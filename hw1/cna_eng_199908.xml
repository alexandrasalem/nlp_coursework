    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF REAFFIRMS US COMMITMENT TO ABIDING BY TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  July  31  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Chairman Richard Bush reaffirmed on Saturday that the United States
will continue abiding by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) and showing
concern about Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>The US point man on Taiwan issues in the absence of official
ties made the statement in his speech to an annual meeting of the
World Formosans Association being held in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Bush's reaffirmation of the US commitment to Taiwan won the
acclaim of all participants as relations across the Taiwan Strait are
at a new low because of ROC President Lee Teng-hui's definition of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Bush, who visited Taipei from July 22-26 in an effort to better
understand Taiwan's basic stance on cross-strait relations, also
stressed in his speech that the United States will adhere to its
"one China" policy and maintain neutrality toward cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>Bush further renewed the consistent US call for the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to resolve their disputes strictly by peaceful
means.</P>
      <P>In his one-hour speech, titled "Taiwan Look Past, Look Forward,"
Bush said the most important task for Taiwan today is to work out a
comprehensive blueprint for its future development and progress.</P>
      <P>In addition to recounting Taiwan's past achievements, Bush made
several suggestions for Taiwan's reference in setting the direction
for its future development.</P>
      <P>First of all, Bush said Taiwan should continue promoting
democratic reforms to deepen its achievements in this regard.</P>
      <P>Bush then recommended that Taiwan forge rapprochement with
mainland China and strengthen engagements with other neighboring
Asia-Pacific countries. Despite their conflicting views on some
critical sovereign issues, Bush said Taiwan should never cease its
efforts to maintain contacts and exchanges with Beijing to ensure
peaceful co-existence.</P>
      <P>Noting that the long-term US policy toward mainland China is to
encourage Beijing to move in a positive, constructive direction,
Bush said he believes that Taiwan can provide a good model for the
mainland.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's continued march toward democracy and freedom has
provided a good model for mainland China which has yet to be
democratized," Bush explained.</P>
      <P>More than 500 members of the World Formosans Association from
Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan and Latin American
countries attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan politicians present at the meeting included Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh, Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan and
opposition Legislators Lee Ying-yuan and Lee Ching-hsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF ASKS ARATS HELP TO FREE TAIWAN SHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) sent a
letter to its mainland Chinese counterpart on Saturday, asking it to
help ensure the safety of a Taiwan ship and its crew that were
forcibly directed to mainland China earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow said the information they
received showed that the 975-ton Shin Hwa freighter was intercepted
by a mainland Chinese military ship while carrying supply materials
from the northern Keeling Port to the Republic of China-controlled
outlying Matsu Island.</P>
      <P>Ship owner Feng Neng-di contacted SEF for help, stressing that
Shin Hwa is a civilian freighter, according to Shi, who asked the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) to provide quick assistance to investigate the incident and
ensure the safety of the ship and its crew members.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese military guardsmen who boarded the ship accused
the Shin Hwa of smuggling and entering mainland China's territorial
waters, forcing the ship to go to Mawei Port in Fujian province. Ten
crew members, including Captain Kuo Tai-sheng, were aboard.</P>
      <P>SEF and the ARATS are semi-official organizations in charge of
two-way exchanges between Taiwan and mainland China in the absence of
formal contacts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO SELL TWO AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  July  31 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Defense Department on Saturday
announced the sale of two E-2T Hawkeye 2000E airborne early warning
aircraft and related equipment and services to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said the sale, worth about US$400 million, is
consistent with US laws and policies, as expressed in Public Law
96-8.</P>
      <P>It stated that this will augment Taiwan's present operational
inventory and self-defense capability, adding that it will not affect
the basic military balance in the region and will have no adverse
impact on US defense readiness.</P>
      <P>Just one day earlier, the United States announced the sale of
US$150 million worth of spare parts and related equipment for F-16
jet fighters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two E-2T Hawkeye aircraft, the new package
also includes two AN-APS-145 radar systems, two T56-A-427 engines,
two OE-335/A antenna groups, two Mission Computer Upgrades/Advanced
Control Indicator Sets, two Passive Detection System software
laboratory upgrades, and spare and replacement parts.</P>
      <P>The prime contractor is Northrop Grumman Corp., which will assign
two representatives to Taiwan for two years for technical support
following the delivery of the aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force procured four E-2T aircraft from
the United States in 1995. One is being repaired in the United States
after suffering extensive damage from a forced belly-landing during a
night training exercise in March 1997.</P>
      <P>An ROC Air Force officer said in Taipei that the sale of the
AN/APS-145 radar systems will extend the ROC's airborne early warning
time by 10 minutes.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Support for Vice President Lien Chan in
Taiwan's next presidential election has markedly surged following his
Saturday announcement that he would seek the Kuomintang's nomination,
the latest survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted in the wake of Lien's
announcement, some 29.6 percent of respondents said they would vote
for Lien in the March 2000 presidential race, ahead of 27.6 percent
who said they would support former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong and 17.7 percent who backed Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Lien scored greater public support
than Soong among Taiwan residents.</P>
      <P>As to the question of which candidate people most wish will be
elected Taiwan's next president, around 31.5 percent of the people
surveyed revealed that they expected Lien to be elected, while 27.2
percent said they wished Soong would win the election and some 17.8
percent said Chen, according to the results of the survey.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 49.6 percent of the public believe that Lien
has the best chance of winning the next presidential race, ahead of
20 percent who said Soong and 6.2 percent who said Chen.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that a 75 percent of the people said that the
presidential hopefuls should focus their attention on providing the
voters with the gist of their campaign and platform, rather than on
other things, such as building a charismatic image or launching
verbal attacks.</P>
      <P>In addition, 46.1 percent agreed with the view that Lien's
announcement had marked the beginning of a competition between the
ruling Kuomintang and the major opposition DPP, while 39.9 percent
disagreed, the survey found.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey included 1,091 valid samples and had a
margin of error of 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR 'STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support
President Lee Teng-hui's definition of relations across the Taiwan
Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship," according to a
public opinion poll released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The opinion survey was conducted by the Republic of China Public
Administration Society from July 29-30 to explore local people's
views on American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush's
July 22-25 visit to Taipei and on their attitude toward top mainland
Chinese envoy Wang Daohan's planned visit to Taiwan this autumn. A
total of 1,071 valid replies were collected.</P>
      <P>Fifty-four percent of those interviewed said they believe that
President Lee's "special state-to-state" theory is aimed at
clarifying the status of cross-strait ties and that Lee's
declaration is part of the ROC's preparations for the opening of
cross-strait political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that 80 percent of the respondents
agreed to the government stance that the Republic of China has
consistently been a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>As for Bush's recent Taipei visit, 72 percent said they know
that the AIT chief visited Taiwan earlier this month in an effort to
prevent possible escalation of cross-strait tension in view of
Beijing's furious reaction to Lee's "special state-to-state"
definition.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 62 percent of those who knew of Bush's
trip said they believe that Bush's visit was helpful to ease
cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 51 percent of them said they were satisfied with
senior ROC official's general performance during Bush's Taipei visit.
However, 30 percent said they felt that ROC officials were not tough
enough in defending the country's basic stance.</P>
      <P>Turning to issues related to Wang's much-anticipated Taiwan
visit, 78 percent said they still welcome Wang's visit in the wake
of the recent cross-strait row over the "special state-to-state"
theory.</P>
      <P>Eighty-seven percent said they hope Wang will take advantage of
his Taiwan trip to better understand Taiwan's democratization and
the differences between the two sides in lifestyles and
stances on certain sensitive political issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 88 percent said if Wang can honor his promise to visit
Taiwan as scheduled, they hope Wang will travel extensively around
the island and will try to understand Taiwan people's aspirations.</P>
      <P>Poll results also show that 55 percent said they feel Beijing
leaders should let Wang visit Taiwan to signify their sincerity
to promote cross-strait dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>In addition, 75 percent said they disagree with Beijing's claim
that the "special state-to-state" theory has violated the so-called
"one China" policy and eroded the very basis for cross-strait
engagements.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of the Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower) said Saturday that Australia is the first country
where his company has initially scored a successful mining joint
venture.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Edward Chen, director of
Taipower's Fuel Department, said "The coal mining joint venture at
the Hunter Valley in New South Wales is our first success story since
we suffered our first failure in Canada in the early 1970s."</P>
      <P>"We are thrilled by the initial production performance of the
mine. It is a very good mine because it has high productivity," he
said.</P>
      <P>The new company, Bengalla Mining Company Pty. Ltd., is a joint
venture among companies of the United States, Australia, Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan. The US investor is Peabody Group. Australia is
represented by Wesfarmers Limited. Both companies have a stake of 37
percent. Taipower has a 10-percent stake in the joint venture.</P>
      <P>The venture was formed in 1990. The mine, which became
operational recently, is expected to produce 2 million tons of coal
in the first 12 months of operation. It is expected to reach the
capacity of 6 million tons per year. The initial mining lease grant
will expire in 2017.

    <DATELINE>Nantou,  central  Taiwan,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan,
who has announced his decision to run for president next spring, on
Sunday stressed the importance of "spiritual reform."</P>
      <P>Lien made the remark while attending a Buddhist gathering at the
famous Chungtai Buddhist Temple in Puli, Nantou County.</P>
      <P>About 10,000 Buddhist disciples from around the island attended
the gathering, presided over by the venerable Master Weichueh. Lien
was invited to address the gathering.</P>
      <P>"Our society has become abundant, but the people's minds remain
poor," and that was why President Lee Teng-hui initiated a campaign
for "spiritual reform," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien praised Master Weichueh for his outstanding contribution to
the propagation of Buddhist teaching, as witnessed by the
establishment of about 60 meditation houses throughout the island.</P>
      <P>He urged the people to give up their greed and stinginess and to
replace them with compassion and a willingness to make a
contribution.</P>
      <P>Although Lien avoided mentioning his decision to run for
president, many attendants shouted "Wish you success" when he arrived
at the temple, accompanied by Premier Vincent Siew and Chairman P.K.
Chiang of the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to be formally nominated by the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) as the party's candidate for next March's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Three other candidates have also announced their decision to join
the presidential race. They are former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and two independents: KMT
member and former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong and former
DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Sunday that he
may visit Kosovo during his upcoming visit to Skopje, capital of
Macedonia, which set up formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in
January.</P>
      <P>Although the major purpose of his trip to Macedonia is to
strengthen relations between the two countries, Siew said that he may
also visit Kosovo to gain a firsthand understanding of the
implementation of a US$300 million humanitarian package contributed
by the Republic of China to the war-torn Yugoslav province.</P>
      <P>The ROC government is determined to further boost ties with
European countries as part of its efforts to promote its policy of
pragmatic diplomacy, the premier noted.</P>
      <P>Expressing his appreciation for the support the private sector
has extended to the government, Siew said he hopes that Macedonia
will become a springboard for Taiwan business in Europe.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks at a rally of Vice President Lien Chan's
supporters at a temple in central Nantou County prior to his
departure for the southeast European state on Sunday night.</P>
      <P>With Siew's attendance at the activity, speculation is mounting
that the premier may serve as Lien's vice presidential running mate
in the election slated for March 2000.</P>
      <P>Reluctant to comment, the premier said only that he is not in the
position to comment on the issue at present.</P>
      <P>Lien officially announced his bid to seek the ruling Kuomintang's
nomination for Taiwan's next presidential race on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials with the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) said COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei, a member of Siew's
delegation to Macedonia, will sign an agricultural cooperation
agreement with his Macedonian counterpart while there.</P>
      <P>The cross-the-board cooperative venture drafted by the COA,
according to the officials, is designed to help Macedonia advance
into the 21st century by sharing with it Taiwan's successful
agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Although the significance of the agricultural sector is fading in
Taiwan, they pointed out that Taiwan's successful agricultural
development will serve as the best model for countries like
Macedonia, which is rich in natural resources.</P>
      <P>Sugar, bananas and canned food were once the staple of Taiwan's
exports in its early stages of economic progress, the officials
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC TO ANNOUNCE EXPLANATORY NOTE ON SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on Sunday
afternoon was scheduled to issue a position paper on the Republic of
China's stance on the "special state-to-state relations" announcement
by President Lee Teng-hui last month.</P>
      <P>The position paper is to make clear that Taiwan views relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait as special state-to-state
relations. This, however, is not an attempt by Taiwan to seek
independence, and Taiwan feels the two sides should conduct
negotiations on an equal basis to jointly pursue the eventual
unification of a democratic and free China.</P>
      <P>The paper will include transcripts of talks dated from July 9 by
President Lee and his interview with Deutsche Welle radio. It will
also contain an interpretation of the special state-to-state policy
by MAC Chairman Su Chi and a statement made by Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu in response to mainland Chinese
aggression resulting from the "special state-to-state relations"
announcement.</P>
      <P>The position paper will focus on the background that led to the
"special relations" between the two sides and articulate the reason
that President Lee specifically pointed out that cross-strait
relations constitute "at least a special state-to-state
relationship." The president's remarks were made in response to a
German reporter's inquiry about the Beijing government viewing Taiwan
as a renegade province.</P>
      <P>The president's response is meant to lay a foundation of parity
between the two sides for elevating the level of dialogue and to
facilitate the mechanisms of democracy and peace.</P>
      <P>The paper will point out that in the five decades since the
People's Republic of China was established in 1949, China has been
divided into two parts across the Taiwan Strait and ruled separately
by two sovereign states. This has naturally resulted in a special
relationship between the two sides across the strait.</P>
      <P>The paper will explain that President Lee's "special
state-to-state relationship" remarks have several meanings. First,
the shared cultural and ethnic origins have resulted in a unique
sense of affection between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Second, the intensification of cross-strait civil and commercial
exchanges is unparalleled when compared with other divided countries
past or present. Third, and most importantly, both sides should have
the common will to pursue a unified China in the future by engaging
in negotiations on the basis of parity.</P>
      <P>To tackle the highly political issues that are likely to be
touched by Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits Chairman Wang Daohan during his autumn visit to Taiwan, it is
essential for Taiwan to clearly explain the relations between the two
sides. Hence, the "special state-to-state relationships" is a
defensive and strategic way for Taiwan to state its position.</P>
      <P>What we see as "one China" is something for the future since
China at the present is divided and ruled separately by two equal
sovereign states in existence at the same time, the paper will point
out and it will add that the fact that each side presents a different
interpretation of its position in consultations is simply part of the
process of seeking common ground despite differences.</P>
      <P>This paper will be issued in Chinese and translated into other
languages by the Government Information Office for distribution to
Taiwan's foreign representatives abroad as means of expounding on
Taiwan's "special state-to-state relationship" stance.</P>

incident provided a historical lesson 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>"Now that Taiwan has developed into a full-fledged democracy, we
should make the incident a 'tonic or nourishment' of the new era,"
Shih said, adding that he hopes Taiwan will move toward an era of
"great reconciliation" and that local society will become even more
tolerant of different political views.</P>
      <P>Shih went on to say that he hopes the 1979 Formosa Magazine
Incident will become a "positive memory" and an "important national
asset" in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>The incident refers to an event in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung in December 1979 which was originally designed to mark the
inauguration of the political magazine but later turned into an
anti-government demonstration. At that time, Taiwan was still under
martial law and political assembly or demonstration was taboo.</P>
      <P>More than 10 key organizers of the event, including Shih and
several other noted politicians in the DPP, were arrested and
sentenced to jail terms.</P>
      <P>The incident, however, inspired ever-mounting calls for Taiwan's
democratic reforms and liberalization. In the late 1980s, the
Republic of China government finally lifted martial law and launched
sweeping political, economic and social reforms, laying a foundation
for Taiwan's transformation from an authoritarian rule into a mature
democracy over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Nearly all of those who were jailed for the Formosa Magazine
Incident and many lawyers who defended for those involved in the
incident later emerged as influential figures in the opposition camp
and have even played an important role in local politics.</P>
      <P>Many political heavyweights from major local political parties,
senior media executives, writers and scholars attended Sunday's
meeting marking the formation of the organizing committee for
commemorating the 20th anniversary of the inspiring incident.</P>
      <P>Those present on the occasion included Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, China Times Press Group Chairman Yu Chi-chung, former New
Party Legislator Yok Mu-ming and Po Yang, a noted writer who
was also once jailed for political dissidence.</P>
      <P>Shih said the commemorative activities will include an
exhibition of photos and documents featuring the incident,
a large-scale evening party, production of documentary
films and publication of books detailing the incident and its
implications.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two highly treasurable Australian koala
bears have adapted themselves well to their new home at the Taipei
City Zoo on their first night in Taiwan, zoo officials reported on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two male koala bears, donated by Australia to the Taipei
City Zoo, arrived in Taipei Saturday evening after a long flight.</P>
      <P>"The two koalas, named Hellai and Patrick, arrived in good shape,
despite the long journey," said a zoo official.</P>
      <P>The two-year-old koala bears were sent into a 100-ping
exhibition room shortly after their arrival at the zoo at around 9
p.m. One ping equals 36 square feet.</P>
      <P>The room is well-appointed. It has an advanced air conditioner
and many other amenities to ensure a comfortable living environment
for the two koalas, which rank among the endangered species needing
special protection.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Zoo has planted 6,000 eucalyptus trees, the
staple food for koalas. Zoo officials said the two koalas have eaten
some Taiwan-grown eucalyptus leaves Saturday evening. "We believe
that their eating amount will increase after they further adapt
themselves to living conditions at their new home," an official
said.</P>
      <P>Many local schoolchildren rushed to the Taipei zoo Sunday in
hopes of having a glimpse of the zoo's new guests. They were
disappointed, however, as the two koalas won't be publicly displayed
until mid-August.</P>

      <P>Some 200 practitioners of Falungong
staged a peaceful demonstration before the Hong Kong branch of the
Xinhua News Agency Sunday morning in protest against mainland Chinese
crackdown on the spiritual sect and its founder Li Hongzhi.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese government recently outlawed the sect,

and seized publications, audio and video tapes, and other materials
produced by the Falungong organization in a nation-wide crackdown.</P>

why the mainland Chinese government wanted to crack down on the sect
and arrest its founder Li. Falungong is non-political, he said.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators dispersed peacefully at noon after a
representative read a 30-page statement in front of the official news
agency of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Falungong organization, which claims to have 100 million
followers in mainland China, was outlawed on July 22. More than 10,000
members of the spiritual sect surrounded the Zhongnanhai leadership
compound in central Beijing in late April in an enormous

    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of reported infiltration by
mainland Chinese gangsters into Taiwan's criminal underground to
affect Taiwan's next presidential election, Justice Minister Yeh
Chin-fong vowed on Monday to probe all such rumors.</P>
      <P>Responding to reporters' questions about local press reports that
mainland China is planning to send gang members to Taiwan to disrupt
the island's March 2000 presidential race, Yeh said she will ask
investigative authorities to probe the reports.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent report carried out by the Investigation Bureau
under the Justice Ministry, local newspapers have reported that
mainland Chinese intelligence agents might have gained a control in
Taiwan's gang syndicates and sent mainland Chinese gangsters to the
island. Meanwhile, gangsters from Hong Kong and Macau have also
expanded into Taiwan at the same time.</P>
      <P>In a bid to ensure public order and the personal safety of all
candidates, the National Security Bureau has already set up a task
force -- Chingtai -- to take charge of investigating all illegal
activities in the lead-up to the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'STATE-TO-STATE' REMARKS PROMPTED BY US PRESSURE: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington Post said Sunday that the
United States has played a role in pushing President Lee Teng-hui "to
roil the waters in the Taiwan Straits," because since March US
officials have pressured Taiwan to start concluding "interim
agreements" with mainland China on issues leading toward
reunification.</P>
      <P>Post correspondent John Pamfret reported from Taipei that
President Lee's motivations for the "special state-to-state"
relationship announcement are complex. For one, it is increasingly
clear that "the president has no interest in uniting with China --
even in the distant future."</P>
      <P>C.V. Chen, who worked closely with Lee managing relations with
mainland China from 1990 to 1992, told Pamfret that Beijing, by its
diplomatic pressure, gave Lee the excuse he needed to sell the
"special state-to-state" concept to Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"China should have been more generous," Chen was quoted as
saying. "They could have offered us a lot more diplomatic space
without jeopardizing their position, but they didn't."</P>
      <P>Another factor for Lee is the upcoming elections, according to
the report. Next March, Taiwan will directly elect its president for
only the second time. So far, the campaign has been going badly for
Lee's man, Vice President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The best way to hurt Lien's challengers, independent presidential
candidate James Soong and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
candidate Chen Shui-bian, analysts said, is for Lee to create a
crisis with mainland China, prompting people to opt for continuity
with Lien. So far, however, it is not clear whether Lien is getting
any boost from the current tensions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BRADLEY: US COMMITTED TO HELP DEFEND TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As things now stand, the United States
is committed to help defend Taiwan against a mainland Chinese
invasion, said Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley on
Sunday, although he prefaced his remark by saying he did not want to
answer a hypothetical question.</P>
      <P>But the former New Jersey senator also said in an interview with
NBC's news program "Meet The Press" that if Beijing invaded Taiwan,
Bill Bradley, as US president, "would have stepped back a few moves
before that and been very clear that the United States should say to
the Taiwanese government that if they take steps toward independence,
that they cannot count on us for any help."</P>
      <P>At the same time, Bradley added, "it should be clear to the
People's Republic that if, in the absence of those steps toward
independence, they take actions that would be of a military nature
toward Taiwan, that we would be there (to help defend Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>Bradley said he regretted what President Lee Teng-hui said a few
weeks ago about the "special state-to-state relationship" across the
Taiwan Strait. "The one nation, one China, is an important policy to
be reaffirmed. It's a long -- you have to have a long view here, and
I think if we did, that we wouldn't have this problem (of the war of
words between Beijing and Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I think we should have been clear in advance to make sure that
he (President Lee) knows that this is a risk for him to take any step
toward independence. At the same time, the People's Republic, the
people there can't be surprised or outraged by talk of a democracy,"
said the former senator. "So there's got to be a meeting of the minds
on both sides there in order to prevent this situation from becoming
highly volatile and perhaps inflammatory."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>How the Chinese Communist Party
confronts a score of vexing issues, ranging from its economy to its
dispute with Taiwan, will determine whether social and political
stability can continue in mainland China, according to the latest
issue of US News and World Report.</P>
      <P>Last week, the mainland Chinese Navy conducted exercises near
Taiwanese waters, and Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui repeated his
stance that mainland China and Taiwan should deal with each other as
equal "states."</P>
      <P>The reaction of Japan and the United States to North Korea's
missile development program is also creating an environment that
Beijing finds increasingly unfriendly, added the report.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has blasted revisions to the US-Japan defense
agreements that will allow close cooperation, and it is also upset
that the United States and Japan are set to embark on joint research
for theater missile defense, in part because it fears the technology
may find its way to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this background of frustration and rising tension, there
were at least a few signs that US-mainland Chinese relations were
recovering from the depths after the NATO bombing of the mainland
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, according to the magazine.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to Japan
Chuang Ming-yao has expressed his grave concern to his Japanese
counterpart about a plan by a group of Japanese lawmakers to land on
the Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>During a July 30 visit with Toshio Goto, the head of the
Interchange Association, which handles Japan's unofficial ties with
Taiwan, Chuang voiced his deep concern about the matter and said the
Republic of China government will closely monitor subsequent
developments.</P>
      <P>Chuang, the ROC's de-factor ambassador to Japan, reiterated
Taipei's four basic stances to Goto:</P>
      <P>-- the Tiaoyutai Islands are ROC territory;</P>
      <P>-- sovereignty disputes over the islands should be resolved
peacefully through negotiations;</P>
      <P>-- Japan should conduct separate negotiations with Taiwan; and</P>
      <P>-- the fishing rights of Taiwan fishermen operating in that area
should be fully protected before the issue is resolved.</P>
      <P>Chuang's statement came after the media reported last week that a
group of Japanese lawmakers had decided to travel to the disputed
islands to raise the Japanese flag there in late August or early
September, a move that ROC officials said would constitute an
apparent violation of Taipei's territorial sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai Islands, known in Japanese as the Senkakus, which
lie to the northeast of Taiwan, are also claimed by Tokyo and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The disputed islands have long been a traditional fishing ground
for fisherman from northern Taiwan counties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew will visit Panama at
the end of this month to attend president-elect Mireya Moscoso's
inauguration on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui after returning from
his current trip to Macedonia on Aug. 9, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>High-level officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
revealed that Lee has appointed the premier to lead a delegation to
visit the Central American nation to attend Moscoso's inauguration on
Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Siew will be leaving for Panama after attending the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT) National Congress meeting, a MOFA spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The premier will visit Panama via New York City, he said, adding
that the purpose of his mission is very simple and that Siew will
not be visiting any other countries during his trip.</P>
      <P>He will then return immediately to Taipei to attend a summit
conference between the Republic of China and the leaders of its
Central American allies at the beginning of September, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew left for Macedonia, the ROC's second ally in Europe, Sunday
evening to strengthen relations between the two countries and to gain
a firsthand understanding of the implementation of the US$300 million
aid package to the warn-torn Yugoslav province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>This is the first visit by a high-level ROC delegation to the
Balkans since the president announced his plans for a humanitarian

      <P>Members of the group accompanying Siew include Foreign Minister
Jason Hu; Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman P.K.
Chiang; Lin Cheng-chih, chairman of the Council for Cultural Affairs;

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan is the only person
who can represent the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), and according to the
party's own public surveys, Lien has already received a support rate
of over 30 percent, KMT Secretary-General John Chang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Opinion polls released over the weekend revealed that Lien's
support rate has been on a marked rise since he formally announced
his presidential candidacy on Saturday.</P>
      <P>When answering reporters' questions Monday morning, Chang said
that the surge in the vice president's public support rate has
rallied the party's overall morale to a greater degree than expected.
He added that this is a meaningful "index" for the party.</P>
      <P>In addition, survey results revealed that Lien is "the only
person who can symbolize the KMT," Chang said, adding that the party

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD CLARIFY ITS TAIWAN POLICY: ARTICLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States must stop parroting
Beijing's "one China" claim and make clear that whether Taiwan
politically rejoins mainland China is a decision for the people of
Taiwan to make, continue to sell Taiwan defensive weapons and under
no circumstances the United States will become involved militarily in
an armed conflict across the Taiwan Straits, according to an American
expert.</P>
      <P>Ted G. Carpenter, vice president for defense and foreign policy
studies at the Washington-based Cato Institute, wrote Monday in an
Op-Ed article titled "Washington's Incoherent Policy on Taiwan" that
the new Taiwan crisis triggered by President Lee Teng-hui's apparent
abandonment of the "one China" principle and his insistence that
Taipei-Beijing relations are to be conducted on a "state-to-state"
basis showed that "US policy toward China is in a dangerous state
of disarray."</P>
      <P>There is a dangerous contradiction at the heart of the
Clinton administration's policy. Even as President Clinton
parrots Beijing's view that Taiwan has no right to statehood (or even
limited international recognition), the president implies that the
United States would come to Taiwan's rescue if the island were
attacked. "The sending of such mixed signals virtually invites
trouble," said Carpenter.</P>
      <P>The expert continued that the unsettling reality is that "neither
the administration nor the hard-line opposition seems capable of
articulating a China policy that is simultaneously clear, realistic
and prudent."</P>
      <P>The United States should seek to maintain decent relations with
the People's Republic of China, Carpenter said, "but US officials
must stop giving undue deference to Beijing's 'one China' claims.
Instead, Washington needs to articulate a new policy that includes
the following elements:</P>
      <P>1) The United States takes no position on the issue of whether
there is one China, two Chinas, or one China - one Taiwan;</P>
      <P>2) Whether Taiwan politically rejoins the mainland or maintains a
separate political existence is properly a decision for the people of
Taiwan to make;</P>
      <P>3) The United States will continue to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons as outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act; and</P>
      <P>4) Under no circumstances will the United States become involved
militarily if an armed conflict breaks out between the PRC and
Taiwanese forces.</P>
      <P>Carpenter concluded that "Such a policy would affirm the right of
the Taiwanese people to determine their own political destiny. At the
same time, it would put Taipei on notice that, if it rejects the 'one
China' principle and proceeds down the path toward separatism and
full independence, it must do so at its own risk."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCIENTISTS CALL FOR PROMPT RATIFICATION OF CTBT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  2  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine renowned American scientists and
former intelligence and military officials have sent a letter to all
100 US senators calling for prompt ratification of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) to prevent the weaponization of
stolen nuclear secrets by Communist China.</P>
      <P>The signers of the letter include Dr. Hans Bethe, Nobel laureate
and head of the Manhattan Project's theoretical division; Dr. Herbert
York, founding director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory;
Adm. Stansfield Turner, former director of the Central Intelligence
Agency; and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, former chief of Naval Operations,
Joint Chiefs of Staff.</P>
      <P>They wrote that "There is one essential step -- which only the
Senate can take -- which would greatly help to protect the United
States against the weaponization of stolen nuclear secrets:
ratification of the CTBT."</P>
      <P>The Senate responded quickly last month to reports of Chinese
espionage by voting to reorganize the Department of Energy to create
a semi-autonomous Nuclear Administration Agency with improved
security on nuclear weapons secrets. "But preventing future losses of
sensitive information is not enough, Congress must also seek to
prevent information that has already been lost from damaging US and
global security," stressed the letter.</P>
      <P>These nuclear weapons and national security experts noted that
ratification of the CTBT is a key part of the solution to this
problem. "With the CTBT in force and its verification system fully
operational, China and other nations would be unable to conduct
clandestine nuclear tests or even the triggers for smaller and
lighter thermonuclear warheads for use on long-range ballistic
missiles," they added. "This is the central security value of the
CTBT, and one that the Senate cannot afford to ignore."</P>
      <P>President Bill Clinton signed the international treaty banning
nuclear weapons test explosions in 1996 and submitted it to the
Senate for ratification in September 1997. But the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, chaired by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) who firmly
opposed to the CTBT, has not yet held a hearing on the treaty.</P>
      <P>So far, a total of 153 nations, including Russia and the People's
Republic of China, have signed the CTBT, but it must be ratified by
44 specific nations, including the United States, in order for the
treaty to enter into force.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMERICAN EXPERT WEIGHS IN FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should start treating
Taiwan as a state under a "real partners" doctrine to signal to
Beijing and every other government what kind of nation Washington
rewards with friendship, according to an American expert specializing
in Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Mark P. Lagon, Council on Foreign Relations fellow at the Project
for New American Century, wrote in the latest issue of "National
Review" monthly magazine that Taiwan politics aside, President Lee
Teng-hui's recent suggestion that cross-strait dialogue should be
seen as "state-to-state" negotiation shows "Taipei may have wished to
claim statehood before the military balance between Taiwan and China
got any worse."</P>
      <P>The PRC is intense about acquiring high-tech weapons, a larger
missile arsenal and the means for air superiority -- all making the
seizure of Taiwan feasible in about ten years, he said.</P>
      <P>Lagon stated in the article titled "Taiwan Gets Bold" that to
his credit, "Lee realizes that it will take boldness to lay the
groundwork for the only permissible term of reunification: the
democratization of the mainland."</P>
      <P>What should the United States do? First, he wrote, "stop
criticizing Taiwan for being provocative. Doing so only prolongs the
current crisis by giving Beijing the sense that we do not back
Taiwan, and it undermines efforts to deter China from taking military
action against the island."</P>
      <P>Second, find tangible ways to give Taiwan the help and respect it
deserves. "Putting ceilings on levels of consultation with a
democracy is simply wrong. Higher-level contacts, arms sales, and
theater-missile-defense cooperation will likely deter a PRC attempt
at reunification by force," he said.</P>
      <P>Lagon noted that these steps would indicate that the United
States will help Taiwan should the island be attacked. And these are
precisely the steps prescribed by the Helms-Torricelli "Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act" under consideration in Congress.</P>
      <P>Third, give Taiwan "face" internationally. For instance, Taiwan
has met the standards for joining the World Trade Organization as a
customs territory. But Beijing insists that the PRC be admitted
first, a position that Hong Kong, as a separate customs territory in
the WTO, is assisting by holding up the last necessary accord with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Open and prosperous enough to import more than one and a half
times as many US goods as the mainland does, "Taiwan is a model for
the market reforms that China will need before it can legitimately
enter the WTO," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also offers the best model for mainland China's political
evolution -- "neither a Singapore that squelches free speech in the
name of 'Asian values' nor a Hong Kong that (as it has recently)
behaves as a lackey," added the expert.</P>
      <P>Last, in order to encourage the democratic evolution of mainland
China and to bolster regional stability in the meantime, the United
States should upgrade cooperation with real partners in the region --
namely, the democracies: Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, and
perhaps India.</P>
      <P>In lieu of President Bill Clinton's imprudent pursuit of
a "strategic partnership" with the PRC, "a 'real partners' doctrine
would signal to Beijing, and every other government, what kind of
nation the United States rewards with friendship. And a very good
place to start would be to treat Taiwan -- an admirably assertive
democracy with 22 million citizens -- as a state," concluded Lagon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS ASK ECONOMICS MINISTER TO RESIGN OVER POWER OUTAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Su Huan-ji of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tuesday said that Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang should resign over the massive power outage
on July 29 that resulted in over NT$10 billion in losses.</P>
      <P>Su and another DPP legislator, Yeh Yi-chin, held a press
conference Tuesday morning in which they demanded compensation from
state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) and Wang's resignation for the
islandwide blackout last Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that the electrical outage resulted in massive
losses all over the island, but Taipower argued that there was no
"human negligence," and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
not issued any explanations. Tsai said this is "far from satisfying."</P>
      <P>He said he has already sought support from other legislators in
his attempt to bring about the economic minister's resignation, he
said.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that the power failure greatly damaged Taiwan's
international reputation and the people's livelihood, but no
government officials are willing to step out and assume
responsibility, much to the dissatisfaction of the public.</P>
      <P>He demanded that Wang, who is currently abroad, step down from
office, adding that the blackout was not only a "natural disaster but
also a human error," for which Taipower must assume total
compensatory responsibility.</P>
      <P>The fact that one toppled electricity tower can lead to an
islandwide power outage reveals a serious problem in Taiwan's
electricity transmission system management, he said. The incident
also showed Taipower's lack of ability in dealing with the crisis.</P>
      <P>Taipower cannot avoid compensation by claiming no human error has
occurred, and it should review its maintenance of power towers and
transmission systems, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other legislators disputed the necessity of Wang's
resignation when members of the Economics Committee went to the MOEA
for a briefing on the blackout on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was visiting Hungary when the blackout occurred. The
economics minister is slated to return to Taipei Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>The legislators also disagreed over whether Wang should have
returned to Taipei to take responsibility for the outage. Lee
Chia-chin, a member of the ruling Kuomintang and a former MOEA
official, said that Wang was abroad on an official trip. His deputy
minister should be able to deal with the outage, he said.</P>
      <P>But other legislators, including Ker Chien-ming of the DPP, said
Wang, who did not return, seemed "indifferent" to the blackout.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Chang Chang-bang explained that the
minister's European tour was pre-arranged by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs six months ago and concerns official bilateral economic and
trade consultations with many countries.</P>
      <P>Wang was not on a "simple research trip," and was thus unable to
head back to Taipei immediately, Chang said. But Wang has phoned him
every day for daily updates, and the minister is very "concerned and
worried" about the blackout, he said.</P>

(THSRC), and an investment of NT$4 billion in 1999 and NT$6 billion
in 2000 by the consortium building the Taipei International
Financial Center Building.</P>
      <P>The THSRC won the contract to build the 340-kilometer railway in
September 1997. It has threatened to stop construction because of the
government's alleged failure to meet its contractual obligations,
particularly its obligation to provide cheap loans to the THSRC for
the US$16.06 billion project and to acquire the land needed for the
railway.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Financial Center Building, which is to
be located near Taipei's domestic airport, was to be the tallest in
Asia when construction plans were made and approved by the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>But once construction began, it was determined that the
building's height could affect flight safety, and the Taipei City
government and the CAA required the consortium responsible for the
building's construction to reduce its height.</P>
      <P>The consortium threatened to stop the project completely and
petitioned for national compensation for huge resulting losses.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the project are continuing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND EXERCISES TO MENACE TAIWAN: KMT CADRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's recent series of military
drills, revealed by the press, are aimed at menacing Taiwan, a
mainland affairs expert said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, director of the Mainland Affairs Research
Department under the ruling Kuomintang, pointed out that Beijing will
conduct a string of military exercises in the coming August-October
period to mark the 50th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party's
holding of power in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He called on the people of Taiwan to be aware of the situation
and stay calm, saying that the mainland has no excuse to invade
Taiwan as the ROC government does not have the intention to amend the
constitution and insert into it President Lee Teng-hui's recent
"special relationship" remarks.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China's military exercises were seldom reported by
the media in the past, Chang said the news of a missile test might be
aimed at menacing Taiwan through the media.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came one day after the media reported that
mainland China successfully test-fired a ground-to-ground missile
within its territory.</P>
      <P>The news came amid escalating tensions between Taiwan and
mainland China following Lee's July 9 announcement that Taiwan's ties
with mainland China constitute a "special state-to-state
relationship."</P>
      <P>Beijing was infuriated by Lee's statement and accused him of
seeking to separate Taiwan from the mainland. Beijing also claimed
that the basis for two-way dialogue and exchanges no longer exists if
Taiwan does not return to its "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a position paper issued by the Mainland Affairs
Council on Sunday night to clarify Lee's "special relationship"
theory, Chang opined that Beijing should be able to accept Taipei's
official stance.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and mainland China are not expected to break the
impasse in their relations in the short term, Chang predicted that
Beijing still needs time to digest Taipei's explanation, thereby
casting a shadow on a planned autumn visit to Taiwan by Wang Daohan,
mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARITY CRUCIAL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday
that continued ambiguity in the status of relations across the Taiwan
Strait will be detrimental to the Republic of China's development in
the long run.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with a group of Canadian
lawmakers who expressed their concern about the recent state of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>From historical and legal points of view, Lee said the
co-existence of the Republic of China and the People's Republic of
China in the international community is an undeniable fact.</P>
      <P>"This was why I defined cross-strait ties as 'at least a special
state-to-state relationship' when Germany's Deutsche Welle radio
station asked me in an interview in early July about my opinion
concerning Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a renegade province of the
PRC," Lee explained.</P>
      <P>The president said since he assumed the presidency, he has
earnestly hoped that the two sides can engage in peaceful exchanges
instead of military confrontation.</P>
      <P>In a show of goodwill, Lee said, the ROC government has
adopted a series of policy adjustments, including
terminating the Period of National Mobilization for Suppression of
the Communist Rebellion, promoting dialogue and expanding
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China, however, has responded to Taiwan's goodwill with
hostility," Lee regretted, adding that mainland China is even
unwilling to work with Taiwan to resolve certain pressing issues
related to rights and interests of people on both sides of the
strait, such as smuggling of humans and contraband goods.</P>
      <P>While some people claim that the so-called "one China" policy
provides "creative ambiguity" and has facilitated the development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said mainland China has asserted in the world
arena that the "one China" refers to the PRC and that the ROC on
Taiwan is a province of the PRC.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's hegemonic 'one China' principle has seriously
squeezed our international space and made our development in the
world community increasingly difficult," Lee said, adding that
communist China's hegemonic attitude has not only threatened the
ROC's survival but also endangered peace and stability in the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that if the status of cross-strait ties remains
ambiguous, Taiwan's development will be adversely affected as
Beijing has consistently regarded itself as the central government
and downgraded the ROC as a local-level government.</P>
      <P>The president said he is afraid if the two sides cannot conduct
dialogue on a basis of parity, cross-strait talks will lead to
nowhere.</P>
      <P>Lee further told his guests that since constitutional amendments
in 1991, the ROC's jurisdiction is limited to Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen
and Matsu. Moreover, the ROC has since recognized the PRC's
jurisdiction over the Chinese mainland. This is a pragmatic
reflection of the reality.</P>
      <P>The president also reiterated that the ROC's policy of pursuing
China's eventual unification under freedom, democracy and prosperity
has remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Canadian lawmakers present at the meeting included Paul Szado,
Rose-Marie Ur, Raymond Bonin, Paul Froseth and Jocelyne
Girard-Bujold.</P>
      <P>Szado said the ROC's achievements in political and economic
fields have won worldwide recognition. "We believe that Taiwan
provides a good model for mainland China's future development," he
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to cross-strait ties, Lee and Canadian lawmakers
also exchanged views on ways to further boost ROC-Canadian trade,
economic and cultural exchanges.</P>

Paraguayan Chamber of Deputies President Pedro Efrain Alegre that the
Republic of China is a free and democratic country whose economic and
political developments can be a paragon to many other countries.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Alegre reaffirmed Paraguay's firm support of
the ROC. He expressed his hope that Taiwan's dispute with mainland
China can be resolved through peaceful and democratic means.</P>
      <P>The president expressed total agreement with the Paraguayan
speaker's views. He reiterated that the ROC's long-standing
cross-strait policy is based on peace, stability, reason and
pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Alegre said that the government and people of Paraguay completely
understand Taiwan's standpoint, adding that Paraguayan congress
recently passed an act further supporting the ROC's cross-strait
policy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic achievements and political development can be a
great example to many countries, President Lee said, adding that it's
unfair for the ROC to be excluded from the United Nations and other
major international organizations.</P>
      <P>Lee also told his visitor that as he has personally visited the
Latin American country twice and that he takes a great interest in
Paraguay's development. He added that Alegre's visit will further

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Bank of China (CBC) Deputy Governor
Shea Jia-dong said on Tuesday that the CBC is determined to punish
anyone speculating in the foreign exchange market and to stabilize
the foreign exchange rate for the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Shea made the remarks in a provisional press conference, the
fourth since the rise in tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait following President Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state
relationship" remarks on July 9. The conference marked the first time
that the CBC specifically used the word "punish."</P>
      <P>Shea also warned individual investors not to "jump onto the
bandwagon" during this period, as they, too, might be seen as
speculators.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves totaled US$98.6 billion at the
end of July, despite the jitters between the two sides once caused
fluctuation, said Shea.</P>
      <P>The CBC will not allow rumors to cause the devaluation of the New
Taiwan dollar and will take measures to stop any market manipulation
and speculation, Shea noted.</P>
      <P>The foreign media, in particular Hong Kong tabloids, continue to
publish unconfirmed reports that affect the local bourse and foreign

the media is doing it on purpose, but he did not rule out the

      <P>What the CBC can do is to urge investors not to jump into traps
set by rumormongers to prevent them from suffering huge losses, he

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI BOURSE TO RALLY FROM NEAR BOTTOM IN NEXT FEW DAYS: RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The effects of the "special state-to-state"
theory on cross-Taiwan Strait relations have almost faded away, and
the Taipei stock market will rally from near bottom in the next few
days, a domestic economist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma Kai, a researcher at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic
Research (CIER), made the remarks in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed
clearly Monday in a position paper on Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" theory that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should abide by a consensus reached in 1992 that each
side can have its own interpretation of "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>The MAC said in the position paper that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should work hand-in-hand through consultations on an
equal footing to create a new climate for cross-strait engagements
and pave the way for a peaceful unification.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taipei has sent a strong message to Beijing, and he said
he believed that Beijing would soon issue a response to Taipei's

    <HEADLINE>5 ROC CARRIERS MAKE PROFITS FROM TAIWAN-PHILIPPINE FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will incure financial losses if
airlinks with the Philippines are really cut, airline sources
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Philippines unilaterally announced on Monday that
it will terminate its 1996 civil aviation agreement with the
Republic of China at the end of September. Filipino authorities
claimed that Taiwan carriers have abused their operational rights for
windfall profits.</P>
      <P>According to airline sources, all the five Taiwan carriers
operating Taiwan-Philippine flights have made profits from such
services. Termination of air services will mark financial losses for
Taiwan, estimated at a total of NT$150 million per month.</P>
      <P>At present, China Airlines (CAL) and EAV Airways operate
scheduled flights to the Philippines, while Far East Air Transport
Corp., UNI Airlines and U-Land Air Lines operate chartered flights.</P>
      <P>All the five carriers said they will abide by the government
regulations if the government finally decides to cut direct airlinks
with the Pihlippines. Nevertheless, they also expressed their hope
that the government will continue negotiations with Filipino
authorities and work out a mutually acceptable solution to ensure
continued fight services between the two countries.</P>
      <P>CAL began to operate Taiwan-Philippine services back in 1967. It
currently operates a total of 21 round-trip Taipei-Manila and
Taipei-Hong Kong-Manila flights per week. Its monthly revenues from
those flights are about NT$100 million, accounting for 3 percent of
the carrier's total monthly income.</P>
      <P>EVA launched its Taipei-Manila flight services when it was
inaugurated in July 1991. It currently operates 11 round-trip
flights a week, with passenger occupancy rate ranging from 75
percent to 80 percent. Its annual turnover from the route amounts to
more than NT$30 million, or 1 percent of its total annual turnover.</P>
      <P>Far East has operated chartered flights between Taiwan and the
Philippines' Subic Bay since September 1995. It now operates a total
of five regular chartered flights from Taipei and Kaohsiung to the
Subic Bay per week, with an annual turnover of about NT$90 million.</P>
      <P>UNI Airlines has operated chartered flights to the Philippines'
Laoag since 1992. It currently has three flights between Taipei and
Laoag per week, with monthly turnover estimated at NT$5 million. The
carrier operates this route only during travel season.</P>
      <P>U-Land also operates chartered flights between Taipei and the
Philippines' Laoag and Cebu on an irregular basis, with its monthly

    <HEADLINE>ENGLISH VERSION OF `SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY IS AVAILABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An English version of an explanation of
President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" statement regarding
the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is near
completion, according to mainland affairs officials.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), Taipei's chief policy-making
body for the China issue, on Sunday issued a position paper in
Mandarin Chinese on Lee's statement, but it is the English rendition,
still being scrutinized by MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin, which
will be used as a basis for explaining the concept to the
international community.</P>
      <P>The MAC position paper seeks to emphasize that Lee's remarks were
aimed at laying a foundation of parity between the two sides in order
to elevate the level of dialogue and facilitate the mechanisms of
democracy and peace, so that a new cross-strait relationship can be
ushered in for the new century.</P>
      <P>The paper points out that Lee's comments were stated under the
premise of maintaining the ROC's national interests and dignity, and
to state the facts from the political, historical and legal points of
view. It also points out that peaceful reunification of China remains
the ultimate long-term goal of the government and people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC also indicated that Taipei rejects Beijing's "one China"
principle, which belittles Taipei by shrinking its position to that
of a local government, and which the Beijing authorities use as their
basis for cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The paper urges the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to return to
the verbal consensus reached in 1992 for a "one China, with each side
entitled to its respective interpretation."</P>
      <P>According to that consensus, the paper notes, Taipei sees "one
China" as something for the future, since China at present is divided
and ruled separately by two equal sovereign states, hence the
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>The paper further points out that the word "special" in "special
state-to-state relationship" acknowledges the fact that both sides
share a common cultural, historical and ethnic background. What is
most important, says the paper, is the fact that both sides are
willing to seek common ground through dialogue and communication for
China's eventual unification.</P>
      <P>Taipei's mainland policy has not changed, and the new description
of the cross-strait situation is merely Taiwan's efforts to seek a
win-win outcome, the paper says.</P>
      <P>Since Taipei's mainland policy remains unchanged, therefore,
problems with constitutional amendments, revisions to the Guidelines
for National Unification, changing of the status quo, or Taiwan's
"trouble making" do not arise, the paper observes.</P>
      <P>It also reiterates the MAC's most sincere welcome to Wang
Daohan's planned visit to Taiwan in autumn. Wang, the mainland's top
negotiator with Taiwan, is the chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The paper stresses that once the two sides resolve their dispute
concerning political meaning following Lee's clear redefinition of
the cross-strait relationship, any topics can be brought to the
discussion table.</P>
      <P>Continuous open discussions between Taipei and Beijing, and a
clear and positive direction for the development of a healthy
cross-strait relationship, will be beneficial to regional peace and
stability, the paper concludes.</P>

      <P>A high-ranking official of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on Tuesday
stressed the importance of "continuing the promotion of all kinds of
cross-strait exchanges."</P>
      <P>Tang Shubei, ARATS executive vice chairman, made the statement in

the Taipei seminar at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Fan Xiaojian, a department head from mainland China's Ministry of

pointed out that the sudden cancellations were personal decisions of
Zhang and Wang. Fan stressed that he is in Taipei as part of an
academic exchange that is not influenced by cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Secretary-General Chang Liang-jen of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) pointed out that Taiwan welcomes
any visit by ARATS personnel, and added that he was surprised to
learn that Zhang and Wang had canceled.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that the ROC has not altered its cross-strait
exchange policy and expressed his wish to continue the expansion of
all types of bilateral exchanges based on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>The 32-member mainland delegation arrived in Taipei on Monday
evening for an eight-day visit. After attending the two-day seminar,
they will visit southern Taiwan to observe the island's agricultural

air force base in mid-July, the spokesman said the French crew is
testing ways to solve the condensation problem.</P>
      <P>The problem, which stems from Taiwan's warm climate and heavy
humidity, has plagued Taiwan's 60 Mirages ever since France delivered
them in 1997. The condensation blocks the pilot's view during flight
and creating a safety hazard. Although the standard misting procedure
prescribed in the manufacturer's operating manual has helped, it has
not solved the problem, said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Technicians at Dassault have worked out several ways to address
the problem and are testing possible solutions on the prototype, said
the spokesman.</P>
      <P>By performing the tests on the prototype, Taiwan's 60 Mirage
fighters can remain in service, said the spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC MISSILE TEST-FIRING IS PURSUIT OF HEGEMONY: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Tuesday that mainland China's development of a new
intercontinental missile "is not worthy of praise" from the viewpoint
of world peace because it is being used as a tool to pursue hegemony.</P>
      <P>He made the remark while responding to reporters outside the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Tang also noted that the missiles in question, capable of
carrying nuclear weapons, have a range of 8,000 kilometers, and cost
as much as US$100 million each.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he pointed out, if mainland China were to use such
weapons to attack Taiwan, it would be akin to "taking a hammer to
crack a nut."</P>
      <P>The successful test-firing of the missile by mainland China on
Monday, and a Hong Kong report about mainland China's heightened war
readiness, have caused new concern in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang asked the public to believe the Defense Ministry rather than
reports and speculation in the Hong Kong media, while a Ministry of
National Defense (MND) spokesman told the media that the test-firing
of the new type of missile is primarily to deter big powers rather
than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Hong Kong report that the People's Liberation Army
has heightened its state of military alert in Fujian Province, the
spokesman said that no unusual movement has been detected so far.</P>
      <P>He noted that the MND has been keeping a close watch on mainland
China's military movements and exercises, and will inform the public
of its findings "at an appropriate time," so long as such information
does not affect national security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC'S POSITION PAPER ON 'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONSHIP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the English version of
the full text of the Republic of China's position paper released by
the Mainland Affairs Council on the "special state-to-state
relationship" with regard to the relations between Taiwan and mainland
China. (The Chinese version was released on Sunday.)</P>
      <P>PARITY, PEACE, AND WIN-WIN:</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's Position on the</P>
      <P>"Special State-to-State Relationship"</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council, Executive Yuan</P>
      <P>Republic of China</P>
      <P>August 1, 1999
 I. To Develop a New Era of Cross-strait Relations Based on Parity</P>
      <P>In response to a question during an interview with Deutsche Welle
radio station that "the Beijing government views Taiwan as a renegade
province," President Lee remarked: "The cross-strait relationship is
a 'special state-to-state relationship.'"</P>
      <P>President Lee's remarks concerning the nature of the cross-strait
relationship were based on the necessity of protecting national
interests and dignity. From the political, historical, and legal
perspectives, he merely clarified an existing fact. He by no means
twisted or exaggerated the truth, nor did he exclude the goal toward
future unification of a new, democratic China.</P>
      <P>This practical and forward-looking view fully voiced the
aspirations of the twenty-two million people in Taiwan. It is
designated to lay a foundation of parity for the two sides, to
elevate the level of dialogue, to build a mechanism for democratic
and peaceful cross-strait interactions, and to usher in a new era of
cross-strait relations.
II. To Oppose Beijing's Hegemonistic "One-China Principle"</P>
      <P>Since its establishment of 1912, the Republic of China has always
been a sovereign state. Although its jurisdiction is currently
limited to the territories of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, the
ROC is the 19th largest economy and the 15th largest trading country
worldwide. These are facts.</P>
      <P>The People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. In the past
fifty years following that, the two sides of the Strait have been
ruled separately, with neither side subordinate to the other. To
date, a special cross-strait relationship of a divided China has not
changed. These are also facts.</P>
      <P>In 1991, we took the initiative in demonstrating our goodwill by
renouncing the use of force to reunify China, acknowledging Beijing's
rule on the Chinese mainland, and replacing military confrontation
with peaceful exchanges and dialogue. However, Beijing has not
responded with goodwill, but rather has denigrated the ROC as a local
government through its hegemonistic "one-China principle." It
downgraded the ROC in cross-strait exchanges, and appropriated the
"one-China principle" as the premise for all cross-strait
negotiations, in order to force us to gradually acquiesce to the "one
country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Beijing has done its utmost to suppress our
international living space. Consequently, the international community
has become accustomed to Beijing's pronouncements, while
disregarding the obvious fact of separate and equal rule on the two
sides of the Strait.</P>
      <P>Precisely because the facts have been distorted by Beijing and
neglected by the international community for many years that
President Lee's announcement drew a great deal of attention from all
circles, when he clearly stated these simple facts. While, Beijing's
hegemonistic "one-China principle," which is the actual root of the
problem, has been ignored in the discussion.
III. To Start Political Negotiations with Prudence</P>
      <P>The experience of countries negotiating with the Chinese
communists has shown, through the years that, during the initial
phase of negotiation, the Chinese communists always insist on setting
advantageous "principles" for themselves. Once such "principles" are
in place, subsequent results are unlikely to exceed those boundaries.
Since 1995, when the PRC unilaterally terminated institutionalized
consultations, Beijing has left functional issues, vital to the
rights and interests of the peoples of both sides, unattended and has
obstinately demanded negotiations on highly sensitive political
issues with the ROC government. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARITY, PEACE, AND WIN-WIN: (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Furthermore, drawing upon its presumptive "one-China principle"
in cross-strait political negotiations and its "one country, two
systems" formula, Beijing has denied the existence of the Republic of
China by treating us as a local government. The ROC government is not
afraid of negotiations, but we will not engage in negotiations, if we
are placed in an unequal status, or if we are under pressure from a
hegemonistic regime that assumes preset conclusions.</P>
      <P>Should the ROC government conduct negotiations with the PRC under
such circumstances, while vaguely claiming that we are only a
"political entity," we would be placing ourselves at a disadvantage.
Thus, before commencing any negotiations, we must have a clear
orientation of cross-strait relations. In order to engage in
meaningful dialogue with the other side and to protect the dignity of
our country and the interests of our people, the ROC government must
transcend the unfair framework in which a "political entity" deals
with a "sovereign state." Only when cross-strait consultations are on
an equal basis, can they win support from the people.
IV. Returning to the Agreement on "One China Respectively Interpreted
by Each Side"</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have always differed in their
definition of "one China." Thus, in 1992, following the establishment
of the SEF and the ARATS, bilateral talks focused mainly on the
definition of "one China." It was only after several rounds of
consultations that the two sides eventually reached an agreement on
"one China to be interpreted respectively by each side." That
is, both sides are free to state their own definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>This is an ideal approach that would have enabled the two sides
to continue promoting cross-strait relations, while resolving their
differences. However, Beijing has unilaterally abandoned this
agreement in recent yeas. It has often objected to the application of
the agreement in international relations. At times, Beijing has
stated that the agreement only applies to technical consultations and
not political negotiations in cross-strait relations. On other
occasions, Beijing has even denied that such an agreement was ever
reached in 1992. Then, in recent years, it has gone as far as to
object to the ROC's right to state its own definition.</P>
      <P>In the framework of the 1992 agreement, whereby each side is
entitled to its respective interpretation, we have always maintained
that the "one China" concept refers to the future rather than the
present. The two sides are not yet unified, but are equals,
separately ruled. We both exist concurrently. Therefore, the two
sides can be defined as sharing a "special state-to-state
relationship," prior to unification. Cross-strait relations are
"special," because we share the same culture, historical origins,
and ethnic bonds. The people on the two sides engage in exchanges in
social, economic, trade, and other areas, activities for which other
divided countries cannot match.</P>
      <P>What is most important is that the two sides are willing to work
in concert and engage in consultations on an equal basis to pursue the
future unification of China. If the two sides can recognize and
appreciate this special relationship and return to the agreement that
each side is entitled to its respective interpretation, then, through
consultations on the basis of equality, we can transcend our
political differences to jointly cooperate in opening a new chapter
in cross-strait relations that will be conducive to the unification
of the country under democracy.
V. To Clarify, Not to Change the Status Quo; To Seek Peace, Not to
Make Trouble</P>
      <P>The purpose of clearly defining the cross-strait relationship
according to reality is to ensure the equal status of both sides of
the Taiwan Strait. We have also repeatedly stressed that various
related policies will not be changed, especially those that promote
constructive dialogue and positive exchanges between the two sides.
Our resolve in seeking a win-win cross-strait relationship and our
determined policy of pursuing the future unification of China, under
democracy, freedom, and equitable prosperity, have not changed. Since
there was no policy change, there is certainly no need to revise the
Constitution, the laws, or the Guidelines for National Unification.
Much less is there the issue of changing the status quo, or making
trouble.</P>
      <P>We hope that all concerned will examine the matter from a
reasonable and objective viewpoint. Also, we would like to increase
contacts with any party to fully communicate our ideas, so together
we can maintain the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait and the
Asia-Pacific region. (more)</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC BUSINESS SECTOR REPRESENTATIVES SUPPORT FREEZE ON PHILIPPINE LABOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's business sector
on Tuesday expressed support for the government's plan to freeze the
entry of Philippine laborers in retaliation against Manila's
unilateral termination of its aviation agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao Chin-yuan, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Federation of Industries, criticized the Manila government for
"forgetting" Taiwan's contributions to the Philippine economy.</P>
      <P>He told the media that Taiwan has so far extended a great deal of
economic assistance to the Philippines, and that it is to Manila's
shame that it has terminated the aviation pact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao said he will call on the nation's industrial and commercial
circles to join hands to back the government's retaliatory measures.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng, chairman of the ROC General Chamber of Commerce,
was also critical of Manila's disregard of Taiwan's favors toward the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>He said local businessmen should support the government's policy
and suspend plans to invest in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>In another development, an official of the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) informed Manila's representatives in Taipei that
another freeze on the recruitment of Philippine laborers will go into
effect on Aug. 16, if Manila fails to repeal a decree due to take
effect on that date that infringes on Taiwan's jurisdiction over
foreign labor brokerage.</P>
      <P>Under the decree, Taiwan's manpower labor agencies will be
blacklisted in the Philippines if they fail to fulfill the terms of
their contracts with Philippine laborers and provide round-trip air
tickets for contracted Philippine laborers.</P>
      <P>According to the decree, Taiwan manpower agencies are also
required to abide by Philippine law rather than Republic of China law
regarding the interests of laborers.</P>
      <P>Government statistics indicate that of some 270,000 foreign
laborers in Taiwan, about 110,000 are from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Ming-feng, chief secretary for the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said that the government will no
longer encourage Taiwan businessmen to invest in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Instead, he went on, they will be encouraged to invest in Vietnam
and friendly Latin American countries.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The agreement for Mr. Wang Daohan's visit to Taiwan this year was
reached during the "Koo-Wang" talks of October 1998, Later, we sent
out the formal invitation to Mr. Wang. Over the last six months,
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) have conducted
exchanges and made preparations for this historic activity. We would
like to reiterate that we sincerely welcome Mr. Wang's visit to
Taiwan in the fall.</P>
      <P>We understand that the mainland authorities have been hoping to
carry out talks on highly-sensitive political topics with us during
Mr. Wang's visit to Taiwan. At this time, we have clearly defined the
cross-strait relationship for the talks, so the two sides will be
able to conduct thorough discussions of various issues, including the
definition of the relationship between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In the course of cross-strait consultations, if the two sides
raise different positions and views, it should be seen as a necessary
stage in the course of seeking common ground while resolving
differences. If one side can express its position, it should also be
able to accept the fact that the other side (can) express its
position as well. In fact, exactly because differences now exist, all
the more need is for consultations. Through consultation, there will
be opportunities to comprehend or resolve differences. If either of
the two sides refuses to hold consultations because of different
views, then the cross-strait relationship is sure to recede.</P>
      <P>We believe such is not the outcome that the two sides and the
international community would like to see. We maintain that the Koo-
Wang dialogue in Taipei can further enable the two sides to
understand each other's overall views and eliminate
misunderstandings. This will not only help reduce tension between the
two sides while furthering the discussions for a clear direction of
cross-strait relations, but will also contribute to regional peace
and stability.
VII. To Achieve Parity, Peace, and a Win-Win Cross-strait
Relationship</P>
      <P>Stability in the Taiwan Strait directly affects peace and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. The maintenance of peace in
the Taiwan Strait should be considered the common desire of both
sides and the international community. The status of cross-strait
relations is now clearly defined and reflects objective political and
legal realities, offering a new opportunity for the resumption of
positive interaction between the two sides.</P>
      <P>After the normalization of cross-strait relations, a long-term
pattern of peace and stability can develop through constructive
dialogue, institutionalized consultations, and orderly exchanges.
This should be the common goal of both sides, as they develop a
unified and democratic new China in the future. A win-win situation
would then be established for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Nations in the region would also benefit. The situation is compatible
with the long-term interests of the two sides and the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>We call on the PRC to face reality and to acknowledge our
earnestness in promoting cross-strait relations. We hope Beijing will
be pragmatic and open-minded, so the joint efforts of both sides will
create a new era of constructive interactions in the 21st century.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign reserves had surged to
US$98.6 billion as of the end of July, the highest since August,
1995, and are anticipated to surpass US$100 billion soon, the Central

      <P>CBC statistics show that although by the end of June, foreign
reserves were only US$900 million more than the previous month, they
were US$15 billion more than one year ago, a remarkable growth pace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTRIES REACH CONSENSUS ON SANCTIONS AGAINST RP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Various Republic of China ministries have
reached consensus on sanctions against the Philippines in the wake of
Manila's scrapping of the ROC-Philippine aviation agreement, Vice
Foreign Minister David Lee said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Following a inter-ministerial meeting, Lee said: "Our carrots
have been sown, and our sticks have been prepared." The meeting
participants included Vice Transportation and Communications Minister
Chang Chia-juch, Council of Labor Affairs Chairman Chan Hou-sheng,
Vice Economics Minister Chang Chang-pang, and Council of Agriculture
Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung.</P>
      <P>The ROC and the Philippines began negotiations on the air link
accord last week, but the talks broke down almost immediately because
of a dispute over the number of passengers allowed to be carried by
Taiwan airlines.</P>
      <P>The Philippines claimed that the ROC violated the air agreement
by using larger planes than permitted under the terms of the accord.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the talks broke down, Manila unilaterally announced
the suspension of the air agreement. From Sept. 1, China Airlines and
Eva Airways will be forced to suspend their Taipei-Manila flights.</P>
      <P>Lee said the sanction measures will be submitted to the Executive
Yuan for approval before they are implemented. He declined to reveal
the contents of the sanction package, but stressed that the ROC hopes
the dispute will be solved pragmatically to the benefit of both
sides.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC will continue to talk with the Philippines
through normal channels prior to the Sept. 1 deadline, with the aim
of restoring the content and spirit of the 1996 bilateral aviation
agreement.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Manila's description of the ROC Council of Labor
Affairs as "Taiwan Province Executive Yuan's Council of Labor
Affairs," Lee said the move is an insult to ROC dignity, and added
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed its
representative office in the Philippines to lodge the strongest
protest.</P>
      <P>At present, there are 115,000 Filipinos working in the ROC. Last
year, 186,000 people from Taiwan visited the Philippines as tourists,
and domestic flights to Manila and Subic Bay carry an average of
9,000 passengers per week, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the ROC's investment in the
Philippines totals US$1 billion, US$300 million of which is at Subic
Bay, with the electronics industry accounting for the biggest share.</P>
      <P>These ROC manufacturers have said that if air links are
suspended, their transport costs will increase and they will probably
consider withdrawing from the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the issue will also determine whether or not an
ROC-Philippine economic exchange conference scheduled for September
will proceed as planned.</P>
      <P>There has been no further news from the Philippines side toward
the ROC's reaction, Lee said, adding that the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) will summon the Philippine representative in the ROC
on Wednesday to set forth the ROC's position.</P>

of China. They also expressed interest in Wang's invitations to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As a result of Wang's visit to Britain, the statement went on,
London has listed Taiwan as one of the 15 countries it will target
for trade promotion.</P>
      <P>Calling Wang the highest-ranking ROC official ever to visit
Sweden, the statement said Wang attended a bilateral economic
conference in Stockholm, which has helped cement bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Hungary, Wang received a warm reception from
the host country and met with senior economic officials, despite
strong protests from Beijing, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>As the first ROC official to visit Norway, the very appearance of
Wang and his entourage in that Scandinavian country was beneficial to
bilateral exchanges, while their meetings with Norwegian political
leaders and senior government officials, and their tour of industrial
facilities during their stay were also very helpful, the statement
said.</P>

delegation for a five-day official visit.</P>
      <P>Paving the way for Taiwan businessmen to advance into Europe,

issues.</P>
      <P>Officials accompanying the premier said that a Taiwan investment

well as cultural exchange agreements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC STILL STRIVING FOR JOINING WTO BY YEAR'S END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's continued boycott, the
Republic of China is still striving for joining the World Trade
Organization (WTO) by the end of this year, a senior official said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT), made the statement after returning from a visit to Geneva to
attend an informal meeting of the WTO working party in charge of the
ROC's membership application.</P>
      <P>Chen said before the opening of the meeting, the ROC delegation
already knew that mainland China would through its allies block the
WTO working party from screening documents concerning Taiwan's entry
terms.</P>
      <P>Although four mainland China allies in the WTO -- Cuba,
Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka -- spoke against the
discussion of Taiwan's entry protocol, the WTO working party still
proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>"Several influential WTO members, including the United States,
the European Union (EU) and Canada, had voiced support for the
screening of Taiwan's entry protocol and related documents," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to boycott discussion, mainland China's allies
quoted a 1992 statement by the head of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which was replaced by the WTO in 1995, as
saying that mainland China's membership application should be
approved ahead of Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>In response, US, EU and Canadian representatives said the
informal working party meeting was designed to discuss only
technical issues, not any other issue.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chen said the working party meeting proceeded
smoothly last week. "At present, most WTO member economies are
screening documents detailing Taiwan's tariff concessions and a
timetable for the opening of its service markets," Chen said, adding
that the ROC will push all WTO contracting parties to accelerate
screening of all those documents to facilitate Taiwan's accession
to the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland China has never ceased its effort to
block Taiwan's WTO entry since the ROC filed its application in
January 1990, Chen said the ROC won't be daunted by Beijing's
interference.</P>
      <P>Mainland China filed its application in 1986. However, it lags
far behind Taiwan in negotiations with WTO members for its entry
terms as its trade regime is not as open and Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has completed all bilateral trade consultations with its
major trade partners in the WTO. "We hope we can be formally
admitted to the organization by the end of the year," Chen stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US VICE PRESIDENT SAYS UNITED STATES WILL FACE CHINA CHALLENGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Vice President Dan Quayle said
Tuesday that he does not support Taiwan independence, but the United
States must make clear to mainland China that the issue of
unification will be resolved peacefully and not by military force.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing wants the "hegemonist" United States out of the
Pacific, Quayle stressed that this is something the United States
just cannot accept. "We need to reinforce the alliances that we have
with South Korea ... reinforce our alliance and troop commitment to
Japan, reinforce our commitment to our friends on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Addressing the National Press Club here, the contender for the
Republican presidential nomination noted that the challenge the
United States is going to face in the next generation, or the next
decade, or maybe even before, is not in Europe, not in the Middle
East, it is in the Pacific and it deals specifically with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Many people believe that mainland China is the Germany of 100
years ago. If they are correct, Quayle said, "Let us hope and pray
that we manage the situation with China better than we did with
Germany at the beginning of this century, where it took us two world
wars to get Germany into the family of democratic nations."</P>
      <P>But the former vice president went on to say that he does not
believe, as some Republicans do, that mainland China is the enemy. He
views mainland China both as a huge challenge and as a huge
opportunity. "I want to see China become prosperous. I also want to
see China become democratic; not just to engage China, but to change
China," he said.</P>
      <P>And when the United States discusses this and the challenge of
mainland China versus Taiwan, Quayle said, "It should not be China
versus Taiwan. We ought to be talking about ideals. And as a nation,
we cannot adopt the standard of excusing communism, but more
importantly, we should adopt the standard of promoting freedom and
liberty around the globe."</P>
      <P>"I do not support the idea of independence for Taiwan, but it is
a democratic entity, and I hope that they don't do it. But it must be
made clear to the rulers in Beijing that this issue be resolved
peacefully and not through military force," he said.</P>
      <P>When asked about trade relations with mainland China and the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Quayle said he is not for granting
Beijing permanent most-favored-nation status (now called normal trade
relations), because that would mean admission to the WTO, and
mainland China just is not ready now.</P>
      <P>"I want to see China eventually admitted to the WTO. I want to
see China become democratic, I want to see them be prosperous. I want
there to be peace between our countries and peace in the Pacific. But
you have to realize that this relationship is more than just trade.</P>
      <P>"There are a whole host of issues that we have between the United
States and China. The Taiwan issue, the trade issue, human rights,
religious persecution, technology transfer, the whole nuclear issue
-- a whole host of matters that we have to discuss with China," he
added.</P>
      <P>Quayle continued that mainland China is a tremendous opportunity
and challenge for the United States. "But we need to know what China
wants. .... What China wants is essentially three things. They want
recognition as a world power on the world stage, much like Russia.
They want Taiwan. And they want the United States out of the
Pacific."</P>
      <P>On the first one, Quayle said, clearly they are a world power and
they will be even more of one and better respected if they follow
Russia in enacting political reform and political development and
move toward democratic values.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan, the former vice president reiterated that the
Taiwan issue will be worked out, "but peacefully and not militarily .
... Mr. Lee (Teng-hui) moved a little bit toward independence the
other day and didn't quite say it, and they had trouble with the
translation. But it was jarring to the PRC, it was jarring to the
world."</P>
      <P>But, he said, "Taiwan is a democratic entity. It's a democracy.
They have elections there, and the people are allowed to vote and
people are allowed to speak freely. They have the free press and
that's a country that should have an impact."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City Government and Majuro,
capital of the Marshall Islands, Wednesday signed a joint statement
announcing the establishment of ties between the two cities, making
Majuro the 44th sister city of Taiwan's capital.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Tarmile Ishoda, mayor of Majuro,
signed a pact of alliance at the Taipei City Government building
Wednesday morning. This is the first sister-city alliance forged by
Ma since he assumed office last December.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out in a speech that after the Marshall Islands
established diplomatic relations with the Republic of China last
November, Foreign Minister Jason Hu visited the new ally earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Taipei Deputy Mayor Bai Hsiu-hsiung, who was
also a member of the ROC delegation, expressed the city's desire to
forge a sister-city alliance with Majuro, he continued, adding that
the plan was finally realized this day.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the Marshall Islands is a beautiful country that
possesses rich fishery and tourism resources, with many of the ROC's
fishing boats fishing near the region. He hopes to step up more
economic, trade and cultural exchanges between the two cities in the
future, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayor also expressed his wish to visit the
Asia-Pacific island nation. But since there are currently no direct
flights between the two countries, it would take 15 hours of flight
and transfer time to get there.</P>
      <P>Ishoda and his six-member entourage will visit major city
constructions during his visit in Taipei. He is scheduled to head
back home on Aug. 7.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CNFI MIGHT CANCEL SEPTEMBER VISIT TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   4  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese National Federation of
Industries' (CNFI) much-anticipated September visit to mainland China
might be canceled due to Beijing's hostile reaction to President Lee
Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-strait relations, CNFI Chairman Kao
Chin-yen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions Wednesday morning, Kao, who
is also president of President Enterprise Corp., said that due to
mainland China's "unfriendly attitude," the CNFI will hold a meeting
on Aug. 10 to discuss whether to continue with the scheduled research
trip next month.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China has displayed "considerable hostility" to
Lee's "special state-to-state relations" theory, Kao said it would
only "cause more trouble for ourselves" if the federation were to
proceed with its original plans.</P>
      <P>So even though members of the delegation have displayed much
eagerness for the trip, Kao said he still tends to favor canceling
the visit.</P>
      <P>The CNFI's governing board in July had originally decided on a
10-day visit from Sept. 20 to 30.</P>

      <P>Threats by the pro-Indonesia militia groups, the widespread

      <P>Amid increasing media reports about mainland
Chinese military movements, Republic of China Defense Minister Tang
Fei said on Wednesday that the ROC military can safeguard Taiwan and
that the public should not worry.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there has been increased sorties by mainland
Chinese jet fighters on the western side of the Taiwan Strait, and

      <P>In other words, Tang said, the ROC military has the capability to
defend Taiwan, but will not take the initiative to provoke mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Tang also urged the people of Taiwan to remain calm over
speculation by the pro-Beijing Hong Kong media regarding Beijing's
military intimidation, and warned local people against of falling for
"Beijing's trickery."</P>
      <P>"Past experience has demonstrated that the ROC armed forces are
capable of handling any incident," he stressed, expressing the hope
that the public will help the government build a positive climate
across the strait, as Taiwan-mainland ties are vital to the continued
development of all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The defense minister made the remarks while addressing the
opening ceremony of a military head-hunting center which was
witnessed by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, Cabinet-level National Youth
Commission Chairwoman Lee Jih-chu, and Kuomintang Legislator Wang
Tein-ging.</P>
      <P>As human resources are the key element to the fate of any
enterprise, whether it is a government-run unit or a private firm,
Tang said that the center will use professional marketing theory to
recruit high-quality manpower for the military in order to inject new
blood into the ROC regular armed forces.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Tang went on, the military has already achieved initial
success in recruiting high quality personnel since the beginning of
this year, evident in the 20 percent increase in the number of
students who have taken examinations to become career officers or to
serve short terms in specialized military schools.</P>
      <P>The head-hunting center will eventually expand its network from
its present urban-based locations until it has offices throughout the
island, as part of a bid to upgrade the quality of the military, he
revealed.</P>

      <P>Left unchecked, HIV and AIDS could be more
serious to Paupa New Guinea (PNG) than droughts and tidal waves, said
former PNG Health Minister Peter Barter.</P>
      <P>Barter's warning was published on Wednesday by The Post-Courier,
a leading newspaper in PNG's capital, Port Moresby.</P>
      <P>He said health professionals have provided information showing
HIV-AIDS was particularly serious in the capital and said Port
Moresby could become the HIV capital.</P>
      <P>"The figures I have show that out of a reported total of 1,741,
1,249 of these were reported contracted in Port Moresby," he said.</P>
      <P>"Assuming that a mere 10 percent of HIV cases were reported, one
must assume that in Port Moresby there could be 17,000 infected with
HIV. Worse still, increases reported each quarter indicate a dramatic
increase. ... If you project this figure ahead to the year 2010, the
least number of HIV cases in Port Moresby could be as high as
100,000." he said.</P>
      <P>"In other words, by the year 2010, one in four persons could
contract the HIV virus," he said. He warned that if the seriousness
of the issue was not recognized, resources would not be used in the
right ways to help minimize the outbreak's social, health and
economic impact.</P>

      <P>Another scandal has rocked the Pan Am Games
in Winnipeg after a 36-year-old Bahamas athlete was charged with one
count of sexual assault. Police said Tuesday the suspect is a
softball player from the Bahamas.</P>
      <P>An investigation was conducted after police received a complaint

      <P>The games, which opened on July 23, are set to wrap up Sunday.
Besides a string of defections by Cuban athletes and delegation
members, the Games have also seen two drug scandals.</P>

happen to Burma's opposition leader -- Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung

    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The suspension of flight links between
Taiwan and the Philippines should not become entangled with Taiwan's
"Go South" investment policy, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman P.K. Chiang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is currently visiting Macedonia with Premier Vincent
Siew and other high-ranking officials, made the remarks in response
to questions from reporters over whether Taiwan should reconsider the
"Go South" investment policy in light of the Philippines' unilateral
decision to suspend flights into the country by Taiwan-based
carriers.</P>
      <P>The policy refers to the government's urging of Taiwan
businessmen to invest in Southeast Asian countries instead of in
mainland China, to avoid excessive economic dependence on Taiwan's
political rival across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chiang called for both countries to calm down and sensibly
reconsider the flight dispute, and stressed that the issue has
nothing to do with the "Go South" policy.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, Taiwan's ambassador at large, and also the Chairman
of Chinatrust Commercial Bank, echoed Chiang's opinion, saying that
exchanges of all kinds with the Philippines are preferable to both
sides. Koo is also a member of Siew's mission to the Balkan nation
which entered a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan on Jan. 27 this
year.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said Manila's decision
is likely to discourage Taiwan businessmen, and will also have a
negative impact on the country's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>He added that if the argument ends up with punitive measures
against the Philippines, other ministries will follow up and take

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong, who has declared his candidacy for the 2000 presidential
election, is planning to convene a mass meeting on Aug. 14 to drum up
support for his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Chin Ching-sheng, spokesman for Soong's campaign office, said
that the mass meeting at a riverside park in Taipei County will be a
gathering convened with an attitude of sincerity and honesty to bring
hope and happiness for all the people of the country.</P>
      <P>The gathering will be Soong's first outdoor public meeting since
he announced last month that he will run as an independent in the
March 2000 election. Soong's office staff estimate that tens of
thousands will be attracted to hear Soong's speech.</P>
      <P>Soong will explain to the public his policies and positions on
domestic and foreign issues, with the aim of winning greater public
support for his election bid, Chin noted, stressing that the mass
meeting will be solely an exchange of ideas with the people.</P>
      <P>Soong's staff declined to comment on the actual contents of his
campaign platform, but informed sources said they will be closely
related to Soong's ideas for running the government, which includes
an efficient government free from money-oriented politics and vested
interest, a trans-party government that is caring, systematic and
just.</P>
      <P>Although there have been reports that the ruling Kuomintang has
launched a movement in Taipei County to curtail Soong's warm-up and
sponsorship activities, Chin said Soong's camp is not greatly worried
about KMT maneuvering, and that Soong's grassroots support will be
unbeatable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong's staff have been busy seeking support from
every sector of society, preparing for the formal sponsorship drive
to ensure he has enough support to launch an election campaign.</P>
      <P>According to presidential election regulations, independent
candidates must be endorsed by at least 224,000 voters, a figure
which Chin said will be easily surpassed.</P>

(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's plan to assist in
reconstruction of the war-torn Balkan peninsula has taken a step
forward as Premier Vincent Siew will make a fact-finding visit to
Kosovo on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ROC has decided to offer aid to the battered
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, which lies very close to the ROC's
diplomatic ally of Macedonia, via the European Bank of Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD).</P>
      <P>Siew, heading a 160-member business and industry delegation,
arrived in Skopje, Macedonia's capital, on Tuesday for a five-day
official visit.</P>
      <P>Besides cementing the newly forged diplomatic ties with
Macedonia and helping Taiwan investors tap the vast European market,
Siew is also expected to get ideas on how Taipei can effectively
implement a US$300 million aid project for Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Loh Ping-chang, secretary-general of the ROC's International
Cooperation and Development Fund, who is accompanying Siew on his
current Macedonia visit, said he reached a four-point consensus with
the European Bank during a meeting held in London last week.</P>
      <P>According to the consensus, the ROC will join in three aid
projects for Macedonia and one for Kosovo.</P>
      <P>For one, Loh said the ROC will join forces with the European
Bank in offering financing for Macedonian small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) for business expansion or new investment.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we hope Macedonian SMEs will create more job
openings to help reduce the country's unemployment rate, which
stands at 40 percent presently," Loh said, adding that the aid
projects are also aimed at helping buoy the listless Macedonian
economy and assisting Taiwan business people in edging into the
Balkan and West European markets.</P>
      <P>Loh said the Macedonian government will attract Taiwan companies
to make turn-key exports to Macedonia by offering land,
joint-venture partners and market information.</P>
      <P>Loh said the ROC will study feasible ways to tie its aid
projects to Kosovo with Taiwan's investment projects in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Premier Siew officiated at a ground-breaking
ceremony for construction of an export processing zone (EPZ) in
Macedonia on Wednesday. The EPZ project, designed to accommodate
Taiwan-invested companies, is invested by a consortium led by China
Development Corp. in which the ROC's ruling Kuomintang has a large
stake.</P>
      <P>Siew attended a seminar on the Balkan reconstruction plan
Wednesday afternoon, during which Siew spoke on Taiwan's current
economic situation and its aid project for Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his arrival in Skopje on Tuesday, Siew held a
summit meeting with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski to
discuss concrete measures for promoting bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Siew said he hopes his visit will help open more mutually
cooperative projects in economic, industrial, agricultural,
educational, journalistic and cultural fields.</P>
      <P>During Siew's visit, the ROC and Macedonian governments will
sign accords on economic cooperation, information exchange,
agricultural development and cooperation, as well as cultural
exchange.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged full diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January

      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters (AFGHQ)
apologized on Wednesday for air traffic chaos which resulted from a
practice fly-past by the Air Force Academy, and urged the public not
to speculate about the issue.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the fly-past was part of a rehersal for the Air
Force Academy's celebrations to mark the 70th anniversary of its
founding, the AFGHQ expressed regret for the inconvenience caused by
the activity.</P>
      <P>It is understood that the Air Force Academy will stage a
large-scale fly-past of scores of a new generation of combat jet
fighters, including Indigenous Defense Fighters, US-made F-16s, and
French-built Mirage 2000s on Sept. 1 as a show of strength following
recent military intimidation of Taiwan by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although the Kaohsiung office of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said it had informed airlines on July 28 of the
academy's five rounds of rehearsals, slated from Aug. 4 to Sept. 1,
Wednesday's activity still disrupted normal operations at Kaohsiung's
Hsiaokang Airport and Pingtung Airport.</P>
      <P>Thousands of passengers who were unaware of the Air Force
Academy's activity were left waiting for flights at the airports when
a total of 17 domestic and international flights were forced to be
canceled or delayed because of the rehearsal.</P>
      <P>According to the CAA, the Air Force Academy's rehearsal will
affect scheduled flights at the Kaohsiung and Pingtung airports for
another 13 days between now and Sept. 1, the biggest disruption of
civilian air traffic by a single event in Taiwan's history.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Wednesday
protested the Philippine government's unfriendly remarks concerning
a bilateral aiviation agreement.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), voiced the
proest to Raul Concepcion, acting Philippine representative to the
ROC, at his office.</P>
      <P>Shih told Concepcion that the Philippine treaty and legal
affairs division chief's recent remarks concerning a Taipei-Manila
aviation pact has violated the general international regulations and
the very basis of the agreement as well as hurt the ROC's
national dignity.</P>
      <P>The division chief with the Philippine Foreign Ministry said
that as the ROC and the Philippines do not have formal diplomatic
ties, their 1996 aviation pact was signed on the basis of the
Philippine domestic law. Since the pact is a private contract,
the Filipino official said, the Philippines can unilaterally cancel
it.</P>
      <P>Shih said such remarks were inappropriate and unacceptable to the
ROC. "We demand that the Philippine government make an official
clarification," Shih told Concepcion.</P>
      <P>Shih went on to say that Manila's unilateral announcement of its
decision to cancel its 1996 aviation agreement with the ROC has
rocked the basis of mutual trust between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Philippine government will abide by the spirit and
content of the 1996 agreement and continue negotiations with Taipei
in a rational manner for mutual benefits," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed that the ROC does not like to see the aviation pact
issue affect bilateral friendship and future development.
Nevertheless, Shih said if the Philippines ignores the
seriousness of the incident and fails to take remedial measures, the
ROC will certainly adopt necessary countermeasures in retaliation.</P>
      <P>Concepcion said he will immediately convey the ROC's stance to
the Philippine government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA acting spokesman Henry Chen said if direct air
links between Taiwan and the Philippines are cut off, the cost for
Taiwan investments in the Philippines' Subic Bay will increase
sharply. In that case, Taiwan investors will be forced to withdraw
their investment there. Moreover, the number of Taiwan tourists to
the Philippines, about 180,000 annually at present, will also
decline significantly.</P>
      <P>The expected decreases in Taiwan investments and tourist
arrivals will certainly deal with a severe blow to the Philippines,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Philippines will revert its decision to cancel its
aviation pact with the ROC from the end of September and resume
negotiations to work out a mutually acceptable solution," Chen
added.</P>

released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>French Economics Minister Dominique Strauss-Khan said Monday at

the nation's construction industry also performed very well in July,
up approximately 5.3 percent from the same month last year.</P>
      <P>Strauss-Khan said the economies of each of the 11 euro groups
will grow significantly this year, especially Germany with an
estimated growth figure of 3 percent, although the German
unemployment rate is still high. French economic growth rate is
expected to stand at around 3 percent, he said.</P>
      <P>Spain, the euro group nation with the highest unemployment rate,
flashed a green light in its economic development in June after its
unemployed population fell to 1.55 million, the lowest since 1981.</P>
      <P>Experts indicated that because Europe maintains a stable interest
rate level, American investors have begun to swarm into the European
market.</P>

the growth of world economy.</P>
      <P>Beginning Jan. 1, 2000, the European auto market will open up to

currency, prices of European autos will unify and drop by 1.2 percent

slightly in public opinion polls after his announcement last Saturday
to vie for ruling Kuomintang's nomination for the presidency, but
still lags behind James Soong and Chen Shui-bian, according to a
newly-released survey.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted between Aug. 1-3 by a local cable TV, the
Chinese Television Network, gives Lien an approval rate of 18.7
percent, or an increase of 4.5 percentage points since the end of
July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Taiwan Province Governor James Soong, has slid
from 37.4 percent to 35.3 percent in the polls.</P>

      <P>An analysis of the survey found that although 46.6 percent of
those surveyed favor Taiwan independence, only 38.6 percent of
them said they would vote for the pro-independence candidate Chen
Shui-bian. Another 27.8 percent who favor independence support Soong,
while 18.4 percent prefer Lien.</P>
      <P>At the opposite end of political spectrum, 56.9 percent of those
favoring a reunion with mainland China, which account for 24.9
percent of the surveyed, said they would vote for Soong. Lien found
favor with 21.6 percent and 11.8 percent chose Chen.</P>
      <P>Soong is also the favorite candidate among the 9.3 percent who
prefer to keep the status quo. He received 62.5 percent of that
segment, compared to 21.9 percent for Lien and 6.3 percent for Chen.</P>
      <P>Huang Hui-chen, KMT director general of the Department for
Cultural Affairs, predicted that the 2000 race will be a competition
between political parties.</P>
      <P>In an apparent reference to Soong who is running as an
independent, Huang predicted that a candidate without the endorsement
of any party will barely make an impact in the race. Huang forecast
Lien will garner 40 to 50 percent of all votes on election night.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the KMT is well on track to win the election, Huang
said his party will press ahead with its campaign strategy and will
not pay too much attention to poll findings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MERITS BETTER SUPPORT FROM THE WEST: CANADIAN DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian newspaper on Tuesday called on
the West to stop kowtowing to Beijing by humiliating Taiwan, whose
democracy may be new and not perfect but whose dissidents do not have
to worry about being thrown in jail or "re-education camps."</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "Taiwan merits better support from the
West" the Star Phoenix published in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, said
that in Asia, the West talks the talk about human rights and
democratic ideals, but is unwilling to walk the walk.</P>
      <P>"The West kowtows to the repressive People's Republic of China
against all reason," the newspaper said.</P>
      <P>It noted that the countries of Southeast Asia, following the lead
of the United States, have reaffirmed their perfectly ridiculous
notion that Taiwan -- the second-strongest Asian economy, home to a
population two-thirds the size of Canada and one of the few
democracies in the area -- does not really exist.</P>
      <P>All this to appease a country that, despite its saber-rattling
and displaying of new neutron bombs, is ill-prepared and unwilling to
violently confront the rest of the world and risk sabotaging its
fragile but growing economy.</P>
      <P>For centuries the West has ignored all the evidence and
considered China a potential vast, untapped market, the daily said.
"It has led to our shame in the past. For instance when Britain, in
order to extract hoarded silver, led a war that forced the government
in China to accept the opium trade that was killing Chinese people,"
it added.</P>
      <P>Now the greed for trade "is forcing us to ignore a friend and our
principles," it continued.</P>
      <P>The dispute arose from a statement Taiwan's President Lee
Teng-hui made to a German journalist that negotiations between Taiwan
and Mainland China should be "state to state." That is, both entities
deserve equal respect and weight when it comes to discussing issues
that affect the two political systems, the Star said.</P>
      <P>It quoted David Lee of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Toronto as pointing out that, this was not a declaration of
independence but a statement of the obvious. "All we want is to stay
alive," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The article noted that Taiwan has been part of mainland China for
a mere four years since 1895; since 1949 it has developed a political
and economic system that is completely distinct from mainland
China's.</P>
      <P>In spite of that difference the Taiwanese maintain close familial
and cultural ties and dream of one day rejoining the mainland -- but
only after the government in Beijing becomes inclusive, responsible
and multi-partied. It is not an unreasonable expectation, the daily
opined.</P>
      <P>Canadians, too, would surely refuse to accept being ruled by an
intolerant, communist government that uses violence to crack down on
dissent, it said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan may be new to democracy and the transition may sometimes
be awkward, with fisticuffs breaking out in the legislature. But at
least overzealous dissenters are not hauled away to "re-education" or
execution, with their body parts harvested for transplants, the daily
said.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to accept the fact Slovenia is no
longer part of Yugoslavia, Bangladesh no longer part of Pakistan,
Panama no longer part of Colombia, Belize no longer part of Guatemala
-- all because it would be completely illogical to think they were.</P>
      <P>"Yet, we have blinders on with our unwillingness to recognize the
People's Republic of China and Taiwan as two distinct entities, each
entitled to international recognition," it said.</P>
      <P>"We have drummed Taiwan out of most international bodies and
don't allow it the respect of setting up embassies. Whether Taiwan
eventually rejoins China or not is a matter to be settled peacefully
by the people of those two countries," it stressed.</P>
      <P>It is not something the rest of the world should be involved in,
either actively or passively, by pretending that Taiwan's independent
political and economic systems do not exist, it stated.</P>
      <P>"Our participation in the humiliation of our proven friends in
Taiwan is a matter for Westerners to hang our heads in shame whenever
we think of ourselves as Lone Rangers," it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON URGED TO ABANDON AMBIGUOUS POLICY TOWARDS TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 4 (CNA): The Washington Post urged Wednesday the
Clinton administration to abandon its policy of "strategic ambiguity"
toward Taiwan so as to enhance the chance of deterring war across the
Taiwan Straits, securing peace and even fostering good relations with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The influential American newspaper wrote in an editorial
titled "Taiwan Tensions" that in the past few days Communist
China has illegally seized a Taiwanese ship, sent jet fighters
provocatively across the Taiwan Straits, repeatedly hurled
threats at Taiwan and its elected president and test-fired a new
ballistic missile built in part with stolen U.S. technology.</P>
      <P>But the Clinton administration response to all these has been,
for the most part, to chide Taiwan and make soothing noises toward
Beijing. In part, this may reflect the administration's dismay that
the Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui reformulated his
country's policy toward mainland China without winning Washington's
advanced approval, noted the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The editorial said the administration's unhappiness is
understandable -- but so, unfortunately, is Mr. Lee's behavior.
"It was President Clinton, after all, who chose China as the
venue for endorsing a new and, from Taiwan's perspective,
disadvantageous U.S. policy toward Taiwan. That, along with Mr.
Clinton's Beijing-centered policy overall, hasn't fostered
trusting relations between the United States and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration isn't responding out of pique; it
believes an accommodating attitude toward Beijing is the best way
to maintain peace in a dangerous part of the world. Mr. Clinton
wants to develop a "strategic constructive partnership" with
mainland China's regime, and "to do so he treats friendly
democracies in the region -- Taiwan, South Korea, even Japan --
as if they were of secondary importance," added the editorial.</P>
      <P>The Washington Post pointed out that "That's why Mr. Clinton
accepts China's fiction that Taiwan is not a separate state.
That's why he accepts as legitimate China's parallel views of
Taiwan and Hong Kong, even though Hong Kong -- now incorporated
into China -- was a colony and never a free entity."</P>
      <P>Mr. Clinton said recently that Beijing has made clear "a
sensitivity to the different system that exists on Taiwan, and a
willingness to find ways to accommodate it, as they did in
working with Hong Kong, and perhaps, even going beyond that."</P>
      <P>But the people of Hong Kong were given no say before being
turned over by Britain to the mercies of Beijing's dictators.
Mr. Clinton should say that such an outcome would be acceptable
for Taiwan only with the explicit consent of the Taiwanese
people, stressed the editorial.</P>
      <P>Instead, the editorial said, the United States maintains a
policy of "strategic ambiguity," warning Communist China against
the use of force "without explicitly promising to defend Taiwan
against Chinese attack."</P>
      <P>The Washington Post concluded that "This murkiness is
designed to discourage Taiwan from recklessly declaring
independence. The danger, though, is that China, rather than
Taiwan, will misjudge U.S. steadfastness. In the long run, there
will be more chance of deterring war, securing peace and even
fostering good relations with China if the United States opts for
clarity, not ambiguity, in showing support for its true friends
in the region." (by Nelson Chung)</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI-MANILA DISPUTE WILL  NOT AFFECT ROC  INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 4,(CNA): Vice Foreign Minister David Lee told a
group of legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Wednesday that the government's "go-south" investment policy
would not change because of the controversy involving Manila-Taipei
air links.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with the lawmakers who came to
express their grave concern that the Taipei-Manila air link was
unilaterally scraped by the Philippine government last Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators who called on Lee were Wang Hsieh-feng, Tsai
Tung-jung and Lin Kuo-hwa. Shi Ting, director general of the
Asia-Pacific Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry and Henry
Chen, acting director general of the Information and Cultural Affairs
Department of the Foreign Ministry were also present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Female legislator Wang Hsueh-feng queried Lee whether it was
possible that the Philippine government would reverse its decision
after evaluating the situation. Lee said that the ROC government is
optimistic about the resolution of the issue. In fact, he added, the
air link is much in the interest of the Philippines, and once the
link was cut, the result will be a loss-loss scenario.</P>
      <P>A senior official at the Manila Economic and Cultural Office in
Taipei was summoned on Wednesday to the ROC Foreign Ministry's
Asia-Pacific Department to receive the ROC government formal protest
against the remarks by the director general of the Legal and Treaty
Department of the Philippine Foreign Ministry. The director general
earlier this week described the Taipei-Manila air accord as a private
agreement since the Philippines government abides by its "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a group of civilians held a protest outside the
Manila Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that politics was not involved in the current
Taipei-Manila air link dispute. The problem resulted from Philippine
Airlines being jealous of the profitable operations of Taiwan's China
Airlines and Eva Air.</P>
      <P>In case the link is interrupted, "We will not let Philippine
Airlines fly into Taiwan," Lee warned. He hoped that Philippine
authorities would calm down and consider the issue on the basis of
the mutual benefits so as not to harm both parties.</P>
      <P>He said that the case has not yet seen the lowering of the
curtain. There is still a 55-day period before the accord expires so
there is still a chance the issue will be resolved. "We don't need to
show our trump card at the beginning. Before the talks begin, we
should examine the chips in our hand. In addition, we can employ the
'carrot and stick' approach," said Lee.</P>
      <P>Wang
said that the Philippine government is not willing to
peacefully settle the issue, and the ROC government should map out
counter measures. She said the people will back the government's
action, otherwise, there will be no air accord, no economic interest
and no dignity of the nation, resulting in a domino effect.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Tsai stressed that sanctions alone will
not resolve the air issue. "We should resolve the problem through
negotiations and consultations. Otherwise, it will demonstrate our
incapability in dealing with the international disputes," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile in the Philippines, it was reported that the Philippine
government intends to renegotiate with the ROC for a new air link
accord.</P>
      <P>However, an official with the Civil Aeronautics Administration
under the ROC Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that
renegotiations will be meaninglessness if the Philippine side does
not restore the spirit of the original accord.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, the Taipei Manpower Brokerage Agencies
Association, which strongly supports the ROC government's suspension
of the import of new Filipino workers, strongly criticized the
Foreign Ministry for being weak and ineffective in dealing with the
current controversy.

      <P>Chinese Taipei won by forfeit after the
professional team representing the Philippines refused to return to
the floor following a free-for-all fight between the Filipino players
and the host Chinese Taipei men's national team Wednesday during the
third day of the 22nd annual William Jones Cup International
Basketball Tournament.</P>
      <P>The riot stemmed from a brawl between players of the two teams
and resulted in fans throwing water bottles and chairs onto the court
with Filipino players throwing chairs back at fans. As a result
three fans were sent to hospital for treatment of slight injuries.</P>
      <P>The two referees awarded the victory to Chinese Taipei, which was
leading 66-42 when the game was disrupted. The Philippine team
refused to resume the game within the one-minute time prescribed by
the officiating crew.</P>
      <P>The melee began when Chinese Taipei player Huang Chun-hsiung
struck the back of the head of his Filipino rival Joey Mente in
retaliation for the latter's elbowing him in the stomach. Mente's
teammate Elpidio Villamin immediately struck Huang in retaliation.
Soon all 12 players on both teams had thrown punches.</P>
      <P>Before the referees could stop the fisticuffs, jeering fans began
throwing objects onto the ground. Filipino players responded by
throwing chairs back at the fan.</P>
      <P>After the riot, the Philippine players were escorted to their

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US OFFICIAL CALLS FOR RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time for the United States to
adopt a two-China policy and the ultimate result of America's
extending full diplomatic recognition to Taiwan would be enhanced
peace and stability in East Asia, according to a former U.S.
assistant secretary of state for international affairs.</P>
      <P>John R. Bolton, senior vice president of the American Enterprise
Institute, wrote in the latest issue of The Weekly Standard, a
monthly magazine published in Washington, that "Once it were clear
that the United States would not permit the PRC to bully Taiwan, the
prospects for peaceful cross-strait ties would grow, not diminish.
Beijing's temptation to adventurism throughout the region -- which
the Clinton administration's deference feeds -- would shrink."</P>
      <P>The legal expert said, "This may sound familiar: It is what a
truly Reaganite foreign policy produces. It has worked before. Will
Republican (presidential) candidates embrace it?"</P>
      <P>Bolton noted that watching the Clinton administration criticize
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui for calling his country a "state," it
is tempting to ask how Ronald Reagan would have reacted. This is far
from an academic question, at a time when Republican presidential
candidates and others are striving to formulate a post-Clinton
foreign policy, he said.</P>
      <P>Early in the 1980 campaign, candidate Reagan said he wanted to
restore full diplomatic recognition to the Republic of China. And
Bolton admitted it is true that in 1980 some of his top campaign
advisers ultimately talked Reagan out of espousing full diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But today, almost 20 years later and in vastly different
circumstances, what would a Reaganite policy on Taiwan look like?
Both for compelling moral reasons and as a matter of US national
interests, Bolton said, "the Reaganite answer is diplomatic
recognition."</P>
      <P>The former assistant secretary of state during the Bush
administration claimed that full diplomatic recognition of Taiwan
"would advance key American interests by ratifying the self-evident
reality on the island, and by shattering the Clinton policy of
deference toward Beijing."</P>
      <P>The United States desperately needs to create a balance-of-power
structure in East Asia, building on existing alliances with Japan and
South Korea. This would not be a traditional alliance like NATO, at
least in the foreseeable future, but it would encompass something
more than the ad hoc relations that now exist. And Bolton said,
"Upgrading the Washington-Taipei relationship would be a major step
toward creating such a regional balance."</P>
      <P>By contrast, the Clinton administration believes that deferring
to Beijing will prompt the leaders there to moderate the scarcely
veiled threats with which they responded to President Lee's remarks.
"But Beijing has the Clinton administration's number, and each US
act of deference simply expands the PRC's appetite," wrote Bolton.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, Japan and South Korea interpret US
deference to Beijing as an implicit rejection of partnership with
them. They conclude that "the United States simply cannot be counted
on to protect our mutual interests in the region. If this continues,
Japan will be tempted to proceed more often unilaterally, no gain for
Asian stability, while Seoul may gravitate into Beijing's orbit,
before, and even more after, reunification with North Korea."</P>
      <P>Bolton stressed that none of this would be in
America's interest, "but it would flow inevitably from Washington's
deference to the PRC."</P>
      <P>Indeed, he pointed out, the only objection to full diplomatic
recognition of Taiwan is that Beijing would erupt in rhetorical
outrage, perhaps including threats of military force, and would
attempt economic reprisals against the United States such as the
cancellation of commercial contracts.</P>
      <P>"At least for a period, our recognition of Taipei would leave us
isolated. Some of our European friends would welcome an opportunity
to profit at our expense, and others would cringe before Beijing's
fulminations," added Bolton.</P>
      <P>But he is convinced that diplomatic recognition of Taiwan "would
be just the kind of demonstration of US leadership that the region
needs and that many of its people hope for. For too long, Beijing has
indulged in angry and intemperate language reminiscent of Nikita
Khrushchev's performance at the United Nations when he pounded his
shoe on his desk.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HELMS PROPOSES TO BOOST ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  4  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) said
Wednesday that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act is aimed to ensure
that Taiwan will have the essential self-defense capabilities, and to
accomplish this he and Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-NJ) proposed to
bolster the process for defense sales to Taiwan and help Taiwan
achieve and maintain an adequate military readiness.</P>
      <P>Both Stanley Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
Affairs, and Kurt Campbell, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,
however, voiced the Clinton administration's strong opposition to
this legislation, claiming that the Taiwan Relations Act has worked
very well to maintain peace and stability in the Western Pacific and
the unintended consequences of the new bill are likely to be
dangerous.</P>
      <P>Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Helms stressed in his
opening statement that "the need to enhance our defense relationship
is obvious" due to the following reasons:</P>
      <P>The reunification of Taiwan has become an increasingly high
agitation issue for Beijing; Beijing constantly demonstrates a
willingness to use intimidation to achieve its goal; part of
Beijing's strategy is to continue its pressure on the US to limit
or cease arms sales to Taiwan; and "our friends in Taiwan have a
military capability that has operated in virtual isolation for over
twenty years."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military does not conduct joint exercises with the US
military and is not even able to observe many of American exercises.
No US officers above the rank of colonel or Navy captain can go to
Taiwan and those who do are limited in the things they can say and
do. "This has certainly had a corrosive effect on Taiwan's military
preparedness, at exactly the time Taiwan faces a growing military
threat from China," explained the senior Republican senator.</P>
      <P>Helms added that "The United States' strategic interests, US law
and US moral values dictate that we assist our long-time friends on
Taiwan in meeting these challenges and that is why Sen. Torricelli
and I introduced this bill" in March.</P>
      <P>But Sen. Joseph R. Biden (D-DE) then pointed out that the Taiwan
Relations Act, which he voted for 20 years ago, has helped peace and
stability in the Western Pacific and "China should have no doubt that
our commitment (to Taiwan's security) remains firm."</P>
      <P>And he said he is concerned that passage of this new legislation
"would be the equivalent of waving a red cape in front of Beijing and
inviting China to charge" against Taiwan, because there is no
security measure included in the new bill that is precluded by the
Taiwan Relations Act and the bill's mistaken conclusion that Taiwan
security is primarily a function of its military capabilities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's security, Biden believed, "flows from its democratic
form of government, its growing economic, cultural and political
contacts with the mainland, and ultimately, the United States'
abiding commitment to a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question."</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, "we should concentrate on strengthening those
areas rather than spend time preauthorizing the sales of weapon
systems, some of which don't even exist yet." He is also convinced
that the timing of this bill is very ill-timed, since US relations
with Communist China leave a lot to be desired at the moment.</P>
      <P>Biden added that there is no single issue with greater potential
to bring the US and the PRC into conflict than Taiwan, and "a
surefire way to spark such a conflict is for the US to reinforce the
growing perception in Beijing, however mistakenly it may be, that the
US is hostile to China or pursuing the fragmentation of China."</P>
      <P>Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) also said what is needed now more than
ever is "dialogue across the Taiwan Strait -- dialogue without
Taiwan attempting to change the framework unilaterally, and dialogue
without the PRC making belligerent threats, taking military action,
or trying in other ways to squeeze Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Helms and Torricelli introduced the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act in late March mainly because Beijing has consistently refused to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan and has repeatedly
threatened force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The act authorizes the US president to sell Taiwan such
defense equipment as theater missile defense equipment and related
items, ground-based and naval-based missile defense systems.</P>

      <P>As many as 15,000 delegates will gather in
Toronto in 2004 for one of the biggest medical conference on earth
-- the World AIDS Congress.</P>
      <P>Canada has previously hosted the AIDS congress in Montreal in

    <HEADLINE>CHINA WARNS US AGAINST KOSOVO FORMULA IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has warned the United States
that it should not try to repeat the "Kosovo formula" in Asia because
it might not have the support of its allies, including Japan and
Australia.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Australian Financial Review,
Chinese ambassador to Canberra, Zhou Wenzhong said Australia and
Japan would not necessarily join a NATO-style action in intervening
in another country's affairs.</P>
      <P>The daily on Thursday quoted Zhou as saying, "The US has
a powerful military, but it is a big world and the US should not
try to extend its power in Asia in this way. Asia is not Europe."
 His warning comes as China confronts Taiwan and Beijing is angry
at signs that the US might favor Taiwan in the contest, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Zhou, who was China's second top diplomat in Chinese embassy in
Washington before taking up his present job, said the US and its NATO
allies had crossed "a watershed" in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>"China, Russia, India and other countries are very concerned
about such a policy of putting human rights above national
sovereignty. This is not right. But would the US have the same
support from its allies in Asia if it were doing the same thing
here? I doubt it," he said.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is working out a US$10
billion agreement to buy liquefied natural gas from Australia as a
reward of Canberra's support in its confrontation with Taiwan, a
leading business daily reported.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Thursday reported President
Jiang Zemin is expected to announce the huge agreement between China
and Australia, the biggest LNG supply contract for Australia since
Japan signed up to buy the Australian LNG more than a decade ago.</P>
      <P>Zhou Wenzhong, Chinese ambassador to Australia, told the daily's
Asia-Pacific editor Peter Hartcher in an interview that such a deal
was preceding on the basis of the extremely good state of relations
between China and Australia.</P>
      <P>In particular, China has been pleased at Australia's unequivocal
support in its confrontation with Taiwan. By contrast, it is
displeased with the US's handling of the dispute between China and
Taiwan, which came after President Lee Teng-hui's statement that the
relations between Taipei and Beijing should be on a "special
state-to-state" basis.
 Jiang is due to visit Australia in early September and Zhou
told the daily that "the two sides are working on a deal by the time
of the President's visit."
 The daily reported China is going to buy 3 million tons of LNG
a year from Australia in the next five years and the contract will be
a 20-year term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF REBUTS BEIJING'S DENIAL OF PREVIOUS CONSENSUS ON 'ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) on Thursday rebutted Beijing's denial of a previous
consensus on the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>SEF said it reached an important consensus with its mainland
Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- in November 1992 that each side is allowed
its own definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) under mainland China's State
Council, however, claimed on Wednesday that the 1992 SEF-ARATS
consensus was that both sides of the Taiwan Strait support the "one
China" principle.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan authorities have distorted the consensus as 'each side
is allowed its own interpretation of one China,'" the TAO claimed,
adding that the distortion was aimed at facilitating promotion of
secessionist concepts.</P>
      <P>The TAO further said the ARATS has and will never recognized the
Taiwan-fabricated principle of "each side is allowed its own
one-China definition."</P>
      <P>The TAO's accusation was seen as a response to the release of a
position paper by the Republic of China's Mainland Affair Council
over the weekend on the "state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the TAO's statement, SEF said it had negotiated
with ARATS for more than two years before they managed to reach the
consensus that each side can have its own "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>"The TAO's statement was not true," SEF said, adding that
documents detailing the 10-plus rounds of bilateral talks on the
principle in the early 1990s have long been known to the
international community.</P>
      <P>"Mainland authorities should not deny such facts," SEF
stressed.</P>
      <P>It further said if Beijing has different opinions about the
issue, the two sides should conduct dialogue or consultations to
seek a common ground on their dispute. "Without dialogue, the two
sides can never find a mutually acceptable solution," SEF said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, SEF reiterated its welcome to ARATS President Wang
Daohan's much-anticipated visit to Taiwan this autumn to continue
constructive dialogue between the two sides.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees SEF
operations, said it has authorized SEF to further clarify the 1992
SEF-ARATS consensus on the "each side is allowed its 'one China'
definition" principle at 4 p.m. Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIEN URGES TAIWAN PEOPLE NOT TO BUCKLE UNDER MAINLAND PRESSURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bien, presidential candidate of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, urged the people of
Taiwan on Thursday not to compromise and yield to pressure from
mainland Chinese military threats.</P>
      <P>Recent US reports confirmed that mainland China has stepped up
its air force exercises near the Taiwan Strait, and the United States
has urged both sides of the strait to restrain from causing
unnecessary conflicts.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has always advocated the importance of national
security, in response to reporters' questions on how to "deal with
the crisis," said that quite often "outside threats are not as
intimidating as inner fears."</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan people not to buckle under pressure from
mainland China, adding that in the face of crisis, Taiwan must keep
its faith to "confront, overcome and surmount" all problems.</P>
      <P>"People have human dignity, as countries have national
integrity," the former Taipei mayor said, and he encouraged the
public to have confidence in themselves and in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the main problem between mainland China and Taiwan is
that both sides do not have enough trust in each other. It is
"unquestionable" that Taiwan is an independent sovereign country, he
said, and it is imperative that "we do not give in first."</P>
      <P>In response to the US State Department's opposition to the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act, proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Chen
expressed his appreciation for Helms' support of Taiwan, saying this
represents the "voice of the US private sector."</P>
      <P>While the US administration might "hold a different view," Chen
said the fact is that Taiwan's security is an inseparable part of the
whole Asian-Pacific system. The best protection for Taiwan is the
internationalization of the Taiwan issue, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER CALLS FOR 'WIN-WIN' RESULT IN ROC-PHILIPPINE DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan Thursday
instructed related Republic of China ministries to resolve the
Taipei-Manila air link dispute under the goal of achieving a
"win-win" result.</P>
      <P>During Thursday morning's routine Executive Yuan session, Liu,
who was chairman of the meeting, asked Vice Foreign Minister David
Lee to report on the latest development of the Taiwan-Philippine air
link issue.</P>
      <P>The Philippines unilaterally announced on Monday that it will
terminate its 1996 civil aviation agreement with the ROC at the end
of September. Filipino authorities claimed that Taiwan carriers have
abused their operational rights for windfall profits.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Frederic Chang, deputy director-general of the
Government Information Office, recounted Liu's instructions that this
dispute involves both air link rights and Filipino foreign officials'
"improper use of words."</P>
      <P>The vice premier hoped that Taiwan will work toward achieving a
"win-win" result, consolidating all government and private efforts to
bid for its rights and resume air link contracts, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Lee told the morning's session that Manila's unilateral
termination of bilateral air links was against the 1996 agreement,
since it did not give the ROC a year's notice before making the
announcement.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, the Filipino foreign ministry's
"inappropriate statement" was detrimental to the ROC's national
dignity.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Fong-cheng pointed
out that according to the ROC-Philippine aviation agreement, each
side is allowed to carry 9,600 passengers to the other country per
week.</P>
      <P>Until now, however, the Philippines has met only 10 percent of
its quota while Taiwan has reached its full passenger capacity,
resulting in a great disparity, he said.</P>
      <P>The Filipino government has demanded that the passenger capacity
be lowered to 4,000 passengers each week. Otherwise it has threatened
to terminate the aviation agreement at the end of September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR  FORCE WILL NOT PROVOKE, NOR  SUCCUMB TO, MAINLAND AIR THREATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force will not
provoke, nor succumb to, mainland Chinese military threats over the
Taiwan Strait, Major General Jen Yu-sheng, deputy chief of staff of
the Air Force General Headquarters (AFGHQ) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The AFGHQ held a press conference at the air force recreational
center Thursday morning to clarify recent media reports of increased
sorties by mainland Chinese jet fighters over the Taiwan Strait amid
the US government's warning of self-restraint to both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>Jen admitted that mainland China has increased the number of its
jet fighter exercises, but said there were no "unusual movements or
developments" by the mainland military.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force will comply with normal procedure in defending
national security as long as such activities do not affect aviation
safety of domestic and international commercial routes, he said. Jen
added that the ROC military has the capability to defend Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that since the Taiwan Strait is limited in
both its depth and width, any air force exercise by mainland China is
a direct threat to Taiwan's air defense.</P>
      <P>To uphold the island's national security, Jen said the ROC Air
Force must have enough military strength to guard against military
activities from the other side of the strait.</P>
      <P>The Air Force's principle is that it will not "initiate any
provocation against mainland China, nor will it succumb to mainland
air threats," the major general said. He went to say that the Air
Force will closely monitor all movements by the mainland and respond
to any movements according to air defense procedure.</P>
      <P>Jen also apologized for Wednesday's air traffic chaos, caused
when Air Force Academy fighter jets practiced a fly-past over the
academy as part of the rehearsal for the academy's 70th anniversary
celebrations.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the fly-past was a simple rehearsal, not a
military exercise, and urged the public not to speculate about the
issue. Jen expressed the AFGHQ's regret for any inconvenience caused
by the rehearsal.</P>
      <P>According to the Air Force Academy, areas in the future that will
be affected by the rehearsals include Kaohsiung, Tainan and Pintung.
Since these areas have airports that host flights to and from Taipei,
almost all civilian air traffic would be affected for another 12 days
between now and Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Jen said the Civil Aeronautics Administration has approved the
academy's five rounds of rehearsal between Aug. 4-Sept. 1, and that
domestic airlines were informed on July 28 of Wednesday's activities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Foreign Ministry official said on
Thursday that enhancing Taiwan's security will certainly contribute
to security and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The official, who demanded anonymity, was commenting on a

jointly introduced by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli (D-NJ).</P>

      <P>The Foreign Ministry official said he cannot make a
comprehensive evaluation until he obtains a detailed report

      <P>Nevertheless, the official said the US executive branch has a

stressed that it will abide by the provision of the Taiwan Relations

Torricelli introduced the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in late
March mainly because Beijing has consistently refused to renounce the
use of force against Taiwan and has repeatedly threatened force
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The act authorizes the US president to sell Taiwan such
defense equipment as theater missile defense equipment and related
items, ground-based and naval-based missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>Helms said at Wednesday's hearing that the bill is aimed at
ensuring that Taiwan will have the essential self-defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>To accomplish this, Helms said he and Sen. Torricelli proposed to
bolster the process for defense sales to Taiwan and help Taiwan
achieve and maintain an adequate military readiness.</P>
      <P>Echoing Helms view, the Foreign Ministry official said he
believes that strengthening Taiwan's security will not only
contribute to stability in the Taiwan Strait but also help maintain
regional security in the Asia-Pacific.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S SECOND QUARTER ECONOMIC GROWTH TO BE REVISED UPWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to score
5.7-percent growth in the second quarter, significantly higher than a
previous estimate of 4.97 percent, according to government officials
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) pointed out that the island's economic growth in
the upper half of 1999 is expected to reach 5 percent, and annual
growth of 5.5 percent is likely to be achieved, which is the goal set
by the government for this year.</P>
      <P>Koo Bin-cheng, deputy director of DGBAS's Third Bureau, noted
that an overall review of Taiwan's economic situation in the first
half of 1999 will be held on Aug. 20, and the DGBAS will make public
the island's actual economic growth from January to June.</P>
      <P>An annual growth prediction of 5.3 percent to 5.5 percent for
this year is just a primary assessment that did not take non-economic
factors into consideration, Koo stressed.</P>
      <P>Koo said factors that may affect Taiwan's economic performance
include the future performance of the US economy, a devaluation of
the mainland Chinese renminbi, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the
question of whether construction will proceed on schedule for
Taiwan's high-speed railway and for its tallest financial building.</P>
      <P>The island's economic growth would decrease by 0.5 percent next
year if the high-speed railway were not built as planned, said Koo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, July's consumers' price index dropped 0.81 percent, a
slide for the second consecutive month, according to the monthly
report released by the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>The annual increase in the consumers' price index for 1999 is
expected to drop to under 1 percent; thus overall domestic prices
will be kept stable this year, said the deputy director.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar hit a 17-month high
against the US dollar on the Taipei foreign exchange market on
Thursday, closing at 32.086.</P>
      <P>Thursday's closing level was 1.3 cents higher than that of
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The local currency opened at 32.075 and was traded between 32.059
and 32.146.</P>
      <P>Interbank US dollar trading amounted to US$401.5 million.</P>
      <P>An overnight plunge on Wall Street, due mainly to investors' fear
that US interest rates would rise amid worries over inflationary
economic pressure, resulted in the greenback's bearishness.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the Japanese yen's bullishness in international
markets and confidence-building statements by the Central Bank of
China have prompted the NT dollar to go strong. The local currency
will probably continue to soar and break the 32: 1 level against the
US dollar, they said.</P>

on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The anonymous source said that the purchase, the biggest single

formally announced next week in Taipei.</P>
      <P>CAL also has an option on another six of the same type of the

      <P>CAL's air cargo fleet today is one of the 10 biggest in the

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER CANCELS TRIP TO KOSOVO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  5  (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
canceled his planned trip to the war-torn Yugoslav province of
Kosovo on Thursday for security considerations.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu, who is accompanying Siew on his
current five-day official visit to Macedonia, confirmed the
cancellation of the Kosovo travel plan on Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>Hu said he couldn't explained whether the cancellation was
related to mainland China's boycott. He instead said he sees no
adverse impact of the cancellation on the ROC government's US$300
million aid project to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Siew was originally scheduled to visit Kosovo, which lies very
close to the ROC ally of Macedonia, on Thursday morning to get some
ideas on how to implement the ROC's aid programs to help Kosovar
refugees.</P>
      <P>Hu said the situation became increasingly complex along with the
approaching of Siew's scheduled visit. Because of changes in some
objective conditions, Hu said even Macedonian officials called for
a second thought of the travel plan. "In considerations of security,
we have decided to cancel the Kosovo trip," he added.</P>
      <P>Hu said Taiwan's aid projects for Kosovo will not be affected by
the cancellation because the ROC will offer the humanitarian aid
through various channels, including the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Siew reiterated the ROC's willingness to join
international humanitarian relief programs or development aid
projects.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the reconstruction of the Balkans, Siew
said military conflicts in Kosovo have affected many neighboring
Balkan countries.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian considerations, Siew said ROC President
Lee Teng-hui has announced Taiwan's decision to take part in
reconstruction of the region.</P>
      <P>"We'll start from assisting Macedonia and will then expand our
operations to other war-devastated areas under the principle that
they welcome our aid programs," Siew said.</P>
      <P>He explained that the ways taken by Taiwan to help Macedonia
revive its battered economy can also be implemented in other
neighboring Balkan countries.</P>
      <P>To cement bilateral ties, the ROC has offered US$12 million in
loans to help Macedonian small- and medium-sized enterprises expand
operations or launch new investment projects.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ROC has signed a US$20 million loan agreement
with Macedonia for construction of public housing units. The ROC is
also constructing an export processing zone in Macedonia to
facilitate Taiwan investment in that country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the ROC will join forces with the European Bank of
Reconstruction and Development to set up a US$50 million Macedonian
reconstruction fund to help boost the Balkan state's overall
development.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said here
that even though Siew canceled his Kosovo visit, aid programs
launched by Taiwan's private charities to Kosovar people will
not be affected.</P>
      <P>Siew arrived in Skopje on Tuesday for a five-day official
visit. He is accompanied by a 160-member delegation of senior
government officials, business and industry executives and private
charity group executives.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged full diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January
this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral relations between the
Republic of China and Panama remain stable despite the installation
of a new Panamanian cabinet, ROC Ambassador to Panama C.M. Lan said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lan said he has sent congratulations to new Panamanian Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Aleman and has exchanged opinions on ways to
strength bilateral relations. The ROC embassy has also contacted the
new Panamanian government led by President-elect Mireya Moscoso, he
added.</P>
      <P>Quoting remarks made by Aleman when asked by the local
Chinese-language press whether Mireya may change Panama's policy
toward Taipei, Lan said that during the presidential race, Mireya and
two other contenders had claimed that no matter who was elected
president, he or she would continue maintaining formal diplomatic
ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Lan stressed that Aleman has also assured him that Panama will
stand firm on its relations with Taipei, as the new Panamanian
government also attaches great importance to the ties.</P>
      <P>Lan said that for its part, the ROC government is determined to
continue offering Panama economic and technological assistance by
implementing all the cooperative ventures signed between the two
countries, as part of Taipei's efforts to help underpin Mireya's
policy of eliminating poverty.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has never eased its efforts to entice Panama by
setting up a trade representative office and courting local
influential political figures and Chinese communities, Lan pointed
out that Mireya and most of the new cabinet members are very aware of
the fact that maintaining full diplomatic links with Taipei is more
beneficial for Panama.</P>
      <P>Admitting that there are some pro-Beijing voices within the
Panamanian government, Lan promised to do his best to boost
understanding and communication with those people to allow them gain
a better understanding of Taipei's goodwill and sincerity.</P>

      <P>The United States has tentatively
agreed to furnish Taiwan with early warning radar to upgrade its
self-defense capabilities, US officials said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs Stanley
Roth and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Kurt Campbell
mentioned the possible arms deal with Taiwan for the first time at a
Senate hearing on a Taiwan Security Enhancement Bill.</P>
      <P>Both Roth and Campbell opposed the enhancement bill. But they
confirmed that the Clinton administration thinks that Taiwan needs to
acquire appropriate early warning radar to enhance its self-defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Campbell said relevant US agencies are conducting internal
technical reviews and discussing with Taipei the most suitable early
warning radar system for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Campbell said a final decision on the model or specifications
will be made during next year's Taipei-Washington military meeting.</P>
      <P>Campbell said the United States has so far never exported early
warning radar to any other country.</P>
      <P>Given its proximity to the Chinese mainland and Beijing's
mounting military threat, Taiwan does badly need early warning

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force denied on
Thursday that two of its Mirage jet fighters were "lit up" or
targeted by Beijing's warplanes during a patrol over the Taiwan
Strait on Monday.</P>
      <P>Maj. Gen. Jen Yu-sen, deputy chief of staff at Air Force General
Headquarters (AFGHQ), dismissed as "groundless allegations" a report
that two of Taiwan's French-built Mirage 2000 fighters were targeted
by the radar systems of mainland Chinese Sukhoi 27s amid increasing
tension between Taiwan and the mainland over President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News, which published the report, said the two
Mirages were conducting a patrol on Aug. 2, the day Beijing tested
its long range Dong Feng-31 missile.</P>
      <P>The Su-27s, took off from southern China, and directed a narrow
radar beam at the Mirages in an apparent act of provocation. The
narrow radar beam, used to track targets and guide the fighter's
firing system, was picked up by the Mirages own detection systems.</P>
      <P>Although the Su-27s were not in a firing position, and there were
other Taiwan fighters close by, the two Mirages were ordered to
return to base to defuse what could have been a possible unintended
accident, according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>Jen said that the air force has an established procedure to
intercept enemy jet fighters which goes into effect automatically
when an enemy plane intrudes into Taiwan airspace with apparent
hostile intent which poses an obvious threat to Taiwan's warplanes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of National Defense Tang Fei addressed
Washington's concerns raised on Tuesday that increasing sorties flown
by both Taiwan and mainland China could spark an "accident," telling
a local radio station that Beijing should exercise restraint.</P>
      <P>Tang said Beijing is the culprit behind the current strained
situation because it increased its sorties over the Taiwan Strait
first, forcing Taiwan to counter with sorties of its own.</P>

cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a position paper on the
"special state-to-state relationship" on Sunday, in which Taipei
rejected Beijing's "one China" principle and asked Beijing to respect
the 1992 agreement to allow each side to have their own respective
interpretations of "one China."</P>
      <P>The Beijing authorities blasted the paper on Wednesday, claiming
that it was advocating "splittism."</P>
      <P>They also denied that any such agreement was reached in 1992, and
further stressed that Beijing has never recognized and will not
recognize in the future the concept of "one China as respectively
interpreted by each side."</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Beijing's criticism was puffed up with
emotional rhetoric, Shi said that the SEF will respect Beijing's
position in principle, but expressed the hope that Beijing will also
respect the idea of "mutual respect."</P>
      <P>He stated that Beijing should respect the reality that the
Republic of China on Taiwan has been a sovereign state for the past
50 years, with neither side subordinate to the other.</P>
      <P>Beijing should also respect the 1992 concept of "one China
respectively interpreted by each side," said Shi.</P>
      <P>The SEF leader reiterated Taipei's welcome to a scheduled autumn
visit by Chairman Wang Daohan of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and added that the most important
thing when the two sides are in dispute is to step up dialogue.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that Taipei is still eager to resume
institutionalized consultations between the SEF and ARATS.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign

United States has contacted Taiwan and mainland China six times in
the last two days over the mounting tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

contact channels exist between Taipei and Washington, which are often
used to exchange views by the two sides.</P>
      <P>US Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Pacific Affairs Stanley
Roth reportedly told a Senate hearing in Washington on Wednesday that
Washington has contacted Beijing and Taipei, via civilian and
military channels, six times in last two days over the increasing
cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Roth made the statement at a hearing on the proposed Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act which is designed to give Taiwan access to
more US arms.</P>
      <P>Roth told the hearing that the legislation "could not be
considered at a worse time." He, as well as Assistant Secretary of

Taiwan and enraging the nationalists in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US PROFESSOR CALLS 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' A SHAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent events in Hong Kong are sending a
clear message to Taiwan about how it would fare under Beijing's "one
country, two systems" policy: It does not mean anything, according to
an American professor.</P>
      <P>R. Thomas Berner, professor of journalism and American studies at
Pennsylvania State University, wrote Thursday in a commentary
published Thursday on the Internet that when he returned from
teaching in mainland China five years ago, someone in local groups
listening to his experience would invariably ask how he thought Hong
Kong would fare when it reverted to the mainland Chinese rule in
1997.</P>
      <P>He said he would reply consistently that "Beijing is not going to
let anybody under its control follow a different set of rules. In
China, it's Beijing's way or no way." The only surprise was that it
took two years before Beijing made it clear that "the late Deng
Xiaoping's promise of 'one country, two systems' did not mean
anything," noted Berner.</P>
      <P>Berner is convinced that mainland China has a chance of becoming
a great nation, but he does not expect to see that happen in his
lifetime, saying, "Perhaps my 18-month-old granddaughter will visit a
much-improved China -- when she is a senior citizen."</P>
      <P>"Until then, Taiwan should take note of what happened in Hong
Kong if it wants to see how the 'one country, two systems' policy
really works. It does not. In Beijing's eyes, there is only one
country, one system, and it has a red star for a symbol," concluded
Berner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CONGRESSIONAL GROUPS TO VISIT TAIWAN TO SHOW SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three to four US congressional groups will
visit Taiwan in the next two weeks to show their concern about the
Taiwan Strait security, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Shou-tai, deputy director of the MOFA's North American
Affairs Department, said the upcoming visits are also aimed at
expressing US congressional support for ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
"special state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Kao was speaking at a hearing on how Taiwan will promote
pragmatic diplomacy in the wake of the release of the
"state-to-state" theory which has sparked furious reaction from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Kao said since President Lee defined cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in an interview with Germany's
Deutsche Welle radio station on July 9, the MOFA has 15 to 16 times
asked the Republic of China representative office in the United
States to collect the US public opinion about the "state-to-state"
theory as well as initial reaction of the Clinton administration,
major think tanks and news media toward the theory.</P>
      <P>"Many of them throw support behind the theory and offer goodwill
suggestions," Kao said, adding that the US mainstream society has
gradually come to understand what President Lee said are just
historical facts and political realities.</P>
      <P>Kao went on to say that the US Congress has offered a great deal
of moral support for the "special state-to-state" theory. Moreover,
26 US senators have sent a joint letter to President Bill Clinton
expressing their support for the ROC's cause.</P>
      <P>"Over the next two weeks, three or four US congressional
delegations are scheduled to visit the island to show their concern
about Taiwan's security and support for the 'special state-to-state'
theory," Kao added.</P>
      <P>The public hearing was called by opposition Legislator Parris
Chang, who said the "special state-to-state theory" symbolizes that
Taiwan has broken off Beijing's "one China" framework.</P>
      <P>"I hope the government will take measures to substantiate
President Lee's 'special state-to-state' theory so as to create a
new opportunity for Taiwan to expand its diplomatic frontier," said
the lawmaker from the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan should not be daunted by Beijing's fury over
the theory. "Budging from our basic stance would only restrict our
own future development," he added.</P>

      <P>Canada's largest opposition party was not
happy about the release of 86 mainland Chinese refugee claimants in
British Columbia.</P>
      <P>They are part of a group of 123 people found on a decrepit boat

shows that almost half of the refugee claimants who are freed never

overhaul the system. He added that Canada needs to be tougher on
criminals who smuggle people. He also said those who come to Canada
illegally should be sent back to their country of origin.</P>
      <P>The 123 Chinese arrived in Canada's territorial waters aboard an
unnamed ship, after a 39-day voyage across the Pacific. The

the bill will not alter or amend US commitments under the Taiwan
Relation Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Rather, he stressed, the bill, which he co-sponsored with Senator
Jesse Helms (R-NC), will ensure that Taiwan's security needs are
adequately met.</P>
      <P>Torricelli's absence from Wednesday's hearing on bill S.693,
which was submitted in March, raised public attention.</P>
      <P>The Democrat congressman from New Jersey is a long-time supporter
of Taiwan, although on July 14 he criticized President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a move which ran the
risk of further isolating the country.</P>
      <P>He said Lee's July 9 statement calling cross-strait ties "a
special state-to-state relationship" contradicted not only the policy
of the People's Republic of China, but also that of the United
States, and asserted that Taiwan has triggered a confrontation with
the PRC "on the wrong basis and at the wrong time."</P>
      <P>However, recent events make it necessary for the United States to
continue its support for Taiwan, Torricelli indicated in his written
statement released on Friday.</P>
      <P>"President Lee's statements have led China to threaten the use of
force against Taiwan. However, we all recognize that the peaceful
resolution of Taiwan's status is important to the Taiwanese people,
the United States and China," the congressman said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the people of Taiwan have a right to determine
their own future by peaceful means, but added that the United States
must remain committed to two important principles -- dialogue between
Taiwan and mainland China must continue in October, and the United
States must demonstrate its commitment to Taiwan by adhering to its
commitments under the TRA.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwan Security Enhancement Act" bill is designed to ensure
Taiwan's ability to meet its defensive security needs. It authorizes,
but does not mandate, the sale of theater missile defense equipment,
satellite early warning data, and specific air and naval defense
systems, Torricelli said in the statement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's overseas
delegates to the 15th National Congress have voiced support for Vice
President Lien Chan's presidential bid, a KMT official in charge of
overseas affairs said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang Neng-chang, head of the KMT's Department of Overseas
Affairs, made the remarks at the airport in San Francisco, where he
was heading for Chicago for a reunion of overseas Taiwanese in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Among the 196 overseas delegates that are expected to attend the
second conference of the 15th National Congress, more than 100 have
stated their support for Lien, Wang said.</P>
      <P>More than 90 "friends of Lien Chan" clubs have been set up
abroad, and they plan to congregate on July 26 in Taipei to hold a
pep rally kicking off a series of campaigns in support of the KMT's
presidential candidate for the March 2000 election. The rally will be
attended by KMT Chairman and Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui, as well as by Lien himself, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the upcoming presidential election will be a
battle between the KMT and the opposition Democrative Progressive
Party, because the independent candidates lack the party machinery to
survive the race.</P>
      <P>Wang predicted that Lien's popularity, which has been lagging far
behind that of former Taiwan Governor James Soong, will surpass
Soong's after October.</P>
      <P>He also urged overseas Chinese to make sure they register for a

    <HEADLINE>RESOLVE CROSS-STRAIT DIFFERENCES THROUGH DIALOGUE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any differences between Taiwan and mainland
China should be resolved through dialogue, exchanges and
consultations, rather than exchanges of virulent abuse and
saber-rattling, a government official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the remarks during a regular press
briefing as he reiterated Taipei's position on the promotion of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations under the framework of peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>The MAC issued a position paper on Aug. 1 which was intended to
explain President Lee Teng-hui's controversial July 9 definition of
cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state relationship". The
paper stressed that Taipei's mainland policy remains unchanged, and
that Taipei hopes to return to the framework of "`one China,'
respectively interpreted by each side," under which to pursue a
peaceful, democratic and unified "new China."</P>
      <P>Sheu also stated the historical facts behind the concept of "`one
China' respectively interpreted by each side," pointing out that
consensus on the issue was reached in November 1992 after several
rounds of consultations between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its mainland counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>That consensus made possible talks in Singapore in 1993 between
the top negotiators of both sides, Koo Chen-fu and Wang Daohan of the
SEF and ARATS, respectively, and was conducive to the subsequent
ensuing dialogue, exchanges and consultations between the two
semi-official bodies, Sheu added.</P>
      <P>However, the Beijing authorities have been promoting its
hegemonic "one China principle" in the international community sine
1996, trying to downgrade Taipei to the level of a local government,
and even denying the existence of the Republic of China, Sheu
continued.</P>
      <P>In September 1996, Beijing brought up the premise that "there is
only one China, the People's Republic of China is the sole legal
government of China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of it," which
led to misunderstanding in the international community that Beijing's
interpretation is the only possible interpretation of "one China,"
Sheu went on.</P>
      <P>If the two sides can return to the agreement that each side is
entitled to its "respective interpretation of one China," said Sheu,
then through consultations on the basis of equality, both sides can
jointly cooperate in opening a new chapter in cross-strait relations
that will be conducive to the unification of the country under
democracy.</P>
      <P>Sheu concluded by reiterating that Taipei still welcomes Wang's
autumn visit to Taiwan, and expressing Taipei's hope that both sides
can resolve their differences and seek consensus through dialogue and
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER MEETS SENIOR KOSOVAR OFFICIALS IN SKOPJE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will never cease
its diplomatic efforts despite mainland China's constant attempt to
isolate it in the international community, ROC Foreign Minister
Jason Hu said here on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu was commenting on a meeting in the Macedonian capital of
Skopje on Thursday between ROC Premier Vincent Siew and Deputy Prime
Minister Mehmet Hajrizi of the provisional government of the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is currently on a five-day official visit in
Macedonia, canceled a long-planned fact-finding trip to war-torn
Kosovo on Thursday after relevant authorities backed off a promise
to provide adequate security services for Siew and his entourage
under pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, Hajrizi and several other
high-ranking Kosovar officials came to meet with Siew at the ROC
embassy in Skopje.</P>
      <P>During their 50-minute meeting, Siew reaffirmed Taipei's
determination to implement its US$300 million aid package for Kosovo.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC government will provide US$5 million to establish
a medium-sized commercial bank in Kosovo in a joint venture with a
European bank, adding that Taiwan is also ready to help train Kosovar
banking personnel.</P>
      <P>Hajrizi briefed Siew on the current situation in Kosovo, pointing
out that the Yugoslavian province currently controlled by NATO
peacekeepers is urgently in need of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Before the talks, the ROC delegation donated a range of
urgently-needed materials and equipment to Kosovo, shattered by
months of civil war. The goods included 30 buses, 1,000
refrigerators, 5,000 blankets, 5,000 winter jackets, 5,000 school
bags, 10,000 tool boxes and 500 tons of fertilizer.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hajrizi said he would hold a news conference after
returning to his hometown to let Kosovars understand Taiwan's
friendship and concern for them.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister-Counselor to Macedonia Cheng Po-jeou, who had made
painstaking efforts to prepare for Siew's aborted Kosovo visit and
later arrange for the Siew-Hajrizi meeting, said although military
action in Kosovo has already ceased, the region is still far from
peace.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he will continue his efforts to forge contacts and
dialogue channel with the provisional Kosovar government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Hu said the drama in the Kosovo
rendezvous has once again highlighted the international reality and
challenges facing the ROC.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hu said the ROC won't be daunted by all the
difficulties nor miss any possible chances to forge ties with other
countries or areas.</P>
      <P>Although some ROC lawmakers have urged the government to
reconsider its massive aid projects for Kosovar refugees after Siew
was forced to cancel his trip to the Yugoslav province, Hu said the
government's stance on joining the international humanitarian relief
efforts for Kosovars will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>To work out more concrete measures for implementing various
bilateral cooperative programs, Siew will hold an additional meeting
with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski on Friday.</P>
      <P>In preparations for the additional meeting, Siew met with senior
business and industry executives accompanying him on his current
visit late Thursday meeting to inquire their findings about
Macedonia's investment climate and business prospects.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Jeffrey Koo, president of the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce, said Macedonia's
investment climate is better than some Central American and
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan investors can consider building small cement factories
and banks in Macedonia," Koo said, adding that a business center
should also be built in the Taiwan-invested export processing zone
(EPZ) in the Balkan state, whose economy has been seriously affected
by war in Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-shan, chairman of the International Commercial Bank of
China, said the bank will open a representative office in Macedonia
and will decide whether to upgrade the office to a branch in
accordance with progress in the EPZ construction project.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged formal diplomatic ties with Macedonia in January
1999. Siew's visit is part of the ROC's efforts to cement the
hard-won bilateral ties in the face of mainland China's constant
diplomatic offensive against Taiwan.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) on Friday granted a 45-day grace
period to the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), allowing it to continue
storing toxic waste in the southern port of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The period is an extension of a previous grace period granted by
the EPA allowing the waste to be temporarily stored at pier No. 63 in
Kaohsiung Port which expired on Friday. FPG now has until Sept. 20 to
dispose of the mercury-laced waste or risk losing a NT$50 million
guarantee fee.</P>
      <P>The EPA also signed a pledge with FPG to prolong another existing
agreement that the EPA will continue to monitor the waste, and that
FPG must maintain the safety of the tanks at the pier in which the
waste is being stored.</P>
      <P>The 4,000 tons of industrial waste have been stored at the port
for the past four months, ever since FPG was forced to ship it back
from Cambodia earlier this year. The group had planned to bury the
waste in a southern village in Cambodia, but was thwarted when
residents found out and a mass panic ensued, attracting international
outrage.</P>
      <P>FPG has been exploring different avenues to dispose of the waste
in another country, but has had no success. It has been said that FPG
may now dump the waste at a landfill in Mailiao, in central Taiwan's
Yunlin County.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan remained
tight-lipped on Friday regarding his running mate on the ruling
Kuomintang ticket for the March 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at a national rally to honor model fathers,
the KMT candidate would neither confirm nor deny a press report that
Premier Vincent Siew will be his running mate.</P>
      <P>Saying that the inner party consulting process is still ongoing,
Lien jokingly referred reporters back to the media outlet which
published the story.</P>
      <P>Under KMT rules, hopeful candidates vying for party nomination
should seek the sponsorship of a quorum of party members before being
confirmed by party delegates.</P>
      <P>After having gone through this process, the candidate chosen by
the party delegates is expected to name his own running mate and
present him to a party congress, scheduled for Aug. 29, for the final
endorsement of the ticket.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew, speaking to reporters in Macedonia where he is
engaged on an official visit, would not comment on the report that he
will serve as the party's candidate for vice president.</P>
      <P>As a loyal KMT member, Siew said, he will answer the party's call
irrespective of personal interest, a statement regarded as signifying
his willingness to be Lien's running mate.</P>
      <P>However, the premier said he has not been consulted on the issue.</P>
      <P>He is slated to return to Taiwan on Aug. 9.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu and Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Reports that Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL)
may change a plan to buy Boeing passenger airplanes are worrying the
Boeing Co., the US government as well as one of the US senators from
Washington State, Slade Gorton.</P>
      <P>Sources in Taipei said on Friday that Boeing will soon send
several high-ranking executives to Taiwan to persuade CAL executives
to maintain the original order for 14 Boeing passenger airplanes,
including the modern Boeing-777's.</P>
      <P>US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Thursday wrote to
Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew, extending her concern over
the CAL decision.</P>
      <P>She expressed in the letter her wish that Siew will help ensure
that "the final decision is based solely on technical and commercial
merit."</P>
      <P>Barshefsky described the purchase as "being of great importance"
to the United States, and as the first purchase of the Boeing-777's
by Taiwan, it symbolizes the island's commitment to the growing
US-Taiwan economic relationship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a report from Washington on Thursday said that Sen.
Gorton will leave for Taiwan on Saturday. Gorton will visit President
Lee Teng-shui and other ranking ROC officials in his bid to confirm
the contract.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Gorton on Thursday told CNA that the senator is
hoping he can salvage the CAL order, valued at over US$2 billion, by
using "his personal relations with Taipei."</P>
      <P>The spokesman said if the deal is called off, it will impact
Boeing, the American aviation industry and the state of Washington.</P>
      <P>CAL signed a letter of intent with Boeing in June 1995 to
purchase 12 Boeing-777 long-range, middle-capacity passenger planes,
an order worth US$2 billion.</P>
      <P>The former flag-carrier of the Republic of China has since also
ordered 13 Boeing 747-400 full cargo jetliners at a cost of US$2.5
billion, the largest single order for freighter aircraft in Boeing's
history.</P>
      <P>CAL has confirmed it will implement the deal for the cargo
planes. However, due to a strong sales promotion by France's Airbus
Industrie, CAL appears to be heading toward replacing its procurement
of Boeing-777s with Airbus A340 planes.</P>
      <P>The CAL Taipei spokesman, Shih Ping-huang, on Friday declined to
confirm whether the Boeing procurement plan will be altered or
amended. He also denied that CAL buying policy is connected with the
ROC's political policy.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed both Boeing and Airbus aircraft are good aircraft.
But he added CAL must also assess factors such as price, maintenance
and repair service costs.</P>
      <P>The France-based Airbus Industrie Co. is also one of the world's
largest aircraft manufacturers. However its Taiwan market share is 25
percent of that of Boeing's, according to statistics from the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>CAL currently owns the most Boeing aircraft among local air
companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LA TIMES CARRIES GIO CHIEF'S ARTICLE ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles, Aug. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mass-circulation Los Angeles Times
carried an article by Chen Chien-jen, director general of the
Government Information Office (GIO), on Friday explaining Taiwan's
position on the current state of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's recent
redefinition of the cross-strait relationship as a "special
state-to-state relationship" simply reflects reality.</P>
      <P>"It does not signal a change in Taiwan's mainland policy,"
stressed the spokesman for the ROC government.</P>
      <P>He quoted ROC Premier Vincent Siew's remarks, "Our policy of
promoting constructive dialogue and positive exchanges remains
unchanged, our resolve to pursue a win-win situation in cross-strait
relations remains unchanged, and our goal for a peaceful, democratic
and united new China in the future remains unchanged."</P>
      <P>Because Beijing has disregarded the existence of the ROC
government on Taiwan, Chen said, there is a real need to clarify
Taiwan's status before the visit to Taiwan by the mainland's emissary
for cross-strait dialogue this fall.</P>
      <P>"If cross-strait talks are to be meaningful and substantive, then
the two parties have to regard each other as equals," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee's recent redefinition of cross-strait relations and the
subsequent explanation by the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
drew harsh criticism from Beijing authorities who branded the
redefinition an act of "splittism."</P>
      <P>In his article, Chen said Lee's characterization of
Taiwan-mainland relations is a clear reminder that progress in
cross-strait relations can never be at the expense of freedom and
democracy on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that "mutual trust between Taipei and Beijing based on
reality, rather than diplomatic sham, will be the basis of lasting
peace, progress and stability for all Chinese as well as the
Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>The GIO chief acknowledged that Beijing's vilification of Taiwan
as a "renegade province," its refusal to renounce the use of force
against Taiwan, and its continuing military buildup are a growing
source of instability in the Asia-Pacific area.

MORE DISSIDENTS IMPRISONED IN MAINLAND CHINA</P>
      <P>Hong Kong, Aug. 6 (CNA) Two founders of the Sichuan provincial
branch of the outlawed China Democracy Party (CDP) were sentenced
to long prison terms Friday on charges of "subverting state power."</P>
      <P>The sentencing has brought the number of CDP members convicted of
"subverting state power" to nine since early May, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Right and Democratic Movement in China
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The center said Liu Xianbin, 31, of Suining city in
southwestern Sichuan province, was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He
was found guilty of drafting several documents concerning the CDP and
advocating a multi-party system for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Liu, who was a student of the Beijing Chinese People's
University, was imprisoned for two and a half years for
participating in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, which ended in a
bloody military crackdown. He was arrested on July 7 for organizing
the provincial branch of the CDP, which was set up and outlawed soon
afterwards in the summer of last year.</P>
      <P>The center added that She Wanbao, 41, of Guangyuan city in
the same province, was sentenced to 12 years on the same charges.</P>
      <P>Two other leaders of the CDP were also sentenced to long prison
terms this week. Zha Jianguo and Gao Hongming, vice chairmen of the
Beijing-Tianjin branch of the CDP, were sentenced to nine and eight
years respectively on Monday, also on charges of "subverting state
power."</P>
      <P>Since NATO bombing of the mainland Chinese embassy in Belgrade on
May 7, nine members of the would-be opposition party have been
convicted for the same reason, the information center added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POSITIVE RESPONSE BY RP TO TAIPEI-MANILA AIR ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles, Aug. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Manila, Aug. 6 (CNA): The Philippine government proposed on
Friday that Taipei and Manila either renegotiate their aviation
accord or air carriers from both countries enter into a commercial
agreement so as to avoid the cessation of the Taipei-Manila air link.</P>
      <P>Fernando Barican, the spokesman for the Estrada Administration,
said in a written statement that "between now and Sep.30, the two
sides could still hold negotiations and come up with an agreement.</P>
      <P>"The other alternative is for the Taiwan air carriers to enter
into a commercial agreement, which could mean no cessation of the
flights after Sept. 30, 1999," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>It was the first positive proposal made by the Philippine
Government since negotiations failed to extend the aviation on July
30.</P>
      <P>Both sides since July 30 have engaged in an oral battle -- Taipei
is threatening economic sanctions while Manila says it will
retaliate.</P>
      <P>Barican blamed Taipei for the lack of progress in the
negotiations. He stressed that the Philippine government had been
asking Taipei to start the negotiations and review the aviation
accord since early this year.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Philippine government hoped that both sides
could eliminate their differences through frank and sincere
exchanges. Taipei eventually agreed to hold talks on July 29, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Manila had proposed to 10 Boeing 747 flights or 16 Airbus-300
flights a week for each country, based on projected figures that the
number of tourists from Taipei to Manila for 1999 would reach
200,000," he said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that any flights in excess of this proposal would
then be "subjected to the commercial agreement".</P>
      <P>"Taiwan turned down the Filipino proposal even after the
Philippine side repeatedly explained that these measures were taken
to ensure the survival of Philippine Airlines (PAL)," he said.</P>
      <P>Barican accused Taipei of repeatedly charging that the Civil
Aeronautic Committee of the Philippines had temporarily suspended
China Airlines' Taipei-Hong Kong-Manila flights, violating the
Taipei-Manila Aviation Accord. In order to express "our good faith",
"we had lifted the sanction against CAL flights," he said.</P>
      <P>"In the face of the intransigent attitude from Taipei, the
Philippine side was left with no other option than to terminate the
operations of ROC carriers effective September 30, 1999," he
added.

    <HEADLINE>MOFA  OFFICIALS  DENY  INFLUENCING BOEING DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) denied on Friday that the government is using the China
Airlines' (CAL) deal with Boeing as a bargaining chip against
Washington.</P>
      <P>Being a public corporation, CAL is responsible for conducting its
own business and is free to decide to buy what kind of aircraft on
the basis of its own professional consideration. The government is
not in a position to meddle with CAL business decisions, said the
officials who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>The MOFA officials were unaware that US Secretary of Commerce
William Daley and US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky had
sent separate letters to Premier Vincent Siew lobbying for Boeing.</P>
      <P>However, they confirmed that US Senator Slade Gorton,
R-Washington, is scheduled to visit Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>As a lawmaker from the state that hosts Boeing's headquarters and
its main plants, the officials said they would not be surprised if
Gorton raises his concern about the deal with Taipei authorities.</P>
      <P>The officials dismissed as "unacceptable joking" reports by a US
newspaper, the Tacoma News Tribune in Washington State on Thursday
that CAL is caught in a political struggle between Taipei and
Washington.</P>
      <P>The Tacoma News Tribune said that Taipei is asking CAL to switch
its order for 12 Boeing 777s, with a price tag of US$2 billion, to
Airbus Industries of France, after Washington sided with Beijing over
President Lee Tung-hui's recent redefinition of Taiwan's statehood.</P>
      <P>The officials said deals involving aircraft orders are usually
concluded after years of studies and negotiations, and couldn't be
changed overnight.</P>
      <P>CAL signed a letter of intent for the aircraft with Boeing in
1995.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTC TO RESPECT CAL AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT PLAN: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Lin Feng-cheng said on Friday that his ministry will respect the
China Airlines' aircraft procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remark amid speculation that CAL will transfer part
of its airplane order from Boeing Co. to European Airbus Industries.</P>
      <P>The United States has expressed grave concern about CAL possibly
changing its aircraft procurement plan. Rumors have spread that the
ROC government has asked CAL to make the change after the US sided
with Beijing over President Lee Tung-hui's recent redefinition of
cross-strait relations as "special state-to-state."</P>
      <P>CAL said its aircraft procurement plan has not been finalized and
that the company will fully explain the plan at a future date.</P>
      <P>Lin said CAL has not reported to him on the specifics of the
procurement plan and his ministry will respect CAL's final decision
on the procurement plan.</P>
      <P>CAL originally planned to procure new planes last year. However,
that plan was shelved after a crash in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan,
killed all 196 passengers and crew on board and six others on the
ground.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CAL procurement plan is solely intended to renovate
the company's aircraft fleet and has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>Lin indicated that in the past, CAL purchased planes entirely
from the United States in tune with ROC governmental policy.
However, with more and more private enterprises competing for CAL's
stake in the market, the former national flag carrier is gradually
freeing itself from government control and is deciding by itself from
which airplane manufacturing companies worldwide to purchase its 
fleet, he said.</P>

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman P.K. Chiang will attend the 1999 summit
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) slated for
Sept. in Auckland, New Zealand, a ranking official with the CEPD
confirmed on Friday.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside local media reports that Taiwan may not be
able to take part in this year's APEC summit due to the escalating
tension between Taiwan and mainland China following President Lee
Teng-hui's July 9 redefinition of Taiwan-mainland ties as "special
state-to-state relationship," CEPD Secretary-General Yeh Ming-feng
revealed that an APEC envoy has visited Taipei recently and extended
an invitation to Chiang personally.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the APEC envoy also praised Chiang as an
outstanding representative, who will take part in the
organization's Sept. summit on behalf of President Lee.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest news that China Airlines (CAL) has
decided to shift a purchase order of 14 passenger airplanes, worth
US2.9 billion, from the US-based Boeing Co. to the
France-headquartered Airbus Industrie amid the current situation
across the Taiwan Strait, Yeh called on the public not to speculate
on the issue as CAL's airplane procurement plan is only a trade
activity.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's financial and
related sectors were told in late April and again in early July they
need to make more effort to cope with the Y2K computer crisis by the
Global Y2K Coordinating Organization.</P>
      <P>The financial sector was given a yellow code --- meaning that
ROC's financial and related sectors need to do more to cope with the
millennium computer bug.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chien-hsing, head of data office of the Central Bank of
China, said the international organization's rating of the ROC's
financial and related sectors' coping with the Y2K bug was not
totally accurate. He said his office has given an explanation through
a channel to the international organization in the hope that it
conducts a re-evaluation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said in a routine news conference that the main reason for
the yellow rating was that the information released by the
financial and related sectors was mainly in Chinese, therefore
hard for the international group to interpret.</P>
      <P>He said after the Central Bank of China collected related data
and re-evaluated the data according to the method used by the
international coordinating organization, the ROC's rating was green,
meaning satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>The Global Y2K Coordinating Organization is an unofficial
international organization that has participation from 70 countries'
financial, securities and insurance institutions. At present, the 70
countries have 630 institutions participating in the organization.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party Lawmaker Lee Ching-hua on Saturday
urged mainland China to quickly free a Taiwan ship and its crew
detained late last month by mainland authorities in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lee called
on the mainland authorities to quickly release the Shin Hwa freighter
and its ten crew members, including captain Kuo Tai-sheng, or at
least allow their families to visit them.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged relevant domestic government agencies to work out
a package of measures to effectively protect Taiwan residents'
safety, as the Shin Hwa incident is not an isolated case, despite its
sensitive timing. The governments on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait should give precedence to the interests of the people when
handling similar cases, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said he immediately contacted Wang Xiaobing, a vice director
of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), which handles the mainland's unofficial ties with
Taiwan, upon learning of the Shin Hwa incident. According to the New
Party lawmaker, Wang promised to contact him as soon as the ARATS had
gained a better understanding of the case.</P>
      <P>The Shin Hwa freighter was intercepted by a mainland Chinese
military vessel while carrying supplies from the northern Taiwan port
of Keelung to the outlying Republic of China-controlled island of
Matsu on July 31.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese security officials accused the Shin Hwa of
smuggling and intruding into mainland Chinese territorial waters, and
forced the ship to go to Mawei Port in nearby Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Family members of the crew who also attended the news conference
also appealed to the mainland authorities to release the crew as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that they have been unable to contact their family

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA IS THE MAIN CULPRIT IN TAIWAN STRAIT CRISIS: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By C.C. Huang and Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's refusal to renounce the
use of force against Taiwan, and its belief that Taipei can be
coerced into accepting Beijing's terms through naval blockades and
missile exercises, are the main cause of the crisis in the Taiwan
Strait, a US expert said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Wei-cheng, a political science professor at Richmond
University, Virginia, made the remarks in a interview with PBS's
"News Hour with Jim Lehrer."</P>
      <P>For the last 20 years, Wang said, the security of the Taiwan
region has depended on "effective deterrence," that is, through a
show of force. But mainland China's increasing build-up of its
military strength and its perception that the "one China" policy
adopted by the United States is leaning more towards Beijing, has
become the cause of instability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang said the government and people of the Republic of China
welcomed Sen. Jesse Helm's proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
since it would show US commitment to upholding Taiwan's security, and
would boost Taipei's confidence in bilateral negotiations with the
mainland. He added that it is in the US interest that both sides of
the strait proceed with dialogue.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-strait relations as "a special state-to-state
relationship" is simply a reaffirmation of the fact that the ROC has
been an independent sovereign country since 1912.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that recent public opinion polls in Taiwan
reveal that the majority of the island's people wish to maintain the
status quo, with less than 4 percent wishing for speedy independence
or reunification.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pei Minxin, a mainland Chinese scholar residing in the
United States, pointed out that Lee's announcement of his "special
state-to-state relations" theory is seen by the authorities in
Beijing as a public declaration of independence.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan holds to such claims, Pei warned, it will lead to a
military conflict. However, he added that this is a latent danger,
and that fighting will not break out for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAUER PLEDGES TO STAND UP TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  6  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republican presidential hopeful Gary
Bauer said on Friday that if elected US president, he will stand up
to mainland China and ensure that the United States lives up to its
defense obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Following a US Senate hearing on the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act on Wednesday, Bauer said that in the face of clear signals from
the mainland intended to intimidate Taiwan in recent weeks, the
Clinton administration continues to appease Beijing, and is even
suggesting that it will cut arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Such a move could violate our obligations under the Taiwan
Relations Act in which the United States is committed to supplying
Taiwan with the weapons it needs to defend itself," said Bauer.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he pointed out, the Clinton administration's
weakness is only part of the problem. For several years, "Republicans
as well as Democrats have been pushing for a policy that accommodates
China's dictators regardless of concerns over America's national
security and our most deeply-held values."</P>
      <P>The practice of routinely granting Beijing most-favored nation
trade status, which members of both parties in Congress recently
voted to renew, has been a major element of that policy. "Sadly, when
presented with opportunities to draw distinctions, many GOP leaders,
including presidential front-runner George W. Bush, advocate a China
policy indistinguishable from Bill Clinton and Al Gore," said the
conservative Republican.</P>
      <P>Bauer stressed that "America needs a president who will craft a
new China policy, one that places our national security ahead of the
dubious prospect of short-term profits. As president, I will stand up
to China's aggression. I will end China's most-favored nation status
which strengthens the communist regime and helps it fund one of the
world's largest arms build-ups. I will deploy a Theater Missile
Defense system to protect American troops and our allies in the
region, and I will ensure that the United States lives up to its
defense obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>Another threat to America's national security emerged this week
with Beijing's test of its newest DF-31 intercontinental ballistic
missile and its announcement of the development of another
medium-range missile, the DF-25.</P>
      <P>Bauer said that the recently-tested DF-31 has the capability to
strike the western United States with a nuclear warhead. Moreover,
the DF-31 warhead is believed to have been developed using
information that Beijing gained through its espionage activity. "Once
again we see that a weak foreign policy directly endangers the safety
of the American people," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JULY FOREIGN TRADE SEES DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted double-digit growth in both
exports and imports in July, a sign that the island's foreign trade
has now emerged completely from the Asian financial meltdown, an
economics official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$9.99 billion-worth of goods in July,
representing 11.8 percent growth from the year-earlier level.
Discounting seasonal or holiday fluctuations, the growth rate was the
largest since August 1997, according to statistics released by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports in July amounted to US$9.5 billion, up 20.2
percent from the same month of last year, the best on record since
October 1997.</P>
      <P>As a result, the island gained US$490 billion in trade surpluses
for the month, the third month in a row that the island has enjoyed a
surplus, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>MOF Director of Statistics Hsu Kuo-chung pointed out that capital
goods imports amounted to US$2.72 billion in July, up 50.7 percent
from the previous year. The figure represents a seven-year high, he
said, adding that Taiwan's economy is now in an optimistic period of
recovery.</P>
      <P>According to a MOF analysis, the double-digit harvest can be
mainly attributed to Taiwan's increasing trade with Hong Kong, Japan,
the United States, European countries, and members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>MOF statistics show that Taiwan imports from the US posted a 38.4
percent year-on-year increase in July, the largest growth since the
beginning of 1997, while exports to Asian countries expanded 28.1
percent, the largest surge since September, 1995.</P>
      <P>In terms of export to South Korea, a 115.4 percent growth was
recorded in July, the largest single-month growth ever recorded in
Taiwan's foreign trade.</P>
      <P>July exports to Japan climbed 36.4 percent, while exports to the
ASEAN countries surged 33.9 percent, and exports to Hong Kong grew 14
percent, all representing new highs since the outbreak of the Asian
financial storm in mid-1997, the MOF figures show.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that Taiwan's exports in the first seven
months of this year posted an increase of 6.3 percent, thanks to
active trading in the electronic, computer, machinery, and optical
manufacturing sectors.</P>
      <P>During the seven-month period, Taiwan exports to the United
States saw a 5.9 percent growth compared with the year-earlier level,
while exports to Asia rose 12.3 percent, and exports to Hong Kong
moved up 0.2 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S CREDIT RATING HARD TO IMPROVE: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will find it difficult to boost
its international credit rating because of its high current account
deficit, external debt and low national savings rate, according to
Moody's Investors Service in New York.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from New York, the Australian Financial Review on
Saturday reported that Moody's published a positive view of
Australia's economy, saying that this reflects Australia's stable
political structure, advanced economic status and sound economic
policy framework.</P>
      <P>But it also criticized Australia for its heavy reliance on
foreign capital which stems from a structural imbalance between
domestic savings and investment, and results in a surge in foreign
debt.</P>
      <P>Moody's estimates that Australia's foreign debt will rise to
US$135.4 billion this year, up from US$127 billion in 1998 and
US$85.1 billion five years ago. This year's debt accounts for 60
percent of its gross domestic product, up from 56.6 percent last
year.</P>
      <P>Moody's also estimates that Australia's current account deficit
will rise to US$23.3 billion this year, up from US$20.9 billion last
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL TO PURCHASE AIRBUS PASSENGER JETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By C. P. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading carrier China Airlines
(CAL) will sign a contract with France-based Airbus Industrie in
Taipei on Aug. 11 to purchase 15 A-340 and A-330 passenger jets, a
senior company executive said here on Friday.</P>
      <P>CAL Chairman Chiang Hung-yi, who is accompanying ROC Premier
Vincent Siew on his current five-day official visit to Macedonia,
said the purchase of A-340 and A-330 jets instead of Boeing's 777
jets was purely a commercial decision and had nothing to do with
politics.</P>
      <P>"Our decision to purchase Airbus passenger jets is mainly aimed
at simplifying aircraft models in our fleet as well as for our
corporate benefits," Chiang said, adding that the recent controversy
over the "special state-to-state relationship" theory has no role in
the deal.</P>
      <P>In addition to the passenger jet deal with Airbus, Chiang said
CAL will also sign a contract with Boeing Co. of the United States
next week to purchase 17 Boeing 747-400 all-cargo freighters.</P>
      <P>The two contracts, worth a total of US$4 billion, form CAL's
largest aircraft purchase deal in the 20th century.</P>
      <P>Some press reports said on Thursday that Boeing is still making
a last-ditch effort to lobby CAL to purchase its Boeing 777
passenger jets instead of Airbus planes.</P>
      <P>Boeing claimed that CAL's decision to switch its passenger jet
order to Airbus was out of political consideration. Boeing sources
said the switch was partly for protesting the Clinton
administration's opposition to ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
recent definition of relations across the Taiwan Strait as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Chiang said all such reports are sheer speculation, adding that
the Airbus deal is part of the carrier's effort to simplify its
aircraft models.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chiang said Boeing 747-400 and 737-800 as well as
Airbus A340 will form the backbone of CAL's passenger fleet. "We'll
gradually phase out MD-2, Boeing 747-200 and Airbus A-300," he
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 15 lawmakers will show their support
for former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong's 2000 presidential
bid when he explains his national policies at a mass rally on Aug. 14
in Yungho City, Taipei County, Kuomintang Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu, a long-time ally of Soong who presided over the opening of a
campaign office in northern Keelung City for Soong on Friday, said
the 15 legislators are just the vanguard, and claimed that more
opinion leaders will publicly demonstrate their backing for Soong as
the March presidential race approaches.</P>
      <P>As for the question of who will serve as Soong's vice
presidential running mate, Liu said it is premature to talk about the
issue, but added that Soong's camp is exploring all feasible
channels.</P>
      <P>Soong, a KMT stalwart who lost his position as provincial

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Shui-bien, the presidential candidate
of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday
that he will announce his vice presidential running mate by year's
end.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when answering reporters' questions as he
made a tour of his new campaign office in Taipei City's Tunhua South
Road.</P>
      <P>The former Taipei City mayor said that his present priorities are
to put on track the organization and human resource deployment of his
campaign office and integrate "DPP party affairs with campaign
affairs."</P>
      <P>The campaign's structural framework will be finished shortly,
according to Chen. He then will announce who his vice presidential
candidate will be, adding that he is "still undecided at
present" who to pick.</P>
      <P>The "ability" of his vice presidential running mate is more
important than his "suitability," he continued. Chen pointed out that
he does not rule out the possibility of pairing with someone outside
the DPP.</P>
      <P>In response to recently released opinion polls indicating that
Chen's public support rate has fallen behind James Soong and Lien
Chan, the former mayor admitted that while he does pay attention to
survey results, he does not let them affect his mood or campaign
tactics.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to comment on a possible KMT ticket of Lien Chan
with Premier Vincent Siew. He called the matter a KMT "domestic
affair."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ENTREPRENEURS' PRIVATE PLANES MUST BE REGISTERED ABROAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Since planes are not allowed to be privately
owned in Taiwan, aircraft owned by Taiwan entrepreneurs have to be
registered abroad in order to fly in and out of the country.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, director of the ruling Kuomintang's business
management committee, departed for the Philippines on a private plane
provided by the ACER conglomerate on Friday. He reportedly is trying
to resolve the dispute over Taipei-Manila aviation rights. The ACER
plane Liu used is registered abroad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan entrepreneurs who have owned planes include Jeffrey Koo,
chairman of the Chinatrust Commercial Bank; and J. F. Chang,
president of the Evergreen conglomerate.</P>
      <P>However, Chang sold his private plane several years ago, as his
EVA Airways Corporation has flights worldwide -- negating his need
for a personal plane.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that aviation and airport space is limited
in Taiwan, domestic civil aeronautic laws state that all aircraft
registered on the island must be available for public use only. No
aircraft are allowed to be privately owned, said officials of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>If a plane is registered abroad, it is seen as a foreign plane,
hence it is entitled to freely fly in and out of Taiwan after
receiving CAA permission to take off or land in Taiwan, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>According to informed sources, Koo's private plane is a US-made
Gulfstream, while the planes owned by the ACER and Chang were made in
France. Due to a very inexpensive registration fee in the United
States, US$25 per plane, the three privately-owned planes are all
registered in the US. Koo's plane is stored and maintained in the
Philippines.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of Defense
(MOD) on Saturday refuted an Internet article saying that a furious
air battle between the military aircraft of Taiwan and mainland China
over the Taiwan Strait occurred on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>The Office of Military Spokesman released a statement, spelling
out the MOD's determination to find out how, from whom, and from
where the rumor started. The MOD has asked law-enforcement
authorities to investigate whether or not the rumor was started to
cause chaos across the nation, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The report written in simplified Chinese characters and in
anonymity appeared Friday on the "Wforum.com/news" website, which is
based in mainland China. It claimed, in the name of the Taipei-based
Central News Agency, that the morning air battle had inflicted damage
on the both sides.</P>
      <P>The MOD statement blamed the story as a malicious attempt to
disturb social and financial order in Taiwan and called on the public
to neglect rumors.</P>
      <P>Military Spokesman Maj. Gen. Kung Fan-ding urged the general

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO ATTEND APEC MEETING AS USUAL: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu said here
on Saturday that the Republic of China will attend the annual meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to be held in
New Zealand in September.</P>
      <P>Hu, who is accompanying Premier Vincent Siew on his five-day
official visit to Macedonia, was responding to a press inquiry
whether the ROC can attend the annual APEC event in the wake of the
recent controversy over the "special state-to-state relationship"
theory.</P>
      <P>In response, Hu said he doesn't think that the controversy
should hinder the ROC's participation in this year's APEC meeting
since the ROC is a full member of the regional forum.</P>
      <P>Both the ROC and mainland China are APEC members. Because of
Beijing's opposition, ROC President Lee Teng-hui has been unable to
attend the annual APEC informal leadership meeting. He has instead
had to name a surrogate to attend such annual summit on his behalf.
Lee has designated P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, to represent him at this year's
APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that the United States is concerned
about the increased fighter jet activities in the Taiwan Strait in
recent days because of the "special state-to-state" theory and has
asked Taipei and Beijing to exercise restraint to avoid escalation
of tension in the region, Hu said ROC military authorities have
ordered fighter pilots to exercise "high degree of restraint."</P>
      <P>"We don't want to cause tension in the Taiwan Strait," Hu said,
adding that the ROC has never taken any provocative action.</P>
      <P>Hu left the Macedonian capital of Skopje for New York
around Saturday noon for a transit stop on his way to Nicaragua to
attend a meeting with foreign ministers of five ROC allies in
Central America.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear whether he will meet with any American
official to exchange views on the current cross-strait tension
or other matters of mutual concern during his transit stay in New
York.</P>
      <P>On Saturday morning, Premier Siew attended a ceremony marking the
ROC's purchase of 30 buses from Macedonia for donation to war-torn
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.</P>
      <P>Siew also met with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski to put finishing touch on some bilateral cooperative
projects.</P>
      <P>Siew, heading a 100-member delegation of senior government
officials, business executives, private charity executives and
journalists, arrived in Skopje on Tuesday for his first visit to
Macedonia since the two countries forged formal diplomatic ties in
January this year.</P>
      <P>At the end of his visit here, Siew will give a news conference
to explain the ROC's basic stances on some critical issues,
including its relations with mainland China, its concrete measures
to assist Macedonia in reviving its battered economy and its aid
projects to Kosovar refugees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the World Vision of Taiwan, a Taipei-based
charity, donated 5,000 stationery bags and 10,000 tool boxes to
Kosovar refugees on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The donation was presented by Shao Ching-ming, president of the
World Vision of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shao said despite geographic distance, the ROC government and
people are more than willing to offer assistance to Macedonian and
Kosovar people rebuild their homeland and economy affected by civil
war in Kosovo, which lies very close to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>Shao said the World Vision of Taiwan has donated more than
US$400,000 worth of relief goods to Kosovar refugees since the
outbreak of the Kosovo crisis in May.</P>
      <P>The charity has sent a team of volunteers to Kosovo to probe
situation there and study feasible ways to assist in the
reconstruction of the region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CALLS MEETING ON TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Aug.   7   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) called a meeting of
government officials, bankers and contractor on Saturday to discuss
some key issues related to the island's high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>The meeting was chaired by CEPD Vice Chairman K. C. Lee, with the
participation of officials from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC), Ministry of Finance, senior executives of
several local banks and representatives of Taiwan High-Speed Railway
Corp. (THSRC).</P>
      <P>The agenda focused on bank loans, fund-raising and tax rates for
the multibillion-dollar high-speed railway project, which will link
Taipei in the north to Kaohsiung in the south.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing said after the two-and-half-hour
meeting that the atmosphere at the meeting was amicable and that
each relevant party was free to frankly express its opinion
about all related issues.</P>
      <P>Ing said she hopes the CEPD will clearly document consensus or
conclusions reached at the meeting.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Lee said the government will take all
necessary steps to help THSRC, a private business and industry
consortium which has won the contract to build the high-speed railway
under a BOT (build-operate-transfer) formula, complete the massive
infrastructure project smoothly.</P>
      <P>It was decided during the meeting that the bank consortium which
will offer NT$280 billion in syndicated loan to the THSRC to help
finance the project can demand a maximum 1.5 percent mark-up on the
Central Bank of China-set prime rate in deciding the interest rate
for the huge loan.</P>
      <P>The THSRC originally hoped that the ceiling on the mark-up will
fall below 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government agreed that the THSRC can raise
additional funds at home and abroad if the construction cost exceeds
its original estimate. In that case, the THSRC's own capital,
about NT$121.9 billion, should still account for more than one
quarter of its total corporate assets.</P>
      <P>If the THSRC issues corporate bonds to raise funds, the amount
should be deducted from its NT$280 billion loan from the bank
consortium. After the deduction, the company's paid-in capital
should still not fall below one-fourth of its total assets.</P>
      <P>Lee said the CEPD will revise the wording of previous meeting
minutes to let the THSRC understand that the government has no
intention of restricting THSRC operations and is willing to assist
the company in obtaining loans from local banks to ensure smooth
proceeding of the project.</P>
      <P>Commenting on press reports that several large European
conglomerates and Taiwan's state-owned enterprises plan to invest in
the high-speed railway project, THSRC Chairwoman Ing said she
welcomes the participation of new investors in the project. "This
will help enhance our confidence in completing the project," Ing
said, adding that the joining of new investors is still in
the "contact stage."</P>
      <P>The new railway is scheduled for completion in 2005.</P>

said, adding that appropriate actions will be taken in case the
activities of mainland Chinese warplanes endanger the safety of
civilian aircraft over the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tang urged the general public not to believe the rumors
being spread by mainland China through Hong Kong news media.
He refuted as "totally untrue" a report on the Internet, which said
a fierce air battle between the warplanes of Taiwan and mainland
China took place over the Taiwan Strait on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG CITY TO ISSUE NEW PUBLIC LOTTERY THIS MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government will issue
new public lotteries by the end of this month, Mayor Frank Hsieh said
Saturday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Showing samples of "Ai Hsin Lo" lottery tickets in the form of
scratch-cards at the press conference, the mayor said that the city
government will put 1.2 million tickets in the market for sale in
the first period, and that it plans to sell 6 million tickets in five
periods. But the length of each period has not been decided yet. "Ai
Hsin Lo" means love and happiness in Chinese.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that, after consulting experts and scholars in law,
he came to believe that the city government's plan is consistent with
the recently-revised statutes governing the issuance of public
lotteries.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government marketed 240,000 public lottery
tickets on a trial basis earlier this year. The sale ended after the
central government took a legal action against it.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the new public lottery offers higher cash prizes for
the winners. The highest prize will increase to NT$2,500,000 from
NT$500,000, while the lowest prize will increase to NT$500 from
NT$200.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC STRENGTH KEY TO RESOLVE CROSS-STRAIT TENSION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Saturday
that solution to the current tension in the Taiwan Strait does not
lie in military wrangling or saber-rattling but in economic strength.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement at an annual congress of the private
Council for Commerce and Industry Research, which groups a new crop
of young business and industry executives.</P>
      <P>Airborne activities over the Taiwan Strait have increased since
President Lee defined cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship" in an interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle radio
station on July 9. Beijing viewed the "state-to-state" definition as
a move to promote Taiwan independence and has launched
saber-rattling against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reviewing the current Taiwan Strait situation, Lee said so long
as the Republic of China can stabilize its economy and ensure
sustained economic growth, it will be able to score a final victory
in its competition with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC faced an export slowdown and a bearish stock
market two years ago when a dramatic depreciation of the Thai
currency triggered a regional and even worldwide financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has adopted a series of pump-priming measures
since late 1997 to stabilize financial markets and stimulate
domestic economic growth, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the president said, the government has taken
concrete measures to streamline the economic structure and
update economic regulations to create a more favorable business and
investment environment and upgrade Taiwan's overall competitiveness
in the world market.</P>
      <P>Through all these efforts, Lee said, Taiwan's economy has
bottomed out of recession and gradually regained momentum. "We
should continue our efforts to promote structural and managerial
reforms to sustain our economic growth and create a brighter future
for our country," the president urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS SEE NO IMMEDIATE OUTBREAK OF WAR IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite mainland China's saber-rattling
over the recent controversy concerning the "special state-to-state"
theory, the possibility of an immediate outbreak of war in the Taiwan
Strait is slim, local strategists said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The strategists and mainland affairs scholars made the forecast
at a seminar on recent escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait
and Beijing's strategy in engaging in psychological warfare against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The scholars said nearly all sensational or shocking reports
about possible mainland China attack on Taiwan were disseminated by
Beijing's mouthpieces in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"None of those reports have been proved true," said Su
Chin-chiang, director of the Strategic Study Center of Nan Hua
University.</P>
      <P>Su said mainland China has to mobilize at least 400,000 troops
if it wants to invade Taiwan. "As mainland China now faces many
domestic problems and challenges, it's not easy for mainland China
to launch an attack on Taiwan at the moment."</P>
      <P>Noting that the so-called Taiwan issue is not just a problem
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Su said the issue is
related to the United States' deployment in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Su said Beijing just tries to take advantage of
the uncertainty concerning top mainland envoy Wang Daohan's planned
visit to Taiwan this autumn to intimidate Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu Ju-heng, an official with the
Ministry of National Defense, said several units in mainland China's
Nanjing Military Region, which is traditionally responsible for
deployment against Taiwan, are now busy with fighting floods in
several mainland provinces.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Hsu said he doesn't think the People's
Liberation Army is really ready for military action against Taiwan.
"Beijing is just using Hong Kong media to release false news to
intimidate our people," he said, adding that local people should not
be panicked by such unfounded speculation and rumors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi on
Saturday chaired a meeting of advisers to the Cabinet-level council,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Seven of the 11 MAC advisers present at the meeting voiced
support for President Lee Teng-hui's definition of cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Only one adviser expressed explicit opposition to the
"state-to-state" concept and three didn't express any opinion.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, a MAC department chief, quoted Su as saying at
the meeting that the government's mainland policy has not changed
following the release of the "state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>"The 'state-to-state' definition just reflects facts and
realities," Su was quoted as saying at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Some MAC advisers said mainland China is not expected to take
actions to create a Taiwan Strait crisis similar to that in 1996.
One reason was that such actions, including live-fire war games
at Taiwan's doorsteps and test-firing of missiles, were very
costly. Mainland China spent an estimated 17 billion renminbi
during the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait crisis.</P>
      <P>Another reason was that mainland China has come to conclude that
its 1996 military action had produced many negative
effects, including pushing for closer military cooperation between
the United States and Japan, the MAC advisers said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the advisers said the mainland economy is currently
in far worse shape than in 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PM SIEW CONCLUDES VISIT  TO  MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  Aug.  7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
and his delegation on Saturday ended their five-day visit to
Macedonia after a meeting between Siew and his Macedonia counterpart,
Ljubco Georgievski.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, several agreements were reached to enhance
bilateral cooperative relations.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the accords, the ROC promised to provide about
US$61 million in low-interest loans and aid to Macedonia to help with
the national development of the Balkan country.</P>
      <P>Of the total, US$20 million will be in low-interest loans for
building public housing units, and US10.5 million for improving
Macedonia's infrastructural facilities, including transportation, tap
water supply, and schools, as well as social welfare programs and
news broadcast systems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC will take part in the Balkan action program by
providing an additional US$31 million loans to Macedonia, including
US$20 million for its city construction and environmental protection,
US$6 million as reconstruction and investment fund, US$3 million for
technical assistance and US$2 million as Taiwan's investment in
Macedonia's pharmaceutical industry.</P>
      <P>Siew, when asked by reporters at a press conference earlier
Saturday, denied media reports that Taiwan has promised a US$1
billion aid-package for Macedonia.</P>
      <P>"There is no such a big figure, ... simply talk about it (money)
would be impractical," Siew said, adding that the development of
bilateral relations should be on a long-term mutually-beneficial
basis.</P>
      <P>The accords signed by officials of the two countries were aimed
to enhance bilateral cooperation in the fields of agriculture, export
processing zones, and cultural and journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Siew arrived in Skopje on Tuesday as head of a 100-stong ROC
delegation. The trip was part of the ROC's efforts to further cement
the hard-won relations with the Balkan state in the face of mainland
China's diplomatic offensive against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although barred from visiting Kosov due to technical problems,
Siew held talks with Kosovo Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Hajrizi and
ranking officials at the ROC embassy in Macedonia.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the premier reaffirmed Taiwan's massive aid
package to the war-torn Kosov.</P>
      <P>Members of Siew' entourage included Foreign Minister Jason Hu,
Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman P.K. Chiang,
Council of Agriculture Chairman Peng Tso-kwei, Council of Labor
Affairs Chairman Chang Hou-sheng, Council for Cultural Affairs
Chairwoman Lin Cheng-chih and Government Information Office Director
General Chen Chien-jen as well as some 50 business leaders.</P>
      <P>The business leaders have decided to import US$2.5 million worth
of Macedonia-produced red wine, marbles, cigarette and woods and open
a five-star hotel and invest in Macedonia's textile and marble
processing industries..</P>
      <P>Besides, the International Commercial Bank of China has also
decided to establish a representative office in Skopje.</P>
      <P>Siew and his delegation are scheduled to leave Skopje late in the
evening and return to Taipei Monday morning via a third country. (By

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan universities released a list of
freshmen recruited through this year's Joint University Entrance
Examination (JUEE) on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The list of 72,466 freshmen, accounting for 61.39 percent of the
total actually taking part in the uniform entrance examination in
early July, was posted at the main gate of National Taiwan University
at 11 a.m.</P>
      <P>The total number of the recruits is 91 short of the full capacity
of the universities in the JUEE program.</P>
      <P>The list has also been posted on the Internet website set up by a
JUEE committee. But the website was overwhelmed as soon as it went
online at 8 a.m. Traffic eased somewhat after some media publications
posted the list on their websites as well.</P>
      <P>Of the number of freshmen admitted, 39,409 -- or 54.38 percent --
were men, and 33,057, or 45.62 percent, were women.</P>
      <P>Among the newly recruited freshmen is veteran test taker Lee
Cheng-gang. A senior at the industry and business administration
department of National Taiwan University, Lee aspires to become a
doctor. He was admitted into National Yang Ming Medical School this
year after taking the examination for the fifth time.</P>
      <P>There were 33 physically handicapped and elderly test takers this
year, and nine were admitted into various universities. Muscular
dystrophy suffer Chuan Shih-hsin was admitted into the entomology
department of National Taiwan University, while Chen Pei-hsien, who
suffers from weak vision, as admitted into National Taiwan
University's law school.</P>
      <P>Eighty-four-year-old Chao Mu-he, who attracted attention during
the exam in July for being the oldest test taker this year, failed to
win admission into a university.</P>
      <P>Although the complicated scoring system of the JUEE allows
various universities to weight the results of certain portions of the
exams differently -- making it impossible to compare test scores
across departments and schools -- law, medicine and electrical
engineering are among the most popular disciplines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF: NO US PRESSURE ON TAIWAN OVER STATE-T0-STATE STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has never put pressure
on or punished Taiwan over President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a "special state-to-state
relationship," said Chairman Richard Bush of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bush made the remarks while replying to questions after a speech
to a meeting of the Alumni Association of Tunghai University in the
Washington Area.</P>
      <P>He told the gathering that he went to Taipei on July 22 to gain a
better understanding of the situation, not to apply pressure or
mediate.</P>
      <P>The AIT chief said that as he indicated in a July 25 statement,
issued before leaving Taiwan, he gained a better understanding of the
situation from his trip, which means his superiors would also have a
better understanding, he added.</P>
      <P>Bush said that Lee's redefinition of the present cross-strait
relations involved the nucleus of mainland-Taiwan relations, and
therefore it is not appropriate for the United States to comment.</P>
      <P>As the United States' policy is to let mainland China and Taiwan
resolve their disputes, he stressed, Washington would not interfere
in the cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The important thing, Bush pointed out, is how Taipei and Beijing
treat the other side's statements and whether progress can be
achieved in the cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>When asked about the possibility of a military clash between the
mainland and Taiwan, he said that there is presently concern over the
escalation in the two sides' air force activities.</P>
      <P>To prevent a military incident, Bush said, the United States
hopes the mainland and Taiwan will show self-restraint.</P>
      <P>Bush was invited to deliver a speech at the meeting, organized to
welcome the Washington visit of Tunghai University President Wang
Kang-pei. Bush's father taught at the English department of Tunghai
University between 1966 and 1971.</P>

      <P>The Fifth Asia Children-Literature Convention has brought
together 300 authors of children's literature from Japan, South

    <HEADLINE>CHIU HUNGDAH SLAMS 'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A famous Chinese scholar criticized on
Saturday the assertion of a "special state-to-state relationship"
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, saying the point of view
severely violates the constitution of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chiu Hungdah, a professor at the University of Maryland's law
school, made the remarks at a seminar.</P>
      <P>He said President Lee Teng-hui should not try to control the
government single-handedly and that Lee was misled to raise the
"state-to-state" concept by his subordinates.</P>
      <P>Chiu said no matter who designed the assertion, the ROC's
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council cannot shirk its
responsibility.</P>
      <P>He said that since there is no change in Article Four of the
ROC's Constitution, there is no basis for Taipei to raise the
"state-to-state" concept. Article Four stipulates that the territory
of the Republic of China and its existing national boundaries shall
not be altered except by a resolution of the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Chiu described the designer of the "state-to-state" theory as
"totally mixed-up."</P>
      <P>Chiu do not think the dispute would lead to a cross-strait
military conflict because the ruling Kuomintang has not amended the
Constitution to bring it in line with the "state-to-state" theory,
rather, he said, Beijing has learned a lesson from the 1996 crisis in
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing would choose to let the United States solve the dispute
that has resulted from the theory, he said.</P>
      <P>Pei Min-hsin, a researcher at the Washington-based Carnegie
International Peace Foundation, said that compared with the 1996
crisis in the Taiwan Strait, not only has the US Congress given only
lukewarm support to Taiwan after Taipei redefined relations with
Beijing in July, the US media is no longer fully supportive of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said 55 percent to 60 percent of US news media editorials
criticized the "state-to-state" concept, and few editorials support
the renunciation of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>He said the Clinton administration, while maintaining its "one
China" policy, cannot overtly pressure Taiwan, because this would
result in a response from the US Congress.</P>
      <P>Chiu indicated that in the future, the Clinton administration can
only treat the symptom, not the disease. But, he said, if Taiwan were
to amend its constitution to bring it in line with the
"state-to-state" theory, war would break out.</P>
      <P>Jin Gan, a former researcher at mainland Chinese National Defense
University, said the "state-to-state" theory is one step closer to
separation. Gin also noted that since Taipei announced the theory in
early July, the thinking of mainland China's People's Liberation Army
has become unified, and they believe peaceful reunification is no
longer possible.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will
hold an investment symposium on Aug. 11 to discuss the development of
the proposed Nankang Economic and Trade Park near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The park, to be developed on a 12-hectare land by the government

      <P>Facilities in the park will include large-scale exhibition halls,
a five-star international hotel and a multi-functional recreational
center. Total investment is estimated at NT$50 billion (US$1.51
billion).</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Board of Foreign Trade has spent NT$9.6 billion
(US$291 million) to purchase six hectares of land from the Taipei
City Government and Taiwan Fertilizer Co. for the construction of
exhibition halls.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT$500 BILLION TO BE CHARGED THIS YEAR BY TAIWAN CREDIT CARD HOLDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There were 11 million valid credit cards in
the Taiwan area as of the end of May this year, and it is estimated
that credit card charges in Taiwan this year will reach NT$500
billion, sources from the credit card industry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The number of cards issued in Taiwan relative to its population
is 64.4 percent. This is considerably lower than South Korea's 130
percent, Hong Kong's 110 percent, Malaysia's 105 percent and
Singapore's 93 percent. The high rates in these countries indicate
that many people there have more than one card.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that Taiwan's credit card consumption
volume accounts for only 9.1 percent of the island's total
consumption volume, far below levels in the United States, Hong Kong
and Singapore. This shows that Taiwan's credit card market still has
room to develop.</P>
      <P>Sources said Taiwan could reach a level in which there would be
one card in circulation for each person on the island, with credit
card consumption accounting for about 20 percent of overall
consumption.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOR THE STOCK MARKET, 6,800 IS THE POINT OF NO RETURN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.8  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If share prices manage to maintain the
6,800-point level, it will take time to consolidate before eventually
moving upward, but if it fails to maintain that level, the index
could plunge to as low as 6,300 points, dealer said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Fubon Securities, selling pressure will prevail in
the short term and keep the local bourse bearish despite attempts by
government-linked funds to push the index up to the 7,000-point
level.</P>
      <P>Government-linked funds on Saturday aggressively bought heavily
weighted technology shares to prevent the index from falling to below
6,800 points. The buying was also seen as an attempt to prevent
a massive sell-off by investors who have to repay margin loans.</P>
      <P>Investors who buy securities on margin take out loans to buy
them, using the securities as collateral. If the prices of the
purchased securities fall far enough, the lending institutions may
force the purchased securities to be sold to repay the loan. In such
cases, a massive sell-off often results, triggering a nose-dive in
share prices that government intervention would not be able to
counter. Market analysts said 6,800 points is the government's bottom
line.</P>
      <P>A rebound on Saturday, however, was mostly the result of bargain
hunters and short-term speculators, not institutional or individual
buyers, both of whom lack confidence in the market, analysts added.</P>
      <P>Jih Sun Securities suggested that mid- and long-term investors
begin buying shares once prices fall below the 7,000 mark.</P>
      <P>As for individual investors, dealers suggested they remain on the
sidelines until the situation becomes clear and the market resumes
its upward climb.</P>
      <P>The situation will not be clear until mid-September, dealers
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agents from Beijing operating in Taiwan are
spreading rumors that an invasion is imminent, intensifying China's
psychological warfare against the island, a Canadian analyst said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Eric Margolis, contributing foreign editor for the Sun
newspapers, said rumors have swept Taiwan that China is preparing
an invasion.</P>
      <P>He noted that the growing crisis over independence-minded Taiwan
is causing deepening concern across Asia and in Washington.</P>
      <P>He noted that much as China would like to invade Taiwan, it
clearly lacks the military capability to do so.</P>
      <P>"So it's more likely Beijing will continue to bombard Taiwan with
threats and perhaps a few missiles... Behind all the threats, China
and Taiwan still need one another as evidenced by that fact
that Taiwan has over US$30 billion invested in mainland China," he
said.

has been blocked by Beijing because of Vatican links with Taiwan, the
South China Morning Post reported today.</P>
      <P>Vatican chiefs lobbying for an SAR stopover during the Pope's

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REITERATES ROC'S STANCE ON 'STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui reiterated on Monday
that he was only telling the truth when he defined relations across
the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state" relationship.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement while meeting with a bipartisan delegation
from the US House of Representatives, headed by Benjamin A. Gilman
(R-N.Y.), chairman of the House International Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>President Lee stressed that the "special state-to-state"
definition describes a fact undeniable either from legal, historical
or any realistic point of view.</P>
      <P>More important, Lee said his definition is just aimed at
further clarifying the fact and ascertaining parity in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lee said cross-strait negotiations will have positive meanings
only when they are conducted on the basis of parity, adding that the
Republic of China can never accept Beijing's claim that it
represents the central government of China while downgrading the ROC
to a local-level government.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's claim is not true and unacceptable to us," the
president stressed, adding the cold reality is that the Republic of
China and the People's Republic of China has co-existed in the world
since 1949.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the ROC has not only existed since its
inception in 1912 but has also created many admirable economic and
democratic achievements over the past 88 years.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to tell his guests that the ROC is the United
States' longtime ally and firm supporter. Over past years, Lee said
the ROC has encountered many difficulties and setbacks in its
pursuit of freedom, democracy and reforms. "Thanks to full US
congressional support, we have managed to overcome all those
challenges."</P>
      <P>The president further said he has consistently attached great
importance to the development of cross-strait relations. "We have
spared no efforts to promote exchanges and dialogue with the
mainland," Lee said, adding that he fully supports US President Bill
Clinton's call on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to resolve
their disputes strictly by peaceful means and to strengthen
bilateral dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lee also emphasized the necessity of strengthening cross-strait
exchanges, saying that the ROC sincerely welcomes top mainland envoy
Wang Daohan's planned visit to Taiwan this autumn.</P>
      <P>"We hope Wang can smoothly visit Taiwan at any time of his
convenience," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee has repeatedly expressed his gratitude
for US congressional support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Gilman said the US Congress recognizes and
supports the ROC's democratic reforms in recent years. "We admire
your efforts to establish a fair, just, free and democratic system
and society," he added.</P>
      <P>The House bipartisan delegation arrived in Taipei on Sunday for
a brief visit as part of its efforts to gain a fuller
understanding of the current Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Other members of the delegation included Rep. John D. Dingell
(D-Mich.), Rep. Alcee L. Hastings (D-Fla.), Rep. Robert Underwood
(D-Guam-AL), Rep. Tom Campbell (R-Calif.) and Robert Ney (R-Ohio).</P>
      <P>Also present at Lee's meeting with the US lawmakers were
Vice Foreign Minister David Lee; Ding Mou-shih, a senior adviser to
the President; Yin Chung-wen, secretary-general of the National
Security Council; and Lin Pi-chao, deputy secretary-general to the

    <HEADLINE>POSTAL SERVICE PRIVATIZATION PLAN DISCUSSED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of whether postal affairs in
Taiwan will remain state-owned or public operated was discussed
during a seminar here on Monday.</P>
      <P>A proposed governmental project calls for the privatization of
the current state-owned and public-operated postal department. The
proposal is causing much controversy due to the fact that postal
savings is one of the three foundations financing the government's
National Stabilization Fund.</P>
      <P>Monday's seminar sponsored by the Chung-Hua Institute for
Economic Research (CHIER) discussed the privatization project. Those
invited included Huang Shui-cheng, deputy commissioner of the
Directorate General of Posts under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications; Deng Tien-lai, director of the Post &amp;
Telecommunications Dept.; and Legislator Fong Fu-Hsiang.</P>
      <P>Both the Ministry of Finance and the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development advocate the postal administration
being divided into four companies operating independently: delivering
service, counter service, banking service and insurance service.</P>
      <P>If the postal savings and postal life-insurance sectors were to
be governed by the "banking law" and the "insurance law" as planned,
the incentives currently offered by the postal savings division would
be greatly reduced, a fact deemed as negative for its growth.</P>
      <P>As this is the case, during the seminar CHIER expressed concern
that the function of postal savings as the protector of the
Taiwan bourse will certainly be weakened.</P>
      <P>Survey results released by CHIER Monday indicated that only 20
percent of those interviewed deemed the current goal of the postal
service of offering "inexpensive, safe, convenient, and private
correspondence" would remain intact if privatization were to occur.</P>
      <P>Up to 93 percent of the interviewees favor the island's postal
administration remaining state-owned. The survey found that the
public deems that the quality of the postal service can only be
guaranteed under a state-owned or public-operated framework.</P>
      <P>In addition, up to 86 percent of consumers interviewed felt that
the inexpensive and reliable postal service enjoyed by residents
here is due to the fact that the domestic postal office can operate
simultaneously the profit-making businesses of postal delivery,
savings and life-insurance. The profit from these three businesses
makes up for the losses resulting from inexpensive delivery charges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FUEL PRICES TO RISE 3 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug.9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is
expected to announce a 3-percent price increase for oil on Tuesday
due to price hikes in the internaional crude oil market and a
pre-tax profit for July that is lower than the government projection.</P>
      <P>CPC's business earnings for July totaled NT$33.83 billion with
pre-tax profits totaling NT$2.62 billion, a NT$178 million decrease
from the government's projected earnings. At the same time, the cost
for imported crude oil reached US$15.68 per barrel in July, a
19-month record high.</P>
      <P>In light of the increasing cost of oil, the CPC has adjusted
upward the oil price three times since April. The revised rates were
2.69 percent in April, 2.8 percent in May and 2.99 percent in July.</P>
      <P>A price rise on Tuesday seems inevitable since the international
price of crude oil continues to rise, CPC noted.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The four people who died and the one person
still missing from Saturday's collision between a yacht and a barge
off West Vancouver were all overseas Chinese from Taiwan, officials
of the Canadian liaison office in Taipei said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted the victims had long resided in either Canada
or the United States. No Taiwanese tourists were on board the yacht,
they added.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 people were on board the yacht which crashed into
the 300-foot barge being towed by a tugboat. The yacht was trying to
get into position to watch a fireworks show, according to foreign
wire reports.</P>
      <P>The Canadian officials pointed out that nine of the 14 people on
the yacht, including the skipper, his wife and two sons, were injured
and are now in a local hospital.</P>
      <P>The four people killed by the boat collision have been identified
as Susie Chen, 53; Marilyn Waye, 51; Manfai Ngo, 36; and Frank Ngo,
5. Louis Chen of West Vancouver, 50, was identified as missing,
according to the Canadian Trade Office (CTO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen's two 13 year-old twin daughters and his 17 year-old
daughter, Waye's boyfriend, and Ngo's wife were among the victims
sent to the hospital, the office reported.</P>
      <P>The CTO said that it on Monday contacted the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs to offer its help for the Chinese victims' relatives in
Taiwan in obtaining Canadian visas.</P>
      <P>Reports said that the yacht flipped over after striking a
submerged cable between the towboat and the barge. Many passengers on
the Seattle-based yacht were not wearing life jackets, a report cited

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIALS  REACT  TO  SUNDAY'S  HACKING  OF  CONTROL YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   9  (CNA)
(By Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China's (CBC)
information system is secure from computer hacker invasions, the
bank's information office director Hsieh Chien-hsing said Monday.</P>
      <P>A hacker broke into the Internet website of the Control Yuan and
wiped out all the information on Sunday, rocking the whole island.</P>
      <P>The CBC's information system, however, is protected by a integral
management procedure, Hsieh said, adding that he is confident no
hacker will be able to reach the bank's database.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if the CBC's information system were to be broken
into by hackers, the whole system might be paralyzed, leading to
serious consequences. How to prevent computer hackers from breaking
into bank information systems is thus every financial institutions'
top priority, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Police Administration Criminal Investigation
Bureau (CIB) Director Cheng Ching-sung said that in view of the fact
that specific regulations preventing Internet crime are lacking, the
most pressing task at hand is to establish international Internet
laws and step up cooperation between government and the private
sector.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of privacy, boundaries and territorial
restrictions, many criminals are able to use the Internet to escape
detection, adding to investigation difficulties, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>While the CIB has set up a computer crime squad, Cheng said the
unit still has a long way to go before it can prevent and detect most
Internet crimes. He urged the private sector to participate in the
CIB's crime-prevention Internet system by setting up a national
public security network.</P>
      <P>Cheng also urged the ISP (internet service providers) industry to
exercise self-restraint and filter out illegal websites to create a
"clean and healthy" Internet society.</P>
      <P>In response to Sunday's break-in, Control Yuan Secretary-General
Tu Shan-liang has instructed information office director Hsieh
Sung-chih to report the incident to the Taipei City Police
Headquarters' Chungcheng precinct.</P>
      <P>Amid continuing tension with mainland China, Cheng urged all
government agencies to raise their awareness to prevent future hacker
invasions.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan President Frederic Chien has personally expressed
concern over Sunday's incident. He has instructed related agencies to
step up information protection measures to guard against further
break-ins.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told members of the press that the hacker only managed to
invade the Control Yuan's service and advertising website, and was
unsuccessful in gaining entrance into the Control Yuan's' inner
communication operation system. No Control Yuan internal data was
lost, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND DENIES WITHDRAWING CHAPARRAL MISSILES FROM MATSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Monday denied a newspaper report that the military will withdraw
chaparral missiles from the Republic of China-held frontline island
of Matsu, which lies closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A press statement released by the Office of the Military
Spokesman said chaparral missiles deployed on Matsu are still in a
state of combat preparedness. "The military does not have any plan to
relocate the chaparral missiles at the moment," the statement
stressed.</P>
      <P>The statement went on to say that the ROC armed forces has a
consistent and well-designed military deployment and adjustment plan,
and that strict procedures must be followed when the plan is
implemented.</P>
      <P>The MND also urged local news media to base its military-related
reports on information released by the ministry, and to avoid
speculating on military-related events, as such speculation has an
adverse effect on national morale.</P>
      <P>In related news, meanwhile, the ministry responded to press
reports that the ROC Air Force has decided to cancel many warplane
display flights during an upcoming Taipei aviation trade fair amid
the current tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ministry stressed that Air Force General Headquarters had
never agreed in the first place to conduct dynamic airborne flight
performances in connection with the aviation show to be held at the
Taipei World Trade Center from Aug. 12-15.</P>
      <P>"The reports are completely unfounded," the Office of the
Military Spokesman said in another press release.</P>
      <P>The MND press release explained that air force authorities did
not agree to an airborne exhibition during this year's aviation trade
fair for several reasons, one of which is that the air force base in
Taoyuan, some 35 kilometers south of Taipei, is undergoing
refurbishment, and another of which is that the exhibition overlaps
with the celebration of the founding anniversary of the Chinese Air
Force Academy.</P>
      <P>Air force activities in the skies over the Taiwan Strait have
increased since ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state relationship" on July 9. The
definition has angered Beijing, prompting communist saber-rattling in
recent weeks, and spawning wild local speculation on military
activities of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MND said it hopes local news media, and society in general,
will stop such speculation, and also stop spreading unsubstantiated
rumors, to avoid disrupting domestic stability.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said Monday the main
reason he raised the "special state-to-state" theory on cross-Taiwan
Strait ties last month was to elucidate the fact that the Republic of
China exists in the world.</P>
      <P>President Lee made the remark while receiving Japanese Dietman
Eisei Ito at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated that the ROC cordially welcomes the visit by
Chairman Wang Daohan of the mainland Chinese Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can discuss any issue
concerning cross-strait relations. However, he added, the talks can
occur only when the two sides are on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>Ito said he agreed with Lee's "special state-to-state" theory and
indicated that Beijing's hegemony has caused anxiety and instability
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted it is not easy for mainland China to democratize,
however, he added, if the mainland Chinese economy can take a turn
for the better, other Asian countries will benefit.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the Republic of China has long been a
sovereign state and that Beijing should not ignore the fact that there
are 22 million people on the island.</P>
      <P>He said seeking unification with mainland China has been and
remains the ROC's consistent position and assertion. However, he
clarified that unification with the mainland is a future task and
will come into realization only when mainland China achieves
democracy, freedom and equal wealth.</P>
      <P>Ito was accompanied to the meeting with President Lee by Vice
Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan and Chairman Lin Chin-ching of the
Association of East Asia Relations. Also present were Senior Adviser

technological cooperation with the Agency for the International
Development of Technology and Trade under the Trade and Industry
Ministry of France, a CETRA senior official said Monday.</P>

      <P>France is the Republic of China's fourth largest European trade
partner, although bilateral investment accumulated only to US$30

of tapping and strengthening trade and investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>At the initial stage, both sides will either hold seminars Kao

      <P>Following a series of intrusions by mainland
Chinese hackers into a dozen government-run Internet websites over
the weekend, prosecution and police authorities on Monday launched an
investigation into the incidents.</P>
      <P>C.J. Chou, a chief public prosecutor with the Taipei District
Prosecutors' Office (TDPO), said a task force led by Prosecutor Chang
Shao-pin, an expert on computer crime, is probing the incidents
involving the infiltration of websites maintained by the Control
Yuan, the Taiwan Provincial Government, the Pintung County
Government, and various other official bodies, by hackers suspected
of being mainland China-based.</P>
      <P>Chang's task force is also cooperating with the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) under the Ministry of the Interior, in an
investigation into the hacking of the website of the American
Institute in Taiwan, which handles the United States' unofficial ties
with Taiwan, according to Chou.</P>
      <P>Tien Ping-lin, head of a TDPO committee on computer crime, said
the mainland Chinese hackers' actions may have violated Republic of
China laws on copyright, document forgery, and defacing of documents.</P>
      <P>If any concrete evidence showing such illegal activity is found,
local police authorities might seek the cooperation of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait in
asking the mainland's public security authorities to crack down on
such Internet attacks, a CIB official said.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, more than ten breaches by mainland hackers into local
websites of government agencies were reported to a local organization
set up to assist victims of computer crime known by the acronym CERT,
which has offered technical assistance to help the victims recover
data wiped out by the hackers.</P>
      <P>The incidents came amid deteriorating relations between Taiwan
and mainland China following President Lee Teng-hui's airing of his
view that Taiwan-mainland ties are a "special state-to-state
relationship" in a July 9 interview with the Germany-based Deutche
Welle radio station.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officers of the Investigation Bureau under the Justice
Ministry said the hackers may have invaded the Taiwan websites
through websites backed by mainland Chinese authorities, or through
US-based websites run by mainlanders, as links between mainland and
foreign websites are closely monitored by the authorities in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Some of these intrusions might be no more than acts of mischief,
the officials said, but they added that they are worried that Beijing
might be attempting to test Taiwan's ability to protect its websites,
and use the breaches "to steal secret information."</P>
      <P>They called on government webmasters to pay special heed to the
situation, and added that a comprehensive monitoring system has been
implemented to ward off further disruptions by mainland hackers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARITY KEY TO POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Monday that
parity is crucial to constructive development of relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while meeting with US Senator Slade Gorton
(R-Wash.), who is currently in Taipei for a brief visit.</P>
      <P>The president said he was stating a fact when he defined
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state" relationship in an
interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle radio station on July 9.</P>
      <P>The "special state-to-state" definition is also aimed at further
clarifying and asserting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are
equal, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the definition does not mark a shift of
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, adding that he has
consistently supported cross-strait exchanges and dialogue.</P>
      <P>The president also threw his full support behind US President
Bill Clinton's call for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
enhance dialogue and exchanges and to resolve their disputes with
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the Republic of China can never accept
Beijing's claim that the ROC is a renegade province or a
local-level government under its jurisdiction. "Cross-strait
relations will develop in a positive, constructive direction only
when their engagements are conducted on a basis of parity."</P>
      <P>Lee extended a warm welcome to Gorton's visit and expressed his
gratitude for longtime US congressional support for the ROC's
national cause.</P>
      <P>For his part, Gorton said the US Congress has consistently
supported free and democratic Taiwan. The senator further said he
does not find any impropriety in President Lee's "special
state-to-state" theory. He also said the US government should
maintain balance in its policies toward Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>As a senator elected from Washington State where Boeing Co. is
headquartered, Gorton expressed his concern about China Airlines'
(CAL's) plan to purchase European-made Airbus A-340 and A-330
passenger jets instead of Boeing 777s.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee said that the ROC government is not in a
position to interfere with CAL's aircraft purchase plan because it
is purely a commercial deal.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said he fully understands Gorton and other
American politicians' concern about the deal. Lee suggested that
Boeing executives directly discuss the purchase deal with their CAL
counterparts. "I believe that such a practice will be more
conducive," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's leading carrier is scheduled to sign a contract with
Boeing Co. at the Sherwood Taipei hotel on Aug. 11 for purchase of
14 B747-400 all-cargo freighters, worth a total of US$2.5 billion.
CAL originally also planned to purchase 13 Boeing 777 passenger
planes. However, the carrier may switch its US$1.5 billion passenger
jet purchase order to France-based Airbus Industrie, causing concern
of the US government.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Gorton also paid a visit to Lin Feng-cheng,
minister of transportation and communications, as part of his effort
to help salvage CAL's passenger jets order for Boeing Co.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has said he is likely

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE  PRESIDENT TRYING TO SALVAGE  AIR AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official of ruling Kuomintang said on
Monday that he has received a promise from Philippine President
Joseph Estrada that his country will not sever its aviation links
with Taiwan without due cause.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, who is in charge of the KMT's business operations,
revealed Estrada's promise at a press conference upon his return to
Taipei after a three-day private visit to the Philippines during
which he met the Philippine president, a personal friend.</P>
      <P>The visit attracted much attention at a time when the
Taipei-Manila aviation agreement is in dispute.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in addition to Estrada, he also met with Jalinto
Ortega, the official in charge of civil aviation affairs.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, he went on, they discussed the recent dispute
which broke out when Manila unilaterally announced the suspension of
the air agreement between Taiwan and the Philippines, forcing China
Airlines and EVA Airways, Taiwan's two major carriers, to suspend
their Taipei-Manila flights from Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>Liu said Estrada felt that the dispute was mainly caused by
miscommunication between the two sides, and that he suggested more
negotiations by aviation representatives from the two countries.</P>
      <P>Estrada gave his word that his country will not cut air links
before the conclusion of such talks, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Earlier negotiations aimed at renewing the Taipei-Manila aviation
accord began in late July, but broke down almost immediately because
of a dispute over passenger quotas for Taiwan carriers.</P>
      <P>The Philippines claimed Taiwan violated the 1996 aviation
agreement by using larger airplanes than permitted under the terms of
the accord. This violation has hurt the Philippine Airlines,
according to Manila authorities.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has also learned during his meeting with Estrada that
it is not just Taiwan airlines that are being targeted by Manila in
its fight to keep the moribund national flag carrier in the air.
Other airlines from countries such as Thailand, Singapore, South
Korea, Malaysia, and Hong Kong are also facing the challenge, he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Philippine Airlines, which currently employs around 7,000 people,
has been suffering operational deficits of around US$1.55 million per
month, Liu said.</P>

      <P>Heavy rains in central and southern Taiwan
in recent days have caused NT$253.5 million-worth of losses in the
agriculture, forestry, fishery and livestock sectors, the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County has been the area hardest-hit, and the COA has
adopted a series of measures to assist farmers in disaster-stricken
areas to reconstruct their damaged homes.</P>
      <P>The losses break down as NT$21 million-worth of losses to farming
land, NT$147 million in lost crops, NT$20 million-worth of damage to
fisheries, NT$190,000 for forestry, and NT$64.4 million-worth of soil
erosion, the COA said.</P>
      <P>Twenty-five hectares of farmland have been washed away or
inundated in central Taiwan's Nantou County alone, with losses of as
much as NT$21 million, according to COA calculations.</P>
      <P>Crops have been severely damaged in Kaohsiung, Yunlin, Nantou,
and Tainan counties, the COA went on, with a total of 861 hectares of
crops in the four counties destroyed beyond salvage, mainly
vegetables, papayas, water melons, bananas, and tomatoes.</P>
      <P>One hundred meters of breakwaters along the coast of Chiayi
County, and the protecting dyke around the base of the Chiayi
lighthouse were also destroyed by the flooding, with an estimated
loss of NT$20 million.</P>
      <P>Several sections of industrial roads in Miaoli, Nantou, Tainan

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi held talks with a US congressional delegation in Taipei on Monday
to exchange views on the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Both sides expressed the hope that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will continue their dialogue.</P>
      <P>The six-member congressional delegation, headed by Benjamin
Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, arrived in Taipei on Sunday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>Su told the visitors that President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition
of cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" was
intended to place future cross-strait political talks on an equal
basis, and did not signal any policy change on behalf of the Republic
of China government.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, Taipei wants to provide more protection
for the existing status quo, and hopes the voice of the Taiwan people
can be heard more clearly by the international community.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief stressed that Lee's statement merely reflected a
simple fact -- "one China" is a concept for the future, and China
today is divided.</P>
      <P>He described Taipei's raising of the "special state-to-state
relationship" as a "defensive political display," and reiterated
Taipei's welcome of an autumn visit to Taiwan by mainland China's
emissary to the island, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>If Wang visits Taipei as scheduled, Su said, it will improve
mainland-Taiwan relations, and bring the triangular relationship
between Washington, Beijing and Taipei into better balance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
returned to Taipei on Monday night from a weeklong official visit to
Macedonia, and described the trip as "very fruitful."</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
upon his arrival. he said that his 100-member mission was warmly
welcomed by the Macedonian people and attracted considerable
attention from the international media.</P>
      <P>"The trip has elevated Taiwan's international image in Europe,
especially on the Balkan peninsula," Siew claimed.</P>
      <P>During his stay in the capital, Skopje, Siew held talks with his
Macedonian counterpart Ljubco Georgievski. The two sides also signed
several bilateral cooperative agreements.</P>
      <P>In addition, Siew also announced the donation of US$10.5
million-worth of direct aid to Macedonia in 10 areas, including
transportation, information technology, water supply, education and
social welfare.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed domestic press reports that he had presented
Macedonia with "big gifts" during his stay.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that Macedonia's economy has been ravaged by the
conflicts in surrounding areas, and that there is a need for Taiwan,
as a friendly country, to provide assistance.</P>
      <P>He added that these moves will also help pave the way for Taiwan
businessmen to expand their operations in Europe.</P>
      <P>The premier was originally scheduled to visit the war-torn
province of Kosovo in neighboring Yugoslavia, but the plan was
canceled due to security considerations. Instead, several ranking
officials of the Kosovar provisional government went to Skopje to
meet with Siew.</P>
      <P>Siew told the media that President Lee Teng-hui's announcement of
US$300 million in aid for Kosovar refugees and rehabilitation
projects was a "very correct decision."</P>
      <P>The aid program was made out of humanitarian consideration,
not merely out of diplomatic consideration, he said, adding that
it will be implemented in phases over the next several years, and the
budget will be deliberated by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Siew's mission consisted of government officials, lawmakers,
representatives of charity groups, businessmen and journalists.</P>
      <P>It was the premier's first visit to Macedonia, with which Taiwan
forged diplomatic relations in January of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF BRIEFS FOREIGN ENVOYS ON 'STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi on Tuesday briefed 13 foreign envoys stationed in Taipei on key
points of the English version of the Republic of China's position
paper on the "special state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Su's briefing was given at the request of resident ambassadors
of 13 of the ROC's diplomatic allies. The presentation, held at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was presided over by Vice Foreign
Minister David Lee.</P>
      <P>Su said President Lee Teng-hui's definition of relations across
the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship" is a
political declaration aimed at clarifying the real nature of
cross-strait ties and asserting the equality and parity of the two
sides.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner stressed that the
declaration does not mark a shift in Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland nor does it has anything to do with the ROC's constitutional
amendments.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "special state-to-state" theory only describes a
fact, Su said the ROC's policies on civilian exchanges, trade and
investment across the Taiwan Strait have remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Guatemalan Ambassador Luis Alberto Noriega
Morales asked Su whether the current tension in the Taiwan Strait
over the "special state-to-state" theory will ease soon.</P>
      <P>In response, Su said the so-called cross-strait military
stand-off is mainly an exaggeration spread by Hong Kong news media.
"In fact, our intelligence shows that the situation is not as tense
as reported by Hong Kong newspapers," Su said, adding that ROC
Defense Minister Tang Fei said last week that many Hong
Kong-originated reports concerning recent mainland Chinese military
deployment were false or fabricated.</P>
      <P>Noriega further asked whether the current cross-strait tension
and the "special state-to-state" theory will have any impact on the
ROC's next presidential election scheduled for March 2000.</P>
      <P>Su said it's still premature to predict whether present
cross-strait ties and the "special state-to-state" theory will have
any effects on the coming election. Nevertheless, Su said he is
convinced that declaring the theory now is better than announcing
it in October or after the autumn.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Su has directly explained the
key spirit of the "special state-to-state" theory to foreign envoys
since President Lee explicitly defined cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in an interview with Germany's
Deutsche Welle radio station on July 9, sparking furious reaction
from Beijing which views Taiwan as a "renegade province."</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials said Su will hold a similar briefing
on the "state-to-state" concept for resident representatives of
countries with which the ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic
ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO STAND UP TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 9 (CNA): Both the Clinton administration and
US Congress have continually acquiesced in the face of Communist
Chinese defiance. If they do not make a stand against Beijing soon,
they may never be able to change Communist Chinese behavior, warned
an American national defense expert Monday.</P>
      <P>Jason Morrow, research associate of the National Center for
Public Policy Research's National Defense Center, wrote in an
analysis titled "Clinton's Flawed China Policy: Is Clinton-style
Engagement Really Constructive?" that the progress on many
issues that the engagement was supposed to bring Washington has not
materialized, but the world has seen the following:</P>
      <P>-- Pakistan and India are at war over a border dispute, thanks
in part to nuclear tests and military escalation made possible by the
People's Republic of China;</P>
      <P>-- The PRC has gathered information from US
nuclear laboratories giving them warhead design information on a par
with the United States;</P>
      <P>-- The US trade deficit with mainland China has risen to $58
billion;</P>
      <P>-- The PRC government has begun a severe crackdown on dissidents
and religious movements; and</P>
      <P>-- Communist China's threats toward Taiwan have reached new
levels.</P>
      <P>Morrow noted that after all these setbacks, the Clinton
administration apparently still believes that "kowtowing to China is
beneficial." And in an egregious display of bad timing, President
Bill Clinton proposed the continued extension of normal trade
relations with mainland China earlier this year, only hours before
the tenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Not even Congress has been immune to engagement fever, said the
national defense expert, adding that the House of Representatives
recently approved continued normal trade relations with the PRC.</P>
      <P>The next critical issue will be the upcoming negotiations to
allow the PRC into the World Trade Organization, an idea that
President Clinton supports. "To do so would complete the process of
capitulation to China, as it would effectively prevent the US from
using trade restrictions as a tool in future negotiations," pointed
out Morrow.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, Aug. 10 (CNA): The possibility of Megawati Sukarnoputri
becoming the next president of Indonesia are doubtful due to
vote-buying by the incumbent head of state, according to one of her
advisers.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Jakarta, the Australian on Tuesday quoted Kwik
Kian Gie as revealing that the PDI-P was "not very confident that
Megawati will be elected (president)."</P>
      <P>Kwik, who is expected to have a Cabinet position if Megawati is
elected to the presidency in November, said "money politics" could
see incumbent B.J. Habibie returned as president.</P>
      <P>Despite her recent victory in the general election by winning 34
percent of the votes, assuring her the front-runner spot in the
November presidential election, Megawati will face the 700-member
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR). Her PDI-P and its alliances
have only 257 votes while the ruling Golkar party could grab 405
votes in the MPR, Kwik said.</P>
      <P>Kwik warned that if Habibie won the presidential election, there
would be "enormous chaos." Student organizations and other opposition
groups have warned that they will take their protests to the streets
if he remains president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MAGAZINE CALLS FOR FIRM CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)
(By Peter Chen)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 9 (CNA): The United States can engage in a
scholastic debate about the misguided "one China" policy later, but
Washington must now embark on a firm policy of deterrent to preserve
peace across the Taiwan Straits, wrote an American political magazine
in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard said in its editorial titled "Peace Through
Strength" that journalists and China watchers have written off the
PRC's seizure of a Taiwanese freighter, its launching military
aircraft on hundreds of sorties over the Taiwan Straits, test-firing
a ground-to-ground ballistic missile with a range of 5,000 miles, and
conducting military exercises in Fujian province as the usual Beijing
bluster, provoked by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's declaration that
mainland China and Taiwan must negotiate as one state to another.</P>
      <P>And China experts are hoping that Communist China, in
the interest of preserving US-PRC relations will not step up the
military confrontation with Taiwan. The Clinton administration, or at
least most of the Clinton administration, seems to be operating on
the basis of this hope as well, added the editorial.</P>
      <P>But the magazine pointed out that "This hopefulness
is dangerously misguided. The current Chinese military activities may
not be mere gestures designed to intimidate Taiwan (and us). They may
well be the opening phase of a serious military confrontation, one
that could culminate in the coming weeks or months in some form of
attack -- probably not on Taiwan itself but against the tiny islands
of Matsu or Kinmen."</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration, probably unwittingly, has given a
yellow light to the Communist Chinese to take some kind of action,
because Clinton officials have declared that the United States is in
fundamental agreement with Beijing's position that President Lee
Teng-hui's statements are unacceptable and provocative, noted the
editorial.</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard said Lee's most recent statements are far
more significant than his trip to Cornell University. If the Beijing
leadership wants to make a strong statement this time, one that will
really frighten the Taiwanese electorate before it goes to the polls
to elect a new president next March, then it will have to undertake a
military action that goes beyond missile tests.</P>
      <P>The PRC does not now have the capability to launch a full-scale
invasion of Taiwan, but it does have more than enough capability to
invade and seize Matsu or Kinmen. It could launch missile strikes
against them, or it might simply set up a naval blockade around the
islands, opined the magazine.</P>
      <P>The editorial went on to say that any of these options
is plausible, but the last one strikes it as potentially most
attractive to the Communist Chinese. And blockade of Matsu or Kinmen
would present the Clinton administration with this choice: Either
send the Seventh Fleet to break the blockade, or acquiesce in Chinese
aggression against Taiwan and accept the consequences of allowing
Beijing to set such a precedent, with all it would mean both for the
future of Taiwan and for the US position in East Asia generally.</P>
      <P>The right-wing magazine said it hopes that the Clinton
administration will choose the first course, but it strongly
suspect, as may the Communist Chinese, that the administration would
back down and desperately seek a negotiated solution to the crisis.</P>
      <P>The fact that the PRC and the United States would be continuing
to talk about Beijing's entry into the WTO, that President Bill
Clinton and President Jiang Zemin would be meeting, and that
relations between Beijing and Washington would appear in all other
respects to be on the mend would only make it more likely that the
Clinton administration would refrain from decisive action that might
disrupt this "progress."</P>
      <P>And it would reinforce the point the Communist Chinese want to
make: that the United States should care, and does care, more about
preserving good ties with the PRC than about defending Taiwan, noted
the editorial.</P>
      <P>But The Weekly Standard said "We hope we are wrong. We hope the
Chinese seizure of the Taiwanese freighter is not, in fact, the first
step toward a total blockade. But the scenario we have outlined seems
sufficiently plausible to require immediate action by the American
government. To avoid the Hob son's choice a Chinese blockade or attack
on Matsu or Kinmen might present, the United States must now embark
on a firm policy of deterrent."</P>

      <P>Canberra, Aug. 10 (CNA): Australia's economy is showing signs of
mixed figures with housing starts falling while employment rises.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Statistics on Monday released figures
showing a 3.2 percent drop in housing finance approvals during June,
including a fall in finance for the important new-construction
category. Housing is one of major drivers of economic growth in
Australia.</P>
      <P>But the Job Advertisements series compiled by the Australian New
Zealand Banking Group showed a rise of 2.6 percent in July to its
highest level in almost a decade, suggesting strong employment growth
and an unemployment rate below 7 percent by September.</P>
      <P>Treasury believes recent weak economic figures could be the first
signs of a slowdown in the country's economy, and it is doggedly
sticking to its conservative 3 percent growth forecast for the
current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US APPEASEMENT SEEN ONLY MAKING CHINA MORE AGGRESSIVE AND DANGEROUS</HEADLINE>

      <P>Canberra, Aug. 10 (CNA): US appeasement towards mainland China
has only made Beijing more aggressive and dangerous, and unless
Washington draws a clear line, the challenge will only grow more
dangerous, an American columnist warns.</P>
      <P>In his article headlined: "US in sweet and sour relationship
with China" published on the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday,
Charles Krauthammer, a columnist with the Washington Post Writers
Group, said: "The Clinton administration's China grovel has gone from
merely embarrassing to potentially dangerous. The past two months of
our relationship with China are a chronicle of appeasement that has,
predictably, made things worse."
 ** The U.S. appeasement started from President Bill Clinton
offering five public apologies and a compensation of US$3 million
after the accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia;
 ** U.S. repeatedly berating Taiwan and demanding for a retraction
of President Lee Teng-hui's statement of "a special state-to-state"
relationship with China;
 Krauthammer said it would be one thing if this obsequious
attempt to placate China worked. But look at how China responds:
 ** It organizes massive anti-US demonstrations over the embassy
bombing, leading to the stoning of the US embassy in Beijing. (The
US ambassador responds in perfect Clintonesque tone: "Clearly this
is going to make the road a little rockier to stabilizing the
relationship between China and the United States.)
 ** It seizes a Taiwanese ship near the island of Matsu (last
heard from in the John F. Kennedy-Richard Nixon debates in 1960),
accusing its crew of "smuggling."
 ** It flies more than 100 menacing military sorties over the Taiwan
Strait.
 ** It denies the United States landing rights for military
planes in Hong Kong.
 ** It launches an intercontinental ballistic missile with
range designed to reach the United States.</P>
      <P>** It sentences two human rights activists to long prison terms.</P>
      <P>** It launches a massive crackdown on the Falun Gong sect, a
peaceful semi-mystical movement in China that the regime has decided
to eradicate.</P>
      <P>"Most ominous is the manner in which the crackdown is carried
out. The sect is being persecuted in classic high-Maoist fashion:
State TV launches an incessant, vitriolic propaganda campaign. Sect
members are arrested and sent en masse to 're-education' schools.
Sect leaders are forced into giving public confessions," Krauthammer
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that globalization does not change China because its
economic freedom has not led to its political freedom.</P>
      <P>"But there is nothing inevitable in history. We had several
mid-20th century cases of vicious fascist dictatorships running
non-socialist, relatively free economies. Which is what we have in
China today: a ruthless party dictatorship, communist in name only,
savagely bent on maintaining power against all opposition," he said.
 "The Clinton administration seems totally wedded to the notion
that as long as it keeps feeding the Chinese economy and propping up
our much-touted 'strategic partnership', it will soften China's
internal repression. That is no more true than that US appeasement
is softening China's external aggressiveness," he said.
 "The Chinese know how pliant Clinton is and how far he will go to
keep trade relations humming. That has emboldened them to openly
challenge both the US 'hegemony' and its Taiwanese client," he said.</P>
      <P>"Unless Clinton draws a clear line across the Taiwan Strait, the
challenge will only grow more dangerous," he warned.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is expected to send
officials to Beijing to discuss the human rights situation in China.</P>
      <P>Human rights analysts are critical of the Australian initiative
because it may not improve China's human rights records of abuses and
repression. Instead, such talks could encourage China to be more
repressive and aggressive in its crackdown on dissidents and even the
Falun Gong sect, they said.</P>
      <P>They said Australia is losing its traditional courage to speak

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS LOCK HORNS OVER TAIWAN HIGH-SPEED RAIL PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the ruling and opposition
parties locked horns on Tuesday over financing problems surrounding
the high-speed rail project.</P>
      <P>The members of the Legislative Transportation Committee heard a
report delivered by officials at the office of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) has threatened to
terminate its contract with the government on Aug. 16 if financing
issues cannot be resolved by then.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen Gun-teh, legislator from the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), demanded during the meeting that the MOTC not make
any further concessions. Meanwhile, a lawmaker from the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) supported the THSRC's stance.</P>
      <P>THSRC CEO Nita Ing has made her company's position clear to the
government.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the company wants to have its business tax lowered from
5 percent, the figure mandated under law, to 2 percent.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the THSRC wants 1.5 percentage points to be the maximum
banks are allowed to charge, instead of the minimum as previously
agreed, above their costs.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the THSRC is pushing for flexibility in regard to the
total amount of financing the company must provide. Under the current
contract, it is obligated to raise NT$280 billion. The company is now
suggesting that capital raised in the form of corporate bonds should
be allowed to count against their financing targets.</P>
      <P>Chung Ching-chiang, a legislator from the DPP, said that the
government should be well prepared to deal with the island's first
and most ambitious infrastructure project. The railway is being built
under the build-operate-transfer formula, whereby a private
consortium builds and operates the system for a specified period of
time, and after that period control is transferred to the government.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Fong-cheng said
that he has done his best to assist the THSRC in resolving its
critical financing problem.</P>
      <P>As long as a compromise can be reached among the MOTC, the THSRC
and the banking consortium that will provide the financing, noted
Lin, the high-speed rail contract will not be scrapped.</P>
      <P>Even if the THSRC wants to terminate the contract, the contract
cannot be terminated unilaterally. The termination must follow a
certain procedure, said Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SHOULD NOT BE PRESSURED TO NEGOTIATE UNTIL MAINLAND DEMOCRATIZES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential US congressman said here on
Tuesday that the Republic of China on Taiwan should not be pressured
to negotiate a reunification until mainland China is a democracy.</P>
      <P>Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, made the remarks in a press
release issued at the end of a two-day visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Gilman said he and his bipartisan House delegation strongly
support democratically-elected ROC President Lee Teng-hui's right to
address Taipei's views of the cross-Taiwan Strait relationship.</P>
      <P>"It is our view that the two sides should engage in a dialogue
as equals," the press statement said, adding that: "President Lee
should not feel pressured to negotiate until China is a democracy, to
negotiate a reunification until such time."</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taipei, Gilman and his colleagues had met
with President Lee, Vice President Lien Chan, National
Security Council Secretary-General Yin chung-wen, Defense Minister
Tang Fei and several other senior officials for candid exchanges of
views on important issues confronting Taiwan at the moment.</P>
      <P>"Our extensive discussions we feel were highly productive and
they also helped us and enhanced our understanding of President
Lee's decision on cross-strait relations and Taiwan's hope for the
future," the press statement said.</P>
      <P>During those meetings, the delegation has expressed the
United States' abiding interest in peace and stability in East Asia
and for the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>"We expressed our concern about Chinese 'saber-rattling' over
President Lee's state-to-state remarks and its effect on the
confidence and security-building in the region," the press release
said, adding: "As we leave Taiwan, we are calling upon the PRC to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The US lawmakers also expressed their belief that Taiwan should
have better representation in international bodies and be recognized
in those bodies. "The 22 million people of Taiwan deserve this
fundamental right no less than any other global citizen."</P>
      <P>The press statement further said the delegation hopes its visit
has in some way strengthened long-standing bonds of friendship
between the United States and Taiwan -- a relationship which is
based on their shared commitment to democracy, to freedom, to
respect for human rights and for a market economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Gilman also said at a pre-departure news conference
that he hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will resume
dialogue this year.</P>
      <P>Gilman further said he fully understands that President Lee has
faced up to the reality while defining cross-strait relations as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in an interview with Germany's
Deutsche Welle radio station on July 9.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the first stop of the US House delegation's two-week
fact-finding visit to East and Southeast Asia.</P>

percent, effective Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MCDONALD'S BREAKS NO LAWS BY SELLING TOY KITTY: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fast-food giant McDonald's has broken
no laws by selling "Hello Kitty" toys, as its business license
permits the company to sell both fast-food and promotional items,
said officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Kun-liang, director-general of the MOEA's Commerce Department
made the statement in response to an independent legislator's
question over whether the fast-food company is entitled to sell
products other than food.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Chiu Chuang-liang, from Taoyuan County,
held a press conference on Tuesday to question McDonald's selling of
the toy.</P>
      <P>Chiu accused the company of violating business regulations by
selling the toy, which can be bought for NT$69 with a set meal or for
NT$119 separately.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said that when McDonald's sought to enter the
Taiwan market, it applied to the MOEA for a business license allowing
it to give away free gifts and to sell promotional goods.
Consequently, McDonald's decision to sell the toy with or without an
accompanying meal does not violate the law, officials said.</P>
      <P>Officials added, however, that McDonald's chains around the
island should apply to their respective local governments for
licenses to sell promotional goods. If they fail to do so, local
governments are entitled to take proper measures against McDonald's,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Any companies violating business registration regulations by
selling unauthorized goods will be fined up to NT$15,000.</P>
      <P>The MOEA will require all local governments to determine whether
the company's branches have applied for licenses permitting the sale
of promotional goods.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE KOALAS BECOME HONORARY CITIZENS OF TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou announced on
Tuesday that the two highly treasured Australian koala bears donated
by Australia to Taipei City Zoo have become the city's honorary
citizens.</P>
      <P>Ma also said the two male koala bears, named Hellai and
Patrick, will make their first formal public appearance here on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The two two-year-old koalas arrived in Taipei on July 31. They
have smoothly passed quarantine and inspection and have adapted
themselves well to living conditions at their new home at Taipei City
Zoo.</P>
      <P>"Barring unexpected development, the two koalas will be on public
display starting this weekend," Ma said.</P>
      <P>As koala bears, which rank among the endangered species needing
special protection, spend 19 hours sleeping per day, they have not
yet got fully familiar with their new living environment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Ma unveiled a set of regulations for local people to
follow when they visit the city zoo this weekend.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, visitors should not tap the glass
wall errected to protect the koalas, should not use flashlights,
should not throw any article into the koala bears showground, should
not feed them any foodstuffs and shoul not make any noise.</P>
      <P>Noting that the introduction of koalas is mainly aimed at
inspiring local people's support for wildlife conservation, Ma
urged local people to exercise restraint and strictly abide by
the regulations when they visit the zoo.</P>
      <P>Zoo officials said the two koalas' appetite has remained normal
over the past week. "By Aug. 7, Hellai's body weight remained at 6.7
kilograms, same as that recorded on its arrival day, while Patrick's
was 0.25 kg higher than its original level," said a zoo official.</P>
      <P>In connection with the upcoming public display of the two
koalas, the city zoo has opened a website on the Internet to provide
information and enlist public support for wildlife conservation and
environmental protection. The website address is
"http://www.koala.taipei.gov.tw".</P>
      <P>A variety of souvenirs featuring koala themes will be sold at
the city zoo from Saturday.</P>
      <P>"We hope the two koala bears will inspire a craze comparable to
the Hello Kitty mania which is now sweeping Japan, Hong Kong and
Taiwan," said a zoo official.</P>
      <P>The city zoo has planted 6,000 eucalyptus trees, the staple food
for koalas. Zoo officials said they are happy to see the two koalas
show high interest in Taiwan-grown eucalyptus leaves.</P>

Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport had his sentence reduced
from one year to 10 months' imprisonment on Tuesday by the Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office in
the Philippines assured the Philippine government Tuesday that it
will not pull out its multi-billion-dollar investments here amid
speculations of possible retaliation for the suspension of an air
agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In a media interview, Chan Hsien-ching, an official
representative from Taiwan, expressed confidence that the problem
would soon be resolved.</P>
      <P>Chan said there is no indication that Taiwan will do something to
sever its bilateral relations with the Philippines as a result of the
suspension of the air agreement.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese public, however, has called for a response to the
Philippines' order for ROC airlines to stop sending aircraft into the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, he said, has worked to calm its public down as
negotiations between the two countries have taken place.</P>
      <P>Chan also discounted reports that Taiwan will send back a large
number of Filipino workers there if Manila does not allow the
resumption of flights by commercial airlines to Philippine
destinations.</P>
      <P>The imbroglio happened after the Philippine government recently
suspended the air agreement, which allowed China Airlines and Eva
Air, to pick up passengers from and deliver them to the Philippines.
The suspension came after the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) noticed
that the airlines had violated some provisions in the air agreement
to the detriment of the country's flag-carrier's business interests.</P>
      <P>Chan said Taiwan would continue to negotiate until a compromise
is reached.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND WARNS TAIWAN OF BEIJING'S INFORMATION WAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the deteriorating relations between
Taiwan and mainland China, the Republic of China's Ministry of
National Defense (MND) has warned the people of Taiwan of Beijing's
"information war."</P>
      <P>The MND urged people to stay confident but remain on high alert
in the face of the "Internet War" which has broken out across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MND's remarks come as tension between the two sides of the
strait remains high following President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition
of Taiwan-mainland ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" in
a July 9 interview with the Germany-based Deutche Welle radio
station.</P>
      <P>In addition to verbal attacks and military intimidation, ranking
MND officials said mainland China is also waging a propaganda war by
spreading groundless rumors through the media and the Internet to
erode Taiwan's confidence, evident in the dozen government-run
websites which have been infiltrated by mainland-based hackers who
replaced the original data with pro-Beijing propaganda.</P>
      <P>According to National Defense Minister Tang Fei, mainland China
has kicked off a comprehensive campaign to develop its hi-tech
military technology, as Beijing has realized that its conventional
military strength will not be any match for that of the United States
within the next 20 years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Beijing is also deeply worried about the
progress of Taiwan's computer industry, prompting it to pay special
heed to the "information war," Tang added.</P>
      <P>Although the definition of "information warfare" remains in
dispute, ranking MND officials said it is widely agreed that the term
refers to any move which uses computer technology, either to protect
one's own data or deface that of the enemy. Computer virus
propagation is just one of the techniques which can be used, they
noted.</P>
      <P>However, the officials pointed out that mainland China's
information war against Taiwan has not yet fully matured, and is
limited to "psychological warfare" at present.</P>
      <P>In light of the vehement campaign by the mainland against Taiwan,
the officials said the MND has erected a string of "firewalls" to
prevent domestic websites and networks from being damaged by
malicious hackers.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MND has already set up a task force to assess
the technological aspects of information warfare and work out
training programs to address new warfare patterns, the officials
revealed, adding that the Republic of China military is also seeking
to acquire long-range early warning radar systems and satellites, and
will establish an information war unit by 2000.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the extent of the current information war
already surpasses the jurisdiction of military affairs and requires
the participation of different sectors, the MND officials urged the
government to establish a supra-ministerial organization to take
charge of its study and research.</P>
      <P>They stressed that the setting up of such an organization is a
serious task which the government will have to face sooner or later.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The self-dubbed "Chinese hacker" who
attacked the website of the Control Yuan on Saturday might be a local
person rather than a mainland Chinese, and investigators have already
closed in on a suspect, a local evening daily said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Investigators probing the case in which the homepage of the
Control Yuan's website was replaced with a map of mainland China and
an announcement that "there is only one China and only one China is
needed," have suspected all along that it was an "inside job," and
have narrowed their investigation to a university student in central
Taiwan, according to the China Times Express.</P>
      <P>A source from the computer crime center under the Criminal
Investigation Bureau said that police have tracked the hacker by
traces he left on network, and are set to launch a search, according
to the paper.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsiao-bin, the prosecutor at the Taipei District
Prosecutor's Office who is heading the investigation, said that
anyone who breaks into the websites of government agencies and alters
their contents will be charged with destroying government documents,
a crime punishable by up to seven years in prison.</P>
      <P>If the attacker has stolen "classified" information from the
websites and resold it for profit, other charges could be filed, said
Chang, without elaborating on how "classified" information could come
to be placed on a public document in the first place.</P>
      <P>The website attack, which has unleashed a wave of counterattacks
from Taiwan hackers on websites operated by mainland Chinese
government agencies in retaliation, has drawn attention to the
security, or lack thereof, of websites.</P>
      <P>A non-profit information promotion organization, the Institute
for Information Industry, on Tuesday set up a network security panel
which will provide free security information to website owners.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an intelligence officer from the Ministry of National
Defense cautioned on Tuesday that there might be military purposes
behind the hackers' attacks.</P>
      <P>Describing the attacks a form of unconventional warfare, Maj.
Gen. Hu Yuan-chieh, director of the office of the vice defense
minister for intelligence affairs, said that the ministry has a set
of security measures to protect its computer network, which is not
linked to the Internet and is almost impossible to break into.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Tuesday
inaugurated Asia's first flight recorder laboratory, allowing local
personnel to analyze aircraft flight recorder (black box) data rather
than having to send such data to a third country for analysis.</P>
      <P>Weng Cheng-yi, chairman of the Flight Security Committee of the
Executive Yuan, said that in the past, the first step of an aircraft
accident investigation was to send the black box to the United States
or Australia for analysis.</P>
      <P>However, because of language and cultural differences, the
results then had to be sent to Taiwan for further analysis, which
made the investigative process very inconvenient. The decision to set
up a local flight recorder laboratory was made last year in the wake
of a China Airlines crash at Taoyuan, the country's worst-ever air
disaster.</P>
      <P>The laboratory can read and analyze the cockpit voice recorder
and the flight information recorder, which will shorten the
investigative process and also help flight security education and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) will buy 13
B747-400 cargo planes from Boeing Co. of the United States and 13
passenger jets from France's Airbus Industrie, sources close to CAL
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The sources said Fred Howard, head of Boeing's operation in Asia,
will arrive in Taipei on Tuesday for the signing of a procurement
agreement with CAL.</P>
      <P>Public Relations personnel of Boeing's headquarters arrived in
Taipei on Monday, and have spent their time with CAL officials
preparing for the signing scheduled to take place on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The cost of the 13 cargo planes procured from Boeing is estimated
at US$2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, John Leahy, senior deputy chief of Airbus Industrie,
is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Wednesday, and will sign a plane
procurement agreement with CAL on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CAL had originally planned to buy all 26 planes from Boeing, but
changed its plan and decided to buy the passenger planes from Airbus
Industrie instead.</P>
      <P>The change of decision shocked Boeing and it was reported that
the US government thought CAL made the change because Taiwan was not
satisfied with the US attitude toward the "special state-to-state"
theory on cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>US Sen. Slade Gorton from Washington State arrived in Taipei on
Monday to meet President Lee Teng-hui and Transportation and
Communications Minister Lin Feng-cheng to try to find out more about
CAL's change of plans, whereupon it was pointed out the deal is
purely commercial in nature and has no political implications.</P>
      <P>Although the procurement plan has not yet been formally approved
by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Lin has said
his ministry will respect CAL's decision and will not oppose the
signing. However, the deals will not become effective until the
approval has been granted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC JET FIGHTERS TWICE CROSS TAIWAN STRAIT CENTER LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese jet fighters twice crossed
the center line of the Taiwan Strait in late July, but with no
apparent hostile intent, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
revealed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MND spokesman's office said the first incident occurred on
July 25 when two indigenous Jian-8 fighters crossed the dividing line
and penetrated five kilometers into Republic of China airspace, while
the second took place on July 30 when two Jian-7s penetrated about 10
kilometers into local territory.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the planes crossed the line, the spokesman's office
noted, they corrected their routes and returned to the west side of
the center line.</P>
      <P>Over the past few weeks, mainland China has been waging a war of
nerves against Taiwan to protest President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a "special
state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>The MND also said that no unusual movements of People's
Liberation Army (PLA) troops along the coastal provinces of mainland
China have been noticed, and that there are no signs that a
large-scale PLA military maneuver is to be held.</P>
      <P>But a ranking MND officer confirmed that advanced Su-27 jet
fighters stationed in Guangdong Province have begun training
activities in areas close to the center line of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the MND, no significant increase in PLA power has
been seen in the Fujian area, with the exception of the deployment of
eight Jian-8s at Fuzhou airbase.</P>
      <P>At present, the MND said, about 150 mainland Chinese aircraft are
stationed in Fujian's coastal areas, with Jian-7s and Jian-8s
increasing their patrol flights from Fuzhou and Longxi airbases.</P>
      <P>The MND urged mainland China to exercise self-restraint in its
jet fighter training, pointing out that about 340 international
flights and 730 domestic flights fly over the Taiwan Strait every
day.</P>
      <P>In response to the increased mainland air activity, the MND said,
the basic principles of the ROC armed forces are to avoid
provocation and minimize the risk of hostility.</P>
      <P>It expressed the hope that the Taiwan people and media will stop
speculating on mainland military activities so as to prevent the
island's stability and economic development from being harmed.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The more publicity caused by Taiwan's claim
of "state-to-state ties" with Beijing the better, President Lee
Teng-hui said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a pep talk to a group of middle-rank officials, the president,
who made the "special state-to-state relationship" remark on July 9,
said that the more international attention his statement receives,
the more understanding of the Republic of China's plight the world
will be able to obtain.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with less than one year left in office, he wanted
to clearly define the status of cross-strait relations before
stepping down, in order to ensure a smooth course in dealing with
Beijing for his successor.</P>
      <P>"We do not advocate Taiwan independence, but the status of a
sovereign state which is vital to the national survival and
development cannot be compromised," said Lee.</P>
      <P>What has gone, he went on, is the policy of "reclaiming mainland
China by force" which was the war cry espoused by previous ROC
presidents.</P>
      <P>Instead, the government wants to transform the Beijing regime by
spreading Taiwan's experience of democratization to mainland China
and set the stage for national reunification, said Lee.</P>
      <P>He stressed the importance of strengthening the island's
defenses, citing as proof the reports of increased military movements
which have been rife since Lee made his statement and
have sparked a nose-dive in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>However, Lee dismissed as "exaggeration" reports that Beijing's
jet fighters, in saber-rattling gestures, have flown sorties across
the central line of the Taiwan Strait which separates Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Only two Beijing aircraft have been detected flying near the
central line, one coming within ten kilometers of it and the other
within five kilometers," he said, adding that he considered the
near-intrusion into Taiwan airspace as an inadvertent accident due to
the high speed of the aircraft and the fact that the center line is
imaginary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL TO SIGN PURCHASE CONTRACTS WITH BOEING AND AIRBUS</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) is scheduled

Wednesday, and 14 passenger jets from European consortium Airbus

      <P>Boeing's Asian region president Fred Howard arrived in Taiwan on

    <HEADLINE>US NEWSPAPER SAYS SEVENTH FLEET PREPARING FOR DUTY IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon and sailors of the United
States' Seventh Fleet are watching the Taiwan Strait, but they must
be hoping they will never have to choose between mainland China and
Taiwan in the event of a military conflict.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, that scenario appears to be growing ever less
likely, according to an American newspaper report.</P>
      <P>The Pacific Star and Stripes reported Tuesday from Tokyo that as
tensions escalate in the Taiwan Strait, members of the Seventh Fleet
watch, knowing they could be sent in as they were three years ago to
prevent a violent takeover of Taiwan by mainland China.</P>
      <P>The newspaper noted that as much as the United States claims to
be committed to the "one China" policy, it was the Seventh Fleet,
sent by President Harry Truman, that prevented the communists from
rolling over the island that the Nationalists retreated to a half
century ago.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the report said, it was also to mainland China's
great benefit that the communists did not take Taiwan in 1950, as
Taiwanese are now among the top investors in the mainland. "There is
little reason to believe Taiwan wouldn't be a struggling backwater
like most of China if it had not been separate for this half
century," it added.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's leaders, of course, see control of the island as
their sovereign right. They are also suspicious of US motives and
intentions, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>The paper cited a passage from the book "China Wakes," by New
York Times writers Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, in which a
classified mainland Chinese document in 1993 warned that "because of
(the United States') political, economic and security interests, it
is in America's best interest to preserve the situation in the Taiwan
Straits as it is, with Taiwan remaining indefinitely as an
independent entity."</P>

      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) has issued a letter to its Beijing counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), asking it
to guarantee the personal safety of a detained Republic of China
national, a SEF official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chien-shih, president of a local security service company

    <HEADLINE>ANALYST SEES CHANGES TO MAINLAND'S 'THEORY OF NUCLEAR DETERRENCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Toronto-based military expert warned
Tuesday that mainland China may have changed its "theory of nuclear
deterrence" so significantly that a nuclear war between Taiwan and
China can no longer be thought of as pure fiction.</P>
      <P>Pinkov revealed his analysis in the Tuesday edition of the Kanwa
News, saying that for mainland China, the function of nuclear
deterrence is to safeguard territorial sovereignty, to contain the
United States from becoming involved in the Taiwan issue through
conventional warfare and to retaliate against a US nuclear attack.</P>
      <P>Mainland China may have copied the new military theory that
Russia proposed in 1993 and has, in fact, given up its promise of
"taking no initiative in using nuclear weapons," Pinkov said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Western military observers generally believe
that mainland China's announcement of possessing the technology to
make neutron bombs and small tactical nuclear weapons at an
appropriate time implies a deterrent to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the announcement, several mainland Chinese
government-run military publications, including the Naval and
Merchant Ship and National Defense Paper, confirmed the view both
directly and indirectly, stressing that this announcement dealt a
blow to Taiwan independence advocates. The Naval and Merchant Ship
directly stated that the best way to destroy enemy planes on the
ground and enemy ships at naval ports is to use tactical nuclear
weapons.</P>
      <P>"This new movement of China marks a possible conceptual
breakthrough in the 'nuclear deterrence' theory of China and it has
actually given up the policy of 'taking no initiative in using
nuclear weapons under any circumstances,'" he wrote.</P>
      <P>That is to say that the new theory of nuclear deterrence has gone
beyond the traditional definition of "nuclear deterrence" to prevent
nuclear war, he said. In fact, nuclear deterrence now plays the role
of preventing conventional wars from breaking out, he said.

    <HEADLINE>LEE'S WORDS SIMPLY REFLECT REALITY: TORONTO STAR ARTICLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's largest-circulation newspaper, The
Toronto Star, carried an article Tuesday by the spokesman for the
government of the Republic of China stating that President Lee
Teng-hui's controversial remarks about "special state-to-state
relationship" with mainland China simply reflect reality.</P>
      <P>"It does not signal a change in Taiwan's mainland policy," said
Chen Chien-jen. The Star referred to Chen as "the director general of
the government information office for the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>He noted that Lee's reference to a "special state-to-state
relationship" is just a straightforward summary of the current
situation and demonstrates pragmatism, continuity of policy and
innovation.</P>
      <P>Chen quoted ROC Premier Vincent Siew as saying, "Our policy of
promoting constructive dialogue and positive exchanges remains
unchanged; our resolve to pursue a win-win situation in cross-strait
relations remains unchanged; and our goal for a peaceful, democratic
and a united new China in the future remains unchanged."</P>
      <P>Pretending that the ROC has not existed for the past 50 years or
that it has not exercised effective jurisdiction over the Taiwan area
has only emboldened those in Beijing intent on intimidation and
military adventurism, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing has grown increasingly intolerant of any
legitimate action in the international community on the part of the
ROC government, no matter how minor, that does not accord with its
own hard-line shift toward defining the term "one China" to mean the
mainland itself.</P>
      <P>There is a real need to clarify Taiwan's status with respect to
mainland China before the visit to Taiwan by mainland China's
emissary for cross-strait dialogue scheduled for this autumn, the
spokesman said.</P>

      <P>The United States on Tuesday again
urged both sides of the Taiwan Strait to exercise restraint and not
take actions or make statements that make meaningful and substantive
dialogue more difficult, and to resolve their differences in a
peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui's televised statement about mainland Chinese Air Force jets
crossing strait lines, US Department of State spokesman James Rubin
told a regular briefing that for some time now, the United States has
been monitoring the situation over the Taiwan Strait very closely.</P>
      <P>"We are aware that recently a number of sorties have been flown
by both China and Taiwan military aircraft in the Taiwan Straits. Any
time you have military aircraft flying this close to each other,
there is a need for and appropriate for there to be concern about
accidents," said Rubin.</P>
      <P>"We have repeatedly stated, both to Taiwan and China, that it is
not beneficial for either side to take steps that increase tensions
across the Taiwan Straits. We continue to urge both sides to exercise
restraint and not take actions or make statements that make
meaningful and substantive dialogue more difficult, and to resolve
their differences in peaceful manner," he said.</P>
      <P>As to New York Republican Congressman Benjamin Gilman's statement
that he supports Taiwan's position on "special state-to-state
relations" with mainland China, Rubin said a House delegation led by
Rep. Gilman is in Taiwan and will meet with President Lee and others.</P>
      <P>"They will speak for themselves, as members of Congress do, and
it will be up to them to describe their own views. We certainly
didn't ask the members to convey a message on our behalf," stressed
Rubin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK DENIES ENTRY TO FORMER MAC CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) has officially rejected former Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh's visa application amid
continued tensions between both sides of the Taiwan Strait, sources
revealed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang was invited to attend an academic conference at the
University of Hong Kong, where he was scheduled to jointly chair the
opening ceremony on Thursday with Ip Kwok-wah, special assistant to
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Fung, general education coordinator for the university,
confirmed to CNA that Hong Kong immigration officials notified him
Monday that Chang's visa request had been denied.</P>
      <P>Fung said the conference, slated to take place on Thursday and
Friday evenings, originally invited specialists from Taiwan, Hong
Kong and mainland China to address the topic of China's
reunification, with university students from Hong Kong, Beijing and
the United States attending as well.</P>
      <P>Because Chang is not able to take part, however, the first day's
seminar had to be canceled at the last minute, Fung said. He added
that this was regrettable, as this would have been a rare opportunity
for experts from three sides to discuss the reunification issue.</P>
      <P>Due to tense relations between both sides of the strait, Fung
said that if the "central government" has instructed the HKSAR to bar
the former MAC chairman's entry, he has "nothing to say."</P>
      <P>But if it were the special administrative region's own decision,
it is another matter, he said. He pointed out that Hong Kong is a
"special region" that can play an intermediary role in private
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he added, Chang has already retired from his government
post, which means his status should not be a matter of sensitivity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   August   11   (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local health offices under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health has conducted overall islandwide
inspections of the selling of drugs and foods, and it found 61
violations of health food regulations implemented last Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is known that 231 violations of various food and
pharmaceutical regulations were recorded among the 2,492 stores
inspected. Of that number 136 violations were of food hygiene
regulations and 41 were of pharmaceutical regulations. The
inspections have been conducted for one week, and most violations
were found in Taipei City, where 77 violations were recorded.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Food Sanitation under the Department of Health
pointed out that all health offices have mobilized related personnel
to inspect pharmacies, weight-loss centers and exclusive shops
selling products appearing on TV shopping channels.</P>
      <P>In addition, the inspections also covered ads in newspapers as
well as commercials on TV.</P>
      <P>Deputy Director of the Bureau Chen Lu-hung said that during the
inspection process, it was found that most store proprietors had
unloaded unlawful products from their shelves in advance of the
inspections and that some labels and ads had been changed or modified
as well.</P>
      <P>Some 90 percent of foods inspected were found to be within
related regulations, and most violations were related to food labeled
as "healthy" or whose healthful effects were exaggerated.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed that the inspections will be conducted
continuously. In order to ensure the public's interest and health,
store keepers must obey the laws and sell legal products.</P>
      <P>According to the inspection results, no violations were found in
several areas, including Taipei County, Chilung City, Nantou County
and Yuanlin County. The bureau, however, will continue to examine

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI URGED TO FILE INTERNATIONAL LAWSUIT ON NAME ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers urged the Republic of
China government on Wednesday to file an international lawsuit
against mainland China's use of the name "Taiwan" on its websites.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan, Cheng Pao-chin
and Yeh Yi-chin, lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, asked the government to take international court action within
a week to bring global attention to the Taiwan situation.</P>
      <P>Echoing remarks made a day earlier by President Lee Teng-hui that
the more international publicity arising from his "special
state-to-state relationship" theory on Taiwan's ties with mainland
China the better, they asserted that the mainland's Xinhua News
Agency's inclusion of a "Taiwan.com" Internet domain name on the home
page of its "China.com" website forms part of Beijing's efforts to
treat Taiwan as one of its provinces.</P>
      <P>The state-run news agency's "China.com" has also set up a company
in Taiwan to operate its "Taiwan.com," which they said is an apparent
attempt by Beijing to achieve its "one country, two systems"
unification goal with Taiwan by misleading the public, according to
the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, they said, the government should file a lawsuit
against Xinhua to fully protect what they called its "legal right" to
the name of "Taiwan.com" and allow the international community to
understand that Taiwan is not a part of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Turning to the Taiwan-based Xinhua-run firm, the lawmakers also
urged the government to carry out a thorough investigation to probe
the role of mainland Chinese capital in the company. They added that
this demand has been endorsed by 101 other lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Y.C. Chen, a lawyer who also attended the news conference,
claimed that under the US' Taiwan Relations Act, which is
Washington's policy framework governing its dealings with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic links between the two sides, Taiwan
is effectively a de facto independent country.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he went on, it should be feasible to
peacefully settle the cross-Taiwan Strait "information war" by
lodging a complaint with the US Federal Court and allowing it to
handle the dispute.</P>
      <P>C.C. Hsiu, a computer science professor at National Taiwan
University (NTU), warned that relevant government authorities must
take precautions against Beijing's spreading of propaganda through
its "Taiwan.com" website, although the website at present provides
only tourist and entertainment information.</P>
      <P>Y.C. Yang, another NTU professor, criticized the government for
moving "too slowly" in setting up a national website network of its
own.</P>
      <P>Blaming the government for lacking a forward-looking view in this
field, he urged the authorities to seriously look into the issue to
prevent Taiwan-based websites from being dominated by mainland China.</P>

      <P>Likening herself to a "mother" of the
East Timorese, Indonesian presidential front-runner Megawati
Sukarnoputri has urged all the people of the former Portuguese colony
to stay Indonesian ahead of the Aug. 30 ballot on the future of the
territory.</P>
      <P>"East Timorese should have confidence and dignity to choose what
is best for them and do not let anyone interfere to separate East
Timor from Indonesia," she told a crowd of 500 mainly male supporters
in a dilapidated sports stadium at the end of her two-day visit to
Dili and other cities on Tuesday, The Sydney Morning Herald reported
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"When I was chosen leader of the PDI-P ... at one special party
congress one of them members came up to me and said, 'We want to vote
for you so please do not leave us.' So that is why I am not going to
leave you. I love the people of East Timor," she said. Megawati made
her emotional plea to the Timorese before heading home to Jakarta.</P>
      <P>But East Timorese Nobel laureate, Bishop Carlos Belo, publicly
appealed to Megawati to respect the outcome of the Aug. 30 referendum
on self-determination. His appeal followed a short meeting with the
PDI-P leader.</P>
      <P>Asked what her response would be if East Timor voted for
independence, Megawati replied: "We'll see at the MPR (People's

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SET TO LOWER BUSINESS TAX SHARPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is set to lower its business
tax from the current 36 percent to 30 percent in its bid to lure
foreign investment and help local businesses gain a more competitive
edge in their exports.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard has changed his earlier opposition to
the sharp drop in the business tax and agreed with the proposal by
Treasurer Peter Costello to slash the current tax to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Details of the deal between Howard and Costello, however, have
yet to be hammered out -- a process that will take several weeks of
high-level discussions in government circles -- but they are almost
certain to see the company tax rate cut to 30 percent from the
current 36 percent, sources close to the government said.</P>
      <P>Australian businessmen are expected to welcome the sharp decline
because they have repeatedly urged the government to agree to the
reduction so that they can have a more competitive edge in selling
their products in overseas markets.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the lower tax rate will certainly attract more
foreign investors to Australia. Australia's high company tax has
deterred many prospective foreign investors from investing in this
country in the past, economists said.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American scientist has identified the
virus that causes breast cancer, raising hopes that a vaccine can be
developed against the disease.</P>
      <P>The discovery -- the first to link an inherited virus with a
major human cancer -- was announced by Professor Robert Garry, a
microbiologist at Tulane University of New Orleans at the 11th
International Congress of Virology in Sydney on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said the finding may be used to identify people at risk of
developing the cancer, so early diagnosis and treatment could be
instigated.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday quoted Garry as saying:
"And if a vaccine could be developed ... we could even prevent
(cancers) from occurring altogether."</P>
      <P>He said the new human virus was almost identical to a virus that
caused breast cancer in mice. He and other researchers found that
more than 85 percent of women with breast cancer have the human
virus, compared with only 20 percent of people without breast cancer.</P>
      <P>Professor John Boyages of the New South Wales Breast Cancer
Institute described the discovery as "exciting" but said the research
had been conducted on only 30 women and large numbers needed to be

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT SEES WHY MAINLAND CHINA CONDUCTING INTENSE CAMPAIGNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A long-time China watcher has cited
several factors as explaining why a frightened mainland China is
conducting intense campaigns against the United States, Taiwan and
the mystical Falun Gong sect by arresting its members and leaders en
masse over the past few weeks.</P>
      <P>Robert Elegant, author of "Last Year in Hong Kong," said there
are several reasons for the campaigns.</P>
      <P>First the ruling Communist Party in Beijing finds its autocratic
power directly challenged by phenomena such as unemployment totaling
about 200 million; the usurpation of its powers by provincial and
municipal party and governmental organs, by secret societies such as
Falun Gong, and by new commercial units; and the People's Liberation
Army, which is quasi-independently rattling sabers over Taiwan's
insistence on equality with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Second, any large organized group outside the Communist
Party-controlled structure is seen as a threat -- especially one
claiming mystical, religious characteristics, such as Falun Gong,
which claims 70 million members in mainland China, compared to 56
million members of the Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Finally, the government, unable to deliver the constantly growing
economic prosperity it has promised the Chinese people, must find
another rallying call to win the people's loyalty to the communists.</P>
      <P>Since so-called Maoist Thought, as well as socialism, are not
merely passe, but reviled, the only remaining sentiment is
nationalism, Elegant said.</P>
      <P>"Nationalism is very hard to arouse or organize in a nation of
1.3 billion that has for millennia been characterized by strong local
loyalties, rather than national allegiance," he said.</P>
      <P>"It is, therefore, necessary to fan nationalistic feeling against
a specific enemy, rather than for China itself. And what better enemy
than the world's sole superpower, the US?" he said.</P>
      <P>"The drive to reclaim Taiwan and revile the US are clearly also
the endeavors of a shaky government," he said.</P>
      <P>He also noted that universal corruption further alienates the
mainland Chinese people from the Communist Party as does the total
refusal to allow the people a voice in their government , despite the
charade of local elections with one slate of party-approved
candidates in some villages.</P>
      <P>"But growing unemployment is the source of the greatest popular
disillusion and the most intense hostility towards the government,"
he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC COMPLETES MISSILE DEPLOYMENT ON OUTLYING ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China armed forces have
completed missile deployment on the country's outlying islands to
beef up their defense capabilities in the face of the mounting threat
from mainland China, a military expert said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was commenting
on a Hong Kong newspaper report that the Beijing leadership has
decided to use "an appropriate degree of force" against Taiwan,
possibly including the occupation of an outlying island, should
Taipei refuse to abandon President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC's military deployment on its outlying
islands, many of which lie closer to mainland China than to Taiwan,
is based on the principle of fortifying firepower while trimming
manpower, the expert said military authorities have also taken into
consideration the geographic situation of the various outlying
islands, and the deployment of the enemy forces.</P>
      <P>Under the military's troop reduction plan, the expert said,
weaponry deployment on Taiwan's offshore frontline islands has been
reinforced significantly to make up for the smaller number of
personnel stationed on the islands.</P>
      <P>According to the expert, the military began to deploy
surface-to-air missiles on the island group of Penghu as far back as
1989, as the islands off Taiwan's southwestern coast sit at a
strategic point close to the center of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, naval authorities are planning to deploy locally built
Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles in Penghu which will be able to
reach the southeastern mainland port city of Xiamen. The navy has
also deployed the missiles, with a range of more than 100 kilometers,
on the ROC's second-generation warships.</P>
      <P>The expert went on to say that although military deployment in
Penghu focuses on anti-invasion operations, the military has also
built up sizable air and naval defense forces there.</P>
      <P>As for other outlying island groups as Kinmen and Matsu, he
continued, military deployment there focuses on traditional forces
because some of their islets lie within firing range of mainland
China artillery. Nevertheless, the military has also deployed
chaparral missiles on some of the islets for low-altitude air
defense.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy is Tungyin, an islet belonging to the Matsu
group, which is out of range of mainland guns. Moreover, Tungyin is
formed from granite, which makes for excellent natural protection,
and is the only outlying island to have deployed the highly advanced
surface-to-air Sky Bow missiles.</P>
      <P>According to the expert, the deployments on the various outlying
islands are not only for passive defense but also have a deterrent
purpose. "Local people should have confidence in the defenses on the
outlying islands," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sponsorship procedure for the
recommendation of the ruling Kuomintang's candidate for the March
2000 presidential election had accumulated 1,204 names as of
Wednesday morning, all of them in support of Lien Chan's nomination.</P>
      <P>Lien, vice president of the Republic of China and also vice
chairman of the KMT, obtained party chairman Lee Teng-hui's
sponsorship on Aug. 7, the first day of the sponsorship period.</P>
      <P>It was estimated by ranking KMT officials that Lien would have
the support of more than 90 percent of the party representatives by
the end of the sponsorship process on Wednesday at close of business.</P>
      <P>According to KMT presidential nomination regulations, potential
candidates must acquire sponsorship of at least one tenth of the
party congress delegates to be eligible for nomination. As there are
2,180 delegates, Lien needed just 218 names.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang noted that Lien's 1,204 sponsors
mean that he has far surpassed the threshold.</P>

      <P>However, Wang's visit has become uncertain after ROC President
Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship" in an interview with a German radio station in July,
drawing a furious reaction from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Amid reports of increased sorties in the skies over the Taiwan
Strait in recent weeks, Rear Admiral Timothy LaFleur, commander of
the USS Constellation battle group, said in Singapore on Tuesday that
the battle group may be dispatched to the Taiwan Strait should a
military crisis break out in the region.</P>
      <P>Noting that mobility is one of the navy's major advantages,
LaFleur said US warships can quickly move from one area to another.
During the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, LaFleur said, a US aircraft
carrier battle group sailed from the Persian Gulf to the Taiwan
Strait in a very short period of time.</P>
      <P>The USS Constellation is currently docked in Singapore for
training exercises with the Singapore navy following similar training
drills with Japanese and South Korean forces.</P>
      <P>LaFleur said the Constellation battle group has so far not
received any directive to sail to the Taiwan Strait. "We instead
have received an order to perform duties in the Persian Gulf.</P>
      <P>The senior US naval officer said although Southeast Asia is a
potential flashpoint, the situation in the area remains stable at the
moment. Therefore, he said, the Constellation battle group will not
stay in the region for long time.</P>
      <P>The USS Constellation is the center of a battle group which
consists of 10 ships and the air wing that is embarked with 71
airplanes. Within the group are also two cruisers, two destroyers,
two submarines, as well as a replenishment ship, a Canadian ship and
a US coast guard ship.</P>
      <P>The Canadian ship is part of Canada's engagement with the United
States to help enforce United Nations sanctions in the Persian Gulf,
LaFleur said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSASIA AIRWAYS FLIES FIRST ROC CHARTER TO NORTHEASTERN THAILAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By  F.C. Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A charter plane of the Taiwan-based
TransAsia Airways will fly more than 160 Thai workers working in
Taiwan back to their hometowns in northeastern Thailand on vacation
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first charter plane from Taiwan to northeastern
Thailand since the two countries signed an aviation agreement last
month, according to ROC Representative in Thailand Huang Hsien-yung,
who added that the flight can be seen as a sign that TransAsia might
operate scheduled flights to Thailand in the future.</P>
      <P>The signing of the aviation agreement allows the two countries to
increase flights and destinations between them, Huang said, stressing
that bilateral ties have always been cordial, not only in the field
of labor affairs but also in the trade and investment areas.</P>
      <P>Huang also expressed the hope that the two countries will ink a
labor cooperation accord as soon as possible to help secure greater
benefits for Thai workers wishing to work in Taiwan, as the Republic
of China government has been actively seeking to reduce the burden of
brokerage fees for Thai workers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Thai representative said the TransAsia charter for
the vacationing Thai workers, allowing them to travel direct to their
homes in the northeast instead of having to transit via Bangkok, is
an indication that they have been well taken care of in Taiwan. Aug.
12 is the birthday of Thai Queen Sirikit, and is also Thailand's
Mothers' Day, the representative added.</P>

      <P>A legislator of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday urged the Executive Yuan to set
up an "information warfare center" in order to protect the island's
electronic networks.</P>
      <P>In light of recent attacks by computer hackers on websites

is easy for hackers to break into government websites and that if
potential enemies launch a formal information war, the outcome would
be "unthinkable."</P>

an information war rather than a full-on attack.</P>
      <P>Li also said that mainland China has put strong emphasis on its
ability to wage information warfare since 1985, and has been building
up its resources and strategies. According to assessments, he went
on, mainland China will be able to intimidate Taiwan in this regard
by 2005.</P>
      <P>He said possible targets will include finance, aviation

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT EXPLAINS `SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' TO US GUESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Wednesday reiterated on Wednesday that his description of
cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state relationship" is no
more than a reflection of the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are equal.</P>
      <P>The sooner this equality is acknowledged, the sooner the two
sides can conduct dialogue and negotiations on issues including
political disputes, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that "we shall never accept" Beijing's claims that
Taiwan is a local province of mainland China, or the "one country two
systems" formula espoused by the mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a meeting with a visiting group of US
Congress representatives headed by Edwin Feulner, the president of
the Washington-based think tank, the Heritage Foundation, at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Other members of the delegation include House Representatives Sam
Johnson (R-Texas), Bill Barrett (R-Nebraska), Charles T. Canady
(R-Florida), Ernest Istook (R-Oklahoma) and Van Hilleary
(R-Tennessee).</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee explained that he made the declaration on
cross-strait relations during an interview on July 9 by the German
Deutsche Welle radio station when the reporter asked about mainland
China's view of Taiwan as a "renegade province."</P>
      <P>As leader of the ROC, Lee said, with the duty of defending the
sovereign rights and interests of the country and people, he had to
give a clearly defined answer to the question. The "special
state-to-state relationship" statement, he said, refers to a fact
which is undeniable from either the historical or the legal point of
view.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that he is obliged to declare the fact of
the ROC's existence in the international community, a fact which he
said has been submerged by false propaganda from Beijing, which
defines "one China" as the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The claim neglects the fact that the ROC exists as a sovereign
state, and has pushed the ROC into a dead-end position in its
struggle for survival in the international community, Lee said.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, the 16-member delegation called on National
Defense Minister Tang Fei to exchange views on cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>During the 50-minute meeting, Feulner said he acknowledged and
understands the ROC's determination to maintain peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Tang said the ROC military monitors every movement of its
mainland Chinese counterpart, and stressed that the ROC military is
basing its actions on the principles of "no provocation, no sparking
of conflicts, and minimizing hostility."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINSTREAM US MEDIA SUPPORT 'STATE-TO-STATE' CONCEPT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen
said on Wednesday that foreign news media have given extensive
coverage to Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>"Since President Lee defined relations across the Taiwan Strait
as a 'special state-to-state relationship' in an interview with
Germany's Deutsche Welle radio station in July, foreign news
publications have carried more than 1,200 articles on the topic,"
Chen said in a report delivered at a weekly meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Quoting an analysis by the Government Information Office (GIO),
Chen said the contents of all those articles cover a broad range of
issues.</P>
      <P>Chen said several mainstream US newspapers, such as the Wall
Street Journal and the Washington Post, have expressed explicit
support for the ROC's stance on its relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The GIO director-general said foreign news reports and
commentaries on the issue focus on the contents of Lee's political
declaration, the timing and motivation of the unveiling of the
definition, and the possible impact on Taiwan of the declaration.</P>
      <P>Chen said the GIO has also stepped up its publicity campaign
based on Lee's interview, Premier Vincent Siew's "three no changes"
statement issued following Lee's declaration, position papers
released by the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the
Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>"The GIO has ordered its staff members stationed abroad to send
letters to major newspapers in their resident countries, or write
special articles and give interviews to make comprehensive, direct
explanations of the ROC's stance on cross-strait relations," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, 50-plus articles and letters to editors
contributed by overseas GIO officials have so far been published by
foreign newspapers.</P>
      <P>An article written by Chen himself, titled "Taiwan Merely
Affirmed Current Reality," appeared in the Aug. 6 issue of the
influential Los Angeles Times.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed in the article that President Lee's reference to a
"special state-to-state relationship" does not signal a change in the
ROC's mainland policy.</P>
      <P>President Lee's "state-to-state" definition has angered Beijing
authorities which have launched saber-rattling against Taiwan and
even increased sorties in the skies over the Taiwan Strait in recent
weeks.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's furious reaction, Chen said
the GIO will further intensify its international publicity campaign
to help more people around the world understand Taiwan's
diplomatic plight and win their support for the ROC's national
cause.</P>
      <P>The career diplomat-turned-GIO chief said the publicity
campaign will focus on three themes: highlighting mainland
China's irrational reaction to the "special state-to-state" theory,
its constant squeeze of the ROC's international space by distorting
facts, and the ROC's desire and capability to take part in
international activities as well as its possible contributions to
the world society through such programs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL,  MOTC REFUTE  ACCUSATION  OF  POLITICAL MEDDLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.11  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) on Wednesday refuted that
politics had been involved in CAL's aircraft purchase plan.</P>
      <P>CAL stressed that its decision to buy passengers jets from Airbus
had previously passed a series of flight security evaluations and had
received the approval of the company's board of directors in June, in
denying the accusation the purchase was in retaliation for the US'
preferential attitude toward mainland China after President Lee
Teng-hui redefined the Taiwan-mainland relationship as a "special
state-to-state relationship".</P>
      <P>CAL signed a purchase contract with Boeing to buy 13 cargo planes
on Wednesday afternoon. On Thursday CAL will sign another contract
with Airbus for a fleet of passenger jets.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to further understand how CAL reached it decision,
legislators from the opposition New Party (NP) on Wednesday morning
invited Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Chang
Chia-juch, Deputy Director General Chang Kuo-cheng of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and CAL General Manager Liu Ko-yia
to a breakfast meeting.</P>
      <P>NP's deputy caucus whip Feng Hu-hsiang questioned the reason for
the change, while legislator Lee Ching-hwa warned the switch could
deteriorate the US-Taiwan relationship.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng categorically denied the meddling accusation,
saying the CAA neither took part in the company's decision-making
process nor required CAL to buy aircraft from specific countries.
Chang added that CAL has to pass a CAA flight security inspections 
before it is granted a permit to import newly-purchased aircraft.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that after last year's fatal crash in Taoyuan,
the CAA ordered CAL to simplify its aircraft models and forbid any
new aircraft to be purchased before CAL's flight security and
business performance improved.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the CAA lifted the CAL purchase ban July 2,
several days prior to President Lee's "special state-to-state
relationship" redefinition on July 9.</P>
      <P>CAL then briefed the purchase plane to the MOTC on mid July.</P>
      <P>However, legislators questioned the briefing date, arguing that
the briefing occurred after Lee stated his "special state-to-state
relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Legislators also questioned CAL why the company sided with the
European aviation company after Airbus aircraft were involved in two
major CAL crashes.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials confirmed the CAL purchase decision was approved
on June 28 by CAL board members and had not been altered since.</P>
      <P>CAL General Manager Liu Ko-yia pointed out that CAL, a private
corporation, had not received political pressure and that Airbus
aircraft are not blamed for the two fatal crashes since the cause of
both tragedies is yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>He further stressed that the CAL decision was based solely on the
Airbus aircraft's reliability and security.

      <P>The chairman of the board of directors of
Philippine Airways (PAL) said on Wednesday that upcoming talks
between PAL, China Airlines, and Eva Airways will be limited to
clarifying the third and the fourth aviation rights and a 5,000
person per week quota while revoking the fifth and the sixth freedom 
rights.</P>
      <P>The third and fourth aviation rights only permit air carriers to
land and carry passengers between Taipei and Manila. the fifth and
sixth freedom rights permit the air carriers to extend their service
to third destinations.</P>
      <P>Lucio Tan, however, said that the employment of the fifth and the
sixth rights will not surpass the passenger load by 2 or 3 percent.
If both sides reach a mutual understanding, up to 5 percent is
acceptable, he said.</P>
      <P>The current weekly quota is 9,600 passengers.</P>
      <P>Tan accused CAL and Eva Air of employing the fifth and sixth
freedom rights to take away passengers from Philippine Airlines. He
labeled the practice of the two Taiwan air carriers as "unfair".</P>
      <P>He stressed that the aviation right talks have nothing to do with
politics. He hoped that the talks would begin soon as PAL could not
afford a financial loss.</P>
      <P>Tan said that PAL is losing 20 million pesos a day or
approximately 700 million pesos per month.

MND CAUTIONS PUBLIC NOT TO BELIEVE SENSATIONAL REPORTS</P>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 11 (CNA) The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
cautioned the public on Wednesday against believing unverified
reports from Hong Kong which, the ministry said, aim at escalating
tension across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ministry aired the caution in response to reports Wednesday
in a Hong Kong newspaper that Beijing leaders huddled in Beidaihe,
Hebei Province, have decided to punish Taiwan for its deviation from
the "one China Policy" by forcibly seizing a Taiwan-controlled
frontline island.</P>
      <P>While downplaying the reports, the ministry refused to comment
on them other than saying that it would keep a close watch on military
activity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, the MND said the Hong Kong mass media often carries
unconfirmed reports about PLA military activity with the purpose of
aiding Beijing in scaring the Taiwan public and disrupting
local stability.</P>
      <P>Calling the techniques "psychological warfare", the MND urged
the public not to be influenced by misleading information.</P>
      <P>In addition to monitoring Beijing's military movements across the
Taiwan Strait, the MND said it will investigate the Hong Kong reports
and then inform the public.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the armed forces have the capability to keep
abreast of enemy activity, the MND said the troops stationed on the
two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu remain on ordinary alert,
and are being allowed to take leave as usual.</P>
      <P>Besides increasing air and sea reconnaissance, the ministry said
there has been no upgrade of military readiness on the two islands.</P>
      <P>In an unrelated event, Gen. Chen Cheng-hsiang, Commander-in-Chief
of Army, arrived in Kinmen on Tuesday to inspect military units there
amid mounting tension between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Gen. Chen, a former chief commander of troops on Kinmen, told
reporters accompanying him that his trip was business as usual and
there was no unusual activity whatsoever on the other side of the
Taiwan strait. He said that "everything is all right".</P>

      <P>The Republic of China earned solid
support from its six Central American allies in its bid to join
international organizations during the Ministerial Conference of the
Mixed ROC-Central American Commission of Cooperation on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The one-day conference concluded after foreign ministers from the
ROC, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and
Belize signed a joint communique promoting broader cooperation among
themselves.</P>
      <P>The communique also stated the need for enhancing trade and
investment between Taiwan and its Latin American allies. The document
also revealed that the seven countries will conduct a leadership
summit in Taipei on September 7, 1999 to more thoroughly discuss
issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>During the San Jose conference the ROC announced it will provide
US$21 million in aid to Central America for disaster relief and
prevention, trade and investment promotion, as well as improved
education and infrastructure development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also pledged its support for increased human rights in the
Latin American area by promising funds for a proposed Court of Human

      <P>Since 1992, the ROC has offered a total of US$72 million in aid
to Central America and some Caribbean countries, while investing
US$150 million into the Bank of Central America, according to ROC
Foreign Minister Jasan Hu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sent 15 technical missions, comprised of 130 experts
and 19 overseas volunteer workers, to its allies in the Latin America
and the Caribbean area to help with local economic development, Hu
said. He added that cooperation between ROC and Central America is
mutually beneficial and permanent.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hu explained to his Latin American counterparts ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's recent redefinition of cross-strait ties as

    <HEADLINE>CAL SIGNS PLANE PROCUREMENT AGREEMENT WITH BOEING CO.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) on Wednesday
signed an agreement with Boeing Co. of the United States to buy 13
B747-400 cargo planes for an estimated US$2.5 billion.</P>
      <P>CAL also announced it has decided to purchase five B737-800
passenger aircraft with option for four more B747-400 cargo planes
and two more B747-400 passenger jets at a cost estimated at US$1.3
billion.</P>
      <P>Fred Howard, head of Boeing's operation in Asia, said he hopes
CAL would continue to purchase planes from Boeing, adding that Boeing
would not abandon its efforts to promote the sale of its B777
jetliners to CAL.</P>
      <P>He said Boeing respects CAL's decision to switch to Airbus for
the purchase of a number of passenger aircraft and declared that the
Seattle-based company is satisfied with CAL's procurement plan.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was held at the Sherwood Taipei in the afternoon
with CAL's Deputy General Manager Chou Kuo-hsing and Fred Howard
jointly signing the agreement.</P>
      <P>CAL Board Chairman Chiang Hung-yi, General Manager Liu Ke-ya and
several high ranking Boeing executives witnessed the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chiang said at a news conference following the signing that CAL
had mapped out an aircraft fleet renovation plan last year. According
to the plan, CAL will buy 19 new passenger jets and 17 B747-400 cargo
planes over the next few years at an estimated cost of US$5.6
billion.</P>
      <P>CAL will also sign an agreement with France's Airbus Industrie on
Thursday confirming the purchase of passenger jets, mainly A330 and
A340, for an estimated US$1.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Despite Boeing's promotion of its B777 jetliners to CAL, the
company decided to buy the French planes.</P>
      <P>Liu denied speculation that CAL switched part of its order of
passenger jets from Beoing to Airbus because Taiwan was not satisfied
with Washington's attitude toward Taiwan's "special state-to-state"
theory on cross-Taiwan Strait relations. Liu stressed that CAL made
the purchase after reviewing its financial ability, market situation
and plan to streamline its air fleet.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON'S APPEASEMENT OF CHINA CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.   11   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration's
unwillingness, and thus failure, to abandon its predecessors' policy
of cuddling Communist China and proceeding with a policy of appeasing
Beijing will never succeed in deterring expansionist dictatorships as
the West failed to deter Adolf Hitler's Germany, according to the
editor of the American Journal of Strategic Studies.</P>
      <P>Amos Perlmutter, a professor of political science and sociology
at American University, wrote in The Washington Times Wednesday that
"the only wise act on the part of the American administration has
been to enhance Taiwan's strategic and security status by selling
them the F-16," he said.</P>
      <P>The tension between the United States, the People's Republic of
China and the Republic of China on Taiwan is mounting. "We do not
expect a repetition of the 1996 military confrontation over the
Taiwan Strait, but the risk for escalation is still in place," said
the professor in an article titled "Taiwan cliffhanger closer to the
edge?"</P>
      <P>Perlmutter accused the Clinton administration of kowtowing to the
world's chief violator of human rights, the PRC, while the United
States conducted a "humanitarian war" in Kosovo. The conflict between
the PRC and the ROC "calls for a clear, courageous, and determined
policy on the part of the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>The professor added that President Bill Clinton can no longer
oscillate between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, but he does not
expect Clinton to call for a different policy toward China because,
as James Mann's book "About Face" shows, the US policy has been to
cuddle the PRC since the Nixon-Kissinger regime was in power.</P>
      <P>But Perlmutter pointed out that the price of appeasing Communist
China, despite the recently invigorated US-Japanese strategic
alliance, is indeed high. Mainland China is surrounded by unfriendly
countries, which recognize its importance but are unwilling to submit
to its aspirations. This is true of Russia, Japan, and above all
India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore.</P>
      <P>"None of these has great love for the PRC. The United States has
a unique role to lead these nations in a balance of power arrangement
to help de-escalate the PRC's expansionist aspirations," said
Perlmutter.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the relationship with Taiwan is fundamental
here, because "there is no reason in the world to appease and kowtow
to China as if it is the single dominant hegemon in East Asia. Mr.
Clinton's shameful retreat from his declared human rights policy in
China is not a tactical, but a strategic, error. China should be
treated as an economic and political competitor and rival, not a
strategic partner."</P>
      <P>Beijing's effort to absorb Taiwan the way it did Hong Kong must
be halted. In view of the coming presidential election in Taiwan,
President Lee Teng-hui and his governing KMT are obviously asserting
themselves on the issue of their relationship with the PRC, wrote
Perlmutter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S ACTIONS CONFIRM US CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.   11   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 11 (CNA): Communist China's recent test-firing
of a long-range ballistic missile, its admission that it has the
neutron bomb, and its announcement that it would test a new
submarine-launched ballistic missile sometime this year have all
validated the findings of a US congressional select committee
report on the PRC espionage.</P>
      <P>The House Select Committee on US National Security
and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China
said in a Cox report update published Tuesday that "Events since the
release of the select committee report have confirmed some of its
most disturbing conclusions about the PRC espionage threat facing the
United States, the weakness of our efforts to counter it, and the
threats to our national security that have resulted from it."</P>
      <P>"With the stolen US technology, the PRC has leaped, in
a handful years, from 1950s-era strategic nuclear capabilities to the
more modern thermonuclear weapons designs," according to the Cox
report. Events of the past months bear this out, stressed the select
committee report update.</P>
      <P>Since the bipartisan committee, led by Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA),
published its report on May 25, the PRC has announced the successful
test-launch of the Dong-feng 31, a ballistic missile capable of
delivering nuclear warheads to Alaska, Hawaii and parts of western
United States.</P>
      <P>The PRC announced in June that sometime this year it would test
a new submarine-launched ballistic missile with a 7,500-mile range, a
development that was predicted in the Cox report.</P>
      <P>In July, the Chinese Communists admitted for the first time that
their army had developed a neutron bomb, confirming the predictions
of the Cox Committee. The committee also reported the 1996 finding of
the US intelligence community that the PRC stole neutron bomb
technology from a US national nuclear weapons laboratory.</P>
      <P>The Cox report, approved by all nine members of the committee's
Republican and Democratic members, added that the PRC had "stolen
classified information on every thermonuclear warhead in the US
ballistic missile arsenal, including the W-88, our most modern
warhead."</P>
      <P>"Despite repeated PRC thefts of the most sophisticated nuclear
weapons technology, security at our national nuclear weapons labs
does not meet even minimal standards and will not be satisfactory
until sometime in the year 2000," said the report.</P>
      <P>But the Cox committee noted in the update that since its report
was published in May, "Congress has moved decisively to implement
some of the select committee report's most important recommendations,
strengthening our counterespionage program and protecting our
national security. In the coming months, Congress will finish the
job."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Aug. 11 (CNA): Business people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits are anxiously watching to see how events develop
across the strait, and they agreed that if Taiwanese companies are
forced to leave mainland China, the level and quality of economic
growth on the mainland will take a turn for the worse, reported the
Voice of America Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The US government-funded radio reported from Hong Kong that the
rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei are putting billions of
dollars in cross-strait trade and investment at risk, because
Taiwan's role as a financial lifeline for mainland China could result
in economic fall-out from the political conflict.</P>
      <P>In the two decades since Beijing began to reform its economy,
Taiwanese businesses have invested more than US$30 billion in
mainland China, according to the report.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based analyst with the investment bank Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Andy Xie, told the VOA that Beijing has created
a friendly business atmosphere for Taiwanese companies, which are
much more concerned about profits than politics. But while some China
watchers say Beijing will go to great lengths to protect these
lucrative ties, Mr. Xie said they could become a casualty of war.</P>
      <P>He was quoted as saying, "China will encourage investment.
China will go out of its way to assure the safety and protection of
Taiwanese businesses in China just like last time during the military
exercises (in 1996).....But in terms of this assumption that China
will not go to war because of concern about the economy, that is
absolutely wrong."</P>
      <P>"China has gone to war many times before, despite catastrophic
consequences for the economy," noted Mr. Xie, adding "The modern
history of China is based on national unification, and there is no
doubt that China will go all the way."</P>
      <P>The VOA continued that the potential for mainland
Chinese economic sanctions against Taiwan or other actions that would
deter Taiwanese investment comes at a difficult time for mainland
China's stalling economy, since the country is in the grip of a
deflationary spiral due to a glut of goods and reluctant consumers.</P>
      <P>Mr. Xie said the on going deterioration of the mainland Chinese
economy is a concern for Taiwan-based financiers, and as a result
they have cut their investments there by more than 30 percent in the
first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Frederick Poon, a China economist for the investment house ABN
Amro, told the VOA that Beijing hopes to attract more funds from
Taiwan in the second half of 1999. But he is also convinced that if
necessary, Communist China will put the issue of unification ahead of
its financial interests.</P>
      <P>"Maintaining economic ties with Taiwan is an important factor in
the Chinese authorities' consideration of the relationship with
Taiwan, but I do not think we can preclude the possibility that if
Taiwan declares independence, China would not hesitate to go into
war, even at the expense of the economic relationship," said Poon.</P>
      <P>The VOA reported that the potential losses for mainland China
are undeniable, since Taiwanese investment in southern China has
financed an unprecedented boom. Taiwan investors have built countless
factories across the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, providing
thousands of jobs, job training and exposure to new technology.
Taiwan is also currently mainland China's fifth biggest trading
partner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian authorities have seized another
ship carrying a human cargo of would-be immigrants off the coast of
British Columbia.</P>
      <P>About 150 people were dumped off the ship and onto the beach at
Gilbert Bay, in the Queen Charlotte Islands Wednesday afternoon. The
captain and the crew of the ship then tried to race back to sea to
avoid capture. The boat was hailed by a military plane and told to
turn back. Canadian police then boarded the suspicious ship. Police
said pre-teen children are among the illegal immigrants. Police had
not confirmed their nationality but noted they "may be from China."</P>
      <P>Canadian authorities believed the mystery ship was carrying
another load of migrants hoping to bypass immigration rules.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Elinor Caplan made the announcement of the
seizure at a news conference in Ottawa. Caplan said she deplored the
smuggling of humans and hinted she may introduce changes to Canada's
immigration laws to prevent such activities in the future.</P>
      <P>The newly-appointed minister said the government would take
"appropriate action" against the ship's captain. "We have the
authority to warn the captain of the consequences of bringing people
illegally into Canada. If the warnings are not heeded, we will
vigorously use all legal revenues," she said.</P>
      <P>Three weeks ago, a similar vessel arrived in B.C. It was

    <TEXT>
      <P>Canberra, Aug. 12 (CNA): The Australian government is expected to
raise its economic growth rate for fiscal 1999-2000, bringing it
closer to the prediction made by private sector economists, the
Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Federal Treasurer Peter Costello has signalled
an upgrade in the current year when he told Parliament on Wednesday,
saying Australia's growth rate would slow to "the threes rather than
the fours" in late 1999, but pick up again during the first half of
2000.
 The government has set its gross domestic product growth for
the current year at 3 percent. Private economists predicted the
growth at 3.5 percent.
 Costello said: "During the course of 1999-2000, we would
expect some slowdown on a 4.8 percent growth rate (recorded during
the 12 months to the end of March 1999), more to levels we have seen
in the United States.</P>

as a "special state-to-state relationship," while 24.5 percent nix
said they disagree with the concept.</P>

follow President Lee's "special state-to-state" theory if he is
elected president next year; 20.9 percent chose Chen Shui-bian, the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party's presidential
candidate; 3.5 percent selected James Soong, a former Taiwan
governor who has announced his intention to run for the presidency

    <HEADLINE>ROC PUSHING FOR UN BID WITH EXPLANATORY MEMO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is taking
a new approach to regaining United Nations membership this year by
using an explanatory memorandum to clarify Taiwan's redefinition of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In the explanatory memorandum, the ROC government emphasizes the
fact that each side of the Taiwan Strait has been ruled by a distinct
and separate government since 1949, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister
David Lee said at a press conference on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China, which was founded in
1912, moved to Taiwan in 1949. That same year, the people's Republic
of China was established on the Chinese mainland, according to the
memo.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Republic of China on Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China on the mainland have coexisted on their respective
sides of the Taiwan Strait, with neither subject to the other's rule,
the memo said.</P>
      <P>"Over that past half century, each side has developed its own
political system, social values and foreign relations. Therefore,
each of these two governments can only speak for and represent the
people actually under its jurisdiction on its side of the Taiwan
Strait," it continued.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Taipei in a formal statement mentioned
both the governments of the ROC and the PRC, in an effort to
highlight the equity of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The
explanation fully reflects the spirit of President Lee Teng-hui's
"state-to-state" concept on the current cross-strait relations, Lee
added.</P>
      <P>Quoting the memo, Lee said the ROC, a country with significant
achievements, is a constructive and responsible member of the
international community. Lee added that Taiwan has recently pledged
an aid package equivalent to US$300 million for humanitarian
assistance to Kosovar refugees and Balkan area reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The memo stated that the Republic of China is a free and
democratic country. The United Nations should consider with an open
mind the appeal of its 22 million people for UN epresentation.</P>
      <P>The participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in the
United Nations poses no barrier to the future peaceful and democratic
unification of a divided China; indeed, it can be conducive to
regional peace and security, it continued.</P>
      <P>The United Nations General Assembly should act to ensure that the
voice of the 22 million people on Taiwan is heard in the United
Nations and its related organizations, it stated.</P>
      <P>In changing from past methods to regain UN membership, this year
Taipei has asked the UN General Assembly to establish a working group
with the mandate of examining thoroughly the exceptional
international situation pertaining to the ROC on Taiwan. The working
group's examination will ensure that Taiwan's 22 million people
participate, with a direct and representative voice in the UN,
according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Taipei has asked the UN General Assembly to establish the working
group in consideration of the fact that the 22 million people of the
ROC on Taiwan have no actual and legitimate representative in the
United Nations and to recognize that since 1949 the ROC government
has exercised effective control and jurisdiction over the Taiwan area
while the PRC government has exercised effective control and
jurisdiction over the Chinese mainland during the same time period,
Lee added.</P>

      <P>A total of 96 local and foreign aerospace
companies are attending the 1999 Taipei Aerospace Technology and
National Defense Industry Exhibition, which opened Thursday, to
demonstrate their innovative products and patented technologies.</P>
      <P>There are 215 booths at the four-day show, which is taking place
at the Taipei World Trade Center. France's Dassault Aviation and the
United States' Bell are among the foreign companies attending,
although the world's two leading aircraft makers -- Airbus Industrie
and Boeing Co. -- are absent.</P>
      <P>Products displayed at the exhibition include key aircraft parts
and components, aircraft bodies, engines, modern testing and repair
systems, defense equipment for military fighters and landing gear
facilities for aircraft and spacecraft.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Lien Chan attended the opening

link together to enhance international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Lien said the aerospace industry is among 10 key industries that
the government is devoted to developing as part of its efforts to
boost Taiwan's economy and improve its national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, when the government formed the Committee for Aviation
and Space Industry Development to help develop the business, Taiwan's
production output in the aerospace sector has increased each year.</P>
      <P>At present, Lien said, there are 75 public and private companies
involved in the aerospace business on the island, and those companies
have a combined production capacity of US$2.17 billion this year.</P>
      <P>The government has held an international air show every two years
since 1991, inviting relevant manufacturers and research centers
around the world to gather in Taiwan to discuss the future
development of the high-tech industry and trade opportunities, Lien
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UN BID NEEDS 'CONSTANT HEAT AND DYNAMISM', SAYS VICE FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seeking representation in the United
Nations (UN) for the 22 million people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan is one of the major parts of Taipei's long-term diplomatic
strategy, Vice Foreign Affairs Minister David Lee said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although efforts will not likely prove successful in the short
term, the ROC's attempts to gain entry require constant "heat" and
"dynamism" so that no chances to succeed are missed, Lee said at a
press conference, during which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made
known the ROC's new approach to regaining UN membership.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, 12 ROC diplomatic allies jointly presented a
proposal to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan early Thursday morning
(Taipei time) to ask the UN General Assembly to establish a working
group to examine the Republic of China's special situation in the
international community so that the 22 million people in Taiwan can
be represented in the United Nations and related organizations.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the Chinese mainland will treat Taiwan's UN bid
based on a principle of equity, Lee said. "Some people may think the
idea is too impractical, but Taiwan would not give up any opportunity
to serve a goodwill ball to the opposite side's court," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's efforts to seek representation in the United
Nations over the last six years have left the international community
with a vivid impression. Nowadays, Taipei has revised its UN approach
to more practical formulas in consideration of the fast-changing
situation in the world, he added.</P>
      <P>The proposal that a working committee be established to examine
Taiwan's situation was submitted by Gambia, Swaziland, Liberia,
Burkina Faso, Senegal, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, the
Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Honduras.</P>
      <P>For this the Ministry of Foreign Affairs extends its most sincere
gratitude to the allied governments and hopes that other nations
around the world will join in the effort to signify the legitimacy of
seeking representation in the United Nations for the government and
the 22 million people in the Republic of China on Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was one of its founding members when the
United Nations came into being in 1945. UN Resolution 2758, adopted
by the 26th session of the UN General Assembly in 1971, forced the
ROC to withdraw from the UN family to make way for the People's
Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF ASKS FEULNER TO CONVEY REGARDS TO TOP MAINLAND ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top mainland policy planner
said on Thursday he has asked the head of a noted US think tank to
convey regards to Wang Daohan, top mainland Chinese negotiator with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, said he
has also asked Edwin Feulner, president of the Washington-based
Heritage Foundation, to extend to Wang Taiwan's sincere welcome to
his visit to the island this autumn.</P>
      <P>Wang, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), a quasi-official intermediary body authorized
by Beijing authorities to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence with official ties, was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan
either in mid-September or mid-October. His visit, however, has
become uncertain following ROC President Lee Teng-hui's reference to
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" in an
interview with a German radio station on July 9.</P>
      <P>Feulner, who and an 18-member US House of Representatives
delegation left for Shanghai on Thursday after a brief visit to
Taiwan, said he and many American congressmen hope to see Wang visit
Taiwan as scheduled because Wang's visit is expected to help resume
cross-strait dialogue and contribute to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Members of the House delegation included Sam Johnson (R-Texas),
Bill Barrett (R-Neb.), Charles T. Canady (R-Fla.), Ernest Istook
(R-Okla.) and Van Hilleary (R-Tenn.).</P>
      <P>Some House members said when they meet Wang in Shanghai, they
will ask mainland China's elder statesman if Beijing leaders cannot
accept Lee's "special state-to-state" concept, "do they have a better
solution?"</P>
      <P>Su told Feulner and the House delegation that the Republic of
China government has consistently welcomed Wang's visit to this
island.</P>
      <P>"We have been actively arranged for Wang's visit under
the principles of safety, comfort, sincerity and constructiveness,"
Su said, adding he is convinced that the earlier the better for
Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>"Only through dialogue can the two sides find a common ground
for their differences or disputes," Su stressed.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Taipei, Feulner and US House members have
met with President Lee, Premier Vincent Siew, National Security
Council Secretary-General Yin Chung-wen, Defense Minister Tang Fei
and other senior ROC officials to exchange views on matters of
mutual concern, including the spirit of the "special state-to-state"
theory and the ROC's policy toward mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE EXCHANGES WITH GOODWILL: PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of
China said Thursday that his government will continue promoting
cross-strait consultations and seeking consensus with goodwill.</P>
      <P>The government has always been practical in initiating, step by
step, a new understanding concerning the interaction between Taiwan
and mainland China, in hopes that the distance between the two sides'
state of development would narrow for the benefit of all the people,
Lee remarked.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the "special state-to-state" cross-strait
relationship he brought up recently is based primarily on the
necessity of protecting national interests and dignity.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks were made when he met with delegates of the
regional 3490 Rotary Club.</P>
      <P>Lee told the delegates that insuring the survival and development
of the country has always been seen as his obligation since he became
president 11 years ago, and to fulfill that responsibility his
government must balance domestic issues, mainland issues and foreign
affairs issues.</P>
      <P>In regard to domestic issues, Lee said, the government has fared
well in the pursuit of democracy while maintaining economic growth
and social security, even during the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>As for the mainland issue, Lee pointed out that in 1991 the
government took the initiative in demonstrating its goodwill by
renouncing the use of force to reunify China, acknowledging Beijing's
rule on the Chinese mainland, and replacing military confrontation
with peaceful exchanges and dialogue. The establishment of the
National Unification Council and the promulgation of the Guidelines
for National Unification are concrete approaches to promote
cross-strait exchanges, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the "special state-to-state relationship"
statement was aimed at letting the international community understand
the existence of the ROC. Only by highlighting the ROC's existence
can the development of the ROC in the international community be
possible, he continued.</P>
      <P>As for the foreign affairs aspect of his responsibilities, Lee
said that the government's endeavors to establish an international
presence and national dignity represent the consensus of all the
people in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Thursday it will keep a close watch on Panamanian Vice
President-elect Arturo Vallarino's current visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Vallarino had informed the Republic of China
government of his travel plan before his departure for the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, Vallarino is currently on a private
visit to the mainland at the invitation of a private enterprise.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said Vallarino had received the invitation
before he won the election earlier this year. "Vallarino had
promised not to touch on any political topics during his mainland
visit and to make a formal visit to Taiwan after his inauguration as
Panamanian vice president," said a MOFA official.</P>
      <P>Panama is one of the ROC's longtime diplomatic allies. Beijing
has spared no effort to court Panama and other ROC allies to switch
diplomatic allegiance in an attempt to isolate Taiwan in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said the United
States should maintain an appropriate military force in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to reports that Rear Admiral Timothy J.
Keating, commander of the USS Kitty Hawk battle group, said in
Pattaya on Wednesday that the berthing of two aircraft carriers
of the US Seventh Fleet in Thailand and Singapore currently is not
especially designed to cope with current tensions in the Taiwan
Strait or the Korean peninsula.</P>
      <P>Keating said USS Kitty Hawk will return to its base in Japan via
the open sea off northern and eastern Taiwan coast after completing
its training exercises with Thai navy.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Lee said regional stability is very
important.</P>
      <P>"I think the United States should maintain a proper military
force in East Asia to ensure regional stability and prosperity," Lee
said, adding that the Taiwan Relations Act requires the United
States to remain concerned about Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Taiwan Strait has strained since ROC
President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship" in an interview with a German radio
station in July. The definition has drawn a furious reaction from
Beijing, which has consistently regarded Taiwan as a "renegade"
province under its jurisdiction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou expressed his
hope on Thursday that his city's on-line population will reach 2
million by the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remark in a webcast speech at the opening ceremony
for a cross-century information application summit being held at a
coastal resort near Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said Taipei City is now striving for the establishment of a
"new web city," with the hope of reaching the target on-line
population by the time Ma's tenure expires in 2002.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that the city is well qualified to become "new web
city." However, he added, the current on-line population of the
metropolis is just 700,000, or one-quarter of the city's total
population.</P>
      <P>In addition to the small on-line population, he also admitted
that the lack of software is another shortcoming for the city's
information industry, and urged local manufacturers in the
information industry to continue their efforts to improve the
situation.</P>
      <P>In order to push for the establishment of the "new web city," the
Taipei City Government has earmarked NT$4.6 billion for the purpose,
he went on, adding that of the sum, NT$1.3 billion will be used to
upgrade the computer equipment in primary and junior high schools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the city government also plans to set up 800 public
computers at public sites by the end of 2002 to allow Taipei citizens
to go on-line at any time.</P>
      <P>According to the mayor, some manufacturers are willing to provide
free e-mail to every Taipei citizen, and he reiterated a promise he
made while seeking office last year to give each Taipei citizen three

      <P>Hung said that although Boeing's B777 series planes and Airbus'
A330s and A340s all meet CAL's operational needs, the B777s, Boeing's
modern long-range jetliners, are twin-engine aircraft. This means
that if the company wants to use the planes for its long-haul routes,
it must wait at least one year for flight permission under civil
aviation laws.</P>
      <P>CAL originally signed a letter of intent with Boeing to purchase
12 B777s in 1995, but dropped out of the deal because of the urgency
of the need to replace old airplanes to improve business
competitiveness, Hung said.</P>
      <P>He added that the company decided to buy the four-engine A340s
because the one-year wait for approval is not required for these
planes.</P>
      <P>Hung said the A340-300 jets will be used on inter-continental
flights, while the A330s, which are also twin-engine jets, will ply
Asian and middle-distance routes.</P>
      <P>CAL on Wednesday signed an agreement with Boeing to buy 13
B747-400 cargo planes for an estimated US$2.5 billion. It also
announced that it will purchase five B737-800 passenger planes with
an option on four more B747-400 cargo aircraft and two more B747-400
passenger jets, at a total cost at US$1.3 billion.</P>
      <P>The total procurement, worth US$5.6 billion, is regarded as the
largest ever in Taiwan's aviation history.</P>

(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 20-year-old American girl looking for her
birth parents in Taiwan held a press conference on Thursday to
publicize her search.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chin Huei-chu of the ruling Kuomintang, who
accompanied Desiree Leary to the press conference, said the girl was
born on approximately July 8, 1979, and is said to be the sixth child
in her family. Her parents, who could not afford to raise another
child, left her in a Taipei City clinic after her birth.</P>
      <P>At two months of age, Desiree was adopted from a local orphanage
by an American widow who took her to America, she went on.</P>
      <P>Chin also provided the numbers of two telephone hot lines --
02-2358818 and 0938373730, in the hope that someone among the general
public will be able to shed some light on the whereabouts of Leary's
biological parents.</P>
      <P>Desiree, who now lives and studies in Pennsylvania, said that she
came to Taiwan in mid-June to participate in an event held by the
China Youth Corps, and took the opportunity while here to seek her
parents. So far, she said, she has been unsuccessful, and is
scheduled to leave Taiwan on Aug. 18.</P>
      <P>The girl said that although her adoptive mother treats her well,
she still has the feeling that she does not belong in America. Since
arriving in Taiwan, she went on, she feels at home, and now most of
all would like to find her birth parents and the rest of her family.</P>
      <P>However, she also stressed that she does not want to disrupt the
lives of her birth parents, and really just wants to discover her
roots.</P>
      <P>Her search has been thwarted by the fact that the clinic where
she was abandoned has closed, and Dr. Huang, the clinic's owner, has
forgotten the details of her case. In addition, the records relating
to her birth cannot be found.</P>
      <P>According to a local woman who was involved in Leary's adoption,
the child contracted serious jaundice as a newborn, and had a green
birthmark on her back. As she is a tall young woman today, it is
thought that her parents might also be tall.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT AGENCY WEBSITE RE-HACKED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The website of the National Assembly was
hacked Thursday for the second time in a week, causing the paralysis
of a mainframe computer.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the National Assembly's website was hacked by
a mainland Chinese computer specialist following a previous intrusion
Tuesday, in which some files were replaced. Thursday's attack was
more serious, however, as viruses introduced into the system by the
hacker damaged computer equipment.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, a firewall -- a device that protects data from
outside intruders -- kept most of the information safe, said National
Assembly Secretary-General Chen Chaun.</P>
      <P>After attempts to restart the computer failed, National Assembly
officials went to the police and the National Security Bureau to
report the crime. They also sought technical help from the machine's
vendor.</P>
      <P>Amid concerns that mainland China will launch an attack on Taiwan
under a similar Internet warfare model, various organizations have
been instructed to look into the origin of recent intrusions and come
up with protective measures.</P>
      <P>The Ninth Investigation Corps of the Criminal Investigation
Bureau believes an attack against the Control Yuan's website on Aug.
9 and recent attacks against the National Assembly's website were
committed by different people, as the attack against the National
Assembly site crippled it, whereas the one against the Control Yuan
merely resulted in a pro-mainland Chinese message appearing on the
site's homepage.</P>
      <P>Police officers do not exclude the possibility that the attacks
were retaliation for President Lee Teng-hui's recent "special
state-to-state relationship" declaration.</P>
      <P>In light of the series of attacks, Director Cheng Nien-hsing of a
Taiwan computer center for emergency measures admitted that the
center failed to detect the intrusion into the National Assembly's
website.</P>
      <P>Cheng said there is no system that is completely free from flaws,
and he suggested that the best way to keep hackers from further
intruding is to reduce the system's external connections. He also
suggested that extra access points into systems be disconnected.</P>

signed an agreement with Airbus Industrie of Europe for a US$1.8
billion order for seven A340-300 passenger jets, with an option for
one more A340-300 and four A330-300s.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong is keeping his lead in the four-man race for the presidency of
the Republic of China, according to the results of a survey released
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Independent Soong was the favorite candidate of 33.3 percent of
those surveyed, while Vice President Lien Chan, the Kuomintang's
candidate, had the support of 21 percent of the survey respondents,
followed by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
candidate Chen Shui-bian, with 19.2 percent, and former DPP Chairman
Hsu Hsin-liang, with 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>If the election were to be held the day after the survey instead
of in March 2000, 34.4 percent of the respondents said they would
vote for Soong, 21.7 percent said they would support Lien, 20.6
percent for Chen and 0.2 percent for Hsu.</P>
      <P>However, 47.8 percent of the respondents said they believe Lien
commands the best chance of winning the election, 19.3 percent
believe Soong will win, and 6.6 percent believe Chen will be the
victor. Hsu did not even get a mention.</P>
      <P>Soong was considered by the majority of 47.6 percent as the
candidate most aware of public dissatisfaction. Chen ranked second,
with 20.6 percent, Lien came in third with 5.8 percent, and Hsu was
last again, with 1.1 percent. The remaining 13.2 percent of the
respondents said they did not know the answer to the question.</P>
      <P>As to which one of the four have the most ambition and capability
to carry out reforms, Chen led the others with a vote of 43.4 percent
of those polled. Soong got 22.3 percent, Lien got 10.6 percent, and
Hsu trailed behind with 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Lien might take comfort in the fact that he was
considered by most of the respondents as the one most capable of
maintaining the island's stability and protecting the national
interest in the face of Beijing's military threat, followed in
descending order by Soong, Chen and Hsu.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Focus Survey Research Corp.,
conducted the telephone interview among 1,130 adults around the

      <P>No links exist between the recent purchase
by China Airlines (CAL) of cargo and passenger jets and the
anticipated opening of direct air links across the Taiwan Strait, an
official with the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Denying the rumors, CAA Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng
stressed that CAL's procurement of new planes is aimed purely at
replacing its aging fleet.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while attending the 1999 Taipei Aerospace
Technology Exhibition in the face of speculation over CAL's purchase
of a total of 36 passenger and cargo planes from the
France-headquartered Airbus Industrie and the US-based Boeing Co. at
a cost of US$5.6 billion, a record in Taiwan's aviation history.</P>
      <P>It had been rumored that the move is in preparation for the
opening of direct air traffic links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that no fixed schedule for the establishment of
cross-strait direct air links has been set, Chang claimed that no
aviation company would be prepared to lose money by investing for
that purpose so soon.</P>
      <P>Even if such links were effectively set up, Chang said he
believed the relevant mainland authorities would in any case reserve
the lucrative Taipei-Beijing or Taipei-Shanghai routes for
mainland-based airlines only.</P>
      <P>As any airplane procurement plan requires a great deal of advance
preparation, Chang asserted that CAL's recent placement of orders for
Airbus and Boeing airplanes is part of the company's long-term
development program.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said on Thursday that Taiwan has
become more attractive than Singapore and Hong Kong for foreign
investors.</P>
      <P>A CEPD report indicates that Taiwan's labor costs in the
manufacturing sector is lower than Singapore's, while its rents for
industrial areas and offices are also lower that those of Singapore
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The report shows that the monthly labor cost for Taiwan's
manufacturing sector stood at US$1,100 in June of this year. The
figure in Singapore was 20 percent higher, while Hong Kong's was 20
percent lower.</P>
      <P>The monthly pay for an engineer in Taiwan averaged US$1,600 in
the same month, while Singapore's was a whopping 140 percent higher,
and Hong Kong's was 10 percent lower.</P>
      <P>The monthly pay for a middle manager in Taiwan was US$2,600,
again far outstripped by the 120 percent higher rate for Singapore.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, monthly rent for industrial zones was US$18 per ping
(six square feet) in Taipei, and four times this figure in Singapore
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The monthly rent for offices was US$57 per ping in Taipei 50
percent higher in Singapore, and 150 percent higher in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>CEPD Deputy Chairman Schive Chi told the media the figures show
that if foreign investors want to invest in Asia, Taiwan remains the
best choice, although he admitted that investment in Taiwan has
disadvantages such as the unstable relationship between mainland
China and Taiwan, and the lack of Taipei's internationalization.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is
wooing US-based Boeing Co. into a joint venture with four local air
carriers to remodel aged passenger planes for use as cargo planes, a
MOEA official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>One day after Taiwan's China Airlines (CAL) signed an order for
13 Boeing-747s, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yin Chi-ming said
that his ministry is trying to lobby Boeing to join CAL, EVA Airways,
Aerospace Industrial Development Corp., and Air Asia Co. in the
venture.</P>
      <P>Thus far, all of the local carriers except CAL have agreed to
join the venture.</P>
      <P>Yin said that even if CAL is not interested in the project, his
ministry will press on with promoting the venture with the
participation of the other three carriers and Boeing.</P>
      <P>The remodeling business, which transforms aging passenger planes
into cargo jets, is a lucrative market estimated at about US$100
billion worldwide.</P>
      <P>Although remodeling an existing plane is far less expensive than
buying a new cargo plane, US$40 million to US$50 million startup
capital must still be put up before a potential investor can be
certified as an accredited operator, a regulation which has scared
away many would-be operators.</P>
      <P>Yin said CAL's newly signed contract with Boeing, as well as the
MOEA's pushing for the new venture, should dispel the allegations
that the Taipei authorities tried to persuade CAL to switch its order
from Boeing to its European rival, Airbus Industrie, to vent its
anger over Washington's tilt toward Beijing in Taipei's dispute over
the island's statehood.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
has played a vital role in saving Taiwan's long-awaited high speed
railway project from being aborted at the last minute.</P>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC) Chairwoman Yin Chi and
Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Fong-chen, after a
four-hour meeting on Thursday evening, reached a consensus that THSRC
will go ahead with the project.</P>
      <P>THSRC, comprised of several local business groups, won the bid
in July last year to build Taiwan's first high speed rail at a cost
of over US$16.5 billion on a BOT (build-operate-transfer) basis.</P>
      <P>However, troubled by financial strains resulting from the
reluctance of a local banking consortium to provide sufficient
funding, and what it claimed is the government's failure to honor
promises to provide other support, THSRC had threatened to scrap the
agreement for the 345-kilometer high speed rail project.</P>

      <P>Tibet's Dalai Lama is currently
visiting the United States "in his capacity as a religious and

spokesman for the Department of State, Thursday.</P>
      <P>Contrary to press reports, Rubin said, the US government is not

But Special Coordinator for Tibetan Affairs Julia Taft is expected to
meet with the Dalai Lama when the Tibetan religious leader is in New

      <P>The spokesman said at a regular briefing at the State Department
that since 1942, the United States has "regarded Tibet as part of
China," stressing, "We do not recognize the Tibetan
government-in-exile as a sovereign entity, but we do believe that
restoration of a dialogue between China and the Dalai Lama is an
important element of a peaceful solution to diffuse tensions."</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE HOUSE SAYS US WILL NOT LOSE ACCESS TO PANAMA CANAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration said
Thursday the United States is satisfied that Beijing will not try and
does not have the capability to command the Panama Canal despite
Republican fears over a Hong Kong company's control of ports at both
ends of the strategic waterway.</P>
      <P>Responding to Republican worries about mainland China's growing
influence over the Panama Canal, David Leavy, spokesman for the White
House National Security Council, said, "The United States is
satisfied our interests will be protected after the canal is turned
over this December."</P>
      <P>"We have seen no capability on the part of the PRC, which is a
heavy user of the canal, to disrupt this operation. So I would
caution people not to get too alarmist over this issue," added Leavy.
American ships are guaranteed access to the canal under a law that
governs the contract of the Hong Kong shipping firm
Hutchinson-Whampoa, he stressed.</P>
      <P>At the Pentagon, Defense Department spokesman Ken Bacon noted
that Hutchinson-Whampoa will have port facilities designed to load
and unload containers from ships that are too big to go into the
canal.</P>
      <P>"The company does not have any ability to stop or impede traffic
through the canal," Bacon said. "In fact, the treaty that has been
signed by the US and Panama calling for the transfer of the canal at
the end of this year provides a guarantee for security of the canal,
and it also says that the canal will be operated in a neutral way ...
open to ships from all countries," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Bacon went on to say that the Panama Canal treaty includes a
provision saying that if the canal is closed or its operations are
interfered with, the United States and Panama each has an independent
right to take any steps necessary, including the use of military
force, to reopen it.</P>
      <P>"So the United States has a unilateral right to maintain the
neutrality of the canal and to reopen it if there should be any
military threat," said the Pentagon spokesman, adding that the United
States did not see the Hong Kong firm's owning of the ports as a
military or a national security threat.</P>
      <P>But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican,
sent an angry letter to Defense Secretary William Cohen on Aug. 1,
accusing the Clinton administration of "allowing a scenario to
develop where US national security interests could not be protected
without confronting the Chinese communists in the Americas."</P>
      <P>"US naval ships will be at the mercy of Chinese-controlled pilots
and could even be denied passage through the Panama Canal by
Hutchinson, an arm of the People's Liberation Army," wrote Lott in
the letter that his office released Thursday.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the Chinese Communist Party will gain an
intelligence information advantage by controlling this strategic
chokepoint," the senator added. "It appears that we have given away
the farm without a shot being fired."</P>
      <P>Panama in 1997 awarded a 25- to 50-year contract to
Hutchinson-Whampoa, permitting it to operate at the two ends of the
Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and the Pacific.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF BRIEFS FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES ON 'STATE-TO-STATE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi on Friday briefed 41 foreign representatives stationed in Taipei
on major points of the Republic of China's "special state-to-state
relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>The briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs followed a
similar presentation by Su on Tuesday to resident ambassadors of 13
of the ROC's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Resident representatives of 41 countries which do not maintain
formal diplomatic ties with the ROC attended Friday's briefing. Many
of them posed questions about the "special state-to-state" theory
after hearing Su's 40-minute briefing.</P>
      <P>Australian Representative Sam Gerovich told CNA that Su's
briefing has helped all foreign envoys come to a better
understanding of ROC President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" concept.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle radio station on
July 9, President Lee defined relations across the Taiwan Strait as
a "special state-to-state relationship," drawing furious reaction
from communist China which has consistently regarded Taiwan as its
"renegade province."</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that the gist of the "special state-to-state"
concept is to emphasize equality and parity between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The definition is mainly a political declaration aimed at
affirming the reality," Su said, adding that the "special
state-to-state" theory does not mark any shift in the ROC's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Our policy of promoting cross-strait civilian exchanges, trade
and investment has remained unchanged," the scholar-turned-official
stressed.</P>
      <P>Su reiterated that the ROC sincerely welcomes top mainland
negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan to visit the island this autumn
to see for himself democratic development here. "We welcome
cross-strait dialogue on any topic that can help boost mutual
understanding and trust."</P>
      <P>In response to an inquiry whether increased sorties in the skies
over the Taiwan Strait recently will affect cross-strait relations,
Su said the so-called military escalation in the strait is
largely an exaggeration by Hong Kong news media.</P>
      <P>"To our knowledge, the situation is not as serious as reported,"
Su said.</P>
      <P>Asked how to define "democratization" when President Lee said
the two sides of the strait can be unified only after mainland China
democratizes, Su said it's not easy to define "democratization."
Nevertheless, Su said a democratically elected parliament can serve
as a major indicator of democratization.</P>
      <P>One foreign envoy said Beijing leaders have decided at their
annual Beidaihe meeting to cancel top mainland negotiator Wang
Daohan's planned Taiwan visit. In reply, Su said there is so far no
official statement from Beijing to verify such a report. "For our
part, we still sincerely welcome Wang's visit," he added.</P>
      <P>The top mainland policy planner went on to say that the timing
for unveiling the "special state-to-state" concept is not important.
"The announcement is mainly aimed at affirming the reality of
cross-strait parity," Su said, adding that if the declaration were to
be made until October this year, its impact on the ROC's presidential
election next year may even greater.</P>
      <P>In reply to an inquiry why mainland China's jet fighters crossed
over the center line of the Taiwan Strait, Su only said the ROC will
not take any provocative action to add up to cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Su said he believes that mainland China has a learned a lesson
from the 1996 cross-strait crisis that saber-rattling would only
increase Taiwan people's aversion to communist China and thus
hinder eventual unification.</P>
      <P>A foreign representative asked what role the United States
will play should a military conflict erupts in the Taiwan Strait.
In reply, Su said the United States upholds its own version of
the "one China" policy under which the United States
encourages cross-strait dialogue and resolve their disputes
through peaceful negotiations.</P>
      <P>"Promoting cross-strait dialogue and seeking peaceful
solution to cross-strait disputes are also our basic policies
toward the mainland," Su said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BULLET TRAIN PROJECT REVIVED UPON SIGNING OF TRI-PARTY ACCORD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tri-party agreement was struck on Friday,
reviving Taiwan's first bullet train project which was nearly aborted
two weeks ago, according to sources from the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement between the government, the builder of the
rail system, and a banking consortium which is providing funding for
the project, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
promised to offer guarantees securing the banking consortium's
creditors rights.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corporation (THSRC)
agreed to go ahead with the project, and to repay an agreement
deposit of NT$15 billion (US$463 million) if it cannot raise some
NT$280 billion (US$8.7 billion) in syndicated loans by next March.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew expressed delight with the development,
saying that the planned 345-km railway, Taiwan's first BOT
(build-operate-transfer) project, is now expected to be completed in
2005, fulfilling the expectations of the Taiwan government and
people.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Feng-cheng, who
met with THSRC Chairman Nita Ing on Thursday for a six-hour
discussion, said the three parties reached consensus late on Thursday
night after two major thorny issues were resolved.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the MOTC is not liable for any of the
project's financing problems, it nevertheless agreed to offer the
guarantees in the hope of reviving the long-awaited major
infrastructure project.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, he said, THSRC should be capable of
completing the bullet train by 2005, two years later than the
originally scheduled date. According to a THSRC analysis, the builder
will sustain a loss of NT$100 million (US$3.1 million) for each day
the project falls behind schedule.</P>
      <P>Trains traveling on the new railway will operate at a maximum
speed of 300 kilometers per hour and will shuttle passengers from
Taipei City in the north of the island to Kaohsiung City in the south
in just 90 minutes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is an independent
sovereign state since its founding in 1912 and this is an
indisputable fact, a senior mainland affairs official said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), was commenting on Beijing's claim that "one
China" is an indisputable fact.</P>
      <P>The press departments of the Taiwan Work Office of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of
the State Council jointly issued an article on Thursday, saying
Taiwan is part of China's territory, and that both sides of the
Taiwan Strait belong to one country, not two. "This is an
indisputable fact," the article asserted.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, will carefully study the two mainland Taiwan affairs offices'
article.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Sheu said he hopes mainland authorities will also
pragmatically, calmly and seriously read the MAC's Aug. 1 written
explanation of ROC President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state"
theory.</P>
      <P>Sheu reiterated the ROC's welcome to top mainland negotiator
with Taiwan Wang Daohan's planned visit to the island this autumn.
Sheu said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should resolve their
disputes or differences through dialogue and consultations.</P>
      <P>Wang, president of the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), is scheduled to visit Taiwan either in
mid-September or mid-October. His visit, however, has become
uncertain since President Lee defined cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in an interview with a German
radio station on July 9. Lee's declaration has drawn Beijing's
furious reaction.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the MAC's Aug. 1 written explanation was designed to
highlight key points of Lee's definition, including laying a basis
of parity for cross-strait engagements and upgrading the
level of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The MAC-issued position paper stressed what the ROC opposes is
Beijing's "one China" principle which downgrades the ROC to a
local-level government and denies its rights to take part in
international activities and organizations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOFU TO BE CENTERPIECE OF 1999 TAIPEI FOOD FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tofu is to be the theme of the 1999 Taipei
Chinese Food Festival scheduled to be held Aug. 20-24, sources from
the Tourism Bureau said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Top-notch chefs from 18 leading tourist-oriented restaurants and
hotels around Taiwan are expected to show off their culinary skills
and creativity with cuisine featuring tofu during the five-day
festival, according to event organizers.</P>
      <P>Tofu, lauded by the festival's organizers as "white jade" and an
essential element of traditional Chinese cuisine, "can be old yet
new," depending on its preparation, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>Tofu, or soybean curd, has been a major item on Chinese dinner
tables since the Han dynasty (206 B.C.-219 A.D.).</P>
      <P>A natural substance rich in vegetable protein, tofu has been
nicknamed by Chinese as "the poor man's meat" because of its pleasant
taste, nutritional value and low price.</P>
      <P>Tofu can be made into hundreds of dishes, from a gourmet delicacy
in a five-star restaurant to a ready-to-serve fast food conveniently
available on supermarket shelves.</P>
      <P>Besides the tofu theme, a classic Chin-ping-mei feast will be
presented at the festival, along with traditional northern Chinese
steamed bread and dishes considered to be aphrodisiacs, said the
organizers.</P>
      <P>Chin-ping-mei is the title of a Ming Dynasty (1386-1644 A.D.)
novel by an anonymous author, and is commonly regarded as obscene,
although the book, which mainly depicts luxurious lifestyles in
wealthy homes during the Ming Dynasty, is also lauded as a
masterpiece.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hakka cuisine, another facet of Chinese cooking, will
also be on display for the first time at this year's exhibition, the
organizers said.</P>
      <P>To mark the festival, the tenth of its kind, the Directorate
General of Posts will issue a series of stamps depicting the essence
of the eight major schools of Chinese cooking. The cuisine stamp
series, the first of its kind in the world, will have a print run of
2.5 million sets, with each set including eight pieces, the
organizers said.</P>

      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and
Communications Mao Chi-kuo said on Friday that he predicts that half
of Taiwan's population will own a cellular phone by 2001.</P>
      <P>Mao was speaking at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Taipei
Telecommunications and Network Exhibition held at the Taipei World
Trade Center, where he jointly cut the ribbon to open the show with
Chien Jen-te, director-general of the Directorate General of
Telecommunications under the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Mao noted that the government partly liberalized the
telecommunications market for mobile and satellite telecommunications
in 1996, and said the next step is to further open the fixed-network
market.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that before the telecommunications
market-opening, only 7 percent of local residents used mobile phones.
However, during the past one-and-a-half years, the figure has reached
37 percent, he continued.</P>
      <P>In addition, national and foreign investments relating to
telecommunications have amounted to NT$50 billion and US$30 million,
respectively, producing thousands of employment opportunities.</P>
      <P>As an overall liberalization policy will be implemented in 2001,
new investment is expected to hit NT$400 billion (US$12.3 billion),
resulting in related industries worth more than NT$10 billion, he
added.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the current priority is to open the
fixed-network market. The end of this year is the deadline for bids
relating to the fixed-network business, and the service should be
available to the public before the end of next year, by which time the
entire island is expected to have entered a 3C integrated
wide-frequency era.</P>
      <P>An exhibition center spokesman said 137 companies have rented 614
booths at the show, the largest number of booths used in a single
exhibition in recent years.</P>

      <P>A Ministry of National Defense (MND)
official confirmed Friday recent reports of two US aircraft carrier
groups exercising in the South China Sea, but stressed that the

      <P>Vice Defense Minister Sun Tao-yu made the remarks during Friday

Kitty Hawk and Constellation, to the South China Sea, but stressed
that it was probably part of an annual routine exercise.</P>
      <P>After the war in the Persian Gulf, Sun said, North and South
Korea have become the United States' major strategic concerns; thus
this was probably just part of a normal exercise of the US South
Pacific fleet, he said.</P>
      <P>Whether the battle group exercise was related to tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, the MND has no way of knowing, the vice minister said.</P>
      <P>Sun also stressed that the situation across the Taiwan Strait
mostly depends on the Republic of China's ability to clearly monitor
mainland Chinese military activities.</P>
      <P>As for the fact that mainland Chinese jet fighters crossed the
center line of the Taiwan Strait twice in late July, Sun said that
the ROC Air Force had closely monitored both incidents.</P>
      <P>The center line of the strait is not a statutory boundary, but a
tacit understanding between the two sides, he said, and the mainland
Chinese Air Force has always shown considerable self-restraint in the
past.</P>
      <P>As long as its activities do not interfere with Taiwan's
international and domestic flights and are not provocative, no
conflicts are likely to erupt, he said.</P>
      <P>Since the outlying Matsu and Kinmen islands both lie closer to
the mainland than to Taiwan, the ROC Air Force would have to cross
over the center line as well when providing air supplies, he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Sun dismissed foreign wire reports of two ROC Mirage jet fighters
being locked onto by mainland Chinese Su-27s. If the Su-27s had
targeted ROC jet fighters with their narrow radar beams and not
fired, their positions would have been exposed, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He continued that unless mainland China was prepared to wage war,
the ROC Air Force would actually welcome more mainland jet fighters
locking onto Taiwan warplanes so that Taiwan can easily obtain
information on mainland Chinese fighters.</P>
      <P>The vice minister also dismissed reports that 500,000 reservists
had been amassing in Fujian province and that they could "easily take
over Taiwan in four to five days."</P>
      <P>As mainland China lacks military mobility, Sun said that military
experts from both England and the United States have said that the
mainland does not have the ability to conquer Taiwan at present, and
that Beijing's claims are part of its psychological warfare campaign
against the ROC.</P>
      <P>Sun pointed out that the MND is well prepared for further
"information warfare" against Taiwan, and added that it is not likely
that Beijing would launch an economic blockade against the island
since such a move would affect the economic benefits of other Asian
countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ENVOY SPEAKS ON POLICY TOWARD BEIJING ON US TV</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China hopes to push for
mainland China's peaceful evolution through civilian exchanges, trade
and investment so that all Chinese people can enjoy full freedom and
democracy, the ROC envoy to the United States said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative Stephen Chen made the remarks in a C-SPAN live
program. In addition to introducing the ROC's stance on its
relations with mainland China, the de facto ROC ambassador to
the United States also answered many call-in questions on
ROC-mainland China and ROC-US relations in the program.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC on Taiwan will be a friend of the United States
forever. On relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said Taiwan
looks forward to negotiating with mainland China various kinds of
issues, including democratic unification, on an equal footing or a
basis of parity.</P>
      <P>Chen categorically denied reports that Taiwan is pursuing
independence and wants the United States to assist it in fighting
with communist China.</P>
      <P>The seasoned career diplomat pointed out that ROC President Lee
Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship" in an interview on July 9 mainly because a reporter
from Germany's Deutsche Welle radio station had asked whether he
agreed with Beijing's claim that "Taiwan is a renegade province of
the PRC."</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee's remarks contain nothing new, Chen said the
"special state-to-state" definition mainly reflects historical facts
and legal reality.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied that ROC-US relations have worsened because of
recent cross-strait tension over the "special state-to-state"
theory.</P>
      <P>He stressed that ROC-US relations have proceeded smoothly under
the Taiwan Relations Act, the US law governing exchanges with Taiwan
in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chen said, American authorities have recently assured
Taipei that the US executive branch and Congress remain firm on
security commitment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also clarified reports that Taiwan's flagship China
Airlines (CAL) had abandoned its purchase order for Seattle-based
Boeing Co. under political consideration. The reports were not true,
Chen said, adding that the carrier has ordered roughly equal amount
of aircraft from both Boeing and Europe's Airbus Industrie. "CAL has
adopted a balanced purchasing principle," Chen said, adding that the
ROC's aircraft purchases from Boeing in recent years are the largest
in the world.</P>
      <P>Chen further explained that the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the United States is the ROC's de facto
embassy in Washington, D.C. With a 200-member staff, the ROC
representative office is one of the largest foreign institutions in
the US capital. The ROC has posted additional 450 officials in other
major US cities.</P>
      <P>During the half-hour program, Chen also introduced the ROC's
history, foreign trade, major industries, government system,
cross-strait relations and its cooperative programs with the
United States in commercial, cultural, technological, academic
and security fields.</P>

      <P>National Assembly member Chang Ming-chih said that having Wu run
for the vice presidency would enhance Lien's presidential bid.</P>
      <P>He also urged the KMT to attach importance to the opinion of the
party grassroots to avoid the possibility of an unfavorable backlash
in the coming election.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a news conference at Yangmingshan,
in suburban Taipei, where the National Assembly is convening to
discuss constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Chang and his colleagues stressed that Wu has ranked high in
various public opinion surveys, and that a Lien-Wu ticket could not
only offset the adverse impact of former Taiwan Provincial Governor
James Soong's presidential bid, but may also lead to an election
victory for the KMT.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chang went on, if the KMT leaders ignore Wu
and fail to put him on the ticket, it could result in antipathy
toward the party which could in turn lead to lost votes.</P>
      <P>The recommendation letter was submitted to John Chang,
secretary-general of the KMT Central Committee, who will forward it

      <P>The total number of Taiwan students
studying in eight major foreign countries fell to 26,200 in 1998,
down more than 1,427 from the 1997 level, according to statistics
released on Thursday by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>America leads other countries, absorbing 13,109 students from
Taiwan last year, down 933 from 1997. Britain and Australia took the
second and third spots, receiving 6,173 and 1,921, down 241 and 205,
respectively, from a year ago, the tallies show. Some 1,649 local
students chose to study in Japan, a decrease of 51 on a year-to-year
basis.</P>
      <P>Canada was the only country to register an increase last year,
welcoming 2,359 students from the island, up 79 from the 1997 level,

      <P>C.C. Lee, director of the Education Ministry's Bureau of
International Cultural and Education Relations, attributed the
following factors -- the large number of overseas students returning

high education costs of studying abroad, and the increasingly popular
short-term courses abroad -- to the falling number of Taiwan students
going abroad for advanced studies.</P>
      <P>However, he also pointed out that the government's efforts to
encourage students to study in countries other than just the United

      <P>Margins are narrowing among the three main
candidates in the 2000 presidential election in the terms of their
public support, according to polls conducted by the Taipei-based Shih
Hsin University.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of July, the private academic institution has
conducted six surveys on Taiwan citizens' choice of candidate in the
four-man race for the Republic of China's presidency.</P>
      <P>In the most recent Shih Hsin poll, which was conducted from
August 6-10 among residents of southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung, Pintung,
and Penghu counties, former Taiwan Governor James Soong, who is
running as an independent candidate, would receive 28 percent of the
respondents' votes if the election were to be held the day after the
survey.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, the ruling Kuomintang's candidate, had
the support of 24 percent of those polled, while former Taipei Mayor
Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), also gained 24 percent of the survey votes.</P>
      <P>The fourth candidate, former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, also
running as an independent, gained the support of less than 1 percent

National Chung Cheng University who was invited to comment on the
poll, said Lien's popularity appears to be growing.</P>
      <P>Although Soong has been the most popular candidate in all six
Shih Hsin surveys, his margin of popularity has gradually declined.
He received the support of 44.5 percent of those surveyed in the
first poll, conducted from July 5-7 around the island, while Lien had
only 14.3 percent support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA): The Morgan Stanley Capital International
(MSCI) announcement that it is raising the weighting of Taiwan stocks
on its indices exchange immediately gave boost to the Taiwan stock
market as the local bourse rallied 295.81 points on Friday.</P>
      <P>A senior official of the Finance Ministry's Securities and
Exchange Commission said that MSCI's action was the result of the
government's liberalization of foreign capital investment and a
well-administrated foreign capital policy.</P>
      <P>The Switzerland-based Morgan Stanley Capital International
announced that it would count Taiwan at 100 percent of its market
capitalization in three major indices effective next February. Taiwan
is currently indexed at 50 percent.</P>
      <P>The MSCI's move will raise the weighting of Taiwan shares from
17.3 percent prices to 27.3 percent on the indices, indicating a 58
percent increase.</P>
      <P>Chu Chao-chuan, deputy chairman of the commission, pointed out
that Taiwan has emerged as the top investment destination for the
Emerging Market Country Free and the All Country Far East Free
Ex-Japan mutual funds, accounting for 19.3 percent of the Emerging
Free Market and 27.3 percent of the All Country Far East Free
Ex-Japan, respectively.</P>
      <P>He said that all the said indices belonged to the foreign capital
section, especially those American-owed capital companies. They will
compete to purchase more Taiwan stocks, which was reflected Friday in
the Taiwan Stock Exchange Market. The indices rallied 295.81 points,
or 4 percent, to 7,626.05 with a strong turnover of NT$172.53
billion (US$5.37 billion). Foreign dollars buying into the local
totaled NT$12.7 billion, eight times more than the NT$1.5 billion

    <TEXT>
      <P>A military takeover of Taiwan and the
expected loss of innocent lives will create lasting ill-feeling and
bitterness and pose as a real stumbling block to communist China's
aspired national revival, according to a commentary article in The
Straits Times today.</P>
      <P>With the title "China lacks vision over Taiwan", the article
pointed out that the Taiwan issue can turn explosive in the next
century. The communist China's leadership would need exceptional
statesmanship and far-sighted strategic vision if it wants to
extricate Beijing from such a situation.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, these attributes seem to be lacking at the moment.</P>
      <P>Only two options are open currently: reunification under
Beijing's terms or the use of force.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely naive of Beijing if it were to assume
that Taipei could accept the "one country, two systems" model.</P>
      <P>Taipei would never enter into negotiations which would relegate
the island to a subservient position, it said.</P>
      <P>Few people doubt mainland's ability or determination to regain
Taiwan by force, or question its legitimacy in doing so. But doing so
will surely create a phantom that will haunt the Chinese race for the
next 100 years, it stressed.</P>
      <P>The June 4th Incident has haunted the Communist Party for the
past 10 years.</P>
      <P>A military takeover of Taiwan and the expected loss of lives will
create lasting ill-feeling and bitterness and pose as a real
stumbling block to communist China's aspired national revival.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, under Beijing's terms war and peace are the only
alternatives. This lack of strategic vision is really a tragedy, it
said.</P>
      <P>Beijing should be able to see that once the country resumes its
previous position as a strong nation with irresistible cultural
charm, the reunification problem would be resolved naturally, it
noted.</P>
      <P>In it's 3,000-year history, China had been the preeminent country
in the world for 70 per cent of the time, when countries far apart
felt honored to be associated with it.</P>
      <P>The setback suffered in the last 150 years is but a minor and
temporary hiccup.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in order to solve a problem that has straddled three
centuries, Communist China should take a long-term view, focusing
first on regaining its former position: the leadership that was among
the strongest in the world.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the present leadership is too much bogged down by
petty politics and temporal concerns, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Politicians argue that since Taiwan is physically much smaller
than the mainland, there is no reason to accord it a position equal
to that of Beijing.</P>
      <P>The military argues that since Taipei's Kuomintang government
was defeated by its troops, in 1949, there is no reason to accord it
equal rights at the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>As long as the leadership in Beijing is stuck in this mind-set,
there is no chance of solving this three-century-old problem, the
commentary ended.

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three private groups and several
legislators met on Friday to call for the enactment of an asylum law
to solve the issue of more than 100 Tibetans currently in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The proposed new law will also extend political asylum to
foreigners who are politically persecuted in their home countries.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Association for Human Rights, the Taiwan Chapter of
Amnesty International, the Chinese International Law Society and
Legislators Chen Hsueh-sheng and Lee Ching-an held a seminar at the
Legislative Yuan to push for the enactment of the law.</P>
      <P>Chai Sung-lin, president of CAHR, said any country that values
human rights should constitute an asylum law to give shelter to
foreign refugees.</P>
      <P>He said at present, the Republic of China lacks related laws
governing the protection for foreign refugees, forcing those refugees
applying for political asylum in the ROC to be repatriated back to
their countries.</P>
      <P>At present, more than 100 Tibetans reside in Taiwan with Indian
or Nepalese passports. Because the governments of India and Nepal do
not wish these Tibetans to return, they face the possibility of being
repatriated to unknown destinations once their passports expire.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD ESTIMATES ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE AT 5.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development of the Executive Yuan (CEPD) estimated Friday that the
nation's economic growth rate will reach 5.5 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, director of the Economic Research Department, said
that due to the economic recovery in East Asia, the boom in exports
and the breakthrough of the stalemate in two important
build-operate-transfer (BOT) construction projects -- the Taiwan High
Speed Railway and Taipei International Financing Center -- the CEPD
has optimistically estimated the economic growth rate at 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Hu said that six big investment projects, amounting to more than
NT$100 billion (US$3.13 billion), will greatly stimulate the
domestic economy.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics made available by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics under the Executive Yuan,
as a result of the government's domestic investment incentives,
investment grew 6.4 percent during the first seven months of this
year.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that the implementation of all the BOT projects -- the
syndicated commercial and industrial centers, the private-run power
plants and industrial parks as well as the privatization of
the telecommunications industry -- will stimulate domestic economic
development and investor interest.</P>
      <P>Hu added that although the housing construction is still in a
recession and may affect to some degree the investment willingness of
private investors, the solid performance of the semi-conductor and
the liquefied crystal display sectors will help the nation achieve a
5.5 percent growth rate by the end of this year.

    <HEADLINE>DPP  TO  DISCIPLINE  NA PARTY MEMBERS WHO FAILED TO TOE PARTY LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said on Friday that it will discipline party representatives at
the National Assemblymen (NA) who deviate from the party's line by
supporting National Assembly power-expansion and the extension of
their terms.</P>
      <P>Reiterating the party's opposition to the two proposals, DPP
General Secretary Yu Hsi-kun said that any DPP assemblyman who
supports the bills will be referred to the party's Central Advisory
Committee for possible discipline.</P>
      <P>Outraged by the outcome of Friday's first reading of the
constitutional reform proposals, Yu said the party's Central Standing
Committee was displeased with the explanation offered by the NA party
whip, Chen Chin-teh, who voted in favor of the bills.</P>
      <P>The Central Standing Committee decided on Friday that all
National Assembly members, including Chen, who failed to follow the
DPP's party line should be disciplined, said Yu.</P>
      <P>Those who walked out of the conference during the ballot, will
also be referred to the Central Advisory Committee to receive a
reprimand.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that all DPP members toe the party's line
during the second reading of the two bills on Aug. 31, Yu said party
leaders will be present at the conference to ensure the
members follow the party's directives.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang party's National Assembly leader offered to
resign after the two bills cruised through the floor.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT party spokesman Huang Hui-chen said that KMT
leaders were fully aware of Chen's effort to block the two bills and
will not blame him for the outcome.</P>
      <P>Huang said the KMT does not plan to sanction its members who
supported the two bills in defiance of the party chairman Lee
Teng-hui's public call on Wednesday to drop them.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT is confident the two bills and any others
which are not approved by the party authorities will be killed during
the second reading when a three-fourths majority is needed to keep
any bill alive for the second and the third reading.</P>
      <P>One of the two controversial bills is designed to give
the National Assembly the power to work out its own structure and
approve its own budget without the interference of the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The other bill would extend members terms in office by two years
to 2002, thus aligning the election of National Assembly members and
legislators.</P>
      <P>Both bills have met strong public opposition. Public opinion
shows a majority would rather downsize or abolish the relic of the
Constitution drafted five decades ago that includes representation of
all of mainland China.</P>

      <P>The chief executive officer of French
aircraft manufacturer Dassault called on Republic of China Economics
Minister Wang Chih-kang on Friday seeking trade opportunities for his
company's commercial aircraft in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Serge Dassault is reportedly highly interested in whether the ROC
has a new procurement plan for purchasing commercial planes from his
company.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Wang expressed his hope that Dassault Co.,
the manufacturer of Mirage-2000 fighters, would continue its
high-tech exchanges with ROC aircraft manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Dassault has paid much attention to the recent China Airlines'
purchase of passenger jets and cargo planes from French Airbus
Industrie and the US Boeing Co.</P>
      <P>He asked Wang whether other ROC airlines such as EVA Airways or
Far East Air Transport Corp. have any intention to enlarge their
aircraft fleet. If so, Dassault expressed his company is interested
in supplying them.</P>
      <P>Wang told Dassault that he was willing to tell ROC airlines that
Dassault would like to be considered as an aircraft supplier.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC) under
the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs is now undergoing privatization
and is currently negotiating with overseas strategic investors. He
welcomed Dassault Co. to attend the process.</P>
      <P>Dassault said his company is willing to proceed with
technological cooperative exchanges with AIDC after AIDC's
privatization is completed.</P>
      <P>Wang indicated that ROC-French economic and trade ties are moving
closer. He welcomed French high ranking officials to visit the ROC
and hoped Dassault would exercise its influence to promote bilateral
exchanges and reciprocal visits.</P>
      <P>Dassault welcomed the ROC's selecting aviation academy students
for advanced study at the French Aviation Academy. He said his
company will send representatives to the ROC for further talks on the
program. Wang agreed to the student exchange program and said he will
help ensure the program is implicated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration said on
Friday that it has not received any threats or ultimatums from
mainland China on the possible use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, US officials once again urged both sides of the Taiwan
Straits to exercise restraint and seek a peaceful resolution to their
differences through dialogue.</P>
      <P>White House National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said
that President Bill Clinton can be expected to discuss Taiwan and
other issues in bilateral relations when he meets mainland China's
President Jiang Zemin next month on the sidelines of the APEC summit
in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Responding to American newspaper reports that mainland Chinese
officials have told US experts and policy analysts that Beijing may
use force against Taiwan to curb what it sees as independence moves
by Taipei authorities, Leavy pointed out that there have been no
mainland Chinese threats or ultimatums conveyed through official
channels.</P>
      <P>While refusing to comment on what Chinese officials may have
told private US experts, Leavy said the PRC has traditionally not
ruled out the use of force with regard to the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Leavy admitted that US officials are concerned about an increase
in military flights by both sides of the Taiwan Strait that could
trigger accidental conflict. But he stressed that US intelligence has
not detected any unusual mainland Chinese military buildup in the
area, as some Hong Kong newspapers have reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE OFFICIALS IN TOWN FOR AIR TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary for
Legal Affairs of the Philippines Franklin Ebdalin flew into Taipei on
Saturday to meet Republic of China officials for discussions on
alleged breaches of an air agreement between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking to local reporters upon his arrival at the airport,
Ebdalin, a member of the Philippine Civil Aeronautics Board, said
there should be no big problems preventing the two sides from
continuing their aviation agreement, so long as several amendments
can be made.</P>
      <P>Ebdalin was accompanied by Eva Estrada Kalaw, board chairwoman of
the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Manila in early August threatened to scrap the air accord with
Taipei, and to stop allowing Taiwan carriers to ply Philippine routes
from Sept. 30 if no new agreement is negotiated by then.</P>
      <P>Ebdalin said besides meeting with ROC officials for talks on the
pact, he will also meet with Philippine officials stationed in Taiwan
to brief them on Manila's latest position on the air agreement and
other issues.</P>
      <P>Kalaw, who is familiar with Taiwan affairs and Manila-Taipei
relations, stressed that Taiwan and the Philippines have maintained
close and cordial ties over the past years, and added that the last
thing she would like to see is the two friendly countries at
loggerheads over "trivial" issues.</P>
      <P>Kalaw was referring to several events, including a brawl between
local and Philippine players during the Jones Cup Basketball
Tournament held recently in Taipei. The Philippine team stormed out
of the competition the day after the fight, and refused to apologize
to the Taiwan players for instigating the fracas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said they would like to meet with Ebdalin and Kalaw for talks over
the next few days, but they stressed that Taipei will ask for an
explanation from Ebdalin about "improper remarks" which he made
recently.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Manila, Ebdalin said during an aviation
discussion with Taipei representatives last month that since Taiwan
maintains no official relations with the Philippines, the aviation
agreement signed in 1996 between Manila and Taipei was only a
"technical agreement between two civil groups" which could be
nullified with a domestic order from the Philippine side alone.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed sources said MOFA officials will ask Ebdalin to
clarify the remarks before proceeding with any negotiations
concerning the air pact, to find out whether his remarks represent
just his own opinion or that of his government. They added that the
remarks have shaken the foundation for cooperation between the two
countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP' THEORY WINS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   14   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state relationship" theory has won widespread support from
the heads of Taiwan's 319 counties and cities, according to the
results of the latest poll.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results revealed by Kuomintang Legislator
Chen Horng-chi at a news conference on Saturday, 86 percent of the
respondents agree with the view that Lee's airing of the term was
aimed at increasing Taiwan's bargaining power with mainland China at
the negotiating table and expanding the island's niche in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Some 46 percent of those polled said they highly support Lee's
redefinition of Taiwan's ties with mainland China, while 59 percent
said they agree in principle, but feel that the issue could have been
downplayed, the poll indicated. Another 58 percent opined that the
public should have been informed before Lee spelled out the issue.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that 60 percent of the respondents agreed that
Lee's statement has escalated tensions between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, some 77 percent still said they believe his statement
will help lay a solid foundation for long-term cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's relations with the United States, around 66
percent said they do not think Lee's words have had a negative
impact, well ahead of 22 percent who said they think the relationship
has been adversely affected.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 53 percent said they believe that Lee's
"two-state relationship" theory will influence the results of
Taiwan's next presidential election slated for March 2000, according
to the survey.</P>
      <P>More than 62 percent said they think that the ruling KMT's
presidential candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, will be most
benefited by Lee's remarks, while 26 percent said it will be Chen
Shui-bian, the contender fielded by the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). Only 11 percent pointed to former Taiwan
Provincial Governor James Soong.</P>
      <P>The public opinion survey was conducted from Aug. 6-1. About 83
percent of the respondents are KMT members, while 11 percent are DPP
members. The remaining six percent have no party affiliation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP APPEASING CHINA: US CONGRESSMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Wendy Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States cannot afford to keep
appeasing China, otherwise in a few years the United States will
discover that its world leadership has been overtaken by China with
disastrous consequences following, US Congressman Bob Barr (R-Ga.)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Republican congressman from Georgia pointed out in a
statement issued by his office that the biggest mistake free
countries have made in the 20th century is appeasing tyrants.</P>
      <P>Before World War II broke out, democratic European countries
including England and France believed that as long as they agreed to
Hitler's demands, he would leave them alone, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Barr continued, that appeasement policy directly led to
the massacres of World War II. He challenged that the Clinton
administration obviously has not learned from this historical lesson
the consequences of appeasing tyranny.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, the White House under President Bill
Clinton's leadership has not been able to prevent mainland China,
which is gradually leaning towards expansionism, from threatening
Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines, he said.</P>
      <P>What is more deplorable is that mainland China's record of
oppression is not restricted to its foreign diplomatic policy, the
congressman went on.</P>
      <P>During this period, Beijing has kept up a cruel suppression of
its own people, oppressing democracy activists and arresting others
for their religious belief, he said.</P>
      <P>Worst of all, he added, mainland China continues the practice of
forced abortion under its Stalinist family planning policy.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, Beijing has directly destroyed the United
States' election system and conducted espionage activities by
stealing US nuclear secrets. Recently, mainland China has further
advocated attacks against the US embassy, and even issued threats
against the US parliament.</P>
      <P>In response, he said, Clinton merely used the US Department of
Commerce to encourage American companies to export its newest
technologies to mainland China, including instrument planes, super
computers and communication equipment that will reinforce mainland
Chinese military strength.</P>
      <P>Barr said that the Justice Department under the Clinton
administration has also effectively prevented any prosecutions
against those participating in mainland Chinese espionage activities
or illegal campaign fund contributions.</P>
      <P>Last month, Barr said, Clinton accorded mainland China most
favored nation treatment, worth billions of dollars. The right-wing
conservative continued that at the end of this year, the Clinton
Administration will give up control of the sea ports on both sides of
the Panama Canal.</P>
      <P>And finally, he said, despite Beijing's unceasing threats toward
Taiwan, the Clinton administration has failed to declare continued US
support for Taiwan's safety.</P>
      <P>"The United States cannot afford to keep appeasing China," Barr
said, otherwise in a few short years the United States might discover
that it is facing a serious displacement role, and "might suffer
disastrous consequences."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAPABLE OF DETERRING PRC CRUISE MISSILE ATTACK: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's military is capable of deterring
an attack by the mainland Chinese cruise missiles which Beijing
authorities claimed have been successfully developed and deployed in
major bases targeting Taiwan, a military strategist said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Lin Chung-ping, who
is a Beijing military development expert, said Taiwan cannot afford
to underestimate mainland China's military research and development
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should watch closely not only the People's Liberation
Army's ballistic missile attacks, but also the overall "acupuncture
point poking" warfare capability that the PLA may launch at any
moment, Lin warned.</P>
      <P>Acupuncture point warfare refers to the application of
information or other technologies to paralyze an enemy's military
command and control centers.</P>
      <P>Lin said cruise missiles are comparatively more threatening to
Taiwan than ballistic missiles, as cruise missiles are self-contained
bombs that can cruise and change course according to geographic
changes. Moreover, cruise missiles cannot be detected and are not
easily destroyed.</P>
      <P>The top brass at the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science
and Technology, at a recent ceremony marking the institute's 30th
founding anniversary, told President Lee Teng-hui that Chungshan has
successfully researched and developed a vehicle-mounted anti-air
weapon radar system which could be effective in deterring PLA cruise
missile attacks, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The newest generation of the radar system will be mass-produced
in the near future and then deployed as the backbone of Taiwan's
defense against low-flying weapons, Lin added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan student involved in a car
accident that killed four other local students Thursday, remains in a
coma after emergency head and chest surgery.</P>
      <P>Kuo Wei-chieh was listed in "critical" condition Friday,
according to Frank Liu, representative of the Taipei Economic and

      <P>Kuo's has a serious head wound, and although doctors have treated
most of his blood clots, his face is still badly swollen and the
pressure on his brain maintains at a dangerous high level, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Four of the 10 Taiwan students on their way to Yellowstone Park
were killed when their rented van rolled over in eastern Idaho near
the national park. The accident occurred when the driver, Hsue
Ya-wen, lost control while trying to avoid hitting a squirrel.</P>
      <P>Hsue and four other passengers suffered injuries, with Kuo being
the most serious. The injured are now at three different city
hospitals receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>The students are all attending either Pace University in New York

      <P>Idaho police speculated that the serious injuries resulted

      <P>Xin Haonian, a visiting professor of East Asian studies at

      <P>The ROC on Taiwan possesses land, people and a administrative
government, he pointed out, adding that its historical and factual

    <DATELINE>New York, Aug. 13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve countries friendly to the Republic
of China have requested that the United Nations discuss their
proposal on Taiwan rejoining the UN during its 54th session which
opens in the middle of September.</P>
      <P>This is the seventh consecutive year that the ROC has taken
action to rejoin the world body through the help of friendly
countries.</P>
      <P>Some political observers say that this year's bid is expected to
draw more international attention because ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's recent redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Accompanied with the proposal is an explanatory memorandum
indicating that each side of the Taiwan Strait has been ruled by a
distinct and separate government since 1949 as well as a draft
resolution demanding the UN establish a working group on the issue.</P>
      <P>This year, the proposal was signed by Burkina Faso, Gambia,
Swaziland, Liberia, Senegal, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines,
Grenada, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands, Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Honduras.</P>
      <P>The number of signing countries is larger than 1998's 11
countries and 1997's nine countries, but less than 1966's 16
countries.</P>
      <P>Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica have not signed the proposal for
three consecutive years. Macedonia, which forged diplomatic relations
with the ROC in January of this year and is the recipient of a large
Taiwan aid package, is also not one of the signatory countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC's basic stance for striving to rejoin the UN has not
changed, and its policy of continuing to promote the bid until it
meets ultimate success remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>However, there is a difference in tactics compared with previous
years' attempts. ROC Vice Foreign Minister David Lee has stated that
this year the ROC will take a "rational, moderate and goodwill"
approach in pursuing the country's basic rights, while demonstrating
the "equality concept" as displayed in President Lee's "special
state-to-state theory."</P>
      <P>According to Lee, UN membership is one part of the island's
overall diplomatic strategy and is a long-term goal of the
government. He admitted that immediate results are not expected.</P>
      <P>The spokesman for mainland China's UN Mission, Chen Zanfeng, on
Aug. 12 described Taiwan's bid as "a revelation that the Taiwan
authorities' are pursuing splittism." He said the 12-country proposal
this year is certain to fail, the same as the past six attempts.</P>
      <P>No matter what the consequence will be, this issue, however, is
expected to focus more international attention on the unreasonable
exclusion of Taiwan from the UN.

      <P>Xiang Gong, a variant of qigong being
practiced by some 30 million people in mainland China, could become
a new target of government crackdown, a human rights group said here
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said that Xiang Gong, which is similar
to Falun Gong, has rapidly developed into a powerful spiritual
movement worrying Beijing leaders. Many senior members of the
Chinese communist party are followers of the Xiang Gong sect.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1988 by its leader Tian Ruisheng, the sect has now
1,200 practice centers in mainland China and has followers in more
than 40 other countries in the world, the center said.</P>
      <P>Like Falun Gong, Xiang Gong combines traditional Chinese
breathing and meditation exercises with religious teachings. In 
Chinese, Xiang means "fragrance." It is said that after a long period
of practicing, the body of Xiang Gong practitioners may become
strong and have pleasant smell.</P>
      <P>Unlike Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi, who is a legal US resident

on Saturday night to seek support for their presidential bids.</P>
      <P>Both contenders for next March's presidential election took
advantage of the opportunities to spell out some outlines of their
domestic and foreign policies.</P>
      <P>Lien told the rally in Hsinchuang City that the government will
not agree to establishment of direct trade, transportation and
communication links with mainland China, unless the island's security
has obtained full protection.</P>
      <P>He stressed the need for Taiwan to participate in international
affairs with dignity and with a pragmatic attitude, and said
that Taiwan deserves its right to join the US-proposed theater
missile defense system.</P>
      <P>The vice president will be formally named as the

month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong told his supporters at a rally in Yungho City
that if he becomes the president, he will form a government with
elites from all parties, and the priority of the government will be
given to the people's welfare.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan people will never accept Beijing's "one

making a showdown with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Regarding President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-Taiwan

said that it still requires a review over the timing and process of
presenting such redefinition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US POLICE WILL NOT TAKE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST TAIWAN VAN DRIVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  14  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police in Idaho's Fremont County
said Saturday they do not plan to take any legal action against the
Taiwan driver of a van that rolled over, killing four Taiwan students
and injuring six others early Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>The students were injured when the van, driven by Hsueh Ya-wen,
rolled over near Fremont County, eastern Idaho, while en route to
Yellowstone National Park from New York, where they were studying.</P>
      <P>A high-ranking officer from the Fremont County police
department told CNA that Hsueh was both physically and mentally
injured by the accident. He said both the local prosecutors and
police believe that even if Hsueh was negligent, taking legal action
against her is unnecessary and meaningless.</P>
      <P>An investigation of the accident is underway, said the police
officer, adding that it will likely be completed by Monday.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwan student who suffered a minor injury in the
accident, the van rolled over after Hsueh swerved to avoid hitting a
squirrel that suddenly appeared on the road.</P>
      <P>But a police officer from Fremont County noted that the skid
marks left by the van's tires did not suggest the brakes were hit
suddenly, and he said he was skeptical about Hsueh's story.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OBSTACLES IN ROC-PHILIPPINE AVIATION TALKS REMOVED: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
in a press release late Saturday that through negotiations with
Philippine officials, obstacles to talks on Republic of
China-Philippine aviation rights have been eliminated.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials met with Eva Estrada-Kalaw, chairman of the
Philippines' Manila Economic and Cultural Office, and Franklin
Ebdalin, director of the Department of Treaty and Legal Affairs under
the Philippine Foreign Ministry, on the restoration of bilateral
aviation talks.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director of the Department of Asia-Pacific Affairs
under MOFA, reiterated at Saturday's talks that the wording and
measures adopted by the Philippine side in July to revoke the 1996
ROC-Philippine aviation accord has severely undermined mutual trust
and friendship and has damaged the foundation for various agreements
and cooperative relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes that the Philippine government, in consideration
of bilateral interests, will deal with the dispute rationally to
rebuild a foundation for mutual trust and cooperation in hopes of
restoring the 1996 bilateral aviation agreement.</P>
      <P>The Philippine side reiterated that the Philippines values the
friendship between the two countries and various cooperative
relations. The Philippine side also expressed their intention to
clarify misunderstandings on crucial issues related to the
ROC-Philippine aviation accord to address ROC concerns.</P>
      <P>The Philippines maintains that the 1996 ROC-Philippine aviation
pact has not been revoked.</P>
      <P>MOFA said the ROC hopes both sides will negotiate the issue
rationally and reach an arrangement that can be accepted by both
sides.</P>
      <P>The Philippines unilaterally suspended the 1996 ROC-Philippine
aviation accord in July on the grounds that the ROC's China Airlines
was using large passenger jets on its Taipei-Manila service, a
violation of the bilateral aviation pact.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Stephen Chen, the Republic of China's
representative to the United States, said in an interview carried by
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun daily on Sunday that if the military tension
in the Taiwan Strait escalates, the United States will support
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the interview conducted in Washington, D.C., Chen indicated
that Taiwan has recently obtained assurances from the Clinton
administration and the Congress that the United States' commitment to
honoring the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>According to the TRA, a threat to Taiwan's security will be
considered a vital concern to the United States, Chen told the

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan's assertion that
Beijing's leaders should recognize the Republic of China's existence
is the most heavily supported statement on the matter among Taiwan's
four presidential hopefuls, according to polls conducted by
Kaohsiung's National Sun Yat-sen University.</P>
      <P>In a public survey on presidential candidates' views toward
President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-state relationship" remark,
Lien received support from 79.6 percent of respondents, topping all
other candidates.</P>
      <P>Lien asserted that Beijing's leaders should recognize the
Republic of China's existence and that both sides of Taiwan Strait
should resolve the dispute peacefully and sincerely.</P>
      <P>Former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong's position on the
matter was supported by 42.1 percent of those interviewed. He said
that because the United States does not understand the ROC's
assertion, it should not label Taiwan a "troublemaker."</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian
received support from 58.2 percent of respondents for saying
President Lee Teng-hui should establish a group to engage in
nationwide consultations to reach a consensus on the theory, since
the security of the Taiwan Strait will affect the security of the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-lian, a former DPP chairman who is running as an
independent, won support from 42.7 percent of respondents for his
position.</P>
      <P>The same survey also showed that Lien topped the four hopefuls in
terms of their ability to stabilize Taiwan's political and security
situation. Some 33.2 percent of respondents called Lien the most able
of the four candidates to do so, while 27.2 percent said Soong was
best able to provide stability.</P>

      <P>Fifty-six mainland Chinese dissidents
living overseas in exile have jointly sent a letter to UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan, saying that the United Nations should closely
monitor the worsening human rights condition in mainland China.</P>

      <P>The letter said the human rights condition in mainland China is
worsening, as can be seen from the recent government crackdown on
dissent. Since NATO bombing of the mainland Chinese embassy in
Belgrade in early May, at least 14 dissidents have been sentenced to
long prison terms. Twenty more could be convicted soon for their

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China badly needs
US-developed missile defense system to upgrade its capability to
cope with mainland China's low-altitude cruise missiles, ROC Defense
Minister Tang Fei said in an interview with the Defense News weekly.</P>
      <P>The American weekly said in its latest issue that mainland
China's purchase of 60 Russian-made Su-30 advanced fighter jets has
prompted the ROC government to adjust its air-defense strategy,
including beefing up air-defense facilities and air combat
capabilities in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In another Taipei-datelined report appearing in the same issue of
the weekly, Minister Tang said if communist China uses missiles or
other conventional military forces to attack Taiwan, the ROC economy
would be seriously affected. Therefore, he said, Taiwan must make
proper investment in the military field to offset pressure from
mainland China's military build-up, particularly its ballistic
missiles, cruise missiles and satellite technology.</P>
      <P>Tang told the Defense News that the ROC is studying how to
enhance its defense capabilities against low-altitude missiles.
In addition to developing its own missile defense system, Tang said
Taiwan is very interested in purchasing US-made Patriot III modified
missile defense system and Aegis radar system</P>
      <P>Tang said acquiring Aegis radar system is critical to
upgrade Taiwan's ability to intercept low-altitude cruise missiles
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>During the 1999 ROC-US military meeting held in Washington, D.C.
in April, the United States tentatively agreed to provide Taiwan with
early warning radar system. Nevertheless, the Clinton administration
is still mulling some details concerning the deal.</P>
      <P>The Defense News said the Clinton administration has also agreed
to sell six additional sets of Patriot missile defense system to
Taiwan to help fortify air-defense facilities in major areas outside
Taipei. However, the weekly said, the quantity and quality Taiwan
demands are far higher than what the United States has agreed to
offer.</P>
      <P>Quoting a congressional report unveiled in February on the
military build-up on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the weekly
said Taiwan's biggest disadvantage lies in its limited ability to
fight against mainland China's ever-growing ballistic missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIAO ANNOUNCES NEW POLICY ON OVERSEAS CHINESE AFFAIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) Minister Chiao Jen-ho said on Sunday that the OCAC will set up
a worldwide business network, as well as a Chinese TV channel, in an
attempt to spread the motherland's latest information and integrate
the business resources of worldwide Chinese through the Internet.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the closing ceremony of an annual meeting of Chinese
schools across America and a seminar of Chinese teachers in the
Greater New York region, Chiao expressed his admiration and respect
for the some 250 Chinese teachers in attendance. He also thanked them
for their devotion to promoting Chinese education, which he believes
will play a pivotal role in promoting world culture.</P>
      <P>Having just arrived in New York early Sunday, Chiao said that
currently there are some 3,000 overseas Chinese schools all over the
world. In light of the importance of overseas Chinese education, the
Executive Yuan passed a NT$500-million special bill last week
allowing the creation of the "Worldwide Mandarin TV Channel," which
will begin airing next May.</P>
      <P>Through five satellites, the TV channel is expected to broadcast
news and programs in mandarin around the clock. The programming will
center on the views of overseas Chinese, and with its mix of lively
and practical programs, it is hoped that it will make overseas
Chinese more interested in learning their mother tongue.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government is making efforts to set up the
"Worldwide Chinese Businessmen Information Network" in hopes of
integrating the resources of Chinese businessmen, Chiao said, noting
that there are some 30,000 overseas Chinese businessmen in the world
with investments totaling US$100 billion.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the network will provide services for
Chinese businessmen who want to put ads on the network's website or
make deals on-line.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that according to statistics, the global
business volume of the Internet has reached US$25 billion and it is
expected to rise to US$1.5 trillion by 2003. Thus Chinese businessmen
throughout the world are expected to display their business strength
through the OCAC network.</P>
      <P>Chiao earlier on his US trip visited New York's Taiwanese
community, where he contributed 12 computers, two printers and two
lion costumes for use in special festivals and celebrations. His
gifts were greeted with gratitude by overseas Taiwanese.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD CHIEF INVITED TO ATTEND CEO SUMMIT UNDER APEC FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top economic
policy planner on Monday denied a newspaper report that he has been
banned from delivering a speech at a business summit meeting under
the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said the report was totally
groundless as he has not applied for delivering a keynote speech at
APEC's 1999 CEO summit.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper said on Monday that Chiang, who will represent
President Lee Teng-hui at this year's APEC leadership meeting, would
be unable to speak at the CEO summit because of the recent
controversy over the "special state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chiang said he will check the source
of such a groundless, speculative report.</P>
      <P>The CEO summit refers to a breakfast meeting between chief
executive officers of large conglomerates and top leaders from all
APEC member economies. The CEO summit, part of the annual APEC
activities, is traditionally organized by the leading business
association of the host country of the annual APEC ministerial-level
and leadership meetings.</P>
      <P>Noting that the keynote speaker at the annual CEO summit is
usually arranged by the host country, Chiang said New Zealand's CEO
Summit Ltd., which organizes the 1999 CEO summit, has invited US
President Bill Clinton to deliver a keynote speech at the coming CEO
summit.</P>
      <P>The 1999 APEC ministerial and leadership meetings will be held
in New Zealand in September. The theme of the coming CEO summit will
be "Sharing Economic Leadership."</P>
      <P>Chiang has been invited to attend the CEO summit. Several local
business heavyweights, including Jeffrey Koo, chairman of Chinatrust
Commercial Bank, Chang An-ping, chairman of Chia Hsin Cement Co. and
I-Mei Foods Co. Vice Chairman Kao Chih-shang.</P>
      <P>The 21-member APEC is a regional economic cooperation forum
dedicated to promoting free trade and investment. Both Taiwan and
mainland China are APEC members.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, President Lee has been barred
from attending the annual APEC leadership meeting. Lee instead has to
name a surrogate to attend the summit meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Since President Lee clearly defined relations across the Taiwan
Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship" in an interview
with a German radio station on July 9, Beijing has stepped up
saber-rattling and launched new diplomatic offensive against Taiwan
as it regards the definition as a move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Local press reports said New Zealand authorities have on many
occasions expressed their hope that the ROC delegation to this
year's APEC ministerial-level and leadership meetings will not touch
on any issues related to the "special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>Senior ROC officials were also quoted as saying that they hope
New Zealand will simultaneously demand mainland China not to mention
its so-called "one China" principle, which downgrades the ROC as a
local-level government, during the coming APEC conferences.</P>
      <P>"We hope the host country will treat the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait on an equal footing and fully respect the ROC's rights and
interests as a full APEC member," said a senior official, who
demanded anonymity.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy development is that whether mainland President
Jiang Zemin and US President Clinton will issue any key statements
concerning regional security and topics related to cross-strait
ties following their planned meeting during the annual APEC
extravaganza, political observers said.</P>
      <P>In the past, the top ROC delegate to the APEC leadership
meeting usually managed to hold bilateral talks with top leaders
from other APEC countries. It remains unclear whether the
controversy over the "special state-to-state theory" will hinder
arrangement of such high-level talks this year.</P>

George W. Bush's statement on Sunday that he would use force to
defend Taiwan against mainland Chinese aggression if he is elected,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Monday said that it

      <P>MOFA spokesman Chen Ming-chen was responding to media questions
about the statement by Bush, the son and namesake of the former US
president. However, Chen did confirm that Taiwan has been in contact
with all of the US presidential hopefuls.</P>
      <P>Bush, currently Governor of Texas state, said in a CNN interview
on Aug.14 that "We need to be very resolute about our position when
it comes to Taiwan." He added that US President Bill Clinton should
make it clear that the United States would "adhere to the spirit of,
and the law, of the Taiwan Relations Act."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that while Taiwan welcomes the efforts of US
congressmen and civilian organizations to urge the US government to
honor the Taiwan Relations Act and its commitment to Taiwan's
security, MOFA would not comment on any specific candidate's
statements.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The working office of former Taiwan
Provincial Governor James Soong, an independent candidate for the
presidential election in March 2000, is calling for voters' to support
Soong candidacy through a sign-up sponsorship campaign.</P>
      <P>Although the 2000 presidential campaign has not formally started,
Soong as an independent presidential candidate, without any political
party support, should amass at least 224,000 signatures supporting
his candidacy. Soong's team is now exerting much effort into meeting
the threshold.</P>
      <P>Posters released by Soong's working office have a theme of
"The People's Opinion Dictates Our Direction."</P>
      <P>The Soong posters stress that the former governor is the most
reliable and trustworthy presidential candidate, and that he will
fully enact political reform measures. The posters urge voters to
show the people's power by signing their support.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Soong has consistently placed at the top
of various public opinion surveys, passing the 224,000-signature
threshold of sponsorship should not be a problem, according to
Soong's working staffs.</P>
      <P>The Soong team is now seeking voter support through its
affiliates in northern, southern and central Taiwan, with no set goal
for the number of signatures. A staff member was quoted as saying,
"the more, the better."</P>
      <P>During a mass rally held in Taipei County Saturday evening,
copies of the sponsorship sheets were disseminated to an estimated
50,000 potential voters. The crowd was also given the donation bank
account number into which they could deposit funds to be used by
Soong's election campaign.</P>
      <P>According to ROC presidential election statutes, the sponsorship
of any voter is limited to only one presidential ticket. A sponsor is
considered invalid if his/her signature is on more than one
presidential ticket sponsorships.</P>
      <P>To stop voting irregularities, all sponsor's signatures and their
personal seal must be attached with a photostatic copy of their ID

(By Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Monday received a group of US congressmen at the Presidential Office
and reaffirmed his "special state-state relationship" regarding ties
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the delegation of the House Military Affairs
Subcommittee jointly led by Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Solomon P.
Ortiz (D-Texas), Lee stressed the importance of clarifying that the
relationship between Taiwan and the mainland should be on an equal
footing so as to ensure the rights and interests of the ROC and its
people.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the ROC's mainland policy remains
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the Beijing regime has been
stressing it's so-called "one country, two systems" formula which
treats the ROC as a local government. Beijing's assertion not only
contravenes the facts, it also fully exposes the mainland's hegemonic
attitude, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guests that President Bill Clinton's China policy --
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and dialogue between Taiwan
and mainland China -- has gained the support of the ROC.</P>
      <P>He said that the government and people of the ROC are grateful
for the help and assistance of the United States, especially that
provided by the US Congress.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the country's economic development, Lee told his
visitors that many people believe that the mainland has a tremendous
population representing a vast market. However, they neglect one
point -- purchasing power. Citing as an example the fact that Taiwan
imports 1.5 times the amount of American-produced products as
mainland China, he said this indicate the ROC's economic and trade
power and potential.</P>
      <P>Graham and Ortiz both said they comprehend and support Lee's
explanation.</P>
      <P>Graham stressed that liberty and democracy cannot be compatible
with the communist system, and that Beijing's "one country, two
systems" proposal is doomed to failure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should ease its rhetoric and move
to assure its neighbors that it does not plan to risk a military
attack on Taiwan, a Bangkok-based English-language daily said on
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Like our neighbors and like both China and Taiwan, Thailand has
much to lose and absolutely nothing to gain by a war between the two
parts of China," said an editorial in the Bangkok Post.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said in its editorial: "China should know that its
neighbors will never accept a military attack on Taiwan, although
China has said during its entire 50-year-communist history that it
reserves the right to use military force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"While once understandable in theory, this outdated policy is
unacceptable in fact," the newspaper stressed.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has built itself from a tiny and corrupt province into a
formidable economic force," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reunification of China, it said that Taiwan has
seen little reason for the past 50 years to rejoin the mainland under

    <HEADLINE>EL SALVADOR REPLACES ENVOY TO ROC OVER SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed on Monday that El Salvador has decided to replace its
ambassador to the Republic of China because of its incumbent envoy's
alleged involvement in a scandal.</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokesman Henry Chen said incumbent Salvadoran
Ambassador David Ernesto Panama is scheduled to leave Taipei on Aug.
22 and that his successor, Francisco Ricardo Santana, will assume the
post the following day.</P>
      <P>Panama was accused of having illegally sold diplomatic automobile
license plates to local people, and Chen said his departure will mark
an end to controversy over the alleged illegal license plate deals.
Noting that the replacement of its envoy is basically El Salvador's
internal affair, Chen said the ROC government fully respects the
Salvadoran government's decision.</P>
      <P>Panama was first accused of having sold diplomatic plates to a
noted local business tycoon in 1996, but was never brought to trial
because he enjoyed diplomatic immunity.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Panama allegedly sold another diplomatic
plate, this time to a man with 14 previous criminal convictions, who
had repeatedly been accused of violating traffic rules in the central
Taiwan township of Tsaotun.</P>
      <P>The Salvadoran embassy in Taipei refused to comment on its
imminent change of guard.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, new Salvadoran Ambassador Santana, 45,
previously served as Salvadoran ambassador to the ROC from 1985
through 1991. His wife is an ethnic Chinese. Santana studied mandarin
Chinese at National Taiwan Normal University from 1982 to 1984. He
also studied at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of
Business Administration, and can speak fluent Chinese.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the ministry will retrieve all single- and
double-digit "Shih-designation" car license plates issued to resident
foreign ambassadors here once a new head of the diplomatic corps is
determined in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry will then issue new license plates to
resident ambassadors based on their seniority.</P>
      <P>Of the 28 ROC diplomatic allies, 15 countries have set up
embassies in Taipei.</P>
      <P>At present, the No. 1 diplomatic license plate belongs to Haiti
Ambassador Sonny Seraphin, who concurrently serves as head of the
diplomatic corps. However, Seraphin left Taipei for home about a
month ago amid reports about his alleged "frivolous" lifestyle,
leaving the post of diplomatic corps chief vacant.</P>
      <P>The No. 2 license plate is presently owned by Panama, who will
soon leave his post, while the No. 3 plate is held by Burkina Faso
Ambassador Jacques Y. Sawadogo.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Ministry of
National Defense (MND) on Monday said it had established a committee
to deal with information warfare.</P>
      <P>A MND official disclosed the information at a public hearing on
the protection of Taiwan's computer systems from mainland Chinese
intrusion. He noted that "we are able to defend ourselves in an
information war, but we will not initiate an offensive."</P>
      <P>According to the official, in 1985 Beijing had already developed
its plans for information warfare, and actual implication of the plan
started in 1995.</P>
      <P>He claimed that in 1997 Beijing conducted exercises in Nanjing
and Beijing using computer viruses to interrupt broadcasting systems
and military communication systems.</P>
      <P>Those at the public hearing were also told that mainland China
has introduced advanced technology from Britain and France for use in
simulated wars.</P>
      <P>To counter the mainland moves, the official said the MND has set
up an advisory committee on information warfare strategy, and in the
future will invite experts and party representatives to study its
comprehensive strategy to combat information warfare.</P>
      <P>Regarding the safety of the island's military data, the official
said the MND computer system can be separated from outside
connections.</P>
      <P>He went on to say the ability to separate was why the
MND computer system was not affected during the July 29 islandwide
power blackout nor by recent incidents of website invasion by
computer hackers.</P>
      <P>The public hearing, held at the Legislative Yuan, was presided
over by two Democratic Progressive Party legislators, Lee Wen-chung
and Tsai Ming-hsien.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COMPUTER GIANT TO INVEST IN INTERNET UNITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Acer Group, whose subsidiary,
Acer Computer International (ACI), last week announced a sharp surge
in profits, expects well over US$1 billion to be pumped into two new
Internet-focused business groups over the next three to five years.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Singapore's Business Times on Friday, Acer
chairman Stan Shih said he also sees an expanded role for his
company's Singapore operation as the computer conglomerate makes its
long-awaited leap onto the Net.</P>
      <P>Acer announced in Taiwan last week plans to invest US$200 million
in a digital service group and another US$200 million in a venture
capital group that will finance intellectual property (IP), primarily
software, companies.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, however, total investment in the two key
projects is likely to be far higher.</P>
      <P>Referring to the venture capital group, which he dubbed Acer
SoftCapital, Shih clarified: "Acer will commit to about US$200
million, but we are expecting to raise US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>"We will invite financial institutions to invest with us, maybe
through a number of funds which combined together should reach US$1
billion."</P>
      <P>Shih said management teams will be set up to direct fund
operations in the US, Greater China and Southeast Asia from de facto
operational headquarters.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the funds themselves will be registered in different
locations, and again, Singapore is a possible choice.</P>
      <P>The Acer chairman also confirmed plans to raise US$200 million by
the end of 2000 for Acer's digital services venture.</P>
      <P>This group, a unit of which will be sited in Singapore, will
consolidate internal development efforts involving a wide range of
Internet-related products and services.</P>
      <P>This initiative will initially be funded privately, he said,
adding: "We are committing US$50 million immediately."</P>
      <P>And he noted: "Operationally, because there will be many joint
venture partners, the overall investment may be US$400 million or
more. All of this is actively under development right now. It will be
very clear by the end of this year."</P>
      <P>Singapore will be the site of a "Competence Center" responsible
for Acer's thrust in Net-based educational services, Shih revealed.
The center, an arm of the newly announced Acer Digital Services
Group, will develop the necessary technology and tie up with business
partners within the region.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
and Premier Vincent Siew on Monday received a call from Guenter
Wilhelm, vice president of Germany's Siemens Co., to exchange views
on his company's investment plan for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Last year, the electronics giant purchased US$400 million-worth
of products from Taiwan, with information industry-related products
accounting for the largest portion. In the first nine months of this
year, its Taiwan purchases have already reached US$700 million.</P>
      <P>Wilhelm told the local media after his meeting that Taiwan will
in the future become Siemens' global center for the procurement of
information industry-related products.</P>
      <P>He added that his company will continue transferring the most
advanced semiconductor technology to its Taiwan partners, and that
its investment and procurement in Taiwan will not be affected by
non-economic factors.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Lee and Siew, Wilhelm indicated Siemens'
strong desire to become the supplier of the NT$300 billion (US$9.12
billion) mechanical-electrical system for the Taiwan High-Speed
Railway build-operate-transfer project.</P>
      <P>He said his company is confident of winning the bid to provide
the system because it has outstanding power supply systems, and has
good technology and experience in the field of railway signals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YUAN DEVALUATION CALLED JUST A MATTER OF TIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  August  16  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fears that mainland China may be
forced to devalue the yuan in order to offset mounting pressures on
its economic growth are becoming pervasive with some analysts arguing
that it is now a matter of time when such a move will be made,
according to a report in The Business Times.</P>
      <P>Economists at the World Bank acknowledge that mainland China may
be hard pressed to avoid a devaluation if current adverse trends
persist, it said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the World Bank official line, the chief economist for
Asia and Pacific Masahiro Kawa says that "the disadvantages of a
renminbi devaluation outweigh the potential advantages and that the
currency should not be devalued". Privately, however, some World Bank
officials qualify such statements by adding "not this year at least".</P>
      <P>One fear is that a yuan devaluation would send an "adverse signal
to the rest of Asia. " Indonesia and Thailand in particular could be
adversely impacted by price-competitive Chinese exports. What World
Bank officials term the V-shape or U-shape recovery in regional
economies might turn into W-shaped or double-bottomed recessions,
especially if US import demand should slow.</P>
      <P>It is not only the need to improve export competitiveness in
international markets that could force mainland to abandon its
long-standing pledge not to devalue its currency. Foreign direct
investment is "down due to weaker economic activity and also because
of fears that the yuan will be devalued", noted a World Bank
official.</P>
      <P>"China is struggling," acknowledges Kawa. "It has deflation and
an economic growth rate that is decelerating each quarter . The
growth rate will be 7 percent this year but if China undertakes the
promised reform of its state-owned enterprises, it will need a
stronger growth rate. Seven percent is not sufficient to enable China
to absorb unemployment and to contain social problems."</P>
      <P>Mainland's export performance is deteriorating, thereby "putting
pressure on the exchange rate" of the yuan. But World Bank economists
are confident that the overall current account will remain in
surplus. The fact that mainland China still has a trade account
surplus and rising foreign exchange reserves makes it difficult for
Beijing to justify any yuan devaluation at this time, they suggested.</P>
      <P>Mainland needs to maintain a high level of foreign exchange
reserves to back its foreign currency debt. Mainland's external debt
in 1998 was US$145.6 billion, according to World Bank figures, and in
1999 it is estimated to rise to US$153.5 billion.</P>
      <P>A devaluation of the yuan is one factor that could upset what
World Bank officials see as a relatively promising scenario for
economic recovery in the rest of Asia. "The worst is now over and
economies are picking up in terms of gross domestic product," said
Mr. Kawa, "In the first half of this year GDP growth rates were
positive in the formerly crisis-affected Asian countries."

      <P>Qian, a former mainland foreign minister, was quoted as saying
during a meeting with a pro-unification delegation from Taiwan on
Monday that Beijing is still waiting for Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland, to retract the "special
state-to-state" theory so as to pave the way for opening
cross-strait political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Qian was referring to President Lee's defining relations across
the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship" during
an interview with Germany's Deutsche Welle radio station on July 9.
The definition has drawn furious reaction from Beijing which regards
it as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Qian's remarks, Premier Siew said the "special
state-to-state" theory simply describes facts and clarifies special
features of cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>"President Lee's definition mainly affirms reality and
underscores parity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Siew
explained, adding that the definition does not mark a shift in
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The premier went on to say that the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's mainland policy, has
issued a position paper detailing the meaning and purposes of the
"special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>"We have also reiterated on many occasions that our policy of
promoting cross-strait exchanges and dialogue as well as seeking an
eventual democratic unification remains unchanged," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC's sovereign status is an indisputable
fact, Siew said he does not think that the ROC government has to
retract President Lee's "special state-to-state" remarks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's top negotiator with Beijing Koo Chen-fu
reiterated the ROC's sincere welcome to his mainland counterpart
Wang Daohan's planned visit to Taiwan this autumn.</P>
      <P>Koo, a veteran business tycoon and senior adviser to President
Lee, said despite the recent controversy over the "special
state-to-state" theory, the ROC government still looks forward to
hosting Wang's visit.</P>
      <P>Koo, who made an ice-breaking visit to the mainland last
October, made no immediate comments on Qian's Monday call for
him to retract the "special state-to-state" theory. "I can't respond
to Qian's remarks until I obtain a full text or full information
about his talks," he added.</P>
      <P>In related news, MAC Chairman Su Chi said in an interview with
Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper that so long as Beijing accepts
the "special state-to-state" definition, the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can start negotiations on highly sensitive political issues,
including the opening of direct cross-strait trade, transport and
postal links.</P>
      <P>The ROC's top mainland policy planner told the largest Japanese
daily that the definition is mainly aimed at setting the fundamental
principle for substantive talks with communist China.</P>
      <P>"Only under this principle can Taiwan starts political
negotiations with the mainland," Su explained.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-policy planner pointed out that Beijing's
so-called "one China" principle is detrimental to Taiwan in any
political negotiations because it downgrades the ROC to a
local-level government.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that in the 21st century, cross-strait ties should
not be a "father-son" relationship as Beijing claims. "We hope
cross-strait ties will move toward a 'brotherly' or 'neighbor-like'
relationship," he noted, adding that this is what the "special
state-to-state" theory means.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE MEETS WITH LIBERIAN SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui on
Tuesday said Taiwan is willing to help Liberia to develop, as he
received Liberian Senate President Pro Tempore Keikura Bayoh Kpoto,
Madame Kpoto and other members of a visiting delegation.</P>
      <P>Lee welcomed the guests and exchanged views with them on issues
of mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee said he hoped Kpoto would make use of his
opportunity to see Taiwan's current development, and he asked Kpoto
to give his regards to Liberian President Charles Taylor when he goes
home.</P>
      <P>In response, Kpoto expressed his appreciation to Lee and said
that Taiwan was the first country to give Liberia a hand in
rebuilding after the country's civil war -- hence Liberia considers
Taiwan a real friend.</P>
      <P>Kpoto reiterated that Liberia will continue to support Taiwan's
involvement in the international community.</P>
      <P>An agricultural technical mission from Taiwan has spared no
efforts to help the Liberian people cultivate rice, and the mission
has also helped people to produce higher-quality rice, Kpoto said. He
added that he wished Lee, an expert on agriculture, would visit the
country to provide personal experience on agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Lee said in response that he would like to visit Taiwan's African
allies one day to see their development in agriculture and to offer
his expertise.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation included Sen. Thomas Nah Nimely and
House Foreign Committee Chairman Francis R. Garbo were received by
President Lee. Senior adviser to the President Ding Mou-shih, Deputy
presidential Secretary-General Lin Bih-jaw and Vice Foreign Minister
Wu Tzu-dan were also present at the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CALLS FOR FEWER FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of foreign laborers employed in
Taiwan should be decreased gradually because the island's domestic
unemployment problem is becoming increasingly serious, said the
presidential candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployed in Taiwan has hit its highest level in
more than a decade, and the problem is noteworthy and worrisome, said
the opposition DPP's presidential candidate, Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chen is now touring the island to drum up support for his
candidacy. During a stop in Tsochen, a town in the southern county of
Tainan, Chen gained a firsthand understanding of efforts to repair an
electrical transmission tower that collapsed July 30 after a
landslide. As a result of the collapse, most of western Taiwan
suffered a power outage.</P>
      <P>Later Chen turned to Jen-teh, a town in Tainan County, to address
a general assembly of the local Federation of Industries. During his
speech, the DPP presidential candidate brought up the island's
unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the island's unemployment in May and
June hit a record high, the problem is indeed critical, Chen
remarked. Lots of young workers who have failed to find jobs in
cities are increasingly going back home and being fed by their
parents, he added.</P>
      <P>There is a relationship between Taiwan's unemployment and the
government's foreign labor policy, Chen indicated.</P>
      <P>The official number of unemployed in Taiwan ranges from 270,000
to 300,000, which is about equal to the number of foreign laborers
employed in Taiwan, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>The best way to resolve the unemployment problem is not to freeze
the quantity of foreign laborers, he said. Instead Taiwan should
consider what has been done in Hong Kong and Singapore -- a gradual
reduction in the number of foreign laborers over a long period of
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS ASKED FOR HELP IN SECURING RELEASE OF DETAINED ROC FREIGHTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) faxed
a letter recently to mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to ask for its help in securing the release of
the detained Keelung-based freighter Shin Hwa and its 15-member crew.</P>
      <P>Shin Hwa was taken over by mainland China's security force in
Taiwan's territorial waters near Lienchiang County, Fujian province,
on July 31 while on a routine mission. The military-commissioned
vessel was to deliver 900 metric tons of commodities to the islands
of Matsu and Wuchiu when it was ordered to the mainland. The vessel
is now anchored at Mawei Port in Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Lienchiang County Magistrate Liu Li-chun, who was worried about
the safety of the freighter's 15-member crew, sent a letter dated
Aug. 11 to SEF asking for its help in resolving the issue.</P>
      <P>In a reply SEF said it faxed ARATS, its mainland Chinese
counterpart, on Aug. 13 to ask for coordination among the various
mainland Chinese agencies concerned so that the freighter and its 15
crew members would be released.</P>
      <P>The letter said that the detained crewmen still have not been
permitted to contact their families since the incident occurred two
weeks ago. Their families are worried greatly about the crew's
safety, and the detention of the vessel, used to deliver commodities
to Matsu and Wuchiu, has affected the supply of commodities to the
two ROC-controlled islands which are just several miles away from
mainland's coast.</P>
      <P>"In addition, according to family of crewman Wang Chih-tzu, Wang
has hypertension requiring continual medical care. The family is
worried about his health and asked ARATS to coordinate with the
mainland Chinese agencies concerned to take care of him," SEF said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AERIAL DISPLAY ON SEPT. 1 NOT A MILITARY EXERCISE: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An aerial display will be held in Kaohsiung
in southern Taiwan on Sept. 1 to mark the 70th anniversary of the Air
Force Academy, Kung Fan-ting, spokesman for the Ministry of National
Defense (MND), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press conference, the spokesman said the
aerial display is not a military exercise. He denied an earlier news
report by a foreign wire service that the aerial display was
deliberately arranged for a show of force.</P>
      <P>He said the aerial display will provide a good opportunity for
the general public to see the performance of Taiwan's "second
generation" military aircraft. But he did not say what kind of
warplanes will take part in the display.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui will inspect the aircraft and their
performance during the celebration.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said it is important to help the general public
understand the performance of the armed forces at a time when
mainland China is waging psychological warfare against Taiwan through
news media in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Rehearsals of the aerial display will be held in the mornings of
Aug. 18, Aug. 22, Aug. 27, and Sept. 1, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's lawmakers and representatives of local and foreign news
media will be invited to observe the aerial display, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the spokesman also said Monday at the regular news
briefing that the "South China Sea Fleet" of mainland China has been
conducting live ammunition shooting drills since Aug. 10 on the seas
east of Leizhou Peninsular in the southern tip of southeastern
Guangdong province, posing no threat to the safety of Taiwan. He also
said that certain mainland Chinese troops and air force units are
also conducting regular training exercises.</P>
      <P>The spokesman began on Aug. 10 to give regular briefing on the
activities of mainland Chinese armed forces after Beijing had
repeatedly released news of military exercises through news media to
intimidate Taiwan people and wreak a havoc on Taiwan's stock market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA: JAPAN'S NEW VISA SYSTEM TO BENEFIT ROC-JAPAN EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's new visa system will help
facilitate exchanges of people between the Republic of China and
Japan, Henry Chen, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Japan, which announced in June that it would affix a seal
allowing 72-hour visa-free entry to the passports of ROC citizens,
announced Monday that it was further easing visa regulations for ROC
citizens.</P>
      <P>Currently Japan offers a multiple-entry visa that permits 15-day
visits over a three-year period. Starting next month, multiple-entry
visas will permit 90-day visits over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>In response to journalists' questions, Chen said that more than
1.5 million people in Taiwan and Japan visit the other side each
year.</P>
      <P>The ROC government began offering 120-hour visa-free entry to
citizens of 12 countries, including Japan, on Jan. 1, 1994. On Jan. 1
1995, the government extended the period to 14 days for citizens of
18 countries.</P>
      <P>Japan's relaxation of visa regulations will greatly benefit
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL VOWS TO FORM SUPRA-PARTY CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   17  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian said on Tuesday that he might
announce part of his Cabinet prior to the presidential election, to
show his desire to form a supra-party government.</P>
      <P>Potential candidates for the Cabinet he will form if he achieves
victory in the March 2000 election will come from all parties, the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the minor opposition New Party, as well
as independents, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He said he is still seeking an appropriate candidate to be his
running mate in the election, but added that he has been talking to
several potential vice presidential candidates, including KMT members
and close allies to independent presidential front-runner James
Soong, the former governor of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The most essential qualification for the vice president, Chen
said, is competence, adding that he will be chosen before the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the DPP's chances of election victory, Chen said that
DPP can win if the whole party devotes itself to the campaign.</P>
      <P>He noted that it is too early to predict the impact on the
election of President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state
relationship" statement, but went on to say that the theory comes
down to a battle between Taiwan independence or reunification with
mainland China, which is so crucial that it will have to be discussed
sooner or later.</P>
      <P>The election will still be a battle between the island's two main
parties -- the KMT and the DPP -- which means there is little space
left for those running as independents, Chen claimed.</P>

Taiwan, DPP Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung said there have been widespread
rumors that the mainland might use military force against Taiwan
since President Lee Teng-hui redefined Taiwan's ties with the
mainland as a "special state-to-state relationship" on July 9.</P>
      <P>Some of these rumors have been fabricated by mainland authorities
with the aim of menacing Taiwan, while some of them are products of
the ignorance of the Taiwan people, Lin added, claiming that it is
useless to predict or analyze Beijing's reaction as this will only
lead to the loss of faith and the bargaining power to deal with the
situation.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuo-hsiung, vice director of the Institute of International
Relations under National Chengchi University, pointed out that it is
easy to see that the string of moves adopted by Beijing following
Lee's "special state-to-state" theory have been no more than "knee
jerk" reactions from a totalitarian regime.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said, it is hard to forecast Beijing's next moves as
the Chinese communist regime is now caught in a trap of its own
devising -- having to win the hearts of the Taiwan people while at
the same time recovering its lost face.</P>
      <P>The most feasible development will be that Beijing will continue
to intimidate Taiwan, in addition to conducting small-scale military
maneuvers in the runup to Taiwan's next presidential elections slated
for March 2000, he said.</P>
      <P>W.Y. Chang, director of the Mainland China Affairs Institute at
Tamkang University, said Beijing will use the promised autumn visit
by top mainland negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan as its prime
bargaining chip to keep pressure on Taiwan, coupled with verbal
attacks, military intimidation and psychological war.</P>
      <P>Wang is chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), which handles the mainland's
unofficial exchanges with the island in the absence of formal
contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>In view of the current situation across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan
cannot afford to allow the mainland to have any excuse to use force
against it, Chang asserted, saying that the two sides should further
boost communication and understanding to mend their differences.</P>
      <P>"Suspending bilateral dialogue is not the way to clarify the
facts if something happens," he noted.</P>
      <P>Pan Shih-tang, a mainland China affairs professor at Tamkang
University, said he believes that the mainland will continue its
military pressure on Taiwan until the March election, but will
refrain from instigating another missile crisis in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Keeping open the invitation to Wang is the best countermeasure to
curb mainland China's verbal attacks and saber rattling, he
suggested.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) under the
Executive Yuan launched a new website, "Health 99," on Chinese
Valentine's Day to highlight the fact that the public can now use the
Internet to download the latest health information.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Director-General Yang Chi-liang said his department
had been working on the "Health 99" website for the past two years.
The website was established to provide better health information to
the public, especially teenagers. Yang noted that the public can now
obtain the latest health information from his department simply by
using a computer.</P>
      <P>The website offers a variety of material, including information
on healthy mobile phones and on popular and current issues, as well
as medical advice. The site will also include health news and a
health poll.</P>
      <P>Yang said the website is user-friendly and provides visitors with
a complete introduction after they log-in.</P>
      <P>The DOH expressed their hope that all citizens will have a
Chinese Valentine's day that is healthier and more informative as a
result of the website. In the future the site will allow the public
to subscribe through e-mail to pamphlets or films on health issues.</P>
      <P>"The website 'Health 99', will benefit all ages, no matter what
their health needs are," Yang said, adding that "our education system
needs 'Health 99' so students can receive sufficient physical health
information."

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Justice Ministry's Investigation Bureau
(JMIB) on Tuesday denied local media reports that over 30,000 Taiwan
people have been recruited by mainland China to work as spies in
Taiwan for the communist regime.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the reports, the JMIB clarified in a press release
that the figure actually represents the number of Taiwan people
residing in mainland China, not the number of Taiwan people serving
as spies for mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the JMIB, the figure reported by the local media was
taken from a general report issued in June this year on mainland
China's commercial organizations dealing with Taiwan, which was taken
in turn from a Sept. 6, 1992 People's Daily news reports on the
mainland's seventh National Congress. The JMIB stressed that the
number was cited by the congress in reference only to the number of
Taiwan people living in the mainland.</P>
      <P>It is rare for the Investigation Bureau to issue a press release
to refute media reports, but an official said on this occasion that
the action "was necessary to clarify the matter."</P>

(By Neil Lu and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The funeral of three of the four
Taiwan students killed in a traffic accident last Thursday was held
on Monday in Rexburg, Idaho.</P>
      <P>The four students, Chen Hsueh-chou, Weng Hui-ya, Lu Chih-jen and
Chao Chih-ying, were killed on Aug. 12 when a van in which they were
traveling, driven by Hsueh Ya-wen, rolled over near Fremont County,
eastern Idaho, while en route to Yellowstone National Park from New
York, where they were studying.</P>
      <P>Hsueh and five other Taiwan students were injured in the
accident. Among them, Kuo Wei-chieh was seriously wounded and still
in intensive care as of press time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Fremont County police department published a
formal investigation report on the accident.</P>
      <P>According to the report, speeding was the main cause of the
accident. Experts who examined the wreckage determined that the van
was traveling at 78-82 miles per hour, far in excess of the 55 miles
per hour limit.</P>
      <P>According to one of the injured students, the van rolled
over after Hsueh swerved to avoid hitting a squirrel that suddenly
appeared on the road, but a police officer cast doubt on the story,
noting that the skid marks left by the van's tires did not suggest
that the brakes were hit suddenly.</P>
      <P>The police officer told CNA that Hsueh was both physically and
mentally injured by the accident, and added that both the local
prosecutors and police believe that even if Hsueh was negligent,
taking legal action against her would be "unnecessary and
meaningless."</P>

    <HEADLINE>STATE-TO-STATE TIES COULD BE A TOPIC OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The special state-to-state ties between
Taiwan and mainland China could be an issue on the agenda of dialogue
between Taipei and Beijing rather than a barrier to such talks, a
mainland China affairs official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said that Taipei would not respond to Beijing's assertions that it is
still waiting for Taiwan to withdraw its claims that cross-Taiwan
Strait ties are "a special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Emerging from a meeting on mainland China affairs with Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) leaders, Wu told waiting reporters that
Taipei has made its approach to Beijing very clear and there is no
need for further explanation.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to reports that Beijing's Vice Premier Qian
Qichen told a pro-reunification Taiwan group in Beijing on Monday
that Beijing is waiting for Taipei to back down before going ahead
with the planned Taiwan visit by Beijing's top negotiator Wang Daohan
this autumn.</P>
      <P>Although he said he could not comment without seeing the text of
Qian's statement, Wu expressed the hope that Wang will visit as
scheduled. Such a visit, he said, "would deepen his understanding of
Taiwan, and he would even be able to challenge the state-to-state
theory during his dialogue with his Taiwan counterpart Koo Chen-fu."</P>
      <P>"Face-to-face talks are better than rhetoric and a war of words
in terms of sorting out mutual differences," Wu went on.</P>
      <P>Beijing which considers Taiwan a part of China, was enraged by
Taipei's claims in July that Taipei-Beijing ties should be put on a
state-to-state basis.</P>
      <P>It demanded an explanation from Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, only to return the written explanation unopened
on July 30 as "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>In his meeting with the leaders of the pro-independence DPP, Wu
warned that political dialogue with Beijing is inevitable, and that
local political parties should brace for the encounter by working out
a united front.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing is adhering to its policy of "peaceful
reunification with Taiwan" and its "one Country, two systems"
formula, Wu said it is obviously that Beijing will refrain from using
force against Taiwan, provided the island does not outright declare
independence.</P>
      <P>To counter Beijing's attempts to annex Taiwan via political
pressure, military intimidation, diplomatic isolation and economic
integration, Wu said Taipei is pressing on with its economic
development, improvement of democracy, consolidation of internal
solidarity and strengthening of defense capability.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials have become more conservative on whether the ROC will be
allowed to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) by the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu admitted on Tuesday that
various elements still need to be overcome, but stressed that WTO
entry by the yearend is still the goal the government is striving for.</P>
      <P>He said that a working committee will be held in late September
or October in Geneva to complete the documentary legalization
procedures.</P>
      <P>Lin was speaking as chair of an ad hoc committee on ROC entry
into world economic and trade organizations at the Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT). More than 70 officials from various government agencies
attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the outlook for the ROC's WTO entry, Lin told the
participants that some countries are in favor of mainland China being
granted entry earlier than Taiwan, although not the United States,
Canada or the European Union, judging from the results of the
extraordinary working committee meeting in Geneva on July 30.</P>
      <P>Due to WTO member nations' failure to reach consensus on mainland
China's WTO membership, it is difficult to say whether Taiwan will be
admitted by the end of this year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on whether the United States and mainland China will

    <HEADLINE>ITALIAN CLERGYMAN-DOCTOR WON ESTEEM WITH DEDICATED SERVICES (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Italian clergyman-doctor Bro. Davide Luigi
Giordan, who devoted more than 50 years of his life to the sick on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, has died of heart failure in Penghu
off Taiwan's southwestern coast.</P>
      <P>The 75-year-old director of St. Camillus Hospital in Penghu was
found dead in his office by one of his colleagues on Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>"I found Bro. Giordan `sleeping' on a chair when I went to his
office to invite him to dinner at around 6 p.m.," Bro. Paul Han
Kuo-chien recalled.</P>
      <P>When Giordan failed to respond to Han's attempts to wake him, Han
alerted hospital medical staff to administer emergency treatment, but
they were unable to revive the respected doctor.</P>
      <P>Giordan's sudden death shocked and saddened all the hospital
staff, who still remembered vividly their boss' broad smile after a
ceremonial mass earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ming-man, a nurse who had worked with Giordan for 35 years,
said Giordan died quietly and peacefully. "His face shone with
glimpses of light. We believe that was an honor bestowed on him by
God in recognition of his devotion to his Chinese patients," an
emotional Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Many Penghu residents who went to the hospital's outpatient
department on Monday broke into tears when they learned of Giordan's
passing. The bearded Italian was admired throughout the community for
his professionalism, devoted service, kindness and good humor.</P>
      <P>"Despite his failing health in recent years, Giordan had never
hesitated to donate his blood whenever any patient at the hospital
needed type B blood. Throughout his life here, he donated more than
37,500 c.c. of his blood to local patients," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>One 70-year-old female Penghu resident said Giordan had often led
a group of young doctors around the rural communities of the offshore
Penghu County to offer free medical services in the 1950-1980s. "He
was the most diligent doctor here," she said, adding that nearly all
Penghu residents aged over 40 have received his medical services at
one time or another.</P>
      <P>Giordan became determined to help the needy at a very early age,
and joined the Catholic Camillians Society at the tender age of 12.
In addition to abiding by the Camillians' stringent discipline,
Giordan privately swore himself to serving patients, particularly
those suffering from dangerous contagious diseases.</P>
      <P>Ten years after joining the Camillians, the Catholic church sent
him to care for leprosy patients in the remote southwestern Chinese
province of Yunnan in 1946.</P>
      <P>Giordan felt heartsick when he saw Chinese leprosy patients
banished into isolation in the barren mountain region. To offer
better treatment for those patients, he and his Catholic colleagues
built two sanitariums and a hospital with funds raised in Italy.</P>
      <P>For his efforts, Giordan was accused of spying by communist
Chinese authorities and expelled from the Chinese mainland in the
late 1940s.</P>
      <P>Although saddened by his expulsion from the mainland, his love
for the Chinese people remained unshaken after returning to his
Italian hometown. He continued his medical studies in Italy, after
which he came to Taiwan.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Giordan's first post in Taiwan was at St. Mary's Hospital in
Loutung, in northeastern Taiwan's Ilan County. During his service
there, Giordan often rode his bicycle to make free housecalls to
residents in remote townships such as Sanhsing and Tatung.</P>
      <P>Later, undeterred by Penghu's inhospitable geographic nature in
the 1950s, Giordan moved to the offshore island county in 1957, where
he cared ceaselessly for his patients until his death.</P>
      <P>Giordan continued to make strenuous efforts to raise funds for
building St. Camillus Hospital to offer better medical services for
the residents of Penghu.</P>
      <P>On his mother's advice, who once told Giordan that the best way
to protect the clergy's image was to project an image of a "loving
elder," he began to cultivate a beard at a young age, and indeed his
hirsute growth impressed many of his patients.</P>
      <P>Giordan built up a good rapport with ordinary folk, and spoke
fluent Chinese and even Taiwanese. He took great interest in
conversing freely with his patients. His good humor and kindness soon
won him the hearts and minds of many Penghu residents, and St.
Camillus Hospital quickly emerged as the largest hospital in the
fishing county.</P>
      <P>Giordan was on call 24 hours a day and always took the initiative
to work overtime. "No matter when patients visited him for emergency
treatment, he never looked tired, even at midnight," one nurse at the
hospital said.</P>
      <P>A self-effacing person, Giordan led a simple, frugal life, often
wearing clothes cast off by other priests. Over the past years, he
had received many honors for his devoted services to the residents of
Penghu, including honorary citizenship of Penghu, and awards for
outstanding and devoted medical professionals. Former Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro also presented the honor of Ordine Al
Merito to Giordan in May 1997, the third-highest honor offered by the
Italian government.</P>
      <P>However, he seldom worn his medals as he disliked publicity and
was unimpressed by such laurels. What he cared about above all else
was accomplishing his wishes to serve his patients.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Giordan often traveled to Yunnan to see leprosy
patients there, and in fact managed just a couple of years ago to
raise enough funds in Taiwan to build a modern sanitarium for
mainland Chinese leprosy patients.</P>
      <P>On the eve of his death, he was still writing a book introducing
the plight of mainland leprosy patients. The book was originally
scheduled for publication at Christmas this year, and Giordan had
been hoping to use the proceeds from the book sales to build a second
leprosy hospital in Yunnan.</P>
      <P>Hu Li-chun, Giordan's personal secretary, said Giordan felt great
pain when he was forced to part company with his leprosy patients in
Yunnan after being expelled by communist Chinese authorities on
charges of spying more than 40 years ago.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, he treasured every opportunity to work in any remote
barren land," Hu said, adding that she earnestly hopes there will be
people willing to carry on Giordan's legacy and continue caring for
Yunnan's leprosy patients.</P>
      <P>Giordan's body was sent to Loutung, Ilan County on Monday
afternoon, and he will be buried in the cemetery of St. Mary's
Hospital there after a funeral mass on Saturday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan has
shrunk by 8 percent in the first seven months of this year, in tune
with a trend since July of 1998, an economics official said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu told a committee for
narrowing the trade gap with Japan that Taiwan's exports to Japan
started to grow in January, and accumulated a combined gain of 21.4
percent in the January-July period, including a single-month growth
of 36.4 percent in July alone.</P>
      <P>Estimating that the trade gap with Japan will be US$16 billion in
1999, compared to an all-time high of US$17.7 billion in 1998, Lin
said that the makeup of Taiwan's exports to Japan has shifted away
from traditional agricultural and livestock products to electronic,
electrical and machinery goods, which bodes well for the prospects of
reversing the long-standing trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the meeting, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang
Chih-kang attributed the increasing exports to Tokyo's economic
recovery, which in turn has driven up imports, in addition to
Taiwan's efforts to pry open the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Japanese Ministry of Finance,
Wang said imports from Taiwan increased by 15.29 percent in the first
half of this year, the highest among Japan's top-13 trade partners,
and making Taiwan its fourth-largest trade partner with a market
share of 4.23 percent, compared to 3.69 percent in 1998.</P>

      <P>Fifty remodeled M41D tanks

the mainstay of the army's tank battalions.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan is unable to procure the most advanced tanks from
the United States and other industrialized countries, the army
decided in 1996 to improve the capabilities of 50 M41s with a cost

      <P>Maj. Lin Keng-sheng parachuted to safety at 8:58 a.m. after his
second attempt to land failed. Lin, returning from a routine training
mission, discovered an absence of propellant power from his
single-seater jet's engine. He ejected after efforts to correct the
malfunction proved ineffective, Air Force officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin, 36, was hospitalized with bone fractures in both his legs.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters announced on Wednesday an
overall grounding of all F-16 fighters for comprehensive safety
checks after the crash.</P>
      <P>The fighter jet crashed in an area some 6,000 feet (about 1,829
meters) south of the runway of Chiayi Airbase, part of which is
opened to civilian air traffic. Civilian air traffic at the airbase,
however, has been suspended as a result of the crash.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force has organized an exclusive task force to
investigate the accident.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew instructed both the Ministry of National
Defense and the Air Force General Headquarters to do their utmost to
look into the accident and make necessary measures to improve the
training of pilots and the maintenance of all F-16s in service in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The crash was the fourth incident involving an F-16 since the
first F-16 squadron was formed in Taiwan in October 1997.</P>
      <P>On March 20, 1998, a twin-seater F-16 B disappeared over the sea
near Penghu County, a group of small islands off the western coast of
Taiwan. The wreckage of the aircraft has not been found, and its two
pilots are presumed dead.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 25 this year, another twin-seater F-16 B crashed in
eastern Taiwan's Taitung County, and its two pilots remain
unaccounted for. The jet fighter, one of 30 twin-seater F-16 B's to
have been delivered by the United States since 1997, smashed into a
tea plantation, destroying a nearby building that was burned as a
result of fuel spilling from the crashed plane. No fatalities on the
ground were reported.</P>
      <P>On June 1 this year, a single-seater F-16 A, piloted by Maj. Hsu
Chung-wei, dropped into the sea about 35 kilometers southwest of
Green Island off the coast of southeastern Taiwan. Both the pilot and
the aircraft remain missing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE POSTPONES INTRODUCTION OF F-16'S INTO ACTIVE SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prompted by another crash of a US-made F-16
jet fighter on Wednesday, the Republic of China Air Force announced
the postponement of plans to introduce the fighters, which are still
being evaluated, into active service, while pilot training will be
extended from six months to eight, according to sources from the
Ministry of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>The introduction of the fighters into the ROC's combat forces
will definitely be delayed, MND officials noted.</P>
      <P>National Defense Minister Tang Fei, who was formerly
commander-in-chief of the ROC Air Force, instructed the Air Force
General Headquarters (AFGH) to review plans to introduce the fighters
into service, as well as pilot training, after Wednesday's crash.</P>
      <P>Major Lin Keng-sheng parachuted to safety on Wednesday morning
after his second attempt to land his single-seater F-16 A failed.
Returning from a routine training mission, Lin discovered he was
unable to obtain thrust from his plane's engine, and ejected after
efforts to correct the malfunction proved ineffective.</P>
      <P>The fighter, one of the 44 F-16s stationed at the Chiayi airbase,
crashed some 1.8 kilometers south of the air base runway.</P>
      <P>Tang also asked the AFGH to determine whether there are any
similarities among the four accidents in the past 17 months involving
twin-seater F-16 B's and single-seater F-16 A's.</P>
      <P>Mechanical and design problems could be behind the tragic
incidents, Tang said, though he stressed that attempts to introduce
them into service too quickly may also have played a role.</P>
      <P>Tang expressed particular concern over pilot training. He said it
is questionable whether ROC Air Force pilots, despite their
commendable physical and mental ability, can be adequately trained to
pilot the fighters in only six months. Noting that six months is the
required training period for US pilots, Tang said a variety of
factors, including language problems and training environments, could
make a longer training period necessary.</P>
      <P>Tang assured the government and the public that even if the
introduction of the F-16's into active service is delayed, it will
not affect the ROC Air Force's defensive capabilities.</P>
      <P>With the delivery and commissioning of 60 French-made Mirage
2000-5 jet fighters, and the introduction of 130 locally developed
Indigenous Defense Fighters (IDFs) into service, there are absolutely
no gaps in the ROC's air defenses, Tang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET CRIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid a recent spate of incidents involving
websites being hacked into on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
government has been urged to enact laws to crack down on such crimes.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the ruling Kuomintang and Legislator
Lai Shih-pao of the tiny opposition New Party jointly held a public
hearing on Wednesday, calling on the government to work out a special
law effective against this type of crime. They also suggested a
rating classification system be adopted to protect children from
being negatively influenced by pornographic websites.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the National Police Administration show
that police have managed to crack only 73 website crimes during the
period from the beginning of 1997 to July this year, while Taiwan's
online population has topped 3 million.</P>
      <P>Of the 73 crimes committed, most of them were cases involving CD
rom piracy and operating pornographic websites, according to the
tallies.</P>
      <P>However, N.P. Hsiu, director of the National Information
Infrastructure task force under the Executive Yuan, voiced opposition
to government interference in the form of special laws, claiming that
there are already relevant regulations governing Internet crime.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hsiu's view, a ranking analyst at the Cabinet-level
Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, said the less
government interference with the Internet the better, opining that
the Internet should not be controlled by governments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CONCERNED ABOUT CLINTON-JIANG TALKS DURING APEC MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is
concerned about a probable meeting between US President Bill Clinton
and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in New Zealand in
September, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu was responding to an announcement on Tuesday by the US
Department of State that Clinton will attend the annual informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in New Zealand from Sept. 12-13.</P>
      <P>As usual, Clinton is expected to take advantage of the annual
event to hold bilateral talks with top leaders from other APEC
countries, including mainland China.</P>
      <P>As the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently at odds over
the "special state-to-state relationship" theory, Taiwan is concerned
about the agenda of the upcoming Clinton-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the ROC
representative office in the United States to keep abreast of the
developments before and after the Clinton-Jiang meeting, as well as
any conclusions reached at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said it remains unclear whether the coming Clinton-Jiang talks
will focus on Taiwan-related issues, and added that he is also not
sure at the moment whether Clinton and Jiang will meet outside the
APEC framework.</P>
      <P>Beijing has intensified its saber-rattling against Taiwan since
ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined relations across the Taiwan Strait
as a "special state-to-state relationship" in an interview with a
German radio station on July 9.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China are APEC members, but because of
Beijing's opposition, Lee has been barred from the annual APEC
leadership meeting. Instead, he has to appoint an envoy to attend the
summit on his behalf. P.K. Chiang, the ROC's top economic policy
planner, will attend the 1999 APEC leadership meeting on the
president's behalf.</P>
      <P>APEC, which groups 21 economies, is a regional economic
cooperation forum dedicated to promoting free trade and investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TAIWAN PEOPLE REPORTED DEAD OR INJURED IN TURKISH QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ankara,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Kuo Chuan-hsin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Early reports from earthquake-shattered
areas of Turkey say that no Taiwan people are among those reported
dead or seriously injured as a result of Tuesday's devastation which
has left at least 2,100 people dead and more than 13,000 injured.</P>
      <P>According to a crisis center established by the Turkish prime
minister's office, there is still no way to identify whether there
are "foreigners," particularly those with Oriental names, among the
victims, because the number of casualties is so big.</P>
      <P>After a day of frantic checking, the CNA reporter was told by an
overseas Chinese leader in Istanbul surnamed Sun that none of the
20-odd Taiwan expatriates and students registered as living in
Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, have been reported dead, while only
a few of them have suffered shock and minor injuries.</P>
      <P>Similar telephone calls to relevant people in Turkey's capital,
Ankara, also found that none of the approximately 20 Taiwan
expatriates or students there have been killed or injured.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Tuesday, a children's folk arts troupe from the
southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung left Turkey for home, escaping the
killer earthquake.</P>
      <P>A 12-member tour group sponsored by Taipei's Singi Travel Agency
is leaving Turkey for home on Wednesday after concluding a 10-day
tour of the country. All members of the group are safe and sound,
according to the travel agency owner.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's quake measured 7.4 on the Richter scale and was
centered on the northwestern industrial city of Izmit, some 90
kilometers east of Istanbul.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MAGAZINE SAYS MAINLAND MAY ACT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An August attack on Taiwan by mainland
China cannot be dismissed out of hand, and that means the United
States must take steps now to deter it. But it is not too late for
the Clinton administration to act with the necessary resolve,
according to the latest issue of a conservative American magazine.</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard wrote in an editorial titled "The Present
Danger" that many China experts inside and outside the Clinton
administration who said mainland China would not escalate the
conflict across the Taiwan Strait are now saying they will not do so
until after Beijing celebrates the 50th anniversary of the Communist
Party's victory on Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>But the conservative political magazine said, "We're not so sure.
If the Chinese are going to carry out some form of aggression against
Taiwan, it makes a lot of sense to do it in the next few weeks. First
of all, the United States is now unprepared to respond quickly. From
what we gather, the Clinton administration has gone out of its way to
avoid 'provoking' the Chinese by stepping up our military presence in
the region."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the editorial noted, everyone knows the US government
goes on vacation in August. And Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait,
which also took everyone by surprise, occurred in August. If mainland
China acts quickly, they can present the United States with a "fait
accompli," it said.</P>
      <P>The weekly doubted that the United States, under the current
administration, will respond militarily to evict mainland Chinese
forces or in some other way. In fact, it said, the Clinton
administration might just choose the opposite course.</P>
      <P>Why should the mainland Chinese, or anyone else, assume that an
attack on one of Taiwan's offshore islands, or even an attack on a
couple of Taiwanese airfields, would necessarily derail either
President Bill Clinton's scheduled meeting with Jiang Zemin in
mid-September or the giant party Beijing is holding for over 300
American CEOs in Shanghai later in September? the magazine asked.</P>
      <P>If an attack is carried out, China experts and administration
officials will argue that what is most needed is intensive diplomacy
to diffuse the crisis. "Our guess is that after an attack, President
Clinton would declare it more essential than ever to meet with
Jiang," and do not bet on the Clinton administration canceling talks
on mainland China's entry into the World Trade Organization, wrote
the magazine.</P>
      <P>In the end, the editorial said, the mainland Chinese might wind
up demonstrating to Taiwan, and to the rest of East Asia, that the
United States cares more about doing business with Beijing than about
defending some small Taiwanese islands from attack. And that would
really give mainland Chinese leaders something to celebrate on Oct.
1.

      <P>Some leaders in Congress -- notably Senate majority leader Trent
Lott, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, Sen.
Robert Torricelli and House International Relations Committee
Chairman Benjamin Gilman -- have been strong in their support for
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The editorial continued that McCain called on the administration
to be "very clear with Beijing that the United States will do what it
must to help defend freedom and stability in Asia." Gary Bauer has
also been a strong supporter of defending democratic Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC SUPPORTS DEPORTATION OF ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While public sentiment in Canada seems to
support the decision to deport most of the mainland Chinese migrants
who illegally arrived off British Columbia's coast last week, a dog
that made the trip is receiving a rousing, warm welcome.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Canadians have offered refuge to "Breeze," the
golden-Lab cross, pregnant with puppies, who came across with the
illegal immigrants, said the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Her warm welcome stands in contrast to the attitude expressed
toward the people who made the two-month voyage in a rusty ship.</P>
      <P>"Go Home!" blared the front page of one West Coast newspaper over
the weekend. Another, The Victoria Times-Colonist, reported that 97
percent of respondents to its poll said the migrants -- and another
123 who arrived last month -- should be sent home.</P>
      <P>Immigration Canada appears to be listening. The department said
77 of last week's arrivals have been ordered out because they came to
Canada to make money. Only 10 of the 131 plan to seek refugee status
because many did not feel it was necessary for them to stay in
Canada.</P>
      <P>Department spokeswoman Janis Harper said for the most part, the
migrants do not express fear at the prospect of returning to mainland
China. People usually have 30 days to leave Canada after failing to
file for refugee status, Harper said.</P>
      <P>All 123 mainland Chinese nationals from the first ship, found
July 20, claimed refugee status. Most of them are now free, awaiting
refugee hearings in September.</P>

      <P>A costly, clandestine journey arranged by
human smugglers is the only route out of poverty and oppression in
mainland China for the desperate people of Fujian province, The
Canadian Press (CP) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CP quoted a recent Fujianese arrival to Canada as saying
whether by boat -- like the two groups that arrived off the West
Coast in the last month -- or more commonly by air, Fujianese know
the journey has risks.</P>
      <P>But the alternative is a hopeless existence under a corrupt
government in an increasingly crowded piece of mainland China, the
man told The Canadian Press.</P>
      <P>The man, whose refugee claim was approved last fall, did not want
to be identified because he is trying to bring his wife and two
teen-age children to Canada, the CP noted in a report from Vancouver.</P>
      <P>The refugee, who is a 43-year-old technician with a power
company, said through an interpreter that he began having trouble at
work because he is a Christian.</P>
      <P>Fujian has been fertile ground for Western missionaries, but he
said Communist Party membership, the key to job security and
advancement, is denied to adherents of any religion.</P>
      <P>Fujian is located on mainland China's eastern coast across from

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  17  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Voice of America (VOA) reported
Tuesday that mainland China continues to denounce Taiwan and threaten
military action against it more than a month after Taiwan insisted
upon being treated as an equal state in its dealings with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>But apart from threats, scare tactics and inflammatory rhetoric,
it said, "Beijing has apparently not yet made up its mind how to deal
with what it considers Taiwan's slap in the face."</P>
      <P>The US government-funded radio network reported from Beijing that
battle tanks, self-propelled artillery pieces and missiles on flatbed
trucks rumbled through the streets of the mainland capital Monday
night in a rehearsal for the giant military parade to mark mainland
China's 50th anniversary Oct. 1. But the display of military might
also had another purpose: It projected an image of strength and
resolve in the midst of what Beijing sees as a threat from Taiwan to
move toward independence.</P>
      <P>The VOA noted that mainland Chinese news media -- all of them
controlled by the government -- have been unceasing in their
vituperation against what they have called the separatist intentions
of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. Not only have they continued to
insinuate that mainland China will use force against Taiwan, they are
now reporting on military exercises and troop preparations in areas
facing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite the rhetoric, the radio pointed out, Western and Asian
diplomats in Beijing wonder just what Beijing will do to hit back at
the Taiwanese leader. They said a real debate is going on within the
Beijing regime, with hard-liners demanding some kind of military
action and moderates advising a more cautious approach.</P>
      <P>The options advocated by hard-liners include capturing small
outlying islands and firing missiles to disrupt shipping in the
Taiwan Strait. The moderates would rather put a freeze on contacts
with Taiwan until after the island's presidential elections in March,
said the report.</P>
      <P>The VOA went on to say that most diplomats agree that what action
mainland China may take depends in large part on the signals it gets
from the United States. Washington has said any attack on Taiwan
would be a matter of grave concern, "but it has remained purposefully
ambiguous about what it would do."</P>
      <P>Last week, the state-owned China Business Times acknowledged 
that the crucial issue is whether the United States would come to
Taiwan's rescue. That, it said, "is a very big question mark,"
according to the VOA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEEN AS URGING MAINLAND CHINA TO RESOLVE TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard is
expected to urge mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin to resolve
the Taiwan issue peacefully when the mainland Chinese leader makes
his first visit to Canberra in early September, a veteran writer
predicted.</P>
      <P>Paul Kelly, international editor of The Australian, on Wednesday
said Howard's "message over Taiwan will be that although Australia
has a firm one-China policy, the entire region wants this issue
resolved peacefully -- and that's a message to Taiwan as well."</P>
      <P>Kelly said the Australian government would ideally like to see
four results from the face to face talks with Jiang, who will become
the highest-ranking mainland Chinese leader to visit Australia since
Canberra recognized Beijing in late 1972.</P>
      <P>They four results are: a showpiece economic announcement; a
deepening of the two countries' political and economic partnership;
progress on efforts to release imprisoned Australian citizen James
Peng, who was kidnapped in the early 1990s, convicted of embezzlement
and sentenced to 16 years in jail; and an ongoing neutralization of
the Taiwan issue through bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>In addition, Australia wants to sell liquefied natural gas to
mainland China and wants another license for one of its insurance
firms to operate in the mainland, Kelly said.</P>
      <P>"The China relationship is where Australia benefits from its
medium-power status. While the US knows China is its potential rival

    <TEXT>
      <P>An East Timorese independence leader has
warned Indonesia that the country would be brought to a standstill by
a global network of computer hackers if Jakarta sabotaged the
UN-sponsored ballot on Aug. 30 to decide the future of the former
Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta warned of a "desperate and
ferocious" international campaign against Indonesia that included
developing a dozen special viruses to infect the country's electronic
communications systems, including aviation.</P>
      <P>He told The Sydney Morning Herald that more than 100 computer
wizards, mostly teenagers in Europe and the United States, had been
preparing a plan that would bring the world's fourth-most populous
nation to a standstill for weeks.</P>
      <P>Banks, the stock exchange and government computer systems would
be targeted in particular, Horta said.</P>
      <P>Horta, who represents the East Timor independence movement in
Sydney and outside Indonesia, said he had been contacted by some of
the people planning the attack and shown what they could do.</P>
      <P>"They definitely have the ability to do this," he told the daily

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average monthly regular income of
families in Taipei City have increased 1.27 times over the last 10
years, according to statistics released on Wednesday by the Taipei
City Government.</P>
      <P>The results, based on a survey of income and expenditure of
Taipei City citizens, show that as the economy has developed over the
period, the household revenue and savings of Taipei City residents
have also increased.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics, monthly household regular incomes
increased from NT$46,412 in 1988 to NT$105,231 in 1998, and jumped
again in the first half of 1999 to NT$113,836. During the same
10-year period, disposable income went up 1.29 times, while savings
increased 1.92 times.</P>
      <P>However, the percentage of average household consumption compared
to household earnings has dropped, posting a downward trend from
80.81 percent in 1988 to 75.53 percent in 1998, and a further drop to
72.58 percent during the January-June period of 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Engel Coefficient, which gauges living standards
by comparing a family's eating expenses as a percentage of total
family expenditure, posted a decrease from 29.88 percent in
1988 to 21.6 percent in 1998, while the coefficient for the first
half of 1999 was 21.56 percent. The lower the Engel Coefficient, the
higher the standard of living.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Engel Coefficient for 1998 was far lower than the 25.28
percent recorded for the island as a whole, showing that the city
possesses the characteristics of a highly urbanized city -- high
income, high consumption, and high living standards.</P>
      <P>The average monthly household expenditure used in dining out was
NT$1,571 in 1988, a figure which had risen to NT$3,899 by 1998, and
NT$3,886 in the first half of 1999, respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, transportation, education and recreation, and health
care expenses jumped from 7.92 percent, 12.36 percent and 4.19
percent, respectively, in 1988 to 8.27 percent, 15.16 percent, and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will host a
leadership meeting in Taipei on Sept. 7 with the participation of
senior leaders from Central American countries, Foreign Minister
Jason Hu announced on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time that the ROC has hosted a summit
meeting with its Central American allies.</P>
      <P>The ROC's diplomatic allies in Central America, including El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras, will send
their top leaders to attend the first-ever Taipei summit, Hu said.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, heads of state from some Central American
countries will arrive in Taipei as early as Sept. 3 for the
extravaganza.</P>
      <P>As Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez made a state
visit to the ROC last September, Costa Rica will send its first vice
president to attend the Taipei summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said participants to a recent Central American foreign
ministers meeting had discussed the agenda and other technical
details concerning the upcoming leadership meeting. "The theme and
meeting schedule will be finalized by the end of this month," he
added.</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) will also arrange for heads of state of two ROC allies in the
Caribbean -- the Dominican Republic and Belize -- to visit Taipei
later this year.</P>
      <P>Central America and the Caribbean are the ROC's diplomatic
stronghold where many of its diplomatic allies are located.</P>
      <P>Responding to press reports that mainland China has stepped up
efforts to court some ROC diplomatic allies to switch diplomatic
allegiance amid the recent controversy over the "special
state-to-state relationship" theory, Hu said Beijing has never ceased
its efforts to isolate the ROC in the international community.</P>
      <P>Hu said he knows that Beijing is lobbying several ROC allies to
switch diplomatic recognition. However, Hu declined to identify
those countries. He instead said the MOFA will make every possible
effort to cement ties with all ROC allies.</P>
      <P>Hu recently attended separate Central American and Caribbean
foreign ministers meetings. Hu said many allies have expressed
concern about the current Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>"I have told them that President Lee Teng-hui's definition of
cross-strait ties as a 'special state-to-state relationship' is
aimed at stressing parity in Taipei-Beijing relations and
does not mark a change in its policy toward mainland China,"
Hu said, adding that if Beijing could understand the ROC's true
intention, cross-strait ties will make positive progress.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's annual imports are expected to
register positive annual growth this year, according to government
assessments based on figures accumulated from Jan 1 to Aug. 31, 1999.</P>
      <P>Import-export statistics released every two weeks by the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) showed on Wednesday that the value of Taiwan's
exports from Aug. 1-14 totaled US$4.6 billion, a growth rate of 8.2
percent compared to the same period of last year, while imports
totaled US$4.11 billion, an increase of 11 percent. The figures
represent a trade surplus of US$490 million for the two-week period.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the Department of Statistics under the
MOF, pointed out that the island's exports for the whole of August
are likely to exceed US$10 billion, while imports should also enjoy
double-digit growth as a result of a surge in private investment and
increasing demand for imported capital goods.</P>
      <P>According to MOF statistics, telecommunication products formed
the bulk of the island's exports in the first half of August, while
agricultural and industrial raw materials, as well as capital goods,
formed the bulk of imports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export value from Jan. 1 to Aug. 14 totaled US$72
billion, or year-on-year growth of 6.5 percent, while import value
totaled US$64.8 billion, a slight decline of 0.04 percent, according
to the statistics.</P>
      <P>The island's export value started to grow from April this year,
and the scale of the decline of import value has narrowed since May,
and in fact has almost come to a halt, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>In view of the facts that Taiwan's export performance has been
robust since spring and that economic prospects are looking
increasingly bright, private investment has gradually increased,
which in turn has led to a growth in demand for imports, noted the
official.</P>

      <P>Japan has stepped up efforts to attract
tourists from Taiwan, particularly young fans of Japanese pop

      <P>A tourist marketing manual compiled by Japan's Ministry of
Transportation suggested that Japanese tourist service operators
focus their efforts on courting repeat Taiwan visitors and design
tour packages catering to the taste of young Republic of China
nationals.</P>
      <P>The Marketing Manual said travel agencies can include
sightseeing spots that once appeared in popular Japanese soap operas
or movies. It also suggested that tour guides arrange for young
Taiwan tourists to visit shops that sell products featuring popular
cartoon figures.</P>
      <P>According to tallies by the Taiwan Visitors Association, ROC
nationals made 840,000 visits to Japan last year, surpassing for the
first time the number of Japanese visitors to Taiwan, which stood at
830,000.</P>
      <P>Japanese tourist sources said more than 60 percent of Taiwan
visitors to Japan are tourists and that their purchasing power is
very impressive.</P>
      <P>Taiwan replaced South Korea as Japan's largest source of
tourists last year as South Korea was hit by a financial crisis and
economic recession.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to woo Taiwan tourists, Japan has decided
to further ease visa restrictions for Taiwan visitors. Starting
Sept. 1, multiple-entry visa holders from Taiwan will be allowed

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The famous credo of mainland China's late
Deng Xiaoping -- "to get rich is glorious" -- has helped encourage
widespread corruption despite stringent efforts by Premier Zhu Rongji
to eradicate the problem, which is expected to remain for many years
to come.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, The Australian on Wednesday reported
Chinese Communist Party cadres throughout mainland China have set
about amassing often obscene wealth by pilfering the public purse.</P>
      <P>In the first half of 1999, the endemic corruption had already
cost the mainland Chinese government about US$13 billion, and much of
it was pilfered by provincial government officials, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Money allocated for specific projects such as water conservancy
and flood control and interest earned on pension funds and government
department budgets had been siphoned off and deposited in the private
bank accounts of officials, the daily reported, quoting the country's
auditor general.</P>
      <P>Officials have employed a range of tricks to cheat the
government, such as forged tax rebate invoices, under-reporting of
duties collected on imports and exports, failure to allocate money to
designated projects and diversion of funds to other uses, such as the
building of luxury offices and apartment blocks, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported increasingly frequent protests by farmers and
workers often focus on such corrupt practices as the collection of
illegal taxes by Communist Party officials.</P>
      <P>Misuse of government funds has also been blamed for various
tragedies such as the collapse of buildings and bridges that have
resulted in deaths. In addition, corruption and smuggling have been
eating away at the fabric of mainland Chinese society since the late
Deng launched policies in 1978 to reform the economy, the daily
reported.</P>

moves forward in regard to Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
call for "special state-to-state" ties with the mainland, The Hong

      <P>The leadership reached an agreement during their meeting in the

their work for the latter half of this year should be concentrated on
"bottleneck" problems in the economy, the report quoted a Beijing

of the domestic market.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui who is also the
chairman of the Kuomintang party on Wednesday asked KMT party members
serving in his Cabinet to conduct a study on the installation of the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system.</P>
      <P>Lee described the TMD system as not only being able to meet
Taiwan's current security needs but also providing long-term
protection.</P>
      <P>After being briefed by Minister of National Defense Tang Fei on
the need for the TMD at the weekly meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee, Lee then asked party members in the Cabinet to
study Tang's suggestions on converting the island's armed forces into
a lean and mean military force as well as ways to protect the public
from a Beijing missile attack.</P>
      <P>Tang, during his 30-minute briefing, analyzed the political,
economic, defensive and psychological aspects of installing the TMD.</P>
      <P>While the text of Tang's brief was classified -- copies were
collected after the meeting -- portions were released to the media by
KMT spokesman Huang Hui-chen later in the day.</P>
      <P>Huang quoted Tang as saying that the anti-missile system is vital
to Taiwan's security, especially the low altitude defense system
which, combined with other air-defense measures, can effectively
protect the island from airborne attacks.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that missile attacks inflict more psychological
impact than physical damage, Tang urged a campaign be conducted to
lessen public fear of a missile attack.</P>
      <P>Tang said that although the TMD system can ease the immediate
threats posed by Beijing's missiles, Taiwan's security will be

JAPANESE NEWSPAPER SUPPORTS TAIWAN'S 'STATE-TO-STATE' CLAIMS</P>
      <P>Tokyo, Aug. 18 (CNA) The mass-circulated newspaper Sankei Shimbun
urged the Japanese government on Wednesday to support President Lee
Tung-hui's redefinition of the Taiwan-Beijing relationship.</P>
      <P>In its evening edition, the newspaper said in its "Tide Watch"
column that Japan should break free from the fictitious "one China"
policy, and back Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>The column, signed with the pseudonym "Multiple Eyes Dragon",
called President Lee's characterization of Taipei-Beijing ties as a
"special state-to-state" relationship, "a move that exposes the
underlying fact by clearing ideological prejudice."</P>
      <P>The column cited polls showing that 73 percent of the Taiwan
people favor Lee's new definition while only 17 percent oppose it.</P>
      <P>The influential paper said Taiwan, after a decade of democratic
and economic reforms, sharply contrasts with the
communist-totalitarian regime on mainland China, and it would be
impossible to incorporate the two systems into a "one China".</P>
      <P>As is the fact now, a "one China" can not be realized without
resorting to force -- something that is unacceptable to the
international community, the column said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the paper said, President Lee is right in pointing out
that "one China" is not an existing fact, rather, it is a goal to be
carried out in the future when mainland China has fully democratized.</P>
      <P>In other words, the only peaceful way to achieve a "one China" is
for mainland China to follow Taiwan's footsteps on the path toward
democracy, said the daily.</P>
      <P>Instead of fooling itself with the false "one China" policy, the
author called on Tokyo to review its policy toward mainland China and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The column urged the Japanese government to expand exchanges with
Taiwan in the fields of politics, economics and culture. It also said
Taiwan's bid for World Trade Organization membership should be
supported by the Japanese government as well as President Lee's
attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit next
month in Auckland, New Zealand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decision of the opposition New Party
to nominate the well-known writer Lee Ao as its presidential
candidate in 2000 presidential race has received mixed reactions on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chung-yu, a member of National Assembly from the New Party,
called Lee's nomination an "explosive story" since he had not
previously been informed of the event. Hsieh, however, spoke highly
of Lee as a well-known critic of social affairs. Hsieh predicted the
nomination would be a good selling point for the party.</P>
      <P>Hsieh doubted whether Lee would affect the number of votes former
Taiwan Governor James Soong would receive in next spring's election.</P>
      <P>Mei Tzai-hsing, a New Party Kaohsiung City Council member, said
that he supports Lee's nomination.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the presidential candidate of the leading
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), welcomed Lee as a
candidate. Chen said he hoped that the upcoming election would be
fairly contested by all participants.</P>
      <P>Former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang who is running as an
independent, also welcomed the New Party's candidate and said that
the participation of Lee will improve the atmosphere of election.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi-jen, executive secretary general for Chen Shui-bian's
campaign headquarters, said that the participation of Lee further
complicates the election. Chiu described Lee as an "explosive"
candidate.

EXPERT WARNS OF FOREIGN CAPITAL OUTFLOW IF SHARE INDEX BREAKS 10,000</P>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA) An expert on financial management warned
the government on Wednesday that foreign stock market investors will
take their profits and run once the local bourse reaches the
10,000-point mark.</P>
      <P>Dr. Cheng F. Lee from the US State University of New Jersey,
Rutgers, made the remarks during a speech delivered at Taiwan's
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Lee, a renowned financial professor and an economics consultant
to Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui, pointed out that Taiwan
is the only Asian country to have remained relatively unscathed by
the Asian financial crisis, so it is not surprising that foreign
capital rushed into Taiwan to make easy profits.</P>
      <P>However, Lee continued, one should never expect foreign capital
to stay forever.</P>
      <P>The excessive inflow of foreign capital from the beginning of the
year has already resulted in an overheated stock market and a "bubble
rally," but fortunately, the share prices gradually cooled down in
the wake of selling panic sparked by the president's "special
state-to-state relationships" remark in early July, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>He added that he considers it unnecessary for government-linked
funds to enter the market for stability as long as the stock index
maintains the 7,500-point level.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Central Bank of China and the Ministry of
Finance to take measures to slow down the appreciation of the new
Taiwan dollar.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong is
leading three other presidential hopefuls in a survey released by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soong, who will run as an independent and has been at the top of
most polls conducted by various groups, was favored by 31.3 of the
1,097 eligible voters in the DPP telephone survey conducted between
Aug. 11-13 in 23 counties and cities around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey has a margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Immediately trailing Soong was former Taipei mayor and DPP
candidate Chen Shui-bian, with a support rate of 21 percent.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, who is sure to be the presidential
candidate of the ruling Kuomintang, was in third place with 17.7
percent of the support.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, who earlier this year quit the
party he co-founded in 1986 to run in the 2000 presidential election
as an independent, had a support rate of only 0.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP said that "it released the results of the survey to
refute untrue reports" that Chen's support had fallen to a point 
below Lien.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results of the four surveys the DPP conducted
between July and mid-August, the party said that Chen's support rate
had stabilized at between 20 percent and 22 percent; while Lien's
support had increased by 4 percentage points -- from 13 percent to 17
percent; Soong's support had dropped 5 percentage points -- from 36
percent to 31 percent.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the rotation of different ruling parties would
be dangerous for the island, 56.8 percent of those surveyed said
"no", while 26.3 percent said "yes."</P>
      <P>On the controversial issue regarding Taiwan's future status, 44
percent of the surveyed said they favor an independent Taiwan, 25
percent supported Taiwan's unification with the mainland China, while
9 percent preferred to keep the status quo.</P>
      <P>The presidential race, scheduled to be held next March, was
further complicated earlier in the day when the tiny opposition New
Party announced that it had recruited the well-known author Lee Ao to
run on its ticket.

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui met with visiting US
congressman John Cooksey on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee explained his "special state-to-state relations" theory to
the Louisiana Republican representative, stressing ROC's sovereignty
in terms of history and law.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was an agro-economist before entering into politics,
also exchanged views on agriculture development with Cooksey who is
also interested in the field.</P>
      <P>Cooksey praised the development of Taiwan's intensive farming and
said he was impressed by the island's automated irrigation system.</P>
      <P>The US representative was surprised when President Lee told him
that hard-working Taiwan farmers manage to harvest grain four times a
year from the island's limited arable fields.</P>
      <P>Lee attributed the island's agricultural achievement to the
government's land reform program implemented between 1949-1953. That 
program distributed land to peasants, boosting their willingness to
work in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Lee told Cooksey that land reform has led to farmers working 280
days a year with agricultural production increasing annually.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Cooksey called on the Democratic Progressive
Party's presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>He told Chen it is unlikely that US President Bill Clinton will
change his policy toward Taiwan as only one and a half years remain
in his term.</P>
      <P>The US Congressman also reaffirmed his support for Taiwan's
participation in the US-led Theater Missile Defense program and
ensured Chen that Washington would not bow to pressure from
Beijing and back down on its commitment to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty-seven former Taiwanese soldiers who
fought for Japan in World War II protested on Wednesday in front of
the Dietmen's Hall in downtown Tokyo against what they called
insufficient compensation by the Japanese government to them.</P>
      <P>The Asahi Shinbum in its evening edition reported that the
protesters were recruited by the Japanese government during the
Second World War to construct the airport in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>The newspaper quoted Chen Ching-tsu, a 72-year-old former soldier
from Kaohsiung as saying that in October 1943, some 1,000 young men
from Taiwan were recruited to go to Indonesia to build a military
airport. The wage was 108 yen per month. He and his fellow soldiers
only received the first three months of their promised 18-month
payment. Chen claimed the remainder has yet to be paid.</P>
      <P>In 1995, the Japanese government unilaterally announced that it
would offer a compensation 120 times that of the original amount of
the unpaid salary.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that this figure was too small. Taking himself
as an example, he worked for 18 months, therefore he would only
receive 230,000 Japanese yen in compensation if he accepted the
Japanese government offer.</P>
      <P>Chen said the workers risked their lives during the World War II
,and he described the Japanese move as "inhumane."</P>
      <P>According to Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry, only 38,272 out
of a total of 84,000 former soldiers from South East Asia recruited
by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces had accepted the compensation
offer as of July 31, this year.

    <HEADLINE>MAC SAYS NO NEED TO RETRACT 'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Wednesday again turned down a
request by mainland China that it retract the "special state-to-state
relations" theory in regard to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi said that the theory
spelled out by President Lee Teng-hui early last month simply seeks
to clarify the reality across the Taiwan Strait, and there is no need
for the Republic of China government to retract it.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew made the same comment Tuesday in response to
mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's remarks that the "special
state-to-state' theory is purely Lee's own view and that Beijing is
waiting for Taipei to retract the theory so as to pave the way for
the opening of cross-strait political negotiations.</P>
      <P>Su was responding to reports that Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office
has openly asked Taipei to abandon the theory, saying that by doing
so and returning to the "one China" principle, the mainland will
be able to resume dialogues with Taiwan on political, economic as well
as a wide range of other issues.</P>
      <P>Su asked Beijing not to set any preconditions or barriers to the
improvement of cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>He said that judging from the results of various surveys,
President Lee's redefinition of cross-strait relations has won the
support of most people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The theory is the voice of a majority of people, and the next
ROC president, whoever he will be, will not deviate from it," Su
said.</P>
      <P>Su reiterated that Taiwan welcomes the scheduled fall visit to
the island by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS). "We have been very
sincere in continuing constructive dialogue with the mainland," he

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park (HSIP) remained the driving force behind the country's economic
growth in the first half of this year as both its business turnover
and exports continued to expand, the government said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>With flying-color growth of 33.6 percent in its overall business
turnover and 31 percent in exports, the HSIP is expected to continue
to lead Taiwan's economic growth, estimated to top 5.3 percent for
the year 1999, said officials from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>HSIP manufacturers and companies generated NT$284 billion (US$8.8
billion) worth of business turnover in the first six months of this
year, up 33.6 percent over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Of the total, companies of integrated circuits (ICs) contributed
NT$149.3 billion (US$4.65 billion); followed by computer and
peripheral makers with NT$97 billion (US$3.02 billion); and
optical-electronics and telecommunications firms with NT$35 billion
(US$1.09 billion), DGBAS officials quoted tallies provided by the
industrial park as indicating.</P>
      <P>In the Jan.-June period, HSIP companies exported NT$166.7 billion
(US$5.2 billion) worth of products, comprising about 10 percent of
Taiwan's entire exports in the six-month period.</P>
      <P>Of the total, the exports of computers and peripherals amounted
to NT$84 billion (US$2.6 billion), up 36 percent as compared with
those posted in the same period a year ago.</P>
      <P>The exports of ICs totaled NT$54 billion (US$1.68 billion), up
13.4 percent, optical-electronics' exports totaled NT$10.9 billion
(US$339.56 million), up 27.7 percent, and telecommunications, totaled
6.8 billion (US$211.8 million), an increase of 15.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The United States remained HSIP's largest export outlet by
absorbing NT$42 billion (US$1.3 billion) worth of products from the
park in the first half year.</P>
      <P>Japan was the second-largest export market, receiving NT$30.6
billion (US$0.95 billion) worth of HSIP-originating products,
followed by Hong Kong, NT$20.4 billion (US$635.5 million), and the

    <HEADLINE>F-16 PILOT PERFORMANCE 'COMMENDABLE': AIR FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern  Taiwan,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Lin Keng-sheng's
daring escape from an F-16 jet fighter which crashed due to
mechanical failure on Wednesday was a commendable performance,
officers from the Chiayi Airbase said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin parachuted to safety on Wednesday morning after his second
attempt to land the F-16 single-seater failed.</P>
      <P>Returning from a routine training mission, Lin discovered he was
unable to obtain enough thrust from the fighter. He was forced to
eject after repeated efforts to correct the malfunction proved
ineffective.</P>
      <P>The fighter, one of the 44 F-16s stationed at the Chiayi airbase,
crashed some 1.8 kilometers south of the base runway, while Lin
ejected to safety. He is currently hospitalized with bone fractures
in both legs.</P>
      <P>Nothing was improper in Lin's handling of the emergency and his
"abandonment" of the jet fighter was virtually inevitable under the
circumstances, said Col. Yueh Hsiu-chi, chief general staff officer
at the Chiayi Airbase.</P>
      <P>Lin, 36, a flight instructor assigned to the F-16 wing, narrowly
escaped death as he repeatedly tried to save the aircraft and did not
parachute to safety until the fighter was less than 300 feet (about
91 meters) from the ground, Yueh said.</P>
      <P>Yueh described the ejection as "daring" because Air Force fighter
pilots are trained to escape from an aircraft at no less than 2,000
feet (610 meters) from the ground.</P>
      <P>As an experienced pilot who has accumulated 2,380 hours in
military aircraft, including 220 hours exclusively in F-16s, Lin's
handling of the situation was proper and commendable, said Yueh.</P>
      <P>Yueh made the analysis to a group of Control Yuan members,
including Chao Chang-ping, who flew to the southern Taiwan airbase to
gain further understanding of Wednesday's crash, the fourth such
incident involving an F-16 since a portion of the US-made jet
fighters were commissioned into the Taiwan Air Force in 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has purchased 150 F-16s from the United States in 1992,
although only some 100 have been delivered to date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'KID BOAT PEOPLE' FROM CHINA SEEN AS 'UNUSUAL' PHENOMENON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is unusual in Chinese culture for
parents to send their children away from their homes unaccompanied, a
Canadian expert said Wednesday of the scores of migrant children
among the 131 boat people that landed in western Canada last week.</P>
      <P>David Lai, a University of Victoria professor who specializes in
China issues, said, "Based on Chinese tradition, you don't send a
child of 11 years old out of your country without guarantees of care
from a relative."</P>
      <P>"It's unusual for a parent to do that unless the parents are
crazy," Lai told The Canadian Press in Victoria, BC.</P>
      <P>Many of the Chinese migrant children who spent 60 days aboard a
cargo ship sailing from Fujian will go to British Columbia group
homes until their refugee status is decided.</P>
      <P>The estimated 53 Chinese children ranging in age from 11 to 18
years old made the lengthy voyage to BC's coast on a cramped human
smuggling ship without their parents or relatives, investigators
found.</P>
      <P>Immigration Canada officials are still trying to determine why
the children would make such a long journey to a strange land alone.</P>
      <P>"Most of the children have said they were put on the boat by
families and relatives and told to come to Canada," said Jim Redmond,
an Immigration Canada spokesman in Victoria.</P>
      <P>Since the children appear to be without family members
or relatives, the B.C. government must legally assume their
guardianship. The provincial Family Relations Act appoints the
province as the legal guardian if the child "has no guardian or if
the guardian appointed is dead, refuses or is incompetent at law to
act."</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of providing group home care for each migrant
youth is about C$8,200 (NT$172,000) per month. That includes about
C$1,200 each month for interpreters and English language courses, but
does not include medical costs.</P>

the end of the old Soviet empire they know and love.

1995: The ROC Foreign Ministry issues a position paper entitled

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA OVERRATED: BRITISH SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China, home to a fifth of
humankind, is overrated as a market and a world power that in reality
is, at best, a second-rank middle power, said a United Kingdom expert
in Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Gerald Segal, director of studies at the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London, wrote in the latest issue of
"Foreign Affairs," that Beijing clearly is a serious menace to
Taiwan, but even Taiwanese defense planners do not believe Communist
China can successfully launch an invasion.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese missile threat to Taiwan is much
exaggerated, especially considering the very limited success of the
far more massive and modern NATO missile strikes on Serbia. "If the
Taiwanese have as much will to resist as did the Serbs, China will
not be able to easily cow Taiwan," said Segal.</P>
      <P>The expert pointed out that before strategic paranoia sets in,
the West should note that the Chinese challenge is nothing like the
Soviet one. "China is less like the Soviet Union in the 1950s than
like Iraq in the 1990s: a regional threat to Western interests, not a
global ideological rival. Such regional threats can be constrained."</P>
      <P>Since the Middle Kingdom is merely a middle power, Segal wrote in
the article titled "Does China Matter?" that it is not that Communist
China does not matter at all, but that it matters far less than most
of the West think. "China matters about as much as Brazil for the
global economy. It is a medium-rank military power, and it exerts no
political pull at all."</P>
      <P>"China matters most for the West because it can make mischief,
either by threatening its neighbors or assisting anti-Western forces
further afield. Although these are problems, they will be more
manageable if the West retains some sense of proportion about China's
importance," he stressed.</P>
      <P>A strategy of "containment" would lead to a new and very
different Western approach to mainland China, Segal wrote, saying
"One would expect robust deterrence of threats to Taiwan, but not
pusillanimous efforts to ease Chinese concerns about Theater Missile
Defense.</P>
      <P>One would expect a tough negotiating stand on the terms of
China's WTO entry, but not Western concessions merely because China
made limited progress toward international transparency standards or
make us feel guilty about bombing its embassy in Belgrade."</P>
      <P>He continued that with such an approach to Communist China, one
would expect Western leaders to tell Beijing leaders that their
authoritarianism puts them on the wrong side of history, but one
would not expect Western countries to stop trying in the United
Nations to censure human rights abuses or to fall over themselves to
compete for the right to lose money in the mainland China market.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Segal concluded, until Communist China is cut down
to size in Western imaginations and treated more like a Brazil or an
India, the West stands little chance of sustaining a coherent and
long-term policy toward it.

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SAID PRESSURING US TO SUSPEND ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has written a letter to US President Bill Clinton demanding him to
cease arms sales to Taiwan amid the controversy over the "special
state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>According to reliable sources, Jiang sent the letter to Clinton
between late July and early August. Jiang demanded in the letter
that the United States cut arms sales to Taiwan and force Taipei to
back off its "state-to-state" theory and start negotiations with
Beijing under the so-called "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Informed sources told CNA that mainland China began to divulge
this episode to Washington-based China affairs experts this week,
indicating that Beijing authorities were disappointed by the Clinton
administration's failure to give any positive response to Jiang's
requests.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the Asia-Pacific Policy Research
Center, a Washington-based think tank, said Jiang's demands
reflected Beijing's concept or sentiment that the United States
should be held responsible for Taipei's insistence on its statehood.</P>
      <P>Paal, a former White House National Security Council official,
said Beijing apparently still does not understand the US domestic
political situation.</P>
      <P>The noted China hand said it is hard for Clinton to accept
Beijing's demands because he faces congressional pressure and has to
take into consideration their possible impact on next year's US
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Paal said he is worrying that Beijing may tie the Clinton
administration's response to Jiang's demands to the resumption of
its bilateral negotiations with Washington on terms for its entry to
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Such a link-up could make
resumption of WTO talks even more difficult, he noted.</P>
      <P>Beijing-Washington talks on WTO accession terms have been
suspended since the US-led NATO mistakenly bombed the mainland
Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May. The Clinton administration
originally hoped that the upcoming informal leadership meeting under
the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
will help score a breakthrough to Beijing's WTO accession. Both
Clinton and Jiang will attend the annual APEC summit meeting.</P>
      <P>The White House neither confirmed nor denied the report that
the mainland president has written to Clinton during the past month.
It only said the two presidents can talk to each other whenever they
want.</P>
      <P>Clinton and Jiang once discussed the Taiwan Strait situation by
telephone on July 18 amid escalation of cross-strait tension over
the "special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui said in an interview with a German
radio station on July 9 that cross-strait ties are a "special
state-to-state relationship," drawing furious reaction from Beijing
which regards the definition as a move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>A STRONG YEN HELPFUL TO APPRECIATION OF OTHER ASIAN CURRENCIES: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The appreciation of the Japanese yen will
help other Asian currencies maintain a strong performance, a ranking
official of the Central Bank of China (CBC) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The remarks, made by an official in the CBC's Economic Research
Department, were in reference to the yen's recent rally against the
US dollar and the euro.</P>
      <P>The yen has surged to a six-month high against the US dollar and
to its highest level ever against the euro. The surge is a result of
a combination of a consistently strong Japanese economic performance
over the past several weeks and an apparent shift in Japan's yen
policy over the past few days, according to reports.</P>
      <P>The dollar has been trading at around 110 yen recently, its
weakest performance since early February. The CBC official indicated
that the yen's current strong performance is likely to lead to a
general appreciation in other Asian currencies.</P>
      <P>The way that a strong yen affects the value of the currencies of
other Asian countries is similar to the depreciation of the Thai baht
in the latter half of 1997, which resulted in the general
depreciation of other Asian currencies, noted the CBC official.</P>
      <P>Whether the yen will rise still further against the dollar hinges
on the attitude of the Central Bank of Japan, the official said.</P>
      <P>If the yen rises too quickly, it could have an adverse impact on
the recovery of Japan's economy, said the official, adding that it
remains to be seen how the Japanese will adjust to the new situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, foreign exchange traders in Taipei said that the
appreciation of the Japanese yen and other Asian currencies is mainly
the result of a weaker US dollar and the economic resurgence of the
Asian region as a whole.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF MANIA, DEPRESSION SUFFERERS IN TAIWAN REACHES 220,000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As people living in Taiwan face more
pressure, the number of people on the island suffering from mania and
depression has reached 220,000, psychiatric doctors at Taipei Medical
College Hospital (TMCH) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a bid to efficiently treat those suffering from mania and
depression, the hospital's psychiatry department set up the first
mania and depression therepy center in Taiwan in 1998 and has
successfully healed many and helped them return to society.</P>
      <P>According to psychiatrist Chen Yi-chun from TMCH, those who
suffer from mania and depression are unable to properly handle their
emotions. For those who suffer from the disease but do not develop
symptoms, they may go undiagnosed because the disorder does not
visibly damage one's brain, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of mania include incessant talking, hyperactivity,
staying up all night, an overactive libido and an excessive interest
in shopping, Chen said, adding that those suffering from depression
display opposite forms of behavior.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that two-thirds of those who came to the therapy
center are people who have several academic degrees or who come from
high society. In most cases, symptoms did not appear until after they
were subjected to various kinds of pressure, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE REFUTES BEIJING ENVOY'S ACCUSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui is by no means a
"troublemaker," but is rather the instigator of many positive
movements that have resulted in closer exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, a Presidential Office spokesman said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Pi-chao, deputy secretary-general to the president, was
rebutting an accusation leveled on Thursday by Beijing's ambassador
to Washington Li Chaoxing that Lee has muddied US-mainland Chinese
ties with his recent statehood assertions regarding cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Li described Lee as "the biggest obstacle" to Beijing-Taipei
relations and the "biggest troublemaker" for US-mainland Chinese
ties.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Lee's "state-to-state" comments were a
deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between mainland China and the
United States. "This is a very serious and dangerous matter," he
said, and cautioned the United States against interfering in what
mainland China views as an internal matter.</P>
      <P>He also said that Beijing "cannot rule out the force option. We
want to prepare ourselves to stop any Taiwan independence or foreign
intervention."</P>
      <P>Lin refuted Li's accusation, describing it as untrue and
ridiculous. Instead, he said, Lee has been largely instrumental in
expanding private exchanges across the strait which were zero more
than 10 years ago, increasing business and trade interflow, and
increasing the number of meetings between quasi-official intermediary
bodies of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated that President Lee's "special state-to-state"
remarks referring to cross-strait relations were simply a
redefinition of existing facts and the current jurisdiction situation
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>By spelling out these facts, Lin went on, Lee also meant to pave
the way for further development of cross-strait relations prior to a
scheduled visit to Taiwan this autumn by Beijing's point-man in
negotiation with Taiwan, Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that many recent public opinion polls conducted in
Taiwan have indicated that most of Taiwan's residents support the
idea that Taiwan and mainland China should be two separate political
entities and that negotiations should be held on an "equal and
parallel" basis, so that Lee's remarks echoed the opinion of the
majority.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that Taipei still looks forward to Wang's visit
later this year, despite the rumors which say that the visit by the
chairman of Beijing's quasi-official Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait may be canceled once and for all due to Lee's
assertions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK URGED TO MAINTAIN ENVIRONMENT FOR FREEDOM OF SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) on Friday urged Hong Kong to continue to maintain the
open environment for freedom of speech which the former British
colony enjoyed prior to the 1997 handover to Beijing rule.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng made the appeal after mainland
Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen warned Hong Kong's media against
helping promote any calls for Taiwan's statehood or independence.</P>
      <P>During a meeting in Beijing with Hong Kong visitors on Thursday,
Qian said open support for Taiwan's "special state-to-state
relationship" theory is a violation of guidelines on Hong Kong-Taiwan
relations.</P>
      <P>Qian's remarks were seen as an indirect criticism of ROC
Representative to Hong Kong Cheng An-kuo's recent explanation of the
"special state-to-state" theory on a Hong Kong government-funded
radio station.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Qian's statements, Sheu said that in an open
democratic society, any person can freely express his or her opinion
about any topic. "We hope the Hong Kong authorities will uphold their
stance on protecting freedom of speech," Sheu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some Hong Kong political observers have expressed
concern as to whether the Hong Kong government will renew Cheng's
work permit after his current visa expires at the end of November.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong daily said Beijing's wrath at ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's declaration in an interview with a German radio station in
July that relations across the Taiwan Strait should be on a "special
state-to-state" basis may hinder Cheng's acquisition of a renewed
work permit.</P>
      <P>Cheng assumed his current post in November 1995 and his work
permit has to be renewed every year. According to the Hong Kong
paper, the Hong Kong government usually links its decision on whether
to extend Cheng's work permit to both his performance and the state
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong paper said Cheng's predecessor, John Ni, was forced
to leave the former British colony after Hong Kong authorities
declined to extend his visa due to his "high-profile working style."</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC MEETINGS SHOULD NOT BE POLITICIZED: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political issues should not be discussed at
upcoming meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, an official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
on Friday.</P>
      <P>K.Y. Tung, deputy director of MOFA's International Organizations
Department, said that APEC is clearly and exclusively a regional
group for promoting economic cooperation, and should therefore not
touch on political issues in any of its gatherings. He further said
he believes that political questions will not be raised in the
forthcoming series of APEC meetings scheduled to begin on Sept. 9 in
Auckland, New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Tung was referring to recent reports from foreign sources that
sponsors of this year's APEC meetings do not wish to see any
references made during the meetings to the "special state-to-state
relations" remarks that Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui made
in July to redefine cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee's statehood assertions have incurred Beijing's wrath with
Taiwan, and are also said to have had an adverse impact on
Beijing-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>Tung stressed that Taipei agrees that the "special
state-to-state" assertions should not be discussed in the upcoming
APEC gatherings, and expressed the hope that the APEC member
economies will respect and understand the basic goals and principles
behind the establishment of APEC.</P>
      <P>At this year's APEC ministerial-level meeting scheduled to be
held from Sept. 9-10, Taiwan will be represented by Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang and Finance Minister Paul Chiu, while Andrew
Hsia, director of MOFA's International Organizations Department, will
lead a Taiwan mission to an informal meeting of APEC senior officials
prior to the ministers' meeting.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, will represent Taiwan at the APEC informal leaders'
summit slated for Sept. 12-13, according to Tung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE COUNCIL DETERMINED TO CRACK DOWN ON SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
determined to crack down on smuggling involving Taiwan smugglers and
mainland Chinese fishery and agricultural produce, despite strong
protests leveled by fishermen from Hsinchu, COA Chairman Peng
Tso-kwei said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to the fishermen's protests, Peng vowed to squarely
carry out the second wave of the "Ching Hai" (to calm the sea)
Project exclusively in coastal areas off Hsinchu and Miaoli counties
in northern Taiwan and Taichung County in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Hsinchu-based fishing boats converged on the Hsinchu
Fishing Port Thursday to protest against the "Ching Hai" Project,
which they said is making it harder for them to earn a living.</P>
      <P>Peng stressed that the COA will try its utmost to protect the
fishermen's well-being, but will not condone smuggling or any illicit
activities on the seas.</P>
      <P>COA sources said they suspect that some of the Hsinchu-based
fishing boats have engaged in the smuggling of agricultural, fishery
and livestock products from the mainland. Some of the fishing boats
indeed were found to have carried packed livestock products, such as
frozen pig offal, and hauls of fish too large for the type of fishing
gear the boats had.</P>
      <P>To carry out the "Ching Hai" Project, Peng said, an active task
force has been organized with personnel from the National Police
Administration, the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau, the
Coastal Guard Command and the Directorate General of Customs.</P>
      <P>The task force will launch their surveillance missions randomly
while local government authorities in Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taichung
will conduct routine inspections on inbound and outbound fishing
boats and their crew members, Peng noted.</P>

      <P>Faculty members and students from National
Chung Cheng University returned to Taiwan from the United States on
Friday after a tragic road accident killed four and injured three
others in their travel group.</P>
      <P>Those who returned included Lee Yi-tsung, an associate professor

students from the university.</P>
      <P>Lee broke down when he recounted the accident which took place
when one of two vans in which the group was traveling swerved off the
road and crashed on the way to Las Vegas from Yosemite National Park
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he was in the lead van, and was in close radio
contact with the second one when he saw the huge flurry of sand
thrown up when the fatal accident took place.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that excessive speed was not a factor in the
accident, pointing out that the lead van was traveling no faster than
60 miles per hour. He said he could not figure out how the accident
had occurred.</P>
      <P>He implored the media not to interview the students, saying that
they were still traumatized after witnessing the tragedy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UN WANTS INDONESIAN ARMY SABOTEURS REMOVED FROM EAST TIMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United Nations has called for the
removal of Indonesian army personnel involved in deadly pro-Jakarta
militia violence in East Timor so that the Aug. 30 ballot can proceed
smoothly.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Dili, Australia's Sydney Morning Herald on
Friday reported that the entire staff of a major UN provincial office
was evacuated on Wednesday after armed militiamen took over the
streets of a southwestern town in an embarrassing protest that
coincided with a visit by Ian Martin, the head of the UN mission in
East Timor.</P>
      <P>The latest violence had already left two people dead, the daily
reported, and quoted Martin as saying that the UN now expects to see
strong action from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Martin gave a list of names of serving military personnel linked
to militia violence to Indonesian authorities because they seek to
sabotage a free poll in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Indonesian government has attacked the East
Timorese independence activist and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos Horta,
who revealed plans to sabotage Indonesia's computer network.</P>
      <P>A senior Foreign Ministry official said Indonesia regards the
threat as "extremely serious" and has referred it to the Ministry for
Political and Security Affairs for "preventive action," the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the daily also reported that Indonesia's
parliament launched an inquiry on Thursday into a bank corruption
scandal that some experts predict could threaten the country's shaky
economic recovery and President B.J. Habibie's chances of retaining
power.</P>
      <P>The scandal surfaced after an audit into Bank Bali found that its
directors had used government bailout money to pay a US$80 million
fee to PT Era Giat Prima, a little-known finance and debt-collecting
company controlled by a senior official of Habibie's Golkar Party.</P>

relations and Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang said the fire-power carried by the American warships far
exceeded mainland China's three naval fleets.</P>
      <P>Chang mentioned this episode in an attempt to convince mainland
China to end its current rounds of saber-rattling against Taiwan
simply because ROC President Lee Teng-hui declared in an interview
with a German radio station on July 9 that relations across the
Taiwan Strait should be on a "special state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>Chang said Lee's statement mainly affirms reality and does not
mark a shift in Taiwan's mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of many public opinion polls conducted after
Lee's "special state-to-state" declaration, Chang said most local
people support the definition and that less than 20 percent oppose
such a declaration.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said, all major political parties here
unanimously insist that cross-strait relations should be on a basis
of parity and equality.</P>
      <P>If Beijing disagrees with the "special state-to-state" theory,
Chang went on, it should negotiate with Taiwan for working out a
mutually acceptable solution.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, we sincerely hope that mainland China's top
negotiator Wang Daohan will visit Taiwan as scheduled," Chang said,
adding that Wang's visit can help forge goodwill and mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>Chang said he does not think that the basis for cross-strait
talks no longer exist in the wake of Lee's "special state-to-state"
definition.</P>
      <P>Chang said the 1992 "one China" principle, which allowed each
side to have its own definition of "one China," still can serve as
the basis for cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"Even though the two sides remain divided over the definition of
'one China,' they can talk to work out a solution," Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China need not think that Wang's visit to Taiwan
would mark an endorsement to the "special state-to-state" theory.
"While we disagree with Beijing's 'one China' principle, we
still sent our top negotiator Koo Chen-fu to the mainland last
year in an effort to forge rapprochement and pave the way for
resumption of regular cross-strait dialogue," Chang noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Suicide has become a danger to the lives of
the Taiwan people as an average of six people kill themselves every
day in Taiwan, according to a Min Sheng Daily report.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics released by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH), the report said women are more likely to attempt
suicide than men, while the 15-24 age group posts the highest level
of suicide attempts.</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwan's suicide levels over the past three years, the
DOH said it has not found any evidence showing that there is a "peak
month" for suicide attempts, but it added that it is worth noting
that the number of people committing suicide has been on the rise in
the past three years.</P>
      <P>In 1996, 10.24 people out of every 100,000 committed suicide,
while the figure rose to 11.43 in 1998, DOH tallies indicated. In
addition, suicide has been one of the top 10 causes of death among
the people of Taiwan since 1997.</P>
      <P>The DOH further found that suicide was the ninth-leading cause of
death among Taiwan's male population in 1998, the report said, adding
that 1.69 times as many men as women succeed in killing themselves
when attempting suicide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE CALLS FOR PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui renewed his call on
Friday for peaceful solution to disputes between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal during a meeting with Japanese lawmaker,
Masateru Nakayama, who is currently on a visit here.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Republic of China government cannot accept
Beijing's "one China" principle which downgrades the ROC to a
local-level government.</P>
      <P>Stressing that cross-strait relations can make positive headway
only under the condition that the two sides regard each other as
equals, Lee said his definition of cross-strait ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship" only affirms historical facts and
political reality and does not mark any shift in the ROC's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a German radio station on July 9, Lee said
cross-strait ties should be on a "special state-to-state" basis,
drawing furious reaction from communist China, which views Lee's
statement as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Lee told the Japanese lawmaker that the definition only reflects
facts and is also aimed at clarifying "parity" and "equality"
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee said the clarification is necessary in preparation
for serious talks with mainland China on sensitive political
issues, including eventual democratic unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that he has consistently advocated
cross-strait dialogue and exchanges. "This policy has remained
unchanged," Lee reiterated, adding that he hopes Taipei and Beijing
can continue strengthening exchanges and dialogue and resolving their
disputes strictly by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>For his part, Nakayama said he fully supports Lee's "special
state-to-state" definition as it is an indisputable fact that the
ROC is an independent sovereign state. The 10-term member of
the lower house of the Japanese Diet further said the Japanese
government should make greater efforts to promote its relations
with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNSTABLE RELATIONSHIPS RESULT IN REDUCED TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There were 157 fewer investments in
mainland China by Taiwan companies from January to June of this year
than the same period last year, according to statistics released by
the Investment Commission (IC) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
on Friday.</P>
      <P>In terms of investment value, Taiwan investment in the mainland
during the seventh-month period was off 36 percent from the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>Some 256 Taiwan investments in the mainland with a total value of
US$592.34 million were approved from January to July. This represents
a drop of 157 cases or US$336.31 million from year-ago levels.</P>
      <P>An IC official attributed the reduction to new economic policies
from the mainland, including a reinforcement on foreign exchange
controls, a crackdown on smuggling, overwhelming tax investigations
into Taiwan-run companies and stricter restrictions on export tax
rebates.</P>
      <P>The official added, however, that expectations by Taiwanese
businessmen of a devaluation of the renminbi and unstable
cross-strait relations were also factors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, inbound investment by overseas Chinese and foreigners
increased by US$100.38 million or 5.26 percent from the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>The growth indicates that overseas Chinese and foreign investors
are optimistic about Taiwan's business outlook and are looking
forward to continued economic recovery in the second half of this
year.</P>
      <P>In regard to the domestic business firms' foreign investments, 44
investment projects worth US$464 million were approved in July. While
foreign investments from domestic businesses from January to July
were up US$103.83 million in terms of volume compared with the same
period last year, there were 87 fewer investments this year.</P>
      <P>The IC official said the reason there are fewer investment cases
but a larger investment value is because many Taiwan companies are
simply increasing the level of previous investments, and these
increases are not counted as new investment cases.</P>
      <P>Approved foreign and overseas investments by domestic firms in
the seven months amounted to 430 cases, with a total volume of
US$2.09 billion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TRADE INCREASES BY 8.4 PERCENT IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's total trade increased by 8.4
percent in July, the third consecutive month of expansion.</P>
      <P>The growth reflected the continued strength of the global
electronics demand and further improvement in economic conditions of
the crisis-hit Asian economies, according to Trade Development Board
of Singapore.</P>
      <P>In particular, non-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded by 11.5
percent, marginally better than the 10.3-percent growth registered in
June 1999.</P>
      <P>The positive trend for NODX, which started in April 1999,
continued into its fourth consecutive month in July 1999. Non-oil
re-exports (NORX) fell by 3.5 percent, the third consecutive monthly
decline. The decline was milder, however, than the double-digit
contractions in the preceding months.</P>
      <P>Non-oil imports excluding aircraft and ships, expanded by 13.4
percent, following a healthy growth of 11 percent in June 1999.</P>
      <P>Despite the overall improvement in trade performance, there were
isolated export segments and markets that remained depressed.
Domestic exports of printers remained in the negative territory,
contracting by 4 percent in July 1999 after a 9.1-percent
contraction in June 1999.</P>
      <P>While domestic exports of disk drives increased for the first
time in four months, it is uncertain whether the growth would be
sustainable as price competition among the major disk drive
manufacturers continues.</P>
      <P>NODX to Hong Kong continued its downward trend, contracting by
15.6 percent in July 1999.</P>
      <P>The improvement in NODX mirrored the continued recovery of
electronic exports and the healthy growth in non-electronic exports.</P>
      <P>Domestic exports of electronic products increased for the third
consecutive month, by 8.6 percent in July 1999, after a 5.4-percent
expansion in June 1999. With the exception of printers, domestic
exports of the other four top electronic exports registered positive
growth rates.</P>
      <P>Domestic exports of non-electronic products expanded for the
fifth consecutive month, growing by 17.7 percent. The increase
continued to come from strong growth in domestic exports of
pharmaceuticals and intermediate compounds to the European Union and
disc media products to Japan.</P>
      <P>Domestic exports of oil grew by 6.2 percent in July 1999,
moderating marginally from the 6.9 percent recorded for June 1999. An
increase in oil prices continued to contribute to the growth of oil
exports in July 1999.</P>
      <P>Non-oil re-exports (NORX) fell by 3.5 percent in July 1999, the
third consecutive month of more moderate declines as compared to the
double-digit declines in the preceding months.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard
should avoid making political concessions over Taiwan during his
September meeting in Canberra with mainland China's President Jiang
Zemin, according to the Australian newspaper.</P>
      <P>Greg Sheridan, the paper's foreign editor, wrote on Friday that
Canberra "wants and needs good relations with China. But this should
not be at any price."</P>
      <P>"Howard should avoid (US President Bill) Clinton's mistakes. He
should warmly affirm China's right to join the World Trade
Organization but should not make any new political concessions over
Taiwan. He should reaffirm Australia's one-China policy but not get
into Clinton's ridiculous `three noes' formula (no Taiwan
independence, no `two Chinas' or `one China, one Taiwan,' and no
Taiwan membership of international organizations based on statehood),
which the Japanese sensibly refused to do," Sheridan said.</P>
      <P>He also urged Howard to raise directly with Jiang the continued
imprisonment of Australian businessman James Peng.</P>
      <P>"The Howard government claims (with great fatuousness) that
relations with China are at an all-time high. This can't mean very
much if Peng is still in jail. Australian indifference to China's
treatment of its own citizens' human rights is one thing, but the
rights of an Australian citizen in China are another thing
altogether," he said.</P>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Friday refused to comment on reports that mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in a latter to US President Bill Clinton demanded that
arms sales to Taipei be stopped.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, the spokesman for MAC -- Taipei's chief
policy-making body for the issues involving mainland China -- refused
to comment on the matter except to remark that MAC officials are now
in the process of trying to understand the matter.</P>
      <P>According to reports, after the hot-line conversation between
Jiang and Clinton over the Taiwan Strait situation following ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" cross-strait
relationship statement on July 9, Jiang then sent a letter to Clinton
in late July or early August.</P>
      <P>Jiang's letter, according to reports, demanded that the US cut
arms sales to Taiwan, force Taipei to scrap its "special
state-to-state relationship" theory and continue to hold talks with
Beijing under the premise of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Informed sources in the United States claim that although Jiang
made three demands in regard to Lee's remarks, there has been no
response from Clinton as of date.</P>
      <P>Clinton is unlikely to give Jiang an answer before their private
meeting at September's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
leadership forum in New Zealand, said local observers. Clinton is not
expected to provide Jiang with a satisfactory response, they added.</P>
      <P>Henry M.C. Chen, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
said at a news conference Friday that Taipei is not surprised that
Beijing is taking a high-handed policy toward Taiwan. Nor is Taipei
surprised at Washington's stance regarding Taiwan's security, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that both the executive branch of the US
government as well as the Congress have recently urged a reaffirmation
of Washington's commitment to the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Regarding the comment's the this week from Li Zhaoxing, the
mainland Chinese Ambassador to the US, who labeled President Lee a
"trouble maker" as well as the chief obstacle to improving
cross-strait relations, Chen stressed that "having both sides sit,
talk and resolve the issues peacefully" has always been Taipei's
basic stance.</P>
      <P>The Taipei side has repeatedly said that it welcomes a visit to
Taiwan by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, the MOFA spokesman said.
However, Beijing has continued to make trouble, thus straining
regional and Taiwan security, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks were echoed by the MAC spokesman Sheu as he noted
that Lee's statement did not carry the intention of causing trouble,
rather, it aimed at making peace.</P>
      <P>Sheu told the press that Taipei's position on the "special
state-to-state relationship" with regard to relations between Taiwan
and mainland China was made very clear in an official explanation
released by MAC on Aug.1.</P>

      <P>In a survey conducted by Taipei's Shih Hsin University, Soong
kept his lead over two other candidates with 29.3 percent of the
support of those interviewed, Lien followed closely behind with 24.2
percent. Chen Shui-bian, the candidate nominated by the Democratic
Progressive Party won the support of 22.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey didn't disclose the share of support for independent
presidential candidate Hsu Hsing-liang, and was conducted before the
New Party candidate Lee Ao entered the race earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>Although Lien trailed Soong in terms of support, he was

residents of Taipei City, Taipei County and Keelung County. The
margin of error was five percentage points.</P>

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Friday denied news
reports that he will meet with US President Bill Clinton at the

      <P>Premier Siew is slated to leave Taipei Aug. 30 for Los Angeles en
route to Panama for Mireya Moscoso's inauguration on Sept. 1 in his
capacity as the special envoy of President Lee Teng-huei.</P>
      <P>Several local mass media reported that Siew will seek to explain
Taipei's "special state-to-state relationship" theory to US officials
during his stopover on US soil and later during his meeting with
Clinton in Panama.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government

fabrication by the local mass media, adding "I have never heard of
such a matter."</P>
      <P>Chen said that Clinton has yet to confirm whether he would
attend Moscoso's inaugural celebration, therefore how could the
premier meet Clinton in Panama?</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry Spokesman Henry Chen made the same denial,

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S  ONE  NATION PARTY IN  CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's One Nation party has been
officially deregistered as a political party in Queensland following
Supreme Court ruling, and the party is now fighting for its survival.</P>
      <P>David Ettridge, national director of One Nation, on Thursday
rushed to Brisbane to assure One Nation's five state MPs of the
survival of the party, which is often described as racist because of
its anti-Asian immigration and anti-Aboriginal policies.</P>
      <P>One Nation is also facing pressure to reveal what it has done
with A$500,000 (US$333,333) in electoral funding, with Queensland
Premier Peter Beattie claiming former leader Pauline Hanson and her
two senior advisers -- Ettridge and David Oldfield -- used the money
like a "lotto prize."</P>
      <P>Ettridge told reporters that One Nation will appeal against the
Supreme Court ruling and will soon move to re-register the party.
But the party was dealt a second legal blow on Thursday after its bid
to extend a stay on the court ruling was rejected, meaning it lost
the chance to be re-registered.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities have
detained an Australian researcher in a sensitive area near Tibet,
while allowing an officially invited Australian human rights
delegation to visit the area, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily reported that Gabriel
Lafitte, 50, was detained on Aug. 15 while he was studying a
controversial World Bank project to resettle 58,000 ethnic Chinese in
Dulan, an area of western Qinghai Province traditionally regarded as
part of Tibet.</P>
      <P>An American Tibet language expert working with Lafitte -- Daja
Meston -- was also detained at the same time, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The Australian embassy in Beijing has raised the matter with
mainland China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is seeking further
details of his detention, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Beijing had already invited an Australian human rights delegation
to visit Qinghai to study the project that has drawn fire from local
Tibetans, foreign governments, pro-Tibet groups and
environmentalists.</P>
      <P>The delegation had conducted three rounds of human rights
dialogue with mainland China in Beijing before heading to Qinghai.
Australia believes the annual talks can help improve the human rights
situation in the mainland, but critics, including Amnesty
International and other human rights organizations, have described
the dialogue as useless and inefficient.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING-MOSCOW MIL. ALLIANCE FORMING: RUSSIAN DEFECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  19  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China and Russia are moving
closer to forming a political and military alliance to challenge the
United States and the West, a Russian defector to the United States
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The West should be alarmed by such an alliance, which will likely
be realized in the next few months and have dramatic consequences for
world civilization that cannot be overestimated, claimed Col.
Stanislav Lunev, the highest ranking Russian military officer ever to
defect to the United States.</P>
      <P>He wrote in an analysis on the internet that one of the military
ramifications of intelligence cooperation between Russia and Red
China may have been mainland China's provocation against Taiwan in
1996 when it fired missiles across the Taiwan Straits precisely at a
time when the U.S. Navy had no ships nearby. Reports are that
Communist Chinese intelligence did not have its own information on
global U.S. ship deployments but had received this information from
Moscow.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Lunev said, Communist Chinese development of the
warhead known as the W-88, reportedly stolen from the United States
by Chinese operatives, may actually have been given to Beijing by the
Russians, who had acquired this technology some years ago.</P>
      <P>He wrote in an analysis on the Internet Thursday that fearing an
aggressive NATO in the wake of the Yugoslavia campaign right on
Russia's doorstep, the Russian Federation seeks new military allies
as a counterbalance to NATO and the Russian elites are now turning to
Red China as the foremost among their new partners.</P>
      <P>Communist China also fears NATO, Lunev noted, saying that Beijing
leaders believe that NATO, especially after bombing the Chinese
embassy in Belgrade, is not genuinely a defensive organization. Also,
President Bill Clinton's justification for the Kosovo war, the human
rights issue, has been worrisome for Communist China, so they will
try to stop the Western countries from attacking mainland China for
human rights abuses in Tibet and other areas with large ethnic
minorities.</P>
      <P>The former GRU agent, who defected in 1992, said the so-called
"democratic" Russia and totalitarian Red China are proving to be
natural allies. Both have buried the hatchet on the ideological
differences that imbued hatred between the two for almost three
decades. And mainland China continues to present the world the
prospect of "real socialism -- Chinese style" under the leadership of
the Chinese Communist Party. And this, no doubt, has impressed
Kremlin leaders, who never really wanted democracy except for the
riches that come from it.</P>
      <P>Internationally, Lunev noted, both countries are standing
together, and this became apparent during the Kosovo crisis when
mainland China and the Russian Federation officially condemned NATO 
and supported Yugoslavia's ruling regime. The military ties between
Beijing and Moscow began to develop in 1992. These were, and still
are, characterized by active military sharing on the highest levels,
with ongoing cooperation in the development and production of the
most modern weapons systems.</P>
      <P>Lunev is convinced that President Boris Yeltsin, who has favored
an alliance with Communist China to counter Washington, clearly looks
with favor on these developments. And the military relationship is
moving at great speed. Both nations have already introduced
compatible weapons systems. By integrating the weapons systems of the
Russian armed forces and the Communist Chinese People's Liberation
Army, the two countries are rapidly becoming a superpower, he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lunev continued, cooperation between Russia and
mainland China is expanding in the area of intelligence, which is
laying the foundation for a climate of mutual trust in the
Russian-PRC relations, including guarantees of each other's security.
Thus, all the necessary preconditions for the strategic alliance
between the two sides are in place, and this alliance could threaten
the United States and the West much sooner than anyone thinks. (by

    <HEADLINE>TYPHOON SAM UNLIKELY TO HIT  TAIWAN: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said on
Friday that it is unlikely that Typhoon Sam will directly hit Taiwan
during the next two days as was originally forecast.</P>
      <P>Sam was situated some 400 kilometers south of Taiwan's
southernmost tip of Hengchun as of 2:00 p.m. Friday, according to
the CWB report.</P>
      <P>The wind speed near the center of the typhoon had increased to 23
meters per second from 20 meters per second, an equivalent of wind of
the ninth grade. Sam occasionally had gusts of wind of up to 30 meters
per second, an equivalent of wind of the 11th grade.</P>
      <P>The CWB originally forecast that Typhoon Sam would directly
threaten Taiwan after it struck the Philippines and turned in a
northerly direction. However, the typhoon has not followed the
direction that was forecasted by the CWB earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>CWB weathermen urged ships sailing and fishing in the Bashi
Channel, the Taiwan Strait, waters off Pratas Island, and waters off
the southeastern coast of Taiwan to be aware of Sam suddenly changing
direction.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend the CWB officials forecast that there will be
heavy rains in southern and southeastern Taiwan. While northern
Taiwan, influenced by the atmospheric current surrounding Sam, will
be hit with strong wind that includes occasional gusts of the
9th-10th grade.</P>
      <P>The CWB urged the public to use caution over the next two days.</P>

      <P>Birth parents of Desiree Leary, a

on Friday after DNA tests proved their relationship earlier the same
day.</P>
      <P>Mother Liu, who was proved to be Desiree's biological mother by
the DNA results, said she was so happy because her dream of finding
her little daughter has finally come true.</P>
      <P>Mother Liu, who personally went to the hospital to receive the
DNA match results, said she had already contact Desiree and
Legislator Chin Hui-chu after learning of the development.</P>
      <P>Chin was the major figure involved in assisting Desiree to search
for her biological parents on this island. Mother Liu and her
husband came to meet Desiree after the girl, helped by Chin, showed
up on television last week appealing for the public to help her find
her parents.</P>
      <P>Desiree was said to be born on July 8, 1979 in Taipei, and was
adopted by an American woman, Grace Leary, from the US one week later
with the help of a Taiwanese woman named Hsueh Mei.
 According to Mother Liu, she gave birth to her sixth child 20
years ago at a Taipei hospital, but was forced to drop the baby alone
there because her disabled husband could not afford to raise her.</P>
      <P>Desiree, who concluded her two-month long search in Taiwan, left

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  20 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A capitan of a Kaohsiung-based fishing
boat and two other officiers were prosecuted Friday on charges of
beating to death three mainland crewmen earlier this year aboard
their boat.</P>
      <P>The vessel, Hsiang Man Chun No. 17, of the Yu Hsiang Sea Product
Enterprises Ltd. in Kaohsiung, headed to waters off the coast of
Argentina last Nov. 15 to fish for squid.</P>
      <P>While off the coast of Argentina, Captain Chen Kun-lin, chief
officer Hsu Hsun-ai and second officer Cheng Chen-liang, unsatisfied
with the attitude and performance of mainland Chinese crewmembers
Chen Tsai-fu, 21, Chang Lin-yuan, 23, and Lee Cheng, 21, hit them
with steel bars, pipes and hammers on at least three occasions in
April, May and June.</P>
      <P>Captain Chen told police during the interrogation that the
crewmen were bound and starved to death. They died at different
times, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Captain Chen told police that two of the victims' bodies were put
in the ship's refrigerated hold while that of the third victim was
thrown into the sea.</P>
      <P>Chen then made a false navigation report that the three had died
accidentally from negligent work on board the ship. Chen forced all
his crewmembers to falsely sign his version of how the men died.</P>
      <P>Police in Koahsiung have been suspicious of the happenings on the
vessel before the boat's return to its base. They created a panel to
probe into the accusation by crew member Lee Chen-chung that he was
beaten by the captain on March 20, 1999 in waters off of Argentina.</P>
      <P>The Hsiang Man Chun No. 17 returned to Kaohsiung port Wednesday
and police immediately interrogated the crew members, leading to the
unveiling of the killings.

    <HEADLINE>US WILL  NOT RULE OUT INCLUSION OF  TAIWAN IN TMD SHIELD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>State Department Spokesman James Rubin
Washington on Thursday deliberately kept the door open for Taiwan to
join the US anti-missile program.</P>
      <P>Rubin during a press briefing said: "We would view with grave
concern any use of force against Taiwan, and we don't preclude the
possible sale of theater missile defenses (TMD) to Taiwan in the
future."</P>
      <P>The United States would help Taiwan defend itself according to
the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, and the 1982 communique
between Washington and Beijing, said Rubin.</P>
      <P>Rubin made the remarks amid increasing tension between Taipei and
Beijing over Taiwan's bid for state status when dealing with mainland
China and reports that Beijing is lobbying Washington to stop all arms
sales to the island.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Beijing's alleged demand that Washington cut off all
arms supplies to Taiwan as a long-standing position of the mainland,
Rubin said the United States would honor the Taiwan Relations Act and
supply Taiwan with weapons necessary for its defense.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has declared the island's
willingness to take part in the TMD program, Rubin cautioned that
weaponry alone would not guarantee the island's security.</P>
      <P>Instead, the spokesman touted the importance of dialogue as the
method to resolve peacefully any disputes between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Citing the US experience as proof, Rubin said tensions in the
Asian Pacific region have lulled whenever an amicable climate
prevailed between Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rubin noted that Taipei has acquired a US-made modified air
defense system -- a modified version of the Patriot anti-missile
system. This purchase, Rubin said, shows Taiwan is assessing its
capability to shelter itself from missile attacks.</P>
      <P>He shrugged off questions about whether Beijing President Jiang
Zemin in a personal letter had asked President Bill Clinton to stop
arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the leaders of the two countries have
exchanged letters several times recently, and that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has spoken with Beijing Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan many times.</P>
      <P>Throughout recent Washington-Beijing dialogue, the Taiwan issue
has hardly been raised without Beijing vocally opposing US arms sales
to Taiwan and without Washington reiterating its obligation to
provide Taiwan with arms under the Taiwan Relations Act, said Rubin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IMPORTS FAR MORE US AGRO PRODUCTS THAN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$970 million worth of
agricultural products from the United States in the first half of
1999, about 3.5 times as much as the US$280 million-worth purchased
by mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report from the US Department of
Agriculture (DOA), US farmers suffered the heaviest decline in
exports in a decade in the first six months of this year as a result
of a greater-than-expected output at home and the Asian economic
crisis, which diminished demand for and imports of American
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Except for sales to Taiwan, exports of US agricultural products
to all its top nine export outlets declined in the six-month period,
DOA officials said.</P>
      <P>Exports to Taiwan, worth US$970 million in the period, posted an
increase of 13 percent over the year-earlier level, they noted.</P>
      <P>This is the third year the United States has suffered a decline
in agricultural exports, and the declines are the largest seen in a
decade.</P>
      <P>DOA tallies showed that the exports of US agricultural products
amounted to US$23.09 billion in the January-June period, down US$3.3
billion, or 12.4 percent, from those posted in the same period of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, Taiwan was the fifth-largest
export market for US agricultural products, behind Japan, Canada,
Mexico and South Korea, and it was the only market that posted growth
in purchases among all major importers of US agricultural products.</P>
      <P>By comparison, similar exports during the same period to mainland
China fell 60.9 percent to US$280 million, the largest decline seen
among all major import countries.</P>
      <P>Similar exports to Japan, meanwhile, dropped 6.3 percent, while
exports to the European Union plummeted 21.2 percent; to South Korea,
down 24.2 percent; and to the Middle East, down 22.8 percent,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between high income and low income
families in Taiwan widened to a ratio of 5.51-to-1 in 1998 from
5.41-to-1 in 1997, according to statistics from the Directorate
General of the Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In terms of a household's individual disposable income, the ratio
between the low and high ends of the scale was 2.46-to-1, up from
2.44-to-1 in 1997.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director General Wei Duan said that the widening of the gap
between the rich and the poor is the result of increased unemployment
among families' chief bread earners, the booming development of
Taiwan's high-tech industry and the increased level of wage hikes.</P>
      <P>But Wei said that because the government has pushed actively for
all kinds of social welfare programs, the gap is narrower than it
would have been otherwise. Without the programs, Wei said, the ratio
could have been substantially higher.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 5.51-1 ratio was higher than the 4.7-1 ratio between
high- and low-income earning families in Japan last year and the
5.3-1 ratio in South Korea.</P>
      <P>But the figure was lower than the 8.6-1 ratio in mainland China,
the 9.5-1 ratio in the United States, the 8.5-1 ratio in Singapore or

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WATCHES CLOSELY TMD-RELATED DEVELOPMENTS: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Continuing to provide Taiwan with defensive
arms is the consistent policy of the United States, and Taiwan will
keep a close watch on developments relating to its proposed inclusion
in a US missile defense shield, government spokesman Chen Chien-jen
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>US State Department spokesman James Rubin on Friday hinted that
the United States may keep the door open for Taiwan to join a US
anti-missile program, saying that "we would view with grave concern
any use of force against Taiwan, and we don't preclude the possible
sale of theater missile defenses (TMD) to Taiwan in the future."</P>
      <P>The United States would help Taiwan defend itself according to
the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act and the three communiques
signed between Washington and Beijing, said Rubin.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Beijing's alleged demand that Washington cut off all
arms supplies to Taiwan, Rubin said at a press conference on Friday
that the United States would honor the TRA and supply Taiwan with
weapons necessary for its defense.</P>
      <P>Rubin said that although Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui has
declared the island's willingness to join the TMD program, weaponry
alone would not guarantee the island's security.</P>
      <P>Instead, the State Department spokesman touted the importance of
dialogue in resolving peacefully any disputes between Taipei and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan welcomes Rubin's statement amid increased
tension in the Taiwan Strait in light of President Lee Teng-hui's
statehood assertion and reports that Beijing is elbowing Washington
to stop all arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rubin's remarks are also encouraging in that they come just one
day after President Lee voiced his backing for Taiwan's inclusion in
the US-initiated TMD system and the Ministry of National Defense's
(MND) announcement that Taiwan will establish a comprehensive missile
defense system step-by-step in accordance with its financial
strength, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MND is studying the feasibility of joining the TMD
program. The MND now places top priority on building up an
early-warning system to cope with mounting mainland Chinese missile
threats and Taiwan's future air-defense needs. An early-warning
system will allow the military to quickly detect aerial activities by
enemy warplanes and thus secure more time for preparing
counterattacks, he added.</P>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing on Thursday
launched a vitriolic attack on President Lee's "special
state-to-state" assertion on cross-strait relations, Chen said
international opinion leaders have now shifted their attention from
Lee's remarks to Beijing-Taipei tensions and possible changes in the
situation in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME FOR TAIWAN TO HAVE 'PLAINER SPEAKING': REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is no bad thing that President
Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China on Taiwan has decided the time
for "plainer speaking" on cross-strait relations has come, said an
article appearing in Friday's issue of The Guardian.</P>
      <P>Written by Martin Woollacott, the article said that in East Asia
ambiguity has often been deemed a virtue, and a careful lack of
clarity has helped limit conflict between mainland China and Taiwan
in the past. But it has also fed Beijing's illusions and ambitions,
and, he added, it is no bad thing that President Lee has decided that
the time has come for some plainer speaking.</P>
      <P>On July 9, President Lee said in a radio interview that future
relations between the island and mainland China should be conducted
on a "special state-to-state basis." President Lee's remark has so
enraged Beijing that it has repeatedly threatened a military assault
on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But in Woollacott's opinion, President Lee's rephrasing of the
issue in itself is not a great shift from previous Taiwanese
formulations. The "gnashing of the teeth" on the part of Beijing only
serves to show that Lee's remark "could mark the moment when China
has to accept that Taiwan cannot be annexed by any combination of
guile, intimidation and appeal to patriotism."</P>
      <P>The problem, Woollacott said, is that "the only reliable road to
unification is through convergence, a convergence in which the
People's Republic would have to adapt far more to the democratic
values represented by Taiwan than Taiwan would to mainland principles
and interests." But one can tell that convergence is still a very
long way off, in view of Beijing's dubious record on human rights and
its lack of respect for democracy.</P>
      <P>The use of the phrase "state to state" is to establish equality
between the two sides, rather than to stake a claim to permanent
independence, Woollacott continued. If there is equality, then
unification will come about only when the Taiwanese government and
people fully agree, and they will fully agree with unification only
if it is unification with a fully democratic China, he said.</P>
      <P>Woollacott also pointed to the fallacy of Beijing's "one country,
two systems" formula devised for Hong Kong in expectation of
acceptance by Taiwan. For one thing, even while wanting to make Hong
Kong a showcase for the two systems formula, Beijing has a very
imperfect idea of what autonomy is, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) will hold a series of presentations next week to help
Taiwan manufacturers tap potential markets in Eastern Europe and
Japan, CETRA officials said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the first of the five presentations will be

      <P>They said that many high-tech manufacturers in the park have
expressed an interest in the presentation and are especially
interested in making inroads into the Japanese market.</P>
      <P>CETRA estimates that 106 Taiwan manufacturers have set up
branches in Japan so far. Among them, more than 50 used CETRA's
center in Osaka as a base before setting up footholds in Japan after
becoming more familiar with the market.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said that according to the economic indexes
released by the Japanese government, its economy has bottomed out and

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  20  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Given the high stake of stability in
East Asia, Washington should make it crystal clear that a military
move against Taiwan would be resisted by the United States, said an
American expert.</P>
      <P>Ross Terrill, a research associate at Harvard's Fairbank Center
and author of a book titled "China in Our Time" and biographies of
Mao Zedong and Madame Mao, wrote in the latest issue of The Weekly
Standard that President Bill Clinton should pick up the phone and say
to President Jiang Zemin, in the words of President Ronald Reagan,
that any attack by Beijing on Taiwan would damage US-mainland Chinese
relations "beyond repair."</P>
      <P>In a world without the Soviet Union, he said, "we do not lack the
power to hold China in balance -- and keep the peace in the Taiwan
Straits." The only problem is, "do we have the will?"</P>
      <P>Terrill noted that the United States has locked into a
Beijing-flavored "one China" policy based on a fiction. Once, in his
opinion, it may have been a useful fiction, but it has become a
dangerous one.</P>

      <P>Two medical projects led by the Republic of

said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>One of the two projects, related to the study and research of

countries and areas, according to Chan, who added that the project
will focus on the establishment of a enterovirus prevention network
to reduce the number of deaths caused by the epidemic among children.</P>
      <P>Another project approved by APEC centers on the setting up of a

    <HEADLINE>6 KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS TENDER RESIGNATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ruling Kuomintang official
confirmed on Saturday that six incumbent members of the party's
decision-making Central Standing Committee (CSC) have tendered their
resignations.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang said all the six CSC members
have offered to resign mainly because of changes in their official
duties.</P>
      <P>Among them was former Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-fan
who reportedly may throw his support behind former Taiwan Governor
James Soong instead of Vice President Lien Chan in the coming
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien will be the KMT's candidate for the 2000 presidential
election while Soong, a former KMT powerhouse, has announced his
determination to run for the presidency even without the party's
blessing.</P>
      <P>Other CSC members who tenered resignations included former
Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yi, former Kaohsiung City Council Speaker
Chen Tien-mao, former Taipei City Council Speaker Chen Chien-chih
and former Defense Minister Chiang Chung-ling.</P>
      <P>Chang didn't identify the sixth CSC member who has offered to
resign.</P>
      <P>The KMT will reshuffle its Central Standing Committee on Aug. 29.
According to KMT rules, the party's 230 Central Committee members
will elect from among themselves 17 members to the standing
committee while 16 other CSC members will be appointed by party
chairman mainly in terms of their functions.</P>
      <P>Chang said President Lee Teng-hui, who concurrently serves as
KMT chairman, is expected to present a list of appointed CSC members
next week.</P>
      <P>The KMT is also scheduled to hold the second plenary session of
its 15th National Congress on Aug. 29 to formally endorse the
party's presidential/vice presidential ticket.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien, also a KMT vice chairman, won the
support of 96.33 percent of 2,180 party congress delegates in
Saturday's primary election to qualify him for the KMT's presidential
candidacy.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to announce his running mate on Aug. 25 after
his candidacy is endorsed by the KMT's Central Standing Committee.
Lien was still tight-lipped on his choice Saturday.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Secretary-General Wu Poh-hsiung. a charismatic
Hakka politician who has made no secret his intention to seek the KMT
nomination for the vice presidency, said on Saturday after casting
his ballot in the party primary for the presidential candidacy that
he is confident in his vice presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu was quick to add that Lien should be given
more "time and room" to make an ultimate decision on his running
mate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY COULD NOT BE MY EX-WIFE, SAYS WRITER-CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acid-tongued writer Li Ao, who may be
nominated by the Kuomintang-breakaway New Party (NP) as its
presidential candidate, said on Saturday that the NP could not be the
second "Hu Ying-meng" -- his ex-wife -- because the "NP is more
merciful than Hu."</P>
      <P>Hu, a renowned actress in Taiwan during the 70s and now a
self-made sophist and writer, this year published a book on her brief
marriage to Li in which she discussed the wide differences of opinion
and ways of thinking between them -- the main cause of their divorce.</P>
      <P>To retaliate against Hu's "untrue" accusations, Li has launched
vitriolic attacks on Hu on his television talk show, and more than 40
such attacks had been made by Saturday.</P>
      <P>The party's nominee will not be decided until Aug. 29, when New
Party's National Election and Development Committee makes its final
decision.</P>
      <P>Despite the likelihood of his being nominated, Li insisted that
he will not join the New Party. He said he declined New Party
membership due to "selfish, private reasons."</P>
      <P>If he is not nominated as its candidate simply because he is not
a party member, Li said he will appeal for an explanation from the
Grand Justice on whether such a prohibition violates people's
constitutional rights.</P>
      <P>Li, meanwhile, apologized to the New Party for calling the mini
opposition party "a rotten melon" compared with the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which he described as a "big
watermelon."</P>
      <P>A nonconformist critic who has never hidden his contempt for
politicians, comparing them to prostitutes who make a living by
pandering to customers, Li said he is not like most politicians, who
turn to the side that seems to have larger political resources and
support. That, he said, is why he chose to affiliate himself with the
New Party rather than the ruling Kuomintang or the opposition DPP.</P>
      <P>Li said he never meant to offend the New Party by calling it a
"rotten melon." "I simply used the language of X-generation people to
highlight the comparison," he said, adding that New Party members
should learn "new languages" and avoid being "too conservative."</P>
      <P>Although describing the New Party's nomination of him as
tantamount to "leading a wolf into the house," Li still looks forward
to the Aug. 29 vote, saying that at least he will succeed in
injecting "new thought into the rigid party."</P>
      <P>When asked whether his controversial advocacy of the abolition of
the National Assembly and the "one country, two system" formula
concerning Taiwan's jurisdiction may backfire or undermine the New
Party's chances of winning even minimal support, Li said that the New
Party, which has already been labeled as a party that will sell out
Taiwan, stands to lose nothing. "A dead pig scares no boiling water,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Noted for his biting humor and free-wheeling criticism of
politicians, regardless of their party affiliation, Li was imprisoned
during Taiwan's period of martial law and later became the host of
his own TV talk show, which he has used as a forum for criticism.</P>
      <P>Speaking about the most recent public opinion poll, which puts
Li's approval rating at about 1 percent -- a score equal to that of
DPP breakaway Hsu Hsin-liang, Li said there are three kinds of lies
-- lies, goddam lies and the polls.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial production is expected
to grow continually in the latter half of 1999, according to
statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA made public domestic industrial production figures for
July, which showed an increase of 7.12 percent compared with the same
month last year, while January-to-July production was up 7.61 percent
from the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the Statistics Department
under the MOEA, said that due to the robust export performance of
telecommunications products, the sixth naphthalene cracker plant's
starting production and the resurgence of the international steel
market, Taiwan's manufacturing output has grown since the beginning
of 1999.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing sector in July scored 8.82-percent year-on-year
growth. Within the sector, the telecommunications industry's
19.58-percent growth ranked highest, while the chemical industry and
metal machinery industry registered growth of 10.36 percent and 3.23
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Regarding prospects for the lower half of this year, Chang
pointed out that as the third and fourth quarters are seen as the
most prosperous seasons for telecommunications products, especially
for semiconductor products, growth is highly likely.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the price of crude oil has soared
recently, together with the effects of the strategic alliance of
global petroleum plants becoming evident, as well as an increase in
both the demand for and the price of raw materials, a bright future
is expected for the petro-chemical industry, the steel industry and
the paper manufacturing industry, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said rising economic prospects for the United States and
Southeast Asia bode well for Taiwan's exporters, which is in turn
good for the island's makers of industrial products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WORKS OUT STRATEGY AGAINST POSSIBLE BEIJING BOYCOTT AT APEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has worked out
strategies to cope with Beijing's possible offensive against Taiwan
during the upcoming meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum, a senior official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>"We have finalized preparations and drawn up a comprehensive
package of measures to address mainland China's possible hostile or
detrimental moves against our country during the annual APEC
gatherings," said the official with the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
the mainland, will send a staff member of "proper level" to take
part in the 1999 APEC activities scheduled to start on Sept. 9 in New
Zealand.</P>
      <P>In the past, the MAC used to send a section chief-level
official in charge of economic affairs to join the ROC
delegation to the annual APEC ministerial-level and informal
leadership meetings.</P>
      <P>This year, the MAC is expected to send a higher-level official
to join the APEC delegation as communist China is likely to take
actions against Taiwan during the APEC event to vent its wrath at
President Lee Teng-hui's declaration of relations across the Taiwan
Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Beijing has launched saber-rattling against Taiwan since
President Lee said in an interview with a German radio station on
July 9 that cross-strait ties should be on a "special
state-to-state" basis. Beijing claims Lee's declaration as a
dangerous move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The MAC already issued a position paper explaining the ROC's
basic stance on its relations with mainland China and the true
meaning of Lee's "special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>In view of Beijing's furious reaction to the "special
state-to-state" concept, the MAC official said the ROC delegation to
the coming APEC meetings will do its best to explain to the world
the gist of Lee's definition if Beijing takes the initiative to
bring up the issue.</P>
      <P>The 1999 APEC ministerial-level meeting will be held from Sept.
9-10 in Auckland, New Zealand. Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and
Finance Minister Paul Chiu will head the ROC delegation to the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, top leaders from all of the 21 APEC member economies
will meet in Auckland from Sept. 12-13. P. K. Chiang, chairman of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, will represent
President Lee at the informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>During the APEC informal leadership meeting, US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin are expected to
hold bilateral talks on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said the ROC government will keep a close watch
on the developments concerning the Clinton-Jiang meeting. "It is our
consistent stance that US-mainland China engagements should not
undermine the ROC's national interests."</P>
      <P>Reports from Washington, D.C. said Jiang wrote a letter to
Clinton early this month demanding the United States to stop arms
sales to Taiwan and force Taipei to retract its "special
state-to-state" theory and to start talks with Beijing under the
so-called "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Clinton is expected to respond to Jiang's demands when they meet
during the APEC event in Auckland. Some observers said they
don't think that Clinton will give Beijing a satisfactory response.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said it is unrealistic for Beijing to ask the
ROC to repudiate the "special state-to-state" theory because the
definition just reflects historical facts and political reality.</P>
      <P>In fact, the official said, the "special state-to-state"
definition is only aimed at affirming parity between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait in preparation for upgrading the level of
cross-strait dialogue and laying a framework for peaceful bilateral
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MATERIAL NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR F-16 WIRING PROBLEM: AIR FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Air Force General
Headquarters on Saturday blamed last Wednesday's crash of an F-16
fighter jet on defective wiring, saying the problem was due to an
assembly error, not the material used to make the wires.</P>
      <P>Officials from the headquarters made the statement in response to
an accusation from Legislator Chen Pao-chin of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party that the Ministry of National Defense
discovered a problem with the aircraft's wiring material before
purchasing 150 of the fighters from the United States in 1992 in a
deal worth US$5.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Chen, who made the accusation at a press conference on Saturday,
said he suspected the ROC Air Force was trying to free itself of
responsibility for the crash and for three similar crashes, which
have resulted in the deaths of five pilots since March 1998.</P>
      <P>During the press conference, Chen faulted the Air Force for
investigating only the most recent F-16 crash, saying it is
apparently ignoring a government demand for a thorough and detailed
check on all F-16s serving in the Air Force.</P>
      <P>Air Force officials responded to Chen's accusation by saying that
after an F-16 crashed last March, there was a short circuit in
another of the planes. That problem was found to be the result of an
overly long Capton cable.</P>
      <P>The Air Force brought the problem to the attention of the F-16's
manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, which soon took measures to correct
the defect, the officials said. They added that the US manufacturer
also performed a check of all similar fighters in the United States
and found that the problem was the result of improper wiring system
assembly at a plant in Mexico.</P>
      <P>No material defaults were found to have been responsible for the
short circuit, which can cause a fatal explosion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>At Saturday's press conference, Yang Ying-chieh, a professor of
electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, revealed
evidence pinpointing serious defects in the Capton wires. Yang has
served for the US Department of Defense.</P>
      <P>Citing reports released by a US Navy research center, Yang said
the Capton wires are made from polyimide, an insulator that is not
resistant to high temperature and humidity. It is not suitable for
use on aircraft that fly over areas surrounded by seas, such as
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN URGED NOT TO TRY RU-486 ABORTION DRUG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) under the
Executive Yuan on Saturday urged the island's women not to use the
abortion drug RU-486, noting that preliminary clinical tests put its
failure rate at 44 percent.</P>
      <P>An official with the DOH told the media that four local medical
institutions have been authorized to conduct clinical trials of the
French-made medicine.</P>
      <P>In one of the tests, 14 of 32 pregnant women who took the drug
did not experience full abortions, with 13 experiencing partial
abortions and one woman remaining pregnant.</P>
      <P>Difference in the physical conditions of Taiwan and foreign women
and an insufficient amount of a second drug that must be taken along
with RU-486 have been cited as probable reasons for the drug's high
failure rate, which is normally around 7.5 percent abroad.</P>
      <P>DOH Director-General Chan Chi-hsien said his department hopes to
approve the commercial sale of RU-486 as early as possible, but urged
the island's women not to try it until studies show how much of the
medicine that complements RU-486 should be taken for the drug to be
effective.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   21   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 1,090 gangsters and
wanted criminal suspects have been arrested in a new islandwide
anti-crime campaign, police authorities said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) launched a "Rapid
Thunder" anti-organized crime operation Friday. The drive ended
Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>It was the six time that the CIB has launched an
islandwide anti-crime campaign so far this year. CIB officials said
similar operations will be staged in coming months as part of the
government's efforts to improve public order and reduce domestic
crime rate.</P>
      <P>Among those nabbed in the latest anti-crime sweep were three key
figures of the Tien Lai Hui, a division of the Bamboo Union crime
syndicate. The three Tien Lai Hui masterminds -- Hsiao Ting-yi, Tsai
Chung-hsin and Hsiao Hsiu-ta -- were accused of having recruited
some 500 junior high school students into their criminal ring.</P>
      <P>Also arrested were Chan Sheng-hsiung, who was accused of having
extorted money from local hospitals and clinics; Chuang Chun-hsiung,
an alleged "engineering gangster" who was accused of involvement in
manipulating bidding for a number of construction projects; and Chou
Cheng-yi, Chen Yao-tung and Chou Yu-li, who allegedly had instigated
many violent clashes between ordinary residents and law enforcement
officers on the excuse of environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Chou Cheng-yi was also accused of having poached gravel in the
Kao-Ping River for windfall profits. Chou allegedly had collaborated
with other criminal ring members in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung region to
set up illegal gravel cleaning and processing plant along the bank
of the Kao-Ping River. Chou's gang was allegedly the largest gravel
poaching operation ever seized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the continued CIB-led anti-crime operations, local crime
rate has declined steadily over the past year, according to official
tallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOALAS ATTRACT THRONG OF VISITORS TO TAIPEI ZOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two koalas borrowed from the Gold Coast
of Australia by the zoological garden of Taipei City continued to
attract a throng of visitors, with more than 20,000 people pouring
into the Mucha complex to see them on Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Although the two koalas, Harley and Patrick, have been on display
for a week with more than 350,000 visitors, local people's
enthusiasm is none the lesser.</P>
      <P>The garden's parking lot was almost full at 9:00 a.m. when the
garden opened Sunday morning. Soon after, traffic jams began to
appear on roads heading into the zoo.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain order, the garden put its entire staff on
duty. Some staff were posted in front of the koalas' cage to prevent
visitors from taking photos using flashes which could scare the two
animals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Director of the Zoological Garden, Yang
Sheng-hsiung, took a group of journalists to Tamshui, Taipei County
to show them a forest of eucalyptus trees to dispel allegations that
the Australian owner of the two Koalas was mulling whether to take
them back because of the lack of eucalyptus tress in Taiwan.
Eucalyptus leaves are the only food koalas will eat.</P>
      <P>A story in the United Daily News on Saturday said that all the
eucalyptus leaves used to feed the two koalas thus far have been
shipped in from Australia. As a result of the shipping and the
time-consuming quarantine procedure after they arrive, the Australian
leaves are often whitered and unsuitable for feed. As a result, the
koalas' owner reportedly was weighing whether to take them back
because Taiwan lacked eucalyptus.</P>
      <P>Yang told journalists that 4,000 eucalyptus trees were planted on
the hectare of land in 1997 in preparation for the arrival of the
koalas. An additional 2,000 eucalyptus trees were planted inside the
Mucha Zoological Garden complex.</P>
      <P>Yang said each of the two koalas consumes about five kilograms of
eucalyptus leaves per day. The zoo is importing from
Australia 20 kilograms per week, with the rest collected locally.</P>

Sunday denied reports that the United States will send an
official delegation to visit Taiwan.</P>

Asian and Pacific Affairs, as well as unidentified National Security
Council and State Department officials to Taipei to meet with
high-ranking officials.</P>

Taiwan Strait have not eased since President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state
relationship," in July, Clinton decided to send the delegation to
Taipei to further discuss the cross-strait as well as the
Taipei-Beijing-Washington triangular relationship.</P>
      <P>Beijing has accused Lee of pursuing separatism. The US
previously sent special envoy Richard Bush to Taipei and Assistant
Secretary of State Stanley Roth to Beijing to try to ease the
tensions.</P>

dealing with mainland China during a summit meeting next month.</P>
      <P>Tamkang University Professor Pan Hsi-tang made the remarks on
Sunday in a cross-strait relations seminar sponsored by the Chinese
Learned Society.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is scheduled to go to New Zealand to
attend the summit meeting of the Asia and Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC) September 12-13. While there, Clinton will
meet with mainland Chinese Presdient Jiang Zemin. Taiwan's
redefinition of the cross-strait relationship is expected to be at
the top of the two leaders' agendas.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that Beijing's current strategy toward President Lee's
redefinition is to monitor the situation while continuing the
pressure on Taiwan politically and militarily, and to formulate a
timetable for unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The scholar also said that Beijing will step up its combat
readiness against Taiwan and prepare a series of military exercises,
as well as redefine its relationship with the US as "strategic
competitive ties."</P>
      <P>Pan said that the US is under pressure to promote cross-strait
dialogue to avoid a repeat of the 1996 missile crisis.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Beijing lobbed missiles into Taiwan waters to intimidate
Taiwan people in the run up to its first popular presidential
election. The US responded by sending two aircraft carriers into
waters near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the US can not force Taiwan to abandon its redefinition of
cross-strait ties, Pan said the US may reluctantly accept Taiwan's
stance that both sides of Taiwan Strait are entitled to its own
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Under the circumstances, Pan said that Taipei's continued
welcoming of mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Wang
Daohan, to visit Taiwan is the best strategy to counter Beijing's
verbal attack and military intimidation.</P>
      <P>Chuang Sheng-jung, National Assembly deputy from the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, also said that with increased
cross-Strait tension, a delayed cross-strait dialogue will not in the
interests of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chuang suggested that the United States help both sides start
dialogues on a parity basis without touching on sovereignty issues so
as to create a "win-win-win" situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPERT: PRC'S RENMINBI STILL FACES DEVALUATION PRESSURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the Kuomintang's
Business Management Committee, indicated on Sunday that mainland
China's renminbi still faces devaluation pressure because the inflow
of foreign capital has decreasing sharply.</P>
      <P>Owing to the economic problems, Liu disclosed that mainland
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji was criticized by some "hawkish" opponents
last month and was on the brink of losing his post.</P>
      <P>Although Zhu and his reform plans have tided over the worst of
the financial crisis, Liu noted, Beijing's internal political scene
may ultimately play a role on whether and when the renminbi is
devalued.</P>
      <P>In addition to the political factor, the expert said, mainland
China still has some financial problems. The sharp decrease in
foreign investment is threatening the foundation that supports the
renminbi from being devalued.</P>
      <P>Once the renminbi is devalued by 15 percent, he said, the debts
incurred by the mainland's state-operated enterprises will soar to
hundreds of billion U.S. dollars.</P>
      <P>But thanks to a continued trade surplus, Liu said, the mainland's
currency remains stable, eliminating the need for an immediate
devaluation.</P>
      <P>Liu also predicted that if the renminbi is devalued by less than
10 percent, the economies of Southeast Asian countries will not be
greatly affected.</P>
      <P>Regarding the value of Taiwan's currency, Liu said, it will
depend on the values of the greenback and the Japanese yen, adding
that one US dollar to 31.5-32.5 Taiwan dollars will best reflect the
island's economic fundamentals.</P>

mostly, to establish solid ground work for the future.</P>
      <P>Market surveys performed indicated that there are between 8,000

    <HEADLINE>FORMER OFFICIAL URGES CLINTON TO STAND UP FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The danger of a shooting war across
the Taiwan Strait through mischance or miscalculation is great. To
reduce the threat of war, the Clinton administration should make
clear to Beijing that it will not tolerate any military action
against Taiwan and any aggression will be resisted by US forces in
the region, said a former US State Department official Saturday.</P>
      <P>Harvey J. Feldman, senior fellow in the Asian Studies Center at
the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, wrote in an analysis that
such a Washington response followed Communist China's threatening
military exercises in the Taiwan Straits on the eve of Taiwan's
presidential election in March 1996.</P>
      <P>The US Navy deployed two aircraft carriers and 36 ships and
submarines to the region to diffuse that situation, disclosed the
former official in charge of Republic of China affairs at the State
Department when President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>For the longer term, Feldman pointed out, the Clinton
administration must distance itself from public or veiled support of
Beijing's views regarding Taiwan. "It is not up to the United States
to determine Taiwan's future status. This right belongs to the people
of Taiwan alone, not to a government in distant Washington," he said.</P>
      <P>The former US ambassador to Papua New Guinea stressed,
"Although the United States no longer recognizes the Republic of
China diplomatically, the Taiwan Relations Act establishes that, for
all purposes of US law, Taiwan is to be treated as a state separate
and distinct from the PRC."</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration claims that promoting democracy is one
of its goals. Yet its failure to clarify America's commitment to
support the right of Taiwan's 22 million people to determine their
own future -- free from coercion or military threat -- would be an
unpardonable betrayal of American ideals and could lead to an armed
conflict with disastrous results," said Feldman.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Lee Teng-hui's remarks that the
relationship between Taipei and Beijing was on a "state-to-state or
special state-to-state basis" would be understood by a German
audience to explain why Taiwan would never negotiate with Beijing as
a province with a central government. But the Clinton
administration's reaction to President Lee's observation was almost
as intemperate as that of Jiang Zemin's government in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Agreeing to the PRC's "Three Noes" toward Taiwan stripped away
much of the necessary ambiguity in the formal "one China" policy that
had guided US-PRC and US-Taiwan relations for two decades. Faced
with this change in US policy, "it is no wonder that President Lee
was compelled to clarify Taiwan's position. It also is no wonder that
Beijing demanded that the Clinton administration pressure Taiwan to
acquiesce," explained Feldman.

    <HEADLINE>5,000 CONSCRIPTS TO BEGIN ALTERNATIVE MILITARY SERVICE NEXT JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first 5,000 conscripts to perform an
alternative to traditional military service will begin their service
next July, the Executive Yuan said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said the 5,000 will be drawn from 70,000
college students expected to graduate next June. They will then be
dispatched to perform alternative services according to their
specialties.</P>
      <P>The alternative military service is largely divided into two
categories: one that deals with social order, such as security
guards, neighborhood security watchers, assistant traffic police,
school guards, correctional officers and emergency rescue workers;
and one that deals with social work, such as social welfare workers
and environmental protection workers.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has decided that every year, 10,000 conscripts
will go into the alternative military service, meaning that they will
serve in non-military units in lieu of the traditional two years of
compulsory military service. As the system will be put into practice
in the latter half of next year, the quota for next year will be only
5,000.</P>
      <P>Alternative military service is one of several measures
considered by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) to alleviate the
oversupply of conscripts in the military, which has resulted in some
conscripts waiting for long periods of time before being called up to
serve.</P>
      <P>The MND has also considered shortening the period of military
service to allow earlier discharges of conscripts from the military.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR REMAIN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER SUNDAY'S CAL CRASH LANDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four people, including two China Airlines
(CAL) crew members injured in a crash landing of a CAL passenger
jetliner in Hong Kong Sunday evening, remain in critical condition,
CAL sources reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>CAL's Flight CI-642, a McDonnell-Douglas 11 en route from Bangkok
to Hong Kong, crash-landed in a driving rain as Typhoon Sam was
sweeping through Hong Kong. The plane, landing at an abnormal
15-degree tilt, cracked a wing, which caused a fire, and flipped onto
its back after landing on the southern runway of Hong Kong's
Chek Lap Kok Airport.</P>
      <P>Two passengers, including a 30-year-old Taiwanese man named Lin
Keng-hui, were killed and 211 of the 315 passengers and crew aboard
were injured, according to CAL officials.</P>
      <P>As of Monday noon, 61 passengers and crew members remained
hospitalized, with four in critical condition, 10 in serious
condition and 47 in stable condition.</P>
      <P>The hospitals could not identify the nationalities of those
hospitalized, although most of the passengers aboard the ill-fated
liner were Portuguese and Hong Kongers.</P>
      <P>A CAL emergency cell along with Lin's relatives, were expected to
try again around Monday noon to fly to Hong Kong for relevant
post-accident work.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan group, headed by CAL Vice President Chou Kuo-hsing,
boarded a CAL passenger jetliner bound for Hong Kong at 7:30 a.m.,
but the plane returned to Taiwan without landing at Hong Kong's Chek
Lap Kok Airport because the airport was closed Monday morning as a
result of continued stormy weather and torrential rainfall.</P>
      <P>Two other CAL passenger planes, carrying passengers who had been
stuck in Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport since Sunday
due to flight cancellations, suffered the same fate Monday morning.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Transportation and Communications Minister Lin
Feng-cheng said he was puzzled as to why the jetliner's pilots
decided to land in Hong Kong during the height of the typhoon Sunday
evening.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, said the crew's handling of the emergency was still
laudable as there were only two fatalities in a situation that had
the potential for a massive loss of life.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA), said that after having detailed discussions
with relevant CAL officials, it was decided that investigations on
the accident may focus on four major points -- the pilot's deciding
to land as a result of overconfidence in his flight skills;
mechanical failure; a sudden wind gust that caused the plane to tilt
as it was landing; and a technical flaw stemming from a height
readjustment as the plane was attempting to land.</P>
      <P>CAL Board Chairman H.I. Chiang apologized to Taiwan's public,
saying that CAL was greatly disturbed as the accident has again
tarnished Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>Chiang would not speculate on the cause of the accident, saying
only that CAL would respect the investigation results of Hong Kong's
civil air authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Executive Yuan's Aviation Safety Council, which is
also dispatching specialists to Hong Kong to help probe the accident,
suggested that the Hong Kong civil air authorities allow the flight
recorder, or "black box," of Flight CI-642 be transported to Taiwan
for further investigation.</P>
      <P>Council members said there are only two countries in Asia, Japan
and Taiwan, that have the know-how and devices to decode or analyze
black box records, while only Taiwan is capable of decoding or
analyzing black box recordings that contain information in mandarin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO PREPARE FOR MAINLAND CHINA'S SQUEEZING OF TAIWAN THROUGH APEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on
Monday the government will prepare for attempts by mainland China at
a summit meeting next month to further squeeze Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu was referring to an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum meeting to be held in New Zealand next month. The meeting comes
amid renewed tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
after President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Many of the participants, including the host country of New
Zealand, have said that they do not wish to discuss the issue in the
summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the main topic of the APEC meeting will be economic
cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, and the ROC government does
not wish to see the summit meeting turn into a forum for debate on
the issue of a "state-to-state" cross-strait relationship or other
political issues.</P>
      <P>In analyzing the possible strategy Beijing may adopt to squeeze
Taiwan, Hu said that Beijing will try to woo more support for its
"one China" rhetoric. Beijing will also try to create an impression
that the United States is tilting toward mainland China, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing will also use the occasion to further isolate Taiwan, Hu
continued.</P>
      <P>"We don't want the APEC meeting to be used by anyone to serve as
the forum to discuss cross-strait issues," Hu said.</P>
      <P>But noting that Beijing would certainly use the occasion to
further squeeze Taiwan, Hu said that he will meet with P.K. Chiang,
chairman of the Council for Economic Planing and Development, and
other officials to discuss ways to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>Chiang will head the ROC delegation attending the APEC informal
leadership meeting scheduled for Sept. 12-13.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN LEADER URGED NOT TO APPEASE MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard should clearly
tell President Jiang Zemin during talks in early September that
Australian-mainland Chinese relations are based on mutual interests
and not on a cringing desire by Canberra to appease Beijing at any
price, a senior writer said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Writing in The Australian Financial Review, Geoffrey Barker, a
veteran writer of the daily, offered a three-point suggestion for
Howard on how to deal with Jiang.</P>
      <P>First, Barker noted the need to explain to mainland China the
security link between Australia and the United States. If mainland
Chinese bellicosity prompts the United States to sail carrier battle
groups again into the Taiwan Strait, Australia will support the
United States. Beijing should ensure that its saber-rattling remains
carefully calibrated and controlled.</P>
      <P>Second, Howard should tell Beijing that Australia will not seek
improved trade ties no matter what the cost. Taiwan is Australia's
seventh-largest trading partner and fifth-largest market for
merchandise exports. A "one China" policy does not mean the
abandonment of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Third, Howard should make clear Australia's commitment to human
rights. Mainland China's international relations will continue to be
fraught while it criminalizes and terrorizes peaceful citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>8-23 KINMEN BOMBARDMENT MARKED</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Fei on
Monday presided over a ceremony on the offshore island of Kinmen to
mark the 41st anniversary of the 8-23 Kinmen Bombardment.</P>
      <P>The 700 participants of the solemn ceremony included Vice Chief
of the General Staff Wang Han-ning, Kinsmen Defense Commander Chu
Kai-sheng, Legislator Han Kuo-yu, family members of those killed in
the bombardment, Kinmen dignitaries as well as troops currently
stationed at the outpost.</P>
      <P>Tang and others burned incense, placed flower wreaths and recited
eulogies to pay their respects to the victims.</P>
      <P>Tang said he hoped the two sides of the Taiwan Strait would never
again engage in shelling and hoped that future cross-Strait
differences would be resolved with patience and wisdom.</P>
      <P>During the battle of the Taiwan Strait, Chinese Communists fired
57,000 shells on the Kinmen Islands over a two-hour period on Aug.
23, 1958.</P>
      <P>Tang later greeted one by one, the nearly 300 family members of
those killed during the shelling. Many of the relatives became
emotional and cried during the ceremony held in the Martyr's Shrine
at the Tawu Mountain Cemetery in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The MND made all the necessary travel arrangements so that family
members could attend Monday's ceremony. Tsao Chin-huan said that he
like many others flown to the ceremony had previously been unable to
visit the cemetery to pay homage because Kinmen was considered a
combat zone before Taiwan annulled its martial law in 1987.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE PARTY CAUCUSES VOICE CONCERN OVER CAL TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The caucuses of both the ruling and
opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan showed deep concern over
the China Airlines (CAL) crash Sunday which killed two passengers and
injured 212 others.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director-general of the legislative caucus of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said that if the accident was due to
human error, CAL high ranking officials should not be free from
blame. In the upcoming September legislative session, the KMT will
enhance the supervision of flight safety, Tseng added.</P>
      <P>The CAL MD-11 jet, was carrying 300 passengers and 15 crew on
flight CI-642 from Bangkok, Thailand. It flipped over and caught fire
while landing at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok International Airport
during Tropical Storm Sam.</P>
      <P>Since the CAL has been plagued by a poor safety record, the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) demanded on Monday that
a legislative Transportation and Communication Committee ad hoc
meeting be held and suggested the disbanding of the CAL foundation.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus strongly demanded an investigation
into the administrative responsibilities of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communication (MOTC), and the Civil Aeronautics
Administration under the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Lee Yin-yuan, convener of the DPP's legislative caucus, said the
immediate priority is for CAL to take responsibility for the dead and
injured and their bereaved families. In the mean time, CAL should
make a public apology to the country, he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, convener of the Transportation and Communication
Committee of the Legislative Yuan, pointed out that "disharmony" has
reportedly long existed between CAL foreign and local pilots, which
could be a factor in CAL's flight safety problems.</P>
      <P>Lai Hse-bao, lawmaker of the New Party, also indicated that CAL
internal management problems, which are long over-due for reform,
should share the blame for the Hong Kong tragedy.</P>

      <P>The remains of one of four Taiwan students
killed in a car accident last week in the United States were brought

      <P>Defense Minister Tang Fei said on Monday
the Republic of China will establish its own missile defense shield
which can be referred to as the "Taiwan Missile Defense (TMD)."</P>
      <P>Tang said in an exclusive interview with CNA that TMD is usually

Taiwan's intention to join the US-initiated theater missile defense
project.</P>
      <P>In fact, Tang said when he pointed out in a report to the ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee last week that installing an
anti-missile system is vital to Taiwan's security, he was referring
to the need to establish a "Taiwan Missile Defense" system.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's own missile defense program, Tang said the top
priority in the initial stage is to build up a low-altitude safety
dragnet capable of intercepting middle-range guided missiles, cruise
missiles and traditional airborne attacks from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the US-initiated TMD is basically a high-altitude
missile defense system, Tang said it's too early for Taiwan to decide
whether to join such a program.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Tang said, the United States has not invited
Taiwan to take part in its TMD project. Furthermore, he said, the
highly sophisticated US-proposed system is still in the development
stage. "We'll evaluate whether to join the project based on future
developments," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tang went on to say even if the United States invites the ROC to
join its TMD system, the military will still study whether Taiwan
needs to do so and whether the majority of local people support such
a move before making a final decision.</P>
      <P>For building up a low-altitude missile defense system, Tang
said, Taiwan will purchase foreign-developed equipment in addition
to developing needed systems on its own. The military-run Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology is in charge of research and
development of new weaponry systems and defense technology.</P>
      <P>As part of the low-altitude missile defense development program,
Tang said the ROC will install an early warning radar system and
purchase the US-built Patriot III anti-missile system.</P>
      <P>Tang said the Ministry of National Defense plans to complete
establishment of a comprehensive low-altitude missile defense system
in 10 years at a cost ranging between NT$250 billion and NT$300
million, adding that the ministry will set aside NT$30 billion in
its annual budget for the critical project.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's urgent needs for missile defense
infrastructure and a low-altitude missile defense system, Tang said
such facilities can not only help defend Taiwan against middle-range
guided missiles and traditional airborne attacks but also against
cruise missiles.</P>
      <P>In the past, Tang said, Taiwan people most worry about threats
from mainland China's tactical missiles and ballistic missiles. "In
fact, it is more worrisome that mainland China is focusing on
developing cruise missiles," Tang said, adding that cruise missiles
pose even greater threats to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tang said mainland China's cruise missiles
still fall below world standards in terms of speed and accuracy. In
the face of the situation, Tang said the ROC military has also
stepped up efforts to work out countermeasures to cope with mainland
China's cruise missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS CONDITION MONITORING INDICATOR TO SHOW GREEN LIGHT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Monday that the business condition
monitoring indicator for July showed a green light for the second
time since the regional financial turmoil hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A green light indicates that business conditions are favorable
for expansion.</P>
      <P>The business condition report, to be officially released Friday,
will show the CEPD saw a thriving July following a prosperous June
due to a bullish export market and an abundant export orders.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the composite index of leading indicators as well as
the index of coincidence indicators for June both rebounded and
created new 14-month and 18-month records, respectively.</P>
      <P>The business condition monitoring indicator for June flashed a
green light for the first time in 15 months, suggesting Taiwan has
officially started a revival of its business environment.</P>
      <P>If tensions are not raised further between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the US economy avoids a recession and mainland China 
maintains a stable currency, this year's economic growth rate could
easily reach the CEPD's projected target of 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The employment number for the non-agricultural sector in July was
8.64 million, marking a slight 0.14-percent increase.</P>
      <P>The one negative factor was that will be that the annual growth
rate of industrial production for July was 7.12 percent, down from
June's 11.1 percent.

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment in July reached 3.11
percent in July, with 302,000 job seekers being not able to find
work, according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>July's figure was the highest level for that month since 1985.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the figure was the result of a large number of new

3 percent as the economy recovers.</P>
      <P>Unemployment in July was mainly due to seasonal factors. In fact,
the seasonally adjusted jobless rate was only 2.88 percent in July,
up slightly from 2.83 percent in June, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate in July was lower than South Korea's

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's number of employed persons totaled
9.41 million in July, a sharp increase for the 4th consecutive month
and a record high, according to official statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>The increase in the number of employed persons indicates that

    <HEADLINE>US NOT TO BACK OFF COMMITMENT TO ROC: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will not back off its
commitments to the Republic of China under the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA), ROC Representative to Washington, D.C. Stephen Chen said
here on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen, who returned to Taipei earlier in the day for home
consultations, made the statement while meeting with the local press
in the evening.</P>
      <P>Chen said the timing of his current home consultation tour has
nothing to with the reported arrival of a US official delegation for
discussing the recent escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait
over the "special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>The de facto ROC ambassador to the United States stressed that
he knew nothing about what local press reports claimed that a US
official delegation will come to Taipei in the near future to meet
with senior ROC officials on current cross-strait tension and the
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular relations.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the timing for his present home consultation
tour has long been set. He last made a home consultation visit in
august 1998.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the United States attaches great importance
to Taiwan-mainland China relations and hopes to see
continued cross-strait dialogue and stable bilateral exchanges. "The
Clinton administration does not like to see an escalation of
cross-strait tension," he noted.</P>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait relations have been soured after ROC
President Lee Teng-hui declared in an interview with a German radio
station in July that cross-strait ties should be on a "special
state-to-state relationship" basis. As Beijing regards the
definition as a dangerous move toward Taiwan independence, it has
launched war of words and saber-rattling against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said despite the recent cross-strait controversy over the
"special state-to-state" theory, the US executive branch and
Congress have reaffirmed their commitments to Taiwan under the TRA,
the US law regulating relations with Taiwan in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>According to the TRA, the United States is obligated to provide
Taiwan with adequate defensive arms and will view any military
action against Taiwan by mainland China as a matter of grave
concern.</P>
      <P>Chen further said communication channels between Taipei and
Washington have operated smoothly.</P>
      <P>The seasoned career diplomat also dismissed as "incorrect" press
reports that Kurt Campbell, US deputy assistant secretary of
defense, will be among members of an American delegation to visit
Taiwan to discuss the "special state-to-state" controversy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other senior ROC officials, including Premier
Vincent Siew, Foreign Minister Jason Hu and Deputy Secretary-General
to the President Lin Pi-chao, also unanimously denied such reports.</P>
      <P>"There is no such thing. The local press need not speculate on
that," Premier Siew said.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, the Clinton administration will send
a delegation of officials from the White House National Security
Council, the Department of State and the Department of Defense to
Taipei to exchange views with senior ROC officials on the current
Taiwan Strait situation and the Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations amid the "special state-to-state" controversy.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism relations between Australia and
mainland China got off to an embarrassing start when two of a group
of 42 tourists from the mainland were reported missing and seeking
political asylum.</P>
      <P>The two Chinese tourists were among the second group to visit
Australia since Beijing designated Australia as one of six countries
for "pleasure trips" for its citizens.</P>
      <P>The two went missing in Sydney and did not rejoin the group to
return to mainland China at the end of its tour last week.</P>
      <P>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on Sunday slammed the door on

    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian researcher has returned to
Melbourne and was reunited with his family after being deported by
mainland Chinese authorities following a week-long detention over
allegations of spying near Tibet.</P>
      <P>Gabriel Lafitte of the Melbourne University on Sunday told the
Age newspaper about his experience, saying he was continually
interrogated by mainland Chinese security agents, deprived of sleep
and forced to sign "hundreds" of confessions after he, an American
linguist and a Tibetan interpreter were accused of conducting "an
illegal visit and doing illegal interviews" and having driven past a
"forbidden" prison farm near Tibet.</P>
      <P>He said what started as a trip to independently observe a
controversial World Bank project in the remote north-west of China
turned into an ugly diplomatic incident.</P>
      <P>He said he had received written assurances from the mainland
Chinese government and the World Bank before he left Australia two
weeks earlier that he was free to inspect the project and speak to
local Tibetan and Mongolian nomads about it.</P>
      <P>The World Bank has agreed to a A$63 (US$42) million loan to fund
irrigation and resettlement of 58,000 Chinese in Dulan County,
traditionally seen as a part of Tibet. Pro-Tibet campaigners say the

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Internet censorship laws are
draconian and repressive and should be repealed, according to the
president of the US Civil Liberties Union.</P>
      <P>The Australian Associated Press (AAP) on Monday quoted Professor
Nadine Strossen of the union as criticizing the new Australian laws
as vague and susceptible to being infused with the values of those
enforcing them.</P>
      <P>She urged the Australian government to repeal the laws, which
will become effective on January 1. The laws require that Internet
service providers in Australia block "anything that offends against
the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted
by reasonable adults."</P>
      <P>Strossen, currently on a visit to Melbourne, said Australia was
now looking like the global village idiot. She said the Internet
should not be censored because it was "potentially the most
empowering, the most enlightening, the most liberating tool for
individual self-realization."</P>

      <P>Competing athletes from more than 100

after the International Olympic Committee gave a go-ahead signal for

      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald reported the IOC, which had previously

positive results, will now allow organizers to conduct blood tests on
any athlete competing in the Olympic Games.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR UNLIKELY TO HIT 31-LEVEL AGAINST US DOLLAR THIS YEAR: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) on Tuesday forecast that the NT
dollar, which was quoted Monday at a 20-month high of 31.883 against
the greenback, would not reach the 31:1 level this year, though there
is room for further rises.</P>
      <P>CEPD said that the 31:1 exchange rate for the NT dollar is
reasonable, though the exact exchange rate must be determined by the
market.</P>
      <P>CEPD Secretary-General Ye Ming-fung said there are three reasons
the NT dollar would likely appreciate further.</P>
      <P>First, the Central Bank of China (CBC) and the CEPD's Effective
Exchange Rate Index is located at a level of about 85 points, which
is considered too low. Second, strong exports this year have resulted
in an export growth rate for the first half of 1999 of 5.5 percent
and a trade surplus of US$6.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Finally, the continuous recovery of Taiwan's economy, the allure
of Taiwan stocks to foreign investors and the recent decision by
Morgan Stanley Capital International to raise the weighting of Taiwan
shares -- resulting in an influx of foreign investment -- could all
contribute to a further rise as well.</P>
      <P>In response to predictions that the NT dollar might reach a
30-level mark against the greenback, Ye said it would be impossible
"in the short term," meaning by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Explaining the reasons for the impossibility of the NT dollar's
reaching the 30-level, Ye said that the CBC may stabilize the foreign
exchange market by all means, as it worries that a sudden fluctuation
of the NT dollar may have a great impact on imports and exports.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's economy is still recovering and has not
reached its peak. Thus, the NT dollar cannot ascend to such a high
level.</P>
      <P>In regard to whether the NT dollar will reach a 30-level against
the US dollar next year, Ye said that it depends on the undulations
of the renminbi, the greenback and other international currencies.</P>
      <P>Ye said he doubted predictions by foreign agents that the
renminbi would be devalued within 45 days, saying that as the yen has
appreciated to 110 against the US dollar, the currencies of Southeast
Asian countries have rallied. In addition, mainland Chinese exports
in July have resulted in positive growth of 7.5 percent, which has
also eased pressure on the currency to devalue.</P>
      <P>If the export competitiveness of the mainland cannot be bolstered
by export taxes rebates, the renminbi will likely be devalued, Ye
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>28 INJURED IN UNI AIR FLIGHT MISHAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-eight passengers were injured when
a domestic jetliner landed in flames at Hualien Airport, some 180
kilometers southeast of Taipei, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The UNI Airlines jetliner, with 90 passengers and six crew
members on board, was crippled by a cabin fire but managed to land
and evacuate its passengers before being consumed by blaze.</P>
      <P>"All passengers safely escaped down emergency rescue chutes,
though 28 are being treated for injuries, chiefly burns," said a UNI
executive.</P>
      <P>Seventeen of the injured have been rushed an army hospital and
11 others were sent to Tzuchi Buddhist General Hospital. Three of
the injured are in critical conditions.</P>
      <P>The airline has formed an emergency relief team which already
traveled from Taipei to Hualien under the leadership of UNI Vice
Chairman Su Chung-ching to handle all related affairs.</P>
      <P>At Premier Vincent Siew's instruction, Transportation and
Communication Minister Lin Feng-cheng and Executive Yuan
Secretary-General Hsieh Shen-shan also flew to Hualien on Taiwan's
Pacific shore to look into the incident.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration, said the UNI plane, a McDonnell Douglas
MD-90, was set ablaze after explosion-like sounds were
reportedly heard from baggage compartments above the seventh-ninth
row of seats in the main passenger cabin. The plane skidded off the
runway and black smoke belching from the plane's fuselage.</P>
      <P>The plane had made a scheduled flight from Taipei to the eastern
resort city of Hualien. It took off from Taipei's Sungshan Airport
at 12:16 and landed at Hualien Airport at around 12:40.</P>
      <P>The Hualien Airport was closed after the mishap and will not
reopen after evidence concerning the incident has been collected and
the plane is towed away. Chang said further investigations are
needed before the true causes of the mishap can be determined.</P>
      <P>UNI Airlines is a wholly-own subsidiary of Taiwan's Evergreen
Group, which operates the world's largest container fleet.</P>
      <P>The incident came two days after a China Airlines (CAL) MD-11
crash-landed in Hong Kong during a typhoon. Two people were killed
and more than 200 injured in the CAL plane crash.</P>

(DPP). The seminar was presided over by DPP Secretary-General You
Hsi-kun.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Juo-yu of Tamkang University said that though there
is advocacy of Taiwan businessmen investing westward or southward,
Taiwan businessmen should make their own judgments on where to
invest.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwan businessmen have invested more than US$40
billion in mainland China over the past two decades. Though Taiwan
now ranks as one of the top three sources of foreign capital in
mainland China, it still cannot be considered as playing a crucial
role in the mainland's capital market.</P>
      <P>Other scholars voiced concern about the mainland currency, the
renminbi, saying that mainland China's economy has been seriously
damaged by financial storms that have been sweeping through the
region since mid-1997.</P>
      <P>Professor Wei Ai of National Chengchi University said that since
mainland China launched economic reforms in 1978, economic
development in the mainland has been moving rapidly. Economic reforms
have brought about an increase in income for its people, the booming
development of its rural regions and an expansion in foreign trade,
which has contributed greatly to its increased economic might.</P>
      <P>But Wei said that on the other hand, its economic reforms have
also highlighted the poor efficiency of its state-owned enterprises,
its unbalanced regional development and problems with inflation.</P>
      <P>Fan Ching-ming of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research
noted that investors withdrew nearly US$100 billion from Southeast
Asia between 1997 and 1998, which dealt a serious blow to the
economic development of the region. At the same time, he said,
mainland China did not devalue its currency.</P>
      <P>Fan said that the mainland Chinese leadership misjudged the
seriousness of the crisis, believing it be only a short-term one. Its
insistence on not devaluing its currency has resulted in a large
decline in its exports to Southeast Asia, which traditionally
accounts for about 40 percent of mainland China's exports.</P>
      <P>Whether Beijing can continue to prop up the renminbi remains to
be seen, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by Typhoon Sam, military troops in
mainland China have slowed down training activities over the past
week, Ministry of National Defense (MND) spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding
said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Due to the influence of Typhoon Sam, Kung said in a regular news

measures, but the measures pose no threat to Taiwan's national
security.</P>
      <P>During the period from Aug. 17-24, exercises conducted by
mainland Chinese ground troops and its Navy were limited to routine
training, while the mainland Chinese Air Force has not demonstrated
any unusual activities, and it is evident that fewer missions are
being flown by mainland fighters.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC armed forces will maintain their combat
readiness and remain on high alert to safeguard Taiwan, Kung called
on the public to stay calm and assured it that ROC troops are ready
to counter any situation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MND will continue monitoring movements by mainland Chinese
troops and will explain the latest cross-strait situation to the

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar continued its upward

NT$31.882, a 21-month high.</P>
      <P>The local currency opened at 31.881, the day's high and had a low

      <P>Interbank transactions totaled US$374 million.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar was relatively weak against the greenback at one

"hands-on" buying by the Central Bank of China, which was apparently
trying to maintain the NT dollar's momentum.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's closing marked the ninth consecutive daily rise by the
NT dollar against the US dollar, and over the past nine days the NT
dollar has risen NT$0.249 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Foreign exchange dealers speculated that there is still room for
the NT dollar to appreciate further against the greenback in the near

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS DEMANDS PREMIER STEP DOWN OVER CAL CRASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tuesday called for the
resignations of the premier and the transportation minister in the
wake of a China Airlines (CAL) jet crash Sunday.</P>
      <P>Flight CI-642, a CAL MD-11 jet, was carrying 300 passengers and
15 crew from Bangkok to Hong Kong Sunday night when it crash-landed
at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok International Airport during Tropical
Storm Sam. As it was landing, the plane flipped over and caught fire,
killing two passengers and injuring 212 others.</P>
      <P>Following Monday's censure of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) for dereliction of its supervisory duty, the
DPP legislative caucus on Tuesday held a news conference in which it
called on Premier Vincent Siew and Transportation Minister Lin
Fong-cheng to step down.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, head of the DPP caucus, told the press that in view
of the fact that MOTC and CAL officials did not act properly in the
aftermath of the accident, which in turn damaged the image of Taiwan,
it is necessary for those at a higher level to take responsibility
for the incident.</P>
      <P>Lin, who pledged to address the flight safety issue when he took
office, has not done anything concrete to improve CAL's flight
safety, Chen said. In addition, the CAL foundation remains in limbo,
being neither a private nor a state-owned operation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks were echoed by DPP lawmaker Wang Tuo, who pointed
out that the MOTC's Lin had vowed to resign if he could not improve
the flight safety of the island's airlines. Therefore, the DPP's
demand is merely that Lin keep the promise he has made.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-nan, deputy convener of the DPP's legislative caucus,
disclosed that Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the MOTC, told the caucus
Monday that the CAA reported to the Executive Yuan long, long ago
that its flight safety team was seriously understaffed; however, the
issue has never been regarded as important.</P>
      <P>The CAA official's comments highlight the fact that the premier
and the transportation minister have ignored completely the flight
safety issue. Therefore, they are not free from blame and must step
down, stressed the DPP's deputy convener.</P>

      <P>Schoolchildren from around Taiwan have
donated 320 cases of stationery as gifts to their counterparts in
five African countries.</P>
      <P>The stationery were presented to Liberian and Chad ambassadors
to the Republic of China in a ceremony presided over by Vice Foreign
Minister David Lee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The recipient countries will also include Sao Tome and Principe,
Malawi and Botswana. Except for Botswana, the four other recipient
countries all maintain formal diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The stationery donation program was initiated by the
privately owned Guinness World of Records Museum in Taichung,
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The museum originally collected stationery donated by local
schoolchildren as gifts for children of the two-toed tribe in
Botswana, southern Africa. As local schoolchildren have responded
enthusiastically to the drive, the museum decided to present excess
stationery to the ROC's four African allies.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister Lee said at the presentation ceremony that
the program signifies the private sector's zeal to help promote
pragmatic diplomacy and win more friendship from around the world.</P>
      <P>Nine cases of stationery will be brought to Botswana in
September by a pair of two-toed sisters from that country. The two
sisters -- Nkhuhlani Matukola and Mokhuhlane Georginah -- have been
on a six-month visit to Taiwan since March at the invitation of the
Guinness World of Records Museum in Taichung.</P>
      <P>The remaining stationery will also be sent to Malawi, Chad, Sao

      <P>For the sake of fairness and the protection
of the interests of those who perform voluntary military service, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) said on Tuesday that part of the
time spent in military schools can be counted toward a person's
military service term.</P>
      <P>The policy ruling went into effect Aug. 3, and those who retired
from the army after June 5, 1998, can apply for a certificate
recognizing time spent in military schools. Some 100,000 people are
expected to benefit from this policy.</P>
      <P>During a routine MND press conference, MND spokesman Major
Gen. Kong Fan-ding pointed out that the Council of Grand Justices had
ruled in 1998 that voluntary military service can be counted as part
of officers' total service terms.</P>
      <P>This ruling can directly affect the amount of one's pension and
the age at which a person may retire.</P>
      <P>To further protect the interests of career army officers who have

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan shoemakers on Tuesday
blasted the government for its alleged lax attitude toward cracking
down on dumping and smuggling of cheap footwear from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The shoemakers voiced their strong protests at a public hearing
hosted by Legislator Chen Hung-chi (KMT-Taipei) on illegal entry of
mainland Chinese footwear.</P>
      <P>Local shoemakers said although the government still bans imports
of mainland Chinese footwear, a large quantity of cheap
mainland-made shoes have made inroads into Taiwan through smuggling
or indirect imports via Hong Kong, Macau and the Philippines with
false certificates of origin.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by local shoemakers associations show that
footwear imports from Hong Kong, Macau and the Philippines have
increased by an annual rate of 30 percent. A large portion of
footwear imports from these areas are believed to have originated in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In 1998, shoe imports from Hong Kong, Macau and the Philippines
exceeded 7 million pairs, and the number reached more than 4.5
million pairs in the first half of this year. The total import
value, however, declined from the same period of last year,
indicating that mainland footwear has been sold under fair
market value here.</P>
      <P>Local shoemakers claimed that the influx of cheap mainland
footwear has seized 60 percent of Taiwan's shoe market and forced
many legally operated local companies to go bankrupt or cease
operations.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, shoemakers said a large number of cheap mainland
footwear have also been sumggled into Taiwan via the offshore
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu, which lie closer to the
mainland than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shoemakers said local government authorities have never taken
effective measures to curb smuggling or dumping of mainland
footwear. "We hope this phenomenon can be imporved immediately and
effectively. Otherwise, we'll stage further demonstrations to
pressure the govenrment to respond to our demand," said Chao
Chien-ho, president of the Taipei County Footwear Industry

      <P>Five members of Taiwan's aeronautic
safety commission and several China Airlines (CAL) representatives
arrived in Hong Kong on Tuesday to join a task force formed by Hong
Kong's civil aeronautics authorities to investigate Sunday's CAL
crash.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government has also invited local aviation experts,
as well as experts from the United States and Britain, to participate
in the investigation.</P>
      <P>Two people were killed when a CAL MD-11 passenger plane en route
from Bangkok to Hong Kong crash-landed and overturned at Chek Lap Kok
airport on Sunday. Over 200 of the 315 passengers and crew aboard
were injured, with six victims remaining in serious condition.</P>
      <P>The task force on Tuesday was recovering the aircraft's black box
from the aircraft wreckage in order to send the device to Britain for
analysis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Deputy
Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said in Taipei that according to a
report from Liu Cheng-hsi, the co-pilot of the stricken plane, he had
given the pilot, Gerardo Lettich of Italy, faulty information about
wind speed during preparations for landing.</P>
      <P>Strong wind shear caused the jetliner to flip upside down and
burst into flames after its right wing clipped the runway upon
landing at the height of a typhoon which swept the former British
colony over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Liu's report said he had told Lettich that the wind was blowing
at 42 kilometers per hour, when in fact it was blowing at 48
kilometers per hour, although Chang said the final analysis will not
be possible until the black box has been decoded.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei's representative to Hong Kong Chen An-kuo

      <P>Taiwan has entered an era of high
unemployment as a result of an imbalance between supply and demand in
the job market, according to the domestic human resources sector.</P>
      <P>The "104 human resources databank," a well-known executive search
website, said the failure to transform the low-skilled workforce and
the delinkage between the education sector and the job market were
the prime factors behind the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the site show that there were an average
of 20,851 job opportunities in July, up 3.2 percent from the June
level.</P>
      <P>The sectors which provided higher numbers of job opportunities
last month included computer peripherals, electronic components,
foreign trade, semiconductors, computer software, the Internet, and
chemical and plastics industries, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the electronic components, chemical and
plastics, foreign trade, food and beverage, computer systems,
nursing, tourism, insurance, and semiconductor industries were among
the leading 10 sectors which posted the largest increase in new jobs

      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Feng-chang on Tuesday confirmed suspicions that a
fire which broke out aboard a domestic UNI Air passenger jet as it
was landing at Hualien airport in eastern Taiwan was caused by an
explosive device.</P>
      <P>The incident, which occurred at around 12:40 p.m. on Tuesday,
resulted in 28 passengers being injured, with most of the casualties
sustaining burns.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council (ASC)
had earlier ruled out mechanical failure or pilot error as factors
behind the accident.</P>
      <P>Judging from a large hole on the fuselage of the MD-90 plane, and
the way in which the steel skin of the fuselage around the hole had
burst outward, an explosive was deemed to be to have been the most
likely cause of the damage, said ASC officials.</P>
      <P>According to passengers who witnessed the accident, the sound of
an explosion was heard before an overhead baggage compartment near
the seventh or eighth line of seats was engulfed in flames, with
small pieces of debris flying all over the inside of the plane.</P>
      <P>Passengers sitting near the source of the blast had their hair
set on fire while the airplane was still taxiing to a halt on the
runway, according to the witnesses.</P>
      <P>The crew of the stricken jet managed to help all 90 passengers
escape from four emergency exits in just a few minutes.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday evening, 20 of the injured remained hospitalized.
Of them, five were in intensive care with massive burns. According to
hospital authorities, two passengers who suffered burns over more

      <P>Lin, who rushed to the scene around 2 p.m., said at a press

explosive was used or how it was brought aboard.</P>
      <P>The accident came just two days after the crash landing of a
China Airlines MD-11 at the height of typhoon Sam in Hong Kong on

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Young Taiwan, Vigorous Government" has
been named as the main campaign theme of the major opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the 2000 presidential
election, a DPP stalwart said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiou Yi-jen, who is the top aide responsible for assisting DPP
presidential hopeful Chen Shui-bian in his run for the presidency,
stressed that the reconstruction of national systems through
constitutional amendment will be high on his party's agenda over the
next 10 to 20 years.</P>
      <P>In order to strengthen the confidence of the party's existing
supporters, the DPP will hold a series of campaign rallies from
Saturday to tour the campaign theme.</P>
      <P>Chiou interpreted the term "vigorous government" from three
aspects -- the spirit of the government, the structure of the
government and the action of the government.</P>
      <P>Referring to the spirit of the government, he noted that many
government officials appear unaware that their function is to serve
the public. A vigorous government is one that possesses the spirit of
being willing to take the initiate to provide the public with the
best possible service, he said.</P>
      <P>Explaining the structure of the government, he slammed the
swollen current central government structure and reiterated the DPP's
consistent intention to condense the five branches of the central
government to three, along with promoting parliamentary reforms,
judicial independence and the redemarcation of administrative areas.</P>
      <P>With regard to the action of the government, Chiou hit out at the
ruling Kuomintang for its abuse of administrative resources, and the
serious involvement of gangsterism and "black money" in politics.</P>
      <P>As for "young Taiwan," he noted that this goal will be achieved
once Taiwan's new vitality is formed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI TRYING TO ARRANGE MEETING BETWEEN US PRESIDENT, ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei is trying to arrange a meeting
between US President Bill Clinton and Republic of China Presidential
Envoy P.K. Chiang, according to sources from the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Such a meeting would take place during the upcoming informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum to be held in Auckland, New Zealand, on Aug. 12-13, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is trying to arrange the
private talks between Clinton and CEPD Chairman Chiang, President Lee
Teng-hui's special envoy who will represent Taiwan at the APEC
leaders summit.</P>
      <P>MOFA is attaching great importance to the hoped-for meeting, as
it would be the first high-level exchange of opinion between US and
Taiwan officials since Lee redefined cross Taiwan Strait relations as
a "special state-to-state" relationship in July, the CEPD officials
said.</P>
      <P>Lee's statehood assertions have incurred Beijing's wrath, and
have caused jitters in Washington.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chung-ping, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), Taiwan's highest government agency responsible for
charting the country's mainland China policies, said a summit meeting
between Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin could
serve as a crucial sounding board for Beijing's latest attitude
toward Taipei in light of Lee's statehood assertions.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that Taipei is still enthusiastically preparing to
welcome Wang Daohan, Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan, who is
scheduled to visit the island this autumn. He noted, however, that
Taipei is also prepared for the possibility that Wang's proposed
visit might be canceled by Beijing once and for all.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER GOVERNOR DISPUTES POSSIBILITY OF RUNNING ON KMT TICKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   24  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Accusing the ruling Kuomintang of
contradicting itself, independent presidential hopeful James Soong
pointedly denied newspaper reports on Tuesday that the KMT is still
trying to recruit him as the party's candidate for vice president in
the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In a hastily called press briefing, Soong dismissed as "a
political gambit" alleged KMT efforts to persuade him to run on the
KMT ticket as the party's vice presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News ran a story on its front page on Tuesday
that KMT is still trying to woo Soong to run as Lien's running mate,
and that Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and former Kaohsiung City
Mayor Wu Den-yi were the mediators spearheading the eleventh hour
efforts.</P>
      <P>Ma was reticent on Tuesday about his role in attempting to broker
the Lien-Soong partnership which is considered to be a sure-win
ticket in the 2000 presidential election, saying that he would spare
no effort to consolidate KMT solidarity.</P>
      <P>Wu could not be reached for comment.</P>
      <P>The former Taiwan provincial governor and KMT secretary-general
stressed that his entry into the presidential race is in order to
seek a chance to fully realize a "democracy for all the people"
rather than to seek personal gains, and that he will not stop his
campaign for anything less than that, much less an offer to award him
a slot on the KMT ticket.</P>
      <P>He admitted that KMT Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou met with him
on Monday in order to urge him to meet with Vice President Lien Chan,
the KMT presidential candidate, in an apparent effort to broker a
partnership between Lien and Soong.</P>
      <P>However, Soong said that he would rather not see Lien before the
KMT approves Lien's choice of running mate, an event which is
expected to take place at an extraordinary KMT meeting on Friday, to
avoid the perception that he is trying to seek the chance to be
Lien's running mate.</P>
      <P>As for former KMT Kaohsiung City Mayor Wu Den-yi, who has
reportedly met with Soong more than twenty times, also in a bid to
recruit him as Lien's running mate, Soong said they only met about
twice and the question was never raised.</P>
      <P>Soong said the KMT leadership have already ruined any chance of a
Lien-Soong partnership in the presidential race by their mudslinging
campaign against him.</P>
      <P>Quoting an unnamed KMT leader who chided him as "a selfish
politician oblivious to loyalty and gratuity," Soong asked, tongue in
cheek: "Why would they name such a mean guy to stand up for them in
the presidential race?"</P>
      <P>Noting Lien's exhibition at a recent campaign rally when he
applauded enthusiastically after a well-known entertainer derided
Soong as a "traitor" for helping President Lee Teng-hui oust
legislators and national assemblymen elected before the ROC relocated
to Taiwan, Soong said Lien owes him an explanation for the display of
name-calling before talking about any partnership.</P>
      <P>Soong boasted of the mass support he enjoys among the grassroots,
and reiterated his statement of July 16, when he announced his
candidacy, that he will never back down on his presidential bid.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin on Tuesday refused to confirm whether the US
government has dispatched a delegation to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he said that if such a delegation were to visit Taipei, it

      <P>Since President Lee Teng-hui redefined Taiwan-mainland China ties
as a "special state-to-state relationship" on July 9, Beijing has
been pressing Lee to retract his statement, and the international

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS   LEADERS   CHALLENGE   APEC  LEADERS  TO  SPEED  UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a frank and challenging report,
business leaders from Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum
countries say individual member economies are not moving fast enough
to achieve their deadlines for free and open trade and investment.</P>
      <P>The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) report to the APEC
Chair, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jenny Shipley, which was made
public on Tuesday, sets down the directions the Asia-Pacific business
community believes APEC must follow, and includes a series of
specific recommendations.</P>
      <P>ABAC Chair, New Zealand's Philip Burdon said in the report that
APEC has achieved a great deal in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>"APEC has become a major force for economic reform and growth,
having put in place far-reaching programs for trade liberalization,
economic and technical cooperation between members, and the removal
of red tape and unnecessary costs to business," Burdon said.</P>
      <P>"But like all processes which move by consensus and which are
subject to the pressures of domestic politics, APEC has at times lost
sight of its own goals," he continued.</P>
      <P>The report challenges APEC leaders to work more vigorously to
achieve their agreed free trade and investment goals by 2010 for
developed economies and 2020 for developing economies. It also calls
on APEC leaders to work together in the World Trade Organization to
achieve comprehensive multilateral trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>The report also says that APEC members need to reduce tariffs
further, but emphasizes that non-tariff measures -- such as
streamlining customs procedures -- are an equally significant
impediment to trade which needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>The report offers a number of proposals for economic and
financial restructuring in order to equip economies for more open
markets, and to assist with recovery and renewed growth in the wake
of the Asian regional crisis.</P>
      <P>ABAC members from around the region will be meeting with APEC
leaders in Auckland, New Zealand, next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVERGREEN CONTAINER SHIP FIRE UNDER CONTROL, UK RESCUE CREW STANDS BY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fire that broke out on an Evergreen
Marine Corp. container ship, Ever Decent, after a collision with the
Bahamas-registered cruise liner Norwegian Dream in the English
Channel on Tuesday has been put under control, according to an
Evergreen spokesman.</P>
      <P>Earlier worries that the fire might cause the explosion of
containers on board Ever Decent carrying hazardous chemicals -- thus
unleashing a biological disaster on the surrounding area -- were
dispelled as it was determined that the 46 containers carrying such
chemicals were not located near the fire, which has already been
extinguished, said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Crew members of Ever Decent decided not to evacuate the ship,
saying that they would stay to help out with fire control and other
tasks.</P>
      <P>British Coast Guard authorities said their rescue operations are
underway, with helicopters hovering above the container ship. The
rescue force will remain on standby in case there are further
emergencies on the ship, which was still taking on water, they added.</P>
      <P>The 55,604-deadweight-ton Ever Decent, with 3,092 containers on
board, was making for the Belgian port of Zeebrugge from Britain's
Thamesport when it collided with the 50,764-gross-ton Norwegian
Dream, which was carrying about 2,400 passengers.</P>
      <P>Describing the collision as only a glancing blow, the Evergreen
spokesman declined to comment on how the collision occurred. He said
further details would be released once British authorities compiled
an accident report.</P>
      <P>The three people aboard the Norwegian Dream injured in the
collision were earlier transported by helicopter to England for
medical treatment. The cruise liner limped into the English port of
Dover about six hours after the collision, which spilled several
Evergreen containers onto the liner's deck.</P>
      <P>British Coast Guard officials gave no clues to the cause of the
accident, saying winds were light and visibility good.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING NOT TO TOUCH ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES DURING APEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
agreed not to touch on their bilateral fracas during the upcoming
meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, a
noted local economist said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-yi, head of the Taiwan Institute for Economic
Research, said the Republic of China has reached a consensus with
mainland China through mediation of New Zealand, the host country of
the 1999 APEC events, on avoiding mentioning cross-strait issues
under the APEC framework.</P>
      <P>Wu, an adviser to the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), has
been invited to attend the 1999 ABAC summit meeting, which refers
to an annual rendezvous between senior business executives and
top leaders from all APEC member economies.</P>
      <P>The annual APEC extravaganza will kick off in New Zealand's
largest city of Auckland on Sept. 9, with a senior officials meeting
and a ministerial-level conference. An informal leadership meeting
will also be held from Sept. 12-13.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and mainland China are APEC members. They have been
at loggerheads since ROC President Lee Teng-hui told a German radio
interviewer on July 9 that cross-Taiwan Strait ties should be defined
as a "special state-to-state relationship." Lee's declaration just
affirms political reality. Beijing, however, regards it as a
dangerous move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ensure smooth proceeding of annual APEC
gatherings in an amicable atmosphere, Wu said the New Zealand
government has taken the initiative to mediate an agreement between
Taipei and Beijing to avoid raising their bilateral issues during
the upcoming APEC meetings.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu said if international news media raised
questions about the "special state-to-state relationship" theory or
other cross-strait disputes during a press conference to be held
after the APEC ministerial-level meeting, ROC officials are still
likely to answer those inquiries.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation to the APEC ministerial-level conference will
be led by Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and Finance Minister
Paul Chiu. And P. K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development, will attend the APEC
leadership meeting on behalf of President Lee. The ROC head of state
has been barred from the annual APEC summit meeting because of
Beijing's opposition. Lee instead has to name a surrogate to attend
the summit meeting on his behalf.</P>
      <P>APEC is a 21-member regional economic cooperation forum
dedicated to promoting free trade and investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ECONOMIC GROWTH LIKELY TO BE ADJUSTED UPWARD AGAIN: THINK-TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Positive indicators have led to the
conclusion that Taiwan's economy is expected to improve even more in
the second half of this year than it did in the first half, the head
of a private economic think-tank said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) will have to
make a further upward adjustment to its forecast for the island's
economic prospects for the second half of the year if the overall
economic upswing continues, said Wu Rong-I, TIER president.</P>
      <P>In July, TIER adjusted its forecast for Taiwan's economic growth
for 1999 from 5.28 percent to 5.34 percent after all economic
indicators, including domestic investment, export business and the
stock market, showed positive growth.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics also revised this year's annual growth upward this month
to 5.74 percent, showing much higher confidence in Taiwan's economic
prospects than does TIER, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>If the upswing continues and cross-Taiwan Strait relations do not
sour further in the remaining months of the year, Wu said, TIER is
likely to adjust its forecast again in November.</P>
      <P>According to TIER tallies, the July index of leading indicators,
which is designed to forecast economic prospects three to six months
in advance, rose to 106.71 points, the highest level in 22 months.</P>
      <P>A monthly TIER survey of domestic manufacturers conducted in
early August found that industry executives have become more
optimistic about their business prospects in the months ahead, even
though they admitted that President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" assertions on cross-strait relations have temporarily
shattered their confidence in Taiwan's overall prospects.</P>
      <P>Thirty-seven percent of those surveyed forecast that the economy
will improve in the next six months, compared with 34.1 percent in
the July survey.</P>
      <P>Forty-seven percent of the survey respondents believe the economy
will remain unchanged, compared with 48.1 percent in the July poll.
Only 15.9 percent said the economy will worsen over the next six
months, compared with 17.8 percent in the July survey.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said Taiwan is unlikely to raise interest rates
simply because the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday lifted the federal
funds rate for overnight loans and discount rate by a
quarter-percentage point each.</P>
      <P>He said that although Taiwan's currency is facing pressure to
further appreciate against the US dollar due to continuously
expanding exports and growing inflow of foreign capital, the Central
Bank of China will not sit idly by and allow the NT dollar to surge,
but will make sure it protects the island's export business.</P>

flight at 9:30 a.m. to allow TransAsia to conduct a thorough overhaul
of its aircraft.</P>
      <P>A ranking TransAsia official said the cancellations were made
because flight safety and customer service are the most important
issues to the aviation company.</P>
      <P>He also asked other passengers for forgiveness and understanding,
as flights for the rest of the day were affected because of the
incident.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, another TransAsia flight from eastern
Hualien bound for Taipei was also canceled after a similar problem
was found by maintenance personnel during a routine pre-flight

from the 62-member Business Advisory Council. The report was
delivered to New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley.</P>
      <P>The council, which includes the chairman of General Motors, Jack
Smith of the United States, and Commonwealth Bank Executive Director
David Murray of Australia, told the APEC leaders that APEC had "lost
sight of its goals" and needed to make "more serious and substantial
commitments" to opening markets.</P>
      <P>Reflecting growing business frustration with the regional
economic forum, the council warned that APEC's self-paced approach to
liberalization was not delivering results and lacked transparency,
specificity and comprehensiveness.</P>
      <P>The APEC leaders summit in Bogor, Indonesia, in 1995 has set a
liberalization timetable of 2010 for industrialized economies and
2020 for developing economies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BISHOP BELO CALLS FOR INTERNATIONAL INTERVENTION IN EAST TIMOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only international intervention can
prevent East Timor from descending into a blood bath after the Aug. 30
vote that will decide the future of the territory, prominent Bishop
Carlos Belo has warned.</P>
      <P>In an article he wrote for The New York Times on Tuesday and
which was published by The Australian on Wednesday, the Nobel
laureate called on the United States to withhold military assistance
and financial aid from Indonesia until the military stops the
violence in the former Portuguese colony.</P>
      <P>Belo said a fair ballot would result in a majority vote for
independence.</P>
      <P>"If not, there would be no need to wage a campaign of violence
and coercion to prevent free elections from taking place," he said.</P>
      <P>He blamed the deaths of hundreds of East Timorese and the
violence in the lead-up to Monday's vote on the Indonesian military,
which has helped pro-Jakarta militias intimidate Timorese,
particularly supporters of the pro-independence movement.</P>
      <P>The Australian also reported that rising militia violence has
prevented the independence lobby from putting forward its case in
many regions in East Timor, while the autonomy campaign is
accelerating its efforts with daily rallies in major centers.</P>
      <P>In another report, The Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday
reported Australia has now more than 5,000 combat-ready troops to
draw on if the United Nations decides to set up an armed peacekeeping
force in East Timor.</P>
      <P>The report also indicated Foreign Minister Alexander Downer will
meet US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and the Pacific
Stanley Roth on Wednesday to discuss the security situation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Acer Group and the Cisco Corp.,
the world's largest network manufacturer, jointly announced on
Wednesday that they have established a strategic alliance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the alliance, Acer will build internal

      <P>"Personal computers (PCs) have made Taiwan a household name in
the information industry; however, to win a larger share of the PC
market, we should combine the functions of PC with those of the
Internet. This will enable us to produce better PCs to compete
with those of other companies," said Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih.</P>
      <P>Cisco will provide Acer with network technology allowing the

    <HEADLINE>CANADIANS LOVE MOVIES; ATTENDANCE UP FOR SIXTH STRAIGHT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forget about videotapes and TV, Canadians
just love to go to the cinemas, and movie attendance hit a 17-year
high in 1997-98, according to Statistics Canada.</P>
      <P>The federal agency reported Tuesday that attendance at theaters
and drive-ins increased by 8 percent to almost 100 million, the sixth
straight annual increase in the number of moviegoers.</P>
      <P>The rise of the giant mega-theater has helped boost attendance.
Statscan said recent openings of very large theaters contributed
significantly to the rise in attendance.</P>
      <P>But these giants may have hurt their smaller competitors, the
report said. Bigger theaters reported a 6-percent jump in patrons,
while small theaters -- ranked by revenue -- saw business drop 10
percent and medium-sized theaters were off 23 percent.</P>
      <P>The movie house industry earned C$85.8 million (US$58.5 million)
in 1997-98, up 31 percent from the previous year. Full-time
employment slipped about 2 percent to 1,376 jobs, while part-time
employment rose 11 percent, to 9,895.</P>
      <P>There were 617 theaters operating during the year in Canada, with
2,186 screens. There were 71 drive-ins with 115 screens.</P>
      <P>The drive-in seems to have lost its allure, however. While the
number of screens actually increased, admissions fell 5 percent to
2.2 million. It was the third year in a row that attendance has
fallen.</P>
      <P>Cinemas, on the other hand, recorded 97.7 million admissions,
with box office receipts totaling C$490 million and total revenues
amounting to C$699.9 million.</P>
      <P>The average Canadian went to the movies 3.3 times during the
year, although Newfoundlanders tended to go only half that often.
People from Alberta were the most avid moviegoers, averaging 4.6
cinema visits per year</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese dissident leader Wei Jingsheng on
Wednesday raised the issues of Taiwan, Tibet and human rights when he
met Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer in Canberra.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at Parliament House, Wei said he hoped the
Australian government could play a bigger role in maintaining
stability and peace in the Taiwan Strait following the recent tension
between Taipei and Beijing because of President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of ties between the two sides as a "special
state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>"If we don't have enough concern over the current tension and
conflict in the Taiwan Strait, if war broke out, Australia would be
more directly affected than America because Australia is closer to
the region," Wei said.</P>
      <P>He said Australia would have good opportunity to express that
when mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin makes his first visit to
Australia on Sept. 6.</P>
      <P>He said Downer agreed that both Taiwan and mainland China should
restrain themselves and seek reconciliation so that the current
tensions can be eased.</P>
      <P>"Whether Taiwan becomes independent or not is up to the people of
Taiwan. I personally do not agree, but I do respect the decision of
the people of Taiwan," Wei said.</P>
      <P>He said the same of the people of Tibet.</P>
      <P>Wei also said he had discussed the Taiwan issue with politicians
of the country's ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, and had come to the conclusion "that the issue of
Taiwan independence is not important."</P>
      <P>"The democratization of China is more important than Taiwan
independence. The issue of a democratic China should come before the
Taiwan independence issue," he said.</P>
      <P>Wei, dubbed the "father of the Chinese dissident movement," is
currently making his first visit to Australia to try and drum up
support from Australian government officials and politicians.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese leadership has
decided to pump billions of yuan into supporting its declining arms
industry in a policy change to deal with economic and political
problems, the Hong Kong Standard reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The report in the English-language daily quoted a China watcher as
saying that the decision is a major compromise between the reformist
civilian government and the hawkish military.</P>
      <P>It is also a major industrial policy adjustment following a
decade-old effort to restructure the industry into a civilian-run
operation.</P>
      <P>In recent high-level meetings, the party and government
leadership reached consensus to earmark more funds for arms research
and manufacture while increasing the military budget to allow the
People's Liberation Army to purchase more hardware, the report
revealed.</P>
      <P>In an apparent gesture to the armed forces, President Jiang Zemin
and Premier Zhu Rongji have in recent months paid visits to several
arms manufacturers in Liaoning and Sichuan provinces.</P>
      <P>Increasing calls have been made by the military and arms
manufacturers for the central government to upgrade military hardware
following the US-led NATO attack on Yugoslavia and Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui's assertion of the island's statehood, the
report quoted mainland sources as saying.</P>
      <P>Jiang and Zhu have recently been under political pressure from
the party's conservative wing and hawkish military for their
enthusiastic efforts to mend ties with the United States and be soft
with Taiwan, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS BLAMED FOR UNI AIR JET BLAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's UNI Airlines vice chairman
asserted on Wednesday that Tuesday's explosion and fire aboard one of
the company's MD-90 planes which injured 28 people was caused by
explosive material brought aboard by a passenger.</P>
      <P>Si Chung-ching made the remarks at a Taipei press conference,
where he also angrily brushed off an "analysis" by a local professor
who claimed, seemingly without any evidence, that the blaze was
caused by faulty materials used in the plane's construction.</P>
      <P>Although the investigation into the incident has yet to be
completed, Si said, it has already been established that no materials
capable of producing such a blast were used in the part of the plane
where the explosion occurred, and that the source of the explosion
must have originated "externally."</P>
      <P>He stressed no human or machine error was behind the incident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) Commissioner Chen
Ching-sung cited preliminary investigation results as saying that the
blaze was caused by an explosion, but he declined to comment on what
could have caused the blast.</P>
      <P>Chen said that no evidence has been found to suggest an explosive
device was responsible, although CIB experts are conducting in-depth
examinations of debris collected from the airplane wreckage.</P>
      <P>The UNI Air jet with 90 passengers and six crew aboard, landed in
flames on Tuesday at the Hualien airport, around 180 kilometers
southeast of Taipei, just two days after Sunday's crash landing of a
China Airlines MD-11 at the height of typhoon Sam in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Most of the 28 victims suffered slight or severe burns. As of
Wednesday, six of them remained hospitalized in the Hualien-based
Tzuchi Buddhist General Hospital, with three in serious condition.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, experts from the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council
(ASC) began to decode the plane's two flight data recorders, the
first time that such work has been attempted in Taiwan rather than at
a specialist laboratory overseas.</P>
      <P>The ASC opened Asia's first "black box" decoding laboratory on
Aug. 10, at a cost of NT$10 million (US$314,000), allowing black box
analysis results to be available much more quickly. However, an ASC
spokesman refused to say when the UNI results would be released.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mongolian &amp; Tibetan
Affairs Commission (MTAC) has been urged to deal with possible
changes in the situation between Taiwan and Mongolia, as Mongolia has
set up a new organization to take charge of exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Mongolia-Taiwan Cultural and Trade Association," with
influential figures from both the government and private sectors
forming the bulk of its members, has recently become operational,
according to an MTAC report.</P>
      <P>Mongolian Prime Minister personally presided over the
organization's opening in the capital, Ulan Bator, the MTAC said,
noting that the head of the Mongolian government' endorsement of the
body shows that he supports further trade and economic exchanges with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MTAC report called for greater heed to be paid and active
measures to be taken to deal with the issue, as the setting up of the
association is set to have a heavy impact on the future of existing
two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although the political situation in Mongolia is not expected to
stabilize until after a general election is held in June 2000, the
MTAC report proposed that a systematic mechanism for two-way
exchanges be set up quickly to ensure continued exchanges no matter
which party takes power in Mongolia in the future.</P>

(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of Taiwan's main opposition
party said on Wednesday that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
should be abolished and replaced by a mainland China department under
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Tong-jung said the
move should be made in light of the new situation in which Taiwan
finds itself after President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of
cross-Taiwan Strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Tsai, who was promoting his idea at a press conference, said he
first raised the issue on July 13, but decided to mention it again
"to remind the government of Lee's political advocacy."</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's attitude to Lee's statement has evolved
into "selective forgetfulness" from its earlier unanimous support,
causing the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
to return to normal as if nothing has happened, Tsai claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the most pragmatic way to settle the
relationship between the two sides would be to adjust the
organizations and structures under the Executive Yuan, which is why
he suggested dismantling the MAC and forming instead a new "mainland
China department" under MOFA. Tsai said he would bring up his
proposal at the next legislative session scheduled to open in
September.</P>

(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should declare
unambiguously that it will come to Taiwan's defense in the event of
an attack or a blockade against the island, said a joint statement
released by two American think tanks on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The statement, co-authored by the Heritage Foundation and the
Project for the New American Century, was issued amid recent
escalation of tension across the Taiwan Strait over the "special
state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three leading US conservatives and foreign-policy experts,
including heads of the two Washington-based think tanks, Edwin J.
Feulner Jr. and William Kristol, signed the statement.</P>
      <P>Other signatories included former US Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, former Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wolfowitz, and
former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage.</P>
      <P>The statement said communist China has continued to threaten
military action against the democratically-elected government of
Taiwan over the "special state-to-state" fracas.</P>
      <P>"It has therefore become essential that the United States make
every effort to deter any form of (mainland) Chinese intimidation of
the Republic of China on Taiwan and declare unambiguously that it
will come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack or a
blockade against Taiwan, including against the offshore islands of
Matsu and Kinmen," the statement said.</P>
      <P>It continued that the United States should also make clear that
while it is prepared to accept any resolution regarding Taiwan's
future status to which both sides voluntarily agree, the future of
Taiwan must reflect the will of the people of Taiwan as expressed
through their duly elected government.</P>
      <P>"If the people of Taiwan do not want to be united with the
mainland until China becomes a democracy, the United States has a
moral obligation and strategic imperative to honor that
determination," the document said.</P>
      <P>It warned that efforts by the Clinton administration to pressure
Taiwan to cede its sovereignty and to adopt Beijing's understanding
of "one China" are dangerous and directly at odds with US strategic
interests, past US policy and American democratic ideals.</P>
      <P>"Failure to stand by Taiwan and live up to the spirit and letter
of the Taiwan Relations Act in the present crisis can only exacerbate
tensions and may well lead to serious miscalculation by Beijing,"
the statement noted.</P>
      <P>It further said the time for strategic and moral "ambiguity"
with regard to Taiwan has passed. "We urge the administration and
leaders in Congress to make a clear statement of America's
commitment to the people of Taiwan," the statement said, adding that
such a commitment is consonant with US national interests and
ideals, and will help ensure peace in East Asia.</P>
      <P>A Heritage Foundation news release issued on the same day also
stressed that the Clinton administration and Congress should dispel
the uncertainty that has clouded the US position in the weeks since
ROC President Lee Teng-hui declared in an interview with a German
radio station in July that mainland China and Taiwan should interact
on a "state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>Other former US officials who signed the statement included
former Central Intelligence Agency Director R. James Woolsey and

its business range in Panama, as it has recently invested US$100
million in the establishment of a Panamanian harbor along with a Hong

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION CAUCUSES DEMAND TRANSPORTATION MINISTER'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of two of Taiwan's
opposition parties on Wednesday urged that the transportation
minister should resign to take responsibility for a series of air
traffic incidents within just a couple of days.</P>
      <P>The call came in response to an incident in which a UNI Air MD-90
jet caught fire as it was landing at Hualien Airport on Tuesday, just
two days after a China Airlines plane crashed at Hong Kong's Chek Lap
Kok International Airport.</P>
      <P>A total of 28 people were injured when Flight B7-973 burst into
flames as it was taxiing to a stop at the eastern Taiwan airport,
according to UNI Air.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, chief convener of the legislative caucus of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said he doubted
the competence of the Aviation Safety Council (ASC) under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC), and that
Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Fong-cheng should
take responsibility.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Wang Tuo said he was also disappointed with Lin's
performance. He pointed out that Lin pledged to address the flight
safety issue when he took office. However, Wang claimed, he has not
done anything concrete to boost flight safety.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the transportation minister had vowed to resign if
he could not improve the flight safety of the island's airlines, Wang
pointed out, adding that he hoped Lin will keep his promise.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said, the ASC should be placed directly under
the Executive Yuan, rather than remaining under the control of the
MOTC, so that it can operate independently and be free from
administrative intervention.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Hse-bao, a lawmaker from the tiny opposition New
Party, said at a news conference that the flight safety team of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) is seriously understaffed,
with just 38 personnel made up of either retired air force officers
or workers receiving a period of flight safety supervisory training.
He pointed out that none of them have any form of internationally
recognized flight safety supervisory license.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the head of the MOTC should not be free from blame
and should step down, along with the director-general of the CAA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL BARRED FROM TAKING PART IN FLIGHT ALLOCATIONS FOR ONE YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) will not be considered
for the next one year when the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA)
distributes flight allocations, CAL Director-General Chang Yu-hern
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in the wake of CAL's latest air accident
when one of its MD-11 jetliners crashed in flames and flipped upside
down in Hong Kong on Sunday, miraculously leaving just two dead and
211 injured.</P>
      <P>Chang said that CAL had asked to be allowed to increase the
number of its flights on the Taipei-Bangkok-Amsterdam route, but that
the request was rejected by the CAA.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that if costs are calculated based on four flights
by B747-400 jetliners every week, the decision will cost CAL NT$2
billion (US$62.11 million) a year.</P>
      <P>CAL, the country's leading airline and former flag-carrier, has
been tainted by its poor safety record in recent years. Its last fatal
crash occurred on Feb. 16, 1998, when another of its planes crashed
near Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan, northern
Taiwan, killing 196 passengers and crew members as well as six other
people on the ground.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC POLICY ADVISER TO DISCUSS CROSS-STRAIT TIES WITH US OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  24  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national policy adviser to
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui will attend a closed-door
seminar on relations across the Taiwan Strait with US officials in
New York later this week.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao, director of the Institute for National Policy
Research, a Taipei-based private think tank, told CNA after his
arrival in San Francisco that he has been invited by the US Foreign
Policy Association to attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>Officials from the US Department of State and Department of
Defense as well as academics from mainland China will also attend the
symposium whose theme is expected to focus on the "special
state-to-state relationship" theory declared by President Lee in
July.</P>
      <P>Tien, a US-trained international affairs scholar, will deliver a
speech on the development of cross-strait relations from Taiwan
perspective during the seminar. Tien is expected to analyze the
Taiwan Strait situation in the past six months in his speech.</P>
      <P>In addition to talks during the seminar, Tien said he does not
rule out the possibility of holding further talks with American
officials in private.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he is not an official delegate, Tien said he will
only present his personal observations and views during his talks
with American officials.</P>
      <P>President Lee's declaration on July 9 in an interview with a
German radio station that Taiwan-mainland China exchanges should be on
a "special state-to-state" basis has drawn furious reaction from
Beijing which regards Lee's statement as a move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Tien said one major factor prompting Lee to make the
declaration was that he felt that the Clinton administration is
leaning toward Beijing's so-called "one China" principle which
downgrades the ROC to a local-level government under its
jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tien said, ROC officials have felt pressure
from some US officials for opening sensitive political dialogue with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tien said President Lee must
clarify the status of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
"Taiwan cannot start political talks with mainland China under
Beijing's 'one China' principle," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tien said Beijing need not overreact to the "special
state-to-state" theory because it just reflects reality and does not
mark a shift in Taiwan's policy and stance toward the mainland.
"Moreover, the ROC government has not taken any action to amend its
constitution or relevant laws in line with the theory," he added.</P>
      <P>Through Taiwan's extensive explanations, Tien said US
authorities have come to a better understanding of the ROC's stance
and has not pressured it to retract the "special state-to-state"
theory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEI JINGSHENG ASKS AUSTRALIA TO PRESS CHINA ON HUMAN RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 25 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese dissident leader Wei Jingsheng on
Wednesday urged Australia and other Western countries to press China
to improve its human rights and speed up democratization.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a gathering of 150 academics and business leaders in
Sydney, Wei said Western countries should exert strong pressure on
China and urge Beijing to respect human rights and take concrete
steps towards democratic system.</P>
      <P>"We need to constantly voice our strong concerns over human
rights situation and the democratic process in China," he said at the
Sydney Institute, a prestigious organization in Australia.</P>
      <P>Wei said the prospects of improving human rights situation and
democratic system in China are gaining momentum. "But we need to
unite all the promoters of democracy among those who live overseas
and in China so that they would become a powerful force," he said.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with members of Parliament from the Liberal,
National, Labor Parties and Independent on Wednesday afternoon in
Canberra, Wei discussed the human rights issues with Australian
politicians.</P>
      <P>He reminded that the current annual bilateral dialogues between
Australia and mainland China on human rights and the Tibet issue have
produced little in pressing China to improve the human rights records
in the mainland.</P>
      <P>"That kind of dialogue is ineffective to press China to improve
its human rights records," he told the Australian MPs, who agreed
with Wei's views.</P>
      <P>The MPs said they would press their government to do more and ask
China to improve its human rights situation in future dialogues.</P>
      <P>Wei, who arrived in Australia on Tuesday for the first time, is
expected to see points of interest in Sydney on Thursday before
giving another speech to overseas Chinese on August 28.

      <P>The Lin Yuan Group topped Taiwan business

(US$10.66 billion), according to a survey released by
monthly magazine Commonwealth on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group, which topped the list in 1997, saw

fifth place. They were followed by the Koo's, Evergreen, United

groups was lackluster, with combined net profits shrinking to

    <HEADLINE>NEARLY  40  PERSENT OF  TAIWAN  MANUFACTURERS  MULL SETTING UP FOOTHOLDS IN EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the Euro's launch this year,
nearly 40 percent of domestic manufacturers are considering setting
up an European foothold or warehouse, according to a survey conducted
by the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>CETRA officials on Wednesday said that as the wage for western
European laborers is high and the rent for office space and
warehouse expansive, they are suggesting that Taiwan manufacturers
setting up footholds in Spain and Portugal in southern Europe, or
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary when the three countries join
the European Union in 2001.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in May they surveyed the effect of the
single European currency on the marketing strategies of Taiwan
businesses, targeting the top 3,000 Taiwan exporters to Europe last
year.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that after the launch of the Euro in 1999, most
Taiwan manufacturers still quoted product prices in US dollars.
However, 70.3 percent of the surveyed also said that it is necessary
to open Euro-deposit accounts.</P>
      <P>Some 19.7 percent of Taiwan manufactures said they plan to go to
Europe to set up footholds or warehouse within three years; 16.6
percent said they are assessing the possibility, while 63.7 percent
said they would not set up a European foothold.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwan businessmen are more willing than

    <HEADLINE>LAST SQUADRON OF MIRAGE FIGHTERS TO BE DEPLOYED BY NEXT MARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  northern Taiwan, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet
fighters ordered by the Republic of China Air Force have arrived in
Taiwan, with the last squadron to be deployed by next March,
according to an air force general on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Gen. Chin Nai-chieh, who is in charge of the Mirage fighter wings
at the Hsinchu Air Force Base, told the media that 40 Mirages have
already joined the combat-readiness deployment unit, while the last
squadron is undergoing intensive training.</P>
      <P>He said the air force originally planned to complete deployment
of the Mirage fleet by the end of this year, but the schedule has now
been extended to next March as the training for the last squadron
will be extended from six to eight months.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate the Mirage fighter's performance capability, Major
Liu Hui-chien, who has 650 flying hours in the French-made fighter,
made a performance flight for the media at the Hsinchu base.</P>
      <P>Meeting with reporters later, Liu said the Mirage is flawless in
flight training and combat training, adding that the only requirement
is to step up the training of personnel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Colonel Shen Yi-ming of the Mirage tactical combat
wing said that mainland China's SU-27 jet fighters are the presumed
rivals of Taiwan's Mirage fighters.</P>
      <P>He noted that both Mirage and SU-27 fighters are high-altitude
high-speed interceptors, but because Mirage 2000-5s have better
weapon systems, the ROC Air Force is able to maintain an air
supremacy over the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT RULES OUT LIEN-SOONG PRESIDENTIAL TICKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after former Taiwan Provincial
Governor James Soong said that he has crossed the Rubicon in his
presidential bid, ruling Kuomintang Secretary General James Chang
ruled out on Wednesday any possibility that Soong could be
recruited as the running mate of KMT presidential candidate Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>After a group of retired Kuomintang party officials lodged an
appeal to the KMT Central Standing Committee on Wednesday strongly
urging the Lien-Soong political partnership, Chang said that the
KMT's exhaustive efforts to broke a compromise between the two
politicians came to no avail due to Soong's insistence on running as
an independent.</P>
      <P>In light of Soong's snub of the KMT heavyweights' outreach on
Tuesday and the Friday deadline for the KMT to name Lien's running
mate, Chang said there is no possibility to have the Soong and Lien
on the same ticket.</P>
      <P>Chang confirmed a report in Wednesday's United Daily News that
Lien, positive that he will represent the party in the 2000
presidential race, wrote a personal letter to Soong exploring the
possibility of cooperation in the presidential election on Monday, 
only to see the letter returned within two hours.</P>
      <P>Denouncing Soong's rejection as "rude, irrational" behavior,
Chang said the former KMT secretary general has "disappointed
everyone who cares about the party."</P>
      <P>He called on party members to give up any hope of a Lien-Soong
partnership and unconditionally ruled out a meeting between Soong and
KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Soong spokesman on Wednesday urged KMT supporters to
stop collecting signatures for an appeal to Soong to serve as Lien's
running mate.</P>
      <P>"Justice delayed is justice denied," Ching Chin-shen said in
appealing to voters to stop the signature collection. He said that
any call, however well-intentioned, for Soong to give up his
presidential bid will only cause trouble for Soong.</P>
      <P>Ching thanked the supporters' for their concern but insisted that
the KMT leaders' outreach to Soong was insincere and a political
gambit aimed at shifting the blame for the party's division onto
Soong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST MAKE POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN CLEAR: EDITORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is a lesson and warning from
the Ronald Reagan years that Washington needs to make it clear to
Beijing that any violence against Taiwan would be met not with
diplomatic indulgence, but military force, a leading American
newspaper said editorially Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"When it comes to preserving peace, grave concern is no
substitute for the Seventh Fleet," said the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette
in its editorial titled "Chinese Puzzle: What would Ronald Reagan
do?"</P>
      <P>It said that uncertain about what to do about the two Chinas
except to keep insisting on the fiction that there is only one, the
United States' diplomatic establishment is in its usual dither. That
is, it's following Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's wobbly
lead, and she is giving off conflicting signals like a traffic light
stuck on red, yellow and green.</P>
      <P>Not since Dean Acheson put South Korea outside the American
"defensive perimeter" has the State Department given a potential
aggressor so clear an invitation. And the Pentagon has done its part
by calling off a military mission to Taiwan. It, too, seems resolved
to be irresolute. Various other American officials, civil and
military, have joined the confused chorus, attacking Taiwan's leaders
on and off the record as if they were the ones fomenting war. No
wonder the Communists on the mainland talk openly of using military
force against "the last redoubt of Chinese freedom," noted the
newspaper.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that Washington's policy is to have no policy,
hoping that the generous amounts of verbal fog will keep the peace.
Here is today's equivocation: The United States would clearly view an
attack on Taiwan as a matter of "grave concern," while Washington
just as clearly disapproves of Taiwan's acting like a free country
or, far worse, talking like one. Which is what Taiwan's president has
been doing, and the Clinton administration is not about to forgive
him for it.</P>
      <P>Trade replaced freedom as the lodestar of American foreign policy
in Asia sometime during the Bush administration. But not until now
has an American administration begun to "treat any talk of freedom
and independence from the other China, our old ally, as grounds for
abandonment," the newspaper pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette continued that it's not so much
that Washington's policy invites war, rather its lack of a policy
does. No one is quite sure what Washington would do if China fired a
few missiles over Taiwan as it has done before, or blockaded the
island's ports, or just occupied a smaller island or Quemoy and
Matsu. Once upon a time in the 1950s, such overt acts of aggression
would have been recognized for what they were. Now they might merit
only a polite protest. Which may be why Beijing is tempted to bite
off what it can.</P>
      <P>Back in 1980, the newspaper said, it wasn't the president of 
Taiwan who was asking that his island nation be treated as a state of
its own, but an American presidential candidate with a way of putting
things plain. Ronald Reagan's statements may have deterred the
aggressor, but they disturbed the kind of politicians who make a
career of ambiguity. So it was only natural for Mr. Reagan to mention
in his offhand way that, in his administration, Taiwan would have an
official relationship with the United States.</P>
      <P>Immediately, his running mate, the experienced and sophisticated
George Bush, stepped in to explain that of course Mr. Reagan hadn't
meant what he'd said. "But of course he had, and Beijing got the
message. Or at least it behaved itself once Ronald Reagan became the
next president of the United States," according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>The newspaper said that there is much to be said for giving
aggressors clear notice that they will be treated as aggressors,
rather than poor, misunderstood nations who only want to take over
their immediate neighbors. "Calling aggression by its right name may
prevent it. Going wobbly may only encourage it," stressed the
editorial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BURGLARY, DANGEROUS DRIVING MOST FEARED IN AUSTRALIA: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australians are more worried about their
house being burgled and dangerous and driving than being murdered,
assaulted or raped, according to the National Crime and Safety Survey
on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey shows most people fear break-ins, which account for 44
percent of all respondents; followed by dangerous and noisy driving
34 percent; and vandalism and graffiti and car theft, which account
for 24 and 28 percent respectively.</P>
      <P>Trailing behind are youth gangs, louts, drunkenness, illegal
drugs, problems with neighbors, prowlers and loiterers. Sexual
assault only accounts for 5 percent.</P>
      <P>"Maybe people have become a bit more realistic about it," said an
official of the Bureau of Crime Statistics in New South Wales. He
said the survey found people were increasingly concerned about crimes
closer to home instead of more serious offenses they were less likely

(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>University tuition in Canada is set for
another jump this year, with undergraduate arts students facing a
rise of 7.1 percent over the last academic year, a federal agency
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The average annual rise over the last five years has been about
nine percent as universities struggled to offset government funding
cuts.</P>
      <P>Statistics Canada said the average undergrad will pay C$3,379 in
tuition this year compared with C$3,156 in 1998-99. Graduate students
face an 8.3-percent increase, to an average of C$3,681.</P>
      <P>Fees rose this year in every province except British Columbia and
Quebec. The former has frozen tuition fees for the last five years
and Quebec is maintaining a freeze for residents, who pay C$1,668.
Non-residents, however, are looking at a 10-percent hike this year.</P>
      <P>Would-be doctors and dentists are hit hardest by fee increase,
Statscan noted. Medical schools will charge an average of C$5,699, a
15.6-percent increase from 1998-99.</P>
      <P>These are all the fees for Canadian citizens or landed
immigrants. Visa students from abroad usually are charged three times
what locals pay.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite an overnight rally on Wall Street
and aggressive foreign buying, the Taipei stock market on Thursday
closed 0.4 percent lower as heavy selling pressure near the end
session eroded early gains.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index shed
29.52 points to close at 8,097.57 points, following a 1.8-percent
rise in the previous session.</P>
      <P>A total of 3.44 billion share changed hands on a turnover of
NT$149.88 billion (US$ 4.7 billion), compared to NT$125.36 billion on

44.19 points higher and at one point had soared 113.08 points to
8,240.17 points. But late profit-taking took the index to negative

      <P>As market confidence remains fragile, investors rushed to lock in
profits when the index surged, dealers said, adding that the stock
market is trapped in a consolidation phase and sharp gains in the
near term are unlikely.</P>
      <P>The construction sector and the plastic and chemical sector
enjoyed the only gains among the eight major stock categories, as
both finished 0.4 percent higher.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff issues reported the largest losses, falling 1.5
percent; they were followed by paper-making issues, which lost 1
percent, and textile shares, which lost 0.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market closed 1.22 points higher at 176.70
points on a turnover of NT$6.33 billion.</P>

      <P>Australia is stalling the sale of its
liquefied natural gas worth A$50 (over US$33) billion over the next
10 years because it fears offending mainland China, the Australian
Financial Review reported in its front page lead news on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the article headlined: "China row threatens A$50 billion
deal," the daily, the largest business newspaper in Australia,
reported Taiwan's offer to buy the LNG this week following reports
that China might sign its own A$15 (US$10) billion agreement when
President Jiang Zemin makes his first official visit to Canberra in
early September. Sales to China are expected to start by 2004 with an
annual amount of 3 million tons.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs on Wednesday night as denying suggestions that the Howard
government was stalling on the Taiwan offer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently imports about 3.5 million tons of LNG from
Indonesia and Malaysia. Taipei has told Canberra it is anxious to
diversify its sources of supply, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Taipei's irritation has been intensified by
reports in the Review that Chinese ambassador to Australia has spoken
about the possibility of the LNG sale because China appreciated
Australia's view on Taiwan.</P>

plan to establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan in return for

    <HEADLINE>INSTIGATORS OF FOREIGN LABORER MELEE MAY FACE REPATRIATION: POLICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The instigators of a melee involving some
300 Indonesian and Philippine laborers Wednesday night may face
repatriation if the two laborers who were injured in the fight file
lawsuits, the Yunlin police said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The two workers were reportedly injured in the brawl between
Indonesian and Filipino workers, all employees of Formosa Plastics'
naphtha cracking plant in Mailiao, Yunlin. The two groups engaged in
a melee late Wednesday night using wooden clubs, bricks and iron
sticks as weapons.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA),
the scuffle was due to a personal vendetta between Indonesian workers
and their Filipino manager.</P>
      <P>Two Indonesian workers were about to be dismissed by Formosa
Plastics because of a "poor work performance." The two Indonesians
suspected their Filipino foreman had lodged a false management
report. The Indonesians met the Filipinos for a "talk" Tuesday night.
That "talk" occurred without any violence.</P>
      <P>However, Wednesday night, Filipino workers physically attacked
Indonesian laborers, instigating a mass brawl. Reports say up to 300
laborers, all working for Formosa Plastics, took part.</P>
      <P>Mailiao police were called in immediately to calm the melee and
found that at least two were injured.</P>
      <P>To prevent further conflicts from occurring, Formosa Plastic
management ordered some 500 Indonesian workers to move to another
dormitory building in the plant complex.</P>
      <P>Fist fights and exchanges of dirty words occurred again Thursday
morning while the Indonesian workers were moving, according to the
police.</P>
      <P>If the two injured laborers file a lawsuit against those
instigators of the violence, the accused might face repatriation,
police said.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's scuffle was the second brawl involving Formosa
Plastic foreign workers since the Mailiao plant became operational in
1993. In June 1997, Philippine and Thai laborers engaged in a bloody
conflict after several bicycles were stolen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR DENIES CANCELLATION OF 'TWO CITIES FORUM'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Thursday
denied that the city government has canceled plans to host a Forum of
Two Cities between Taipei and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Rebutting rumors that the forum will be canceled as a result of
an adverse impact from President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" assertion on cross-strait relations, Ma said the
forum will be held in Taipei with representatives from both Taipei
and Hong Kong taking part.</P>
      <P>Ma said the schedule of the forum is expected to be finalized
soon after the Hong Kong sponsors notify Taipei City of a proposed
date. That notification is expected within a week.</P>
      <P>The Forum of Two Cities, a brainchild of Ma, was first proposed
by the mayor when he last visited Hong Kong in March. Several private
Hong Kong groups will jointly sponsor the gathering.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks Thursday when he met with Liu Huei-ching,
convenor of The Frontier, a Hong Kong-based political group, and a
member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council.</P>
      <P>Liu and a group of representatives of several Hong Kong private
organizations are currently on a fact-finding tour of Taipei, mainly
to gain a better understanding of Taiwan's medical services and the
national health insurance program that has been in effect in Taiwan
for more than five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMY UNVEILS SKY BOW MISSILE BASE IN KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Army unveiled its
Sky Bow surface-to-air missile base in Linyuan in the southern
Taiwan county of Kaohsiung County on Thursday amid escalation of
tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the ROC military has opened its
Sky Bow air-defense missile base for media coverage. Observers said
the move is part of the military's efforts to allay local people's
jitters about possible mainland Chinese attacks over the "special
state-to-state relationship" controversy.</P>
      <P>The Army General Headquarters said all Sky-Bow missile units
in Taiwan and on offshore islands have completed combat deployment
with the assistance of the Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology (CIST) and the Combined Service Force.</P>
      <P>The CIST-developed Sky Bow surface-to-air missiles have been
deployed at six army bases, with five in Taiwan and one in Tungyin,
a small islet of the Matsu island group which lies closer to
mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The five Sky Bow missile bases in Taiwan are located in Sanchih,
a northern Taiwan coastal township; Penghu, an offshore island county
off southwestern Taiwan coast; Taichung in central Taiwan; and two
bases in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>All of the six Sky Bow missile bases are equipped with
highly advanced phased array radar systems.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CIST, the military's research and development
arm, has completed combat testing on the second-generation Sky Bow
missiles. Military sources said Sky Bow II missiles are more
sophisticated and more powerful than Sky Bow I missiles. Mass
production and deployment of Sky Bow II missiles have also got
underway, CIST officials said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has launched new rounds of saber-rattling against Taiwan
since ROC President Lee Teng-hui said in an interview with a German
radio station on July 9 that Taiwan-mainland China relations should
be on a "special state-to-state relationship" basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RARE STOAT SPECIES FOUND ENDEMIC ONLY TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest collaborative research between
specialists from Taiwan and Japan has confirmed that the two mini
stoats discovered in mountains in central Taiwan are a virtual "relic
species" and endemic only to Taiwan, according to an Asahi Shimbun
report.</P>
      <P>Associate Professor Lin Liang-kung from Taiwan's Tunghai
University who found the two stoats, and Masanori Harada, an
associate professor of the City University of Osaka, recently
announced that the Taiwan mountain stoat, believed to be an Arctic
species that survived the last ice age, is unique and endemic only to
Taiwan, the Asahi Shimbun report said.</P>
      <P>Lin and Harada made public their findings after conducting a
series of laborious DNA comparisons between cell samples of the two
Formosan stoats and those of distant relatives originating from
Japan, Russia and the Korean Peninsula.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the rare Formosan stoats have been
discovered since World War II, according to the Asahi Shimbun report.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, who discovered the first Formosan stoat on Mt.
Hohuan in June 1997 and the second in July this year, the mammal is
known as a "relic species" and is considered as important a species
in biological terms as Taiwan's other relic species, the Formosan
landlocked salmon.</P>
      <P>"Relic species" refers to a species that has survived from a
previous age, such as before the last ice age, when many other
species died out.</P>
      <P>The rare stoats that Lin found on 3,000-meter Mt. Hohuan are both
adult mammals weighing some 20 grams each and are around 16
centimeters and 20 centimeters long.</P>
      <P>With brown fur all over its body except for its belly, which has
white fur, the Formosan stoat looks like the snow stoat that has been
found in the high mountains of Japan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin speculated that the Formosan stoat is descended from stoats
originating in mainland China 10,000 to 60,000 years ago and has
evolved as a unique species in isolated highland areas in Taiwan,
which is believed to be the creature's only habitat.</P>
      <P>It is biologically significant that an essentially Arctic species
like the Formosan stoat can be found in subtropical Taiwan, Lin
noted. It suggests that more previously unknown or rare species of
animals and plants may remain to be discovered in remote and
mountainous areas of Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's biological records, the two Formosan stoats
that Lin found are the third and fourth stoat of their kind to have
been found in Taiwan in recent years. A similar specimen was found
dead in 1996 and is now stored at the National Taichung Museum of
Natural Sciences. A second one was captured five years ago, also by
Lin, near central Taiwan's Jade Mountain, but he released the animal,
mistaking it for a more common weasel.</P>
      <P>Lin and his researchers have established observation posts in
areas above 3,000 meters in national parks in the hope that more
specimens will be found and thus contribute to research into the
species.</P>
      <P>Lin's only worry is that the Formosan stoat's population is under
threat, as it is believed to share its habitat with weasels, which
are far more abundant and will compete with the stoats for limited
food resources. Both species are ferocious carnivores that prey
mainly on mice, shrews and voles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN-SIEW TICKET NOT A PLUS FOR KMT, SAYS DPP SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Lien-Siew ticket is not a plus for the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in the 2000 presidential election, said the
secretary-general of the major opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu Hsi-kun made the remark as the KMT prepares to announce its
ticket, which is expected to match presidential candidate and current
Vice President Lien Chan with Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT's singling out of the head of a "disastrous
cabinet" to be its vice presidential candidate is not a plus for the
party. Instead such a ticket would make the DPP feel that it is "more
and more close to victory in the election," he said.</P>
      <P>Yu Ying-lung, spokesman for the headquarters of DPP presidential
hopeful Chen Shui-bian, said a Lien-Siew ticket is the party's third
choice. The KMT would rather see Lien paired with former Taiwan
Provincial Governor James Soong or Senior Adviser to the President Wu
Poh-hsiung.</P>
      <P>When Siew assumed his post, he promised that his cabinet would be
one of action, but the facts have shown otherwise, Yu Ying-lung
said.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that although Siew has the image of a yes-man,
he still possesses plenty of administrative resources as a civil
servant. In addition, Siew is a native of southern Taiwan and may
help the KMT to grab votes in that region.</P>
      <P>Yu Hsi-kun said the men close to Lien, including Siew, are mostly
outdated in their thinking. He slammed Siew for what he called the
string of disasters that have occurred during Siew's tenure, and he
said Siew is not good at dealing with crises.</P>
      <P>Yu Hsi-kun called Siew's cabinet a "disastrous cabinet" and said
the Lien-Siew ticket is nothing new and not a plus for the KMT.</P>
      <P>Yu Ying-lung noted that for the KMT, a Lien-Soong ticket would be
the best choice, but such a ticket will not be formed, as Soong has
declared his intention to run for president as an independent.</P>
      <P>Although a Lien-Wu ticket is the second best choice, it seems
that the combination is also impossible because Wu loudly and
publicly voiced in early August his intention to be Lien's running
mate, an act that breaks a taboo of the ruling party.</P>

      <P>As the presidential election approaches,
the ruling Kuomintang's quasi-presidential candidate Lien Chan on
Thursday urged all KMT party member to unite closely to fight against
those who bear "daydreams" of bringing to an end the KMT or the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Over 500 supporters from the overseas "Friends of Lien Chan Club"
on Thursday morning gathered outside the headquarters of the KMT's
Central Committee to drum up support for Lien. Loud chants of "Lien
Chan, elected" echoed through the building.</P>
      <P>While delivering a thank-you speech, Lien noted that it is the
aspiration of all Taiwan people that Taiwan become a completely
modernized country -- characterized by dignity, peace, job
opportunities and justice -- in the 21st century. This, he added,
is his main political goal.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that many different views, some of which would
be contrary to those of the KMT and are mainly fierce attacks to KMT
ruling, would be raised during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Some will campaign for the termination of the ROC, while some are
keen on knocking down the KMT. Hence, all KMT supporters have to work
together to ensure the victory of the KMT in the upcoming
presidential election so as to create a modern ROC, Lien said.</P>
      <P>At the gathering, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jyng-ping, Vice
Chairman Rau Yin-chi and KMT Secretary-General John Chang were also

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO MAKE PUBLIC FLIGHT SAFETY ASSESSMENTS</HEADLINE>

(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many local scholars and experts, concerned
over the poor safety record of China Airlines (CAL), on Thursday
called for the government to make public airlines' flight information
and their flight safety assessments.</P>
      <P>The scholars and experts voiced their opinions at a seminar
sponsored by the Consumers Foundation in the wake of a CAL jet crash
landing Sunday that killed two passengers and injured 212 others, the
third serious accident for CAL this decade.</P>
      <P>The flight accident rate of the island's civilian airlines is 3.7
times that of the worldwide average, according to an investigation.</P>
      <P>Su Ching-hsia, secretary-general of the Consumers Foundation,
said that domestic consumers have all been in the dark in terms of
their knowledge about the flight safety records of various airlines
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su called for the government to implement a flight safety
assessment project thoroughly. The government should make public the
number of flight hours of all the pilots of Taiwan's airlines, as
well as maintenance records and an explanation of how the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) supervises the airlines, Su said.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, Lai Hse-bao, a lawmaker from the opposition
New Party, said that not only is the CAA's flight safety team
seriously understaffed, no team members have internationally
recognized flight-safety supervisory licenses. The government cannot
shirk its responsibility in addressing the issue, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, chief convener of the legislative caucus of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party, also censured CAL for
being reckless.</P>
      <P>Wu Jung-kuei, head of the Navigation and Aviation Department

that a government-designed flight safety measurement based on
information from airlines' flight records will be released to the
public within two weeks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'SPECIAL STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY IS DEFENSIVE POLICY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Aug.  25  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui's
"special state-to-state" theory is basically a defensive policy to
cope with changes in the status quo and rules of game in
Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties, a scholar said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tien Hung-mao, director of the Institute for National
Policy Research, a Taipei-based private think tank, said President
Lee was forced to redefine relations across the Taiwan Strait
because the rules of game in the triangular
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations have been changed by the United
States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tien, a national policy adviser to Lee, said US President Bill
Clinton's 1998 "three noes" statement and Assistant Secretary of
State Stanley Roth's recent "interim agreement" proposal have made
President Lee feel that the US stance on cross-strait ties have
been leaning toward Beijing.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Tien said, Beijing has unilaterally backed off a
1992 cross-strait consensus that each side is allowed to have its
own definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tien said, President Lee passively
declared in an interview with a German radio station on July 9 that
cross-strait relations should be on a "special state-to-state"
basis.</P>
      <P>"Lee's declaration is basically a passive, defensive and
preventive move to ward off imbalance in cross-strait ties and
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations," Tien said, adding
that the "special state-to-state" definition just affirms reality
in order to ensure Taiwan's survival and safety.</P>
      <P>Tien, a US-trained political scientist who maintains close ties
with the Republic of China's policy-making system, said even though
communist China has repeatedly pressured the United States to force
Taiwan to retract the "special state-to-state" theory, the Clinton
administration has so far not asked Taiwan to do so.</P>
      <P>The US government has only expressed hopes that Taiwan will
continue exchanges, dialogue and negotiations with mainland China so
as to work out a peaceful solution to their disputes, Tien said.</P>
      <P>As to Beijing's reaction, Tien said mainland China has so far not
conducted abnormal military activities and that its air force has
maintained normal operations. "There are also no signs showing that
mainland China has moved troops from inland provinces to coastal
areas opposite Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tien further predicted that mainland China will not take
any military action against Taiwan before the island's next
direct presidential election scheduled for March 2000. "Mainland
leaders will wait until after the election to decide whether to take
any military action against Taiwan," he forecast.</P>
      <P>Tien made the above remarks in a speech to a seminar sponsored
by the North California Taiwan Chamber of commerce.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Tien's current US trip is to attend a
closed-door seminar to be held in New York on cross-strait relations
and the US policy toward Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tien said two US officials in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs
--Kurt Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, Susan Shirk,
deputy assistant secretary of state, will also attend the roundtable
meeting.</P>

      <P>Field surveys conducted by Hsu's research team found that more
than 80 percent Taipei households have been haunted by cockroaches.
"The number of cockroaches found in a single household ranges from
tens to hundreds," Hsu said, adding that most cockroaches found
here are German species.</P>
      <P>Noting that German cockroaches are highly reproductive, Hsu said
a German cockroach can lay an average of 30 eggs a day and that it
takes only a very short period of time for an egg to grow into a
mature cockroach.</P>
      <P>"Given German cockroach's high reproduction capability, I'm not
surprised by the catch of more than 4,800 cockroaches overnight at a
20-ping Taipei bakery," Hsu said. (One ping equals 36 square feet.)</P>
      <P>Hsu said German cockroaches have topped American and Australian
species as well as brown-banded cockroaches and small brown
cockroaches to become the largest cockroach species in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu further said cockroaches have not only haunted local
families but also hospitals and clinics. "Cockroaches are the main
vehicle to spread a variety of viruses and bacteria at local
hospitals," he noted.</P>
      <P>Many insect scholars and pharmaceutical makers have been
endeavoring to study ways to extinguish cockroaches. Novartis Co.,
for instance, plans to market a drug that can halt cockroaches'
reproduction capabilities.

    <HEADLINE>CAA CHIEF CRITICIZED FOR FAILURE TO IMPROVE AVIATION SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director-general of the Republic of
China's Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) faced severe criticism
from lawmakers on Thursday for the recent series of aviation
incidents among Taiwan carriers.</P>
      <P>Scolded for his failure to improve aviation safety, Chang
Yu-hern dissolved into tears at one point, although he defended
himself by saying that he has put all his strength into his work.</P>
      <P>Chang, who holds a doctoral degree in transportation management
and a license as an aeronautic engineering technician, was a
professor at the Tainan-based National Cheng Kung University before
taking his current post eight months ago.</P>
      <P>A non-partisan legislative group invited Chang and CAA officials
to a lunch meeting to discuss aviation safety in the wake of two
recent incidents involving local airliners which have claimed two
lives and injured more than 200 people.</P>
      <P>A China Airlines MD-11 passenger jet crash landed at Chek Lap Kok
airport in Hong Kong on Sunday at the height of typhoon Sam, killing
two people and injuring 213. Two days later, a domestic UNI Airliners
MD-90 was engulfed in flames after it skidded off the runway at
Hualien Airport in eastern Taiwan, resulting in 28 injuries.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chau-jung of the ruling Kuomintang noted that no
high-ranking officials have been seen to have taken responsibility
for the incidents, pointing out that Premier Vincent Siew was too
busy celebrating Vice President Lien Chan's birthday to respond to
news of the crash.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, Transportation and Communications Minister
Lin Feng-cheng has been spending all his time delivering messages
from Lien to James Soong, an independent presidential hopeful, in an
attempt to recruit Soong as Lien's presidential running mate.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hou Huei-hsien said the CAA has had eight heads
since 1990, none of whom have performed well.</P>
      <P>In other related news, the Cabinet-level Aviation Safety Council
(ASC) revealed that experts have completed the decoding of the
cockpit voice recorder, one of two flight data recorders on the UNI
Air jet involved in the Hualien incident, and have detected no
abnormalities.</P>
      <P>ASC Director of Administration Jung Kai said the council needs
more time to decode the other recorder that contains digital flight
navigation data, and added that a 10-strong panel formed by the US
civil aeronautics authorities and the plane's maker, McDonnell
Douglas Corp., will arrive in Hualien on Saturday to help investigate
the accident.</P>
      <P>Members of the task force will include an expert in explosions,
he said, noting that existing evidence, including eye-witness
accounts, have suggested that an explosion was the cause of the fire.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities arrested on
Aug. 4 eight leaders of a small secret army in the Chongqing area
in southwestern Sichuan province on charges of "subverting state
power," according to a recent report by the Yang Cheng Evening News
of Guangzhou city in southeastern Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>The report said that the anti-Communist army is composed of only
several dozens of farmers from 13 villages and townships in the area
in eastern Sichuan, and that the army was established in June, 1998.</P>
      <P>Authorities found many anti-government slogans and short poems
in more than 20 villages and townships in the area in June, the
report said. But it did not reveal the contents of those slogans and
poems.</P>
      <P>The report said that 10 leaders of the secret army were wanted
by authorities, and that two of them are still at large.</P>
      <P>One of the leaders is Yang Jiahua, 52, of Zhijiang County in
eastern Sichuan. He was previously wanted by public safety
authorities for participating in an anti-Communist organization in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of local legislators on Thursday
set up the Taiwan-Sweden Parliamentarians Association, the first time
an association of this kind has been set up without using the name
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Huang Ming-ho (KMT, Changhua) and Lee Hsien-jen (KMT, Taipei
County), both backed President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of ties
between Taiwan and mainland China as "a special state-to-state
relationship," saying they believe that a proper distinction between
Taiwan and China will help Taiwan's position in the international
community, which is why they organized the Taiwan-Sweden
Parliamentarians Association, they said.</P>
      <P>More than 20 dignitaries, including Legislative Yuan President
Wang Ching-ping, legislators Hsu Shao-ping (KMT, Keelung), Wang
Hsueh-feng (Democratic Progressive Party, Taipei City), Hsu Jong-su
(DPP legislator-at-large) Ying Chih-hung (New Party, overseas
Chinese), and five Swedish parliamentarians witnessed the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-ping said that parliamentary diplomacy will help fill
in the shortcomings of traditional diplomatic activities, and that
the ROC will continue to promote parliamentary diplomacy, especially
among European countries.</P>
      <P>Huang said he has visited Sweden several times, and has found
that Taiwan can learn a great deal from the Scandinavian country's
social welfare system. In addition, Sweden's high-tech development
can provide cooperation opportunities for Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>Sten Tolgfors, chairman of the foreign relations committee of the
Swedish parliament, said in return that Sweden and Taiwan should
strengthen their cooperation and exchanges in the fields of small-

    <TEXT>
      <P>The economies of Southeast Asian countries,
hard-hit by the 1997-98 financial turmoil, are on the way to
recovery, but their steady growth may be affected by some "changeable
elements."</P>
      <P>The results of a study released on Thursday by the Republic of
China Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) cited the changeable
elements as huge foreign debts, heavy dependence on the US and
Japanese economies, high shares of the electronics industry, lack of
self-reliance in technology, unstable political and social
situations, and the effects of mainland China's economy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the effect of a possible devaluation of mainland
China's currency, the renminbi, the report said the timing and scale
of such a devaluation poses a threat to Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Although there are no signs that a devaluation of the renminbi is
likely in the immediate future, the report noted, the threat remains
as the mainland's balance of international payments and its exports
have not been as good as expected.</P>
      <P>The report also said that mainland China and Southeast Asian
countries are using abundant and inexpensive labor forces to support
their competitiveness, and are attempting to woo as much foreign
capital as possible to expand their economies.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it said, the most important question for mainland
China and Southeast Asia is how to avoid unnecessary, harmful
competition in these aspects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF STILL PREPARING FOR TAIWAN VISIT BY MAINLAND CHINA ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is still preparing for an autumn
visit by mainland China's top envoy to the island, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Unless the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) officially informs the SEF that ARATS Chairman
Wang Daohan has canceled his Taiwan visit, the SEF will continue
making arrangements for Wang's trip, an optimistic Shi said.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Beijing may change its policy
toward Taiwan, or cancel Wang's visit to Taiwan, after mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin meets US President Bill Clinton in a
coming meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum,
Shi told reporters that Taipei will closely watch subsequent
developments. Any meeting between the two must not hurt Taiwan's
interests, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Although it has been rumored that Beijing intends to cancel
Wang's visit to Taiwan in the wake of President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of Taiwan's ties with mainland China as a "special
state-to-state relationship," Shi said he thinks Wang's visit will go
ahead as scheduled according to the consensus reached between the two
sides when SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu paid a historic visit to Wang in
Shanghai last October.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the widespread rhetoric that Beijing is gravely
concerned that Wang's Taiwan trip may reflect Beijing's endorsement
of Lee's "special relationship" theory, the SEF secretary-general
pointed out that while Koo met Wang and Jiang last year, that did not
represent Taiwan endorsement of the Beijing-proposed "one country,
two systems" formula for China's unification.</P>
      <P>Taipei is opposed to Beijing's "one country, two systems" scheme,
but has never threatened to suspend dialogue and exchanges with the
mainland unless Beijing renounces it, Shi noted.</P>
      <P>The existence of the SEF and ARATS is to serve the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, not to serve politics, he pointed out,
stressing that the two sides should first address issues of major
concern and interest arising from bilateral exchanges of the people
of both sides.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that Taiwan and the mainland remain sharply
divided over the definition of the disputed "one China" principle,
Shi proposed that Wang should not scrap his Taiwan trip and that
Taiwan and the mainland should continue to maintain two-way exchanges
under the framework that each side can express its own interpretation
of so-called "one China."</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semiofficial organizations representing
Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to conduct cross-strait exchanges
in the absence of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>

another jump this year, with undergraduate arts students facing a
rise of 7.1 percent over the last academic year, a federal agency
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The average annual rise over the last five years has been about 9

      <P>Statistics Canada said the average undergrad will pay C$3,379 in

face an 8.3-percent increase, to an average of C$3,681.</P>
      <P>Fees rose this year in every province except British Columbia and
Quebec. The former has frozen tuition fees for the last five years
and Quebec is maintaining a freeze for residents, who pay C$1,668.
Non-residents, however, are looking at a 10-percent hike this year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Allegations that Vice President Lien Chan,
the ruling Kuomintang's candidate for the 2000 presidential election,
has chosen Premier Vincent Siew as his running mate caused concern at
the Legislative Yuan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Doubting that Siew can juggle the demanding job of premier with
the responsibilities of joining the election campaign, many
legislators from various parties have voiced their opposition to
Siew's candidacy.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and New Party said that if he accepts Lien's offer, Siew should
resign as premier and concentrate on the election.</P>
      <P>As the head of the government, they said, a premier should stay
beyond the election fray and refrain from influencing its outcome by
aiding any party in the race.</P>
      <P>Even some legislators of the ruling Kuomintang would not support
the partnership between Lien and Siew.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chin Hui-chu predicted that the choice of Siew
will draw fire from KMT legislators who support Wu Poh-hsiung,
another vice-president-aspirant.</P>
      <P>A former KMT secretary-general, Wu is the only KMT heavyweight to
repeatedly express his desire to represent the party in the race for
vice president, and a campaign to seek support for Wu's bid is under
way among KMT legislators, led by Legislator Wu Ke-ching.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Hsu Cheng-kun said that Siew has already
used his office to aid Lien's campaign over the past six months, and
is expected to do this even more blatantly if he is named as Lien's
running mate.</P>
      <P>In order to keep the election just and fair, Hsu said he will
force Siew to choose between the premiership and candidacy, or face a
boycott at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Chen Chien-jen refused on Thursday to answer
questions about how Siew will defuse the critics' blame because his
candidacy is still pending KMT approval. He said, however, that the
premier will act according to the law.</P>
      <P>A government official who asked not to be named said that the law
does not prohibit government officials from running for public
office.</P>
      <P>Citing former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong and former
Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian as examples, the official said there
are many prominent cases of government officials running for office
without giving up their government jobs.</P>
      <P>As to the legislative opposition, the senior official said with
confidence that it will be defused by Lien and Siew. Given the KMT's
overwhelming majority at the Legislative Yuan, and the fact that some
DPP legislators favor Siew's candidacy, the official said any boycott
by Siew's opponents will be totally ineffective.</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan, who will

will formally name Premier Vincent Siew as his running mate on

      <P>The Lien-Siew ticket is expected to be approved by the KMT
Central Standing Committee at an extraordinary meeting later that
day, with the Party National Congress giving its final stamp of

      <P>On Thursday, Lien met with the chiefs of the Executive Yuan, the

secretaries-general of the National Security Council, the
Presidential Office and the KMT Central Committee, telling them of
his decision to select Siew as his running mate.</P>
      <P>According to Legislative Yuan President Wang Chin-pyng, Lien
praised Siew as a qualified choice to team up with, because of his

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four of the highest escalators in Taiwan
are expected to be inaugurated at an interchange mass transit station
in eastern Taipei by the end of the year, the Department of Rapid
Transit Systems said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Department officials said that it will take people in the
Chunghsiao Fuhsing Station one minute and 15 seconds to ride the
escalators stretching from three floors below ground to the station's
third floor.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the opening of part of the Nankang Line by the
end of the year, the officials said that Chunghsiao Fuhsing Station
will be the interchange for the Nankang Line and the Mucha Line,
which connects Taipei City Zoo and Chung Shan Middle School.</P>
      <P>A temporary Chunghsiao Fuhsing station now serves passengers
traveling along the Mucha line. Construction of a permanent station
building has been completed, and the installation of the four
escalators is underway.</P>
      <P>They said that the escalators, imported from Germany, measure
19.72 meters high and 49 meters long. They will be the highest
escalators in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Nankang line will run from the headquarters of Academia

between Taipei City Hall and Lungshan Temple will be open by the end
of the year. A trip between those two points will take about 13
minutes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng, who resigned earlier this week, said on
Friday that he is happy to have decided to leave the post so that he
can start a new era in his life.</P>
      <P>Sheu, however, refused to disclose future career plans, calling
his affairs "personal."</P>
      <P>He also denied media reports that his resignation was related to
a "question of chemistry and understanding" between him and MAC
Chairman Su Chi.</P>
      <P>Su, through his aides, said Friday that he envies Sheu and his
wife for deciding to retire simultaneously, and he denied that there
is any difference of opinion between him and Sheu.</P>
      <P>Sheu said his resignation is expected to go into effect Oct. 1,
and all his superiors have agreed.</P>
      <P>Sheu, 66, a graduate of National Taiwan University, has a
master's degree from the University of Hawaii. He served as an
economics liaison official at Republic of China representative
offices in Britain and the United States before becoming
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Before becoming MAC vice chairman, Sheu was vice economic affairs
minister.</P>
      <P>Commenting on remarks made by Macau's chief executive-designate
Edmund Ho that the official name of Taiwan's liaison office in Macau
should be changed after the Portuguese colony was returned to
mainland Chinese rule on Dec. 20, Sheu, as MAC spokesman, said it is
yet the time now to discuss the name change. MAC will pay close
attention to this issue, he said.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's suppression of Falun Gong followers on the Chinese
mainland, Sheu said communist Chinese authorities should not focus
all their efforts on economic reforms. Rather, he said, the policy
makers there should do more to protect human rights and religious
freedom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RIFT BETWEEN TAIWAN AND CHINA WIDENING: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is difficult to imagine Taiwan and
mainland China reunifying unless the latter changes, said an American
national newspaper Thursday.</P>
      <P>USA Today reported from Taipei that, since President Lee Teng-hui
declared on July 9 that mainland China and Taiwan should deal with
each other as separate states and Beijing responded with threats to
invade if Taiwan declares formal independence, Taiwanese nationalism
has been rising.</P>
      <P>The report said that the nationalism is hardly surprising, as "50
years of separation have pushed mainland China and Taiwan so far
apart politically, socially and culturally that it is difficult to
imagine them ever being part of the same whole -- unless China
changes."</P>
      <P>It seems that more and more people in Taiwan regard mainland
China as a foreign land. In one of the latest national opinion polls
in Taiwan, taken after President Lee's statement, 46 percent of
Republic of China nationals identified themselves as strictly
Taiwanese, up from 37 percent in April. Those identifying themselves
as both Taiwanese and Chinese fell to 42 from 45 percent, and those
identifying themselves as only Chinese edged down to 11.4 from 12.7
percent.</P>
      <P>The American newspaper said, "Changing sentiments, unless
curtailed, will make it tougher for mainland China and Taiwan to
peacefully reunite," which both have agreed to do in the future and
which the United States says is the preferred outcome.</P>
      <P>The current tense situation across the Taiwan Strait is far from
what the people of Taiwan want, according to the report. Before
President Lee's statement, the majority of Taiwan's 22 million people
were content to promise reunification and go about their lives,
opinion polls showed.</P>
      <P>But USA Today pointed out that despite reunification dreams, the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait are worlds apart: Taiwan is a vibrant
democracy, while mainland China is a one-party state ruled by the
Communist Party; Taiwan is one of the richest places in Asia, while
mainland China is one of the poorest; the streets of Taipei are
crowded with cars and motorcycles, while bicycles are the only mode
of transportation many mainland Chinese can afford.</P>
      <P>"There is little interest" for the people of Taiwan in news
from mainland China, a news executive at a television station in
Taipei was quoted as saying. Young people in Taiwan "don't think
anything from mainland China is worth copying," said a Taipei
business executive and mother of two teenagers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRIADS LINKED TO HACKING AT CANADIAN MISSION IN HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A published report said Thursday that
mainland Chinese nationals linked to organized crime broke into
computers at the Canadian High Commission in Hong Kong in 1992 to
hide their links with "triads," or the Chinese mafia.</P>
      <P>The National Post and the Vancouver Province carried an identical
report saying the Canadian government has for seven years covered up
the security breach, in which commission staff were allegedly bribed
to delete computer files.</P>
      <P>A related concern is that some 2,000 stolen visa forms have been
used for people, including criminals, to enter Canada illegally, the
report said.</P>
      <P>It quoted secret documents as saying at least 788 files from the
Computer-Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) were deleted,
and up to 2,000 blank visa forms have disappeared.</P>
      <P>For seven years, the RCMP, Immigration Canada and the Department
of Foreign Affairs are alleged to have kept a lid on the case,
unwilling to reveal the extent of what several sources call a "breach
of national security," the dailies said.</P>
      <P>In 1992, Ottawa sent two officials to investigate, but they just
carried out a cursory investigation, the Province quoted reliable
sources as saying.</P>
      <P>Despite evidence indicating security breaches by locally employed
staff and the discovery of fake Immigration Canada stamps in one of
their desks, neither of the two officials sent to Hong Kong
recommended further investigations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THIRD CAL CRASH VICTIM DIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Chou Chia-hung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong man surnamed Chou who
suffered massive burns during a crash landing of a China Airlines
(CAL) passenger liner last Sunday died on Friday, increasing to three
the number of people who died from the crash.</P>
      <P>According to hospital sources, Chou suffered burns to more than
55 percent of his body.</P>
      <P>As of Friday 31 passengers and crew members injured in the crash
remained hospitalized, with one in critical condition, the hospital
sources said.</P>
      <P>A CAL MD-11 jetliner crash-landed in flames and flipped upside
down onto a runaway at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport during the
height of Typhoon Sam. Miraculously, the crash, the worst accident so
far at Hong Kong's new airport, left only two dead and 211 injured
before Chou's death on Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Airport Administration reported that the
removal of the wreckage of the ill-fated CAL MD-11 from the airport
area hit another snag Friday as the debris was too big and too heavy
to be towed by existing crane facilities.</P>
      <P>Administration officials said the wreckage removal work has
become even more difficult after days of torrential rainfall that
helped to sink the wreckage into the earth. In addition, the weight
of the debris has been increased as a result of residue from the
material used to extinguish the flames.</P>
      <P>An administration spokesman said it has been decided that the
wreckage will be sawed into three parts before workers make any
further moves.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomingtang on Friday approved
Vice President Lien Chan and Premier Vincent Siew as party's ticket
in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>At the KMT's provisional Central Standing Committee meeting, the
participants first heard reports by the party's Department of
Organization Affairs, which reported that Lien garnered support from
96.33 percent of the 2,180 party delegates who voted last Saturday on
the selection of the party's candidate.</P>
      <P>The proposal was passed by means of resounding applause. Lien
then recommended Premier Siew as his running mate, which was also
passed in the same manner.</P>
      <P>The Party National Congress will give the final stamp of approval
on Aug. 29.</P>
      <P>President Lee said the 2000 presidential election is crucial to
the future development of the nation, and that the party must unify
to ensure Lien and Siew win the election.</P>
      <P>He stressed that he, in his capacity as party chairman, will
work with all party members to fight tooth and nail for the party's
victory.</P>
      <P>Three Central Standing Committee members -- Koo Chen-fu, Wang
You-cheng and Wang Jin-pyng -- spoke in the meeting. They lauded the
Lien-Siew ticket as a correct and appropriate team, and they said
they are confident of the pair's victory in the election.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang also said that there is no problem in regard to
Siew's running, even though he is currently premier. Some legislators
have questioned the premier's ability to balance the demands of his
position with those of a strenuous campaign and have requested that
Siew resign as premier if he accepts the nomination as Lien's running
mate.</P>
      <P>Both said that it would be perfectly plausible for a public
official to run in a race without resigning his position, adding that
there are many examples of officials who have done this.</P>
      <P>Central Standing Committee member Wu Poh-hsiung, who sought to be
Lien's running mate, and former Legislative Yuan President Liu
Sung-fan did not attend Friday's meeting.</P>
      <P>After the 30-minute meeting, Lien spoke to his supporters, who
had thronged to the party's Headquarters.</P>
      <P>Lien lauded the 60-year-old Siew as one who has served in various
major government posts, adding that he has rich experience in both
the administrative and legislative branches of government.</P>

      <P>Passengers on Taipei's mass rapid transit
(MRT) system will have to learn to read the pinyin romanization
system for Chinese place names following a decision by the Taipei
City Government.</P>
      <P>Under the new spelling system, Yuanshan will be the only MRT
station to retain its original English spelling. Other stations, for
example Chunghsiao-Fuhsing, will be respelled as Zhongxiao-Fuxing.
The English spelling changes will cost the city government an
estimated NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>However, since many stations are named after nearby institutions
or landmarks, some controversy remains among the authorities in
charge of the operation as to whether across-the-board changes should
be made.</P>
      <P>Replacing station names such as the Technology Building with the
pinyin version -- Kejidalou -- for example, will make little sense to
the foreign visitors for whom the translations are being provided.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Civil Affairs will study these special cases,
including the station serving the City Government, and are expected
to allow some exceptions to be made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW AIT TAIPEI DIRECTOR EXPECTED TO ASSUME POST WITHIN DAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  26  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Raymond F. Burghardt, the newly
appointed director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT), said on Friday that US policy toward Taiwan remains
unchanged despite a minor personnel change.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference held exclusively for the Taiwan
media, Burghardt, who is expected to assume his Taipei post at the
end of August, said Taiwan has seen dramatic changes over the past
two decades and has maintained close and cordial relations with the
United States. "My job in Taipei is to further strengthen those
relations," he said.</P>
      <P>Burghardt stressed that US policy toward Taiwan, which is
regulated by the Taiwan Relations Act, and the cross-Taiwan Strait
relations that were stipulated in the three communiques signed
between Washington and Beijing, remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who was scheduled to leave for his new post on Friday
and formally assume the directorship of the AIT Taipei office on
Tuesday, is the eighth local AIT chief since the institute was
established in 1980.</P>
      <P>He succeeds Darryl Johnson, who returned to the United States in
July after his three-year tenure expired.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Burghardt said he feels honored to be
appointed to the post at such a "good and exciting moment." He said
he has met with relevant officials in the Clinton Administration over
the last week to gain a deeper understanding of US interests in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that although he has not visited Taiwan since he left the
island in 1977 after studying Mandarin Chinese for one year, he has
constantly kept abreast of Taiwan affairs, and knows clearly that
Taiwan has experienced dramatic changes over the last 20 years, with
political democratization and a rapidly expanding free market-based
economy.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, the US consul general in Shanghai before being
appointed the AIT Taipei director, is also an old acquaintance of
Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan, with whom
he used to meet at least once a month.</P>
      <P>He was appointed the American consul general in Shanghai in 1997,
which gave him the status of minister-counselor in the United States
Foreign Service. He had previously served as Deputy Chief of Mission
at the US embassy in Manila from 1993 to 1996, and in Seoul from 1990
to 1993.</P>
      <P>Burghardt's previous positions also included a stint with the
National Security Council Staff as a special assistant to former
President Ronald Reagan, and as senior director of Latin American
affairs. His earlier Latin American experience included service at
the US embassies in Honduras and Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Burghardt was a political counselor in Beijing from 1987 to 1989.
He has also worked as a political officer in Hong Kong and Saigon,
and as deputy director of the State Department's Office of Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia Affairs.</P>
      <P>He was born in New York City in 1945 and grew up in the New York
metropolitan area. He received a B.A. from Columbia College in 1967
and did graduate work at Columbia University's School of
International and Public Affairs. He served as a Peace Corps
volunteer in Colombia and elsewhere in South America before joining
the foreign service in 1969.</P>
      <P>Burghardt is married to the former Susan Day. They have two
daughters. He speaks Mandarin, which he studied in Taichung, as well
as Spanish, Vietnamese and French.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines has declared that the
aviation accord between Taipei and Manila launched in 1996 has not
been suspended, an official of Taiwan's Minister of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Answering a reporter's question Liu Yi-ming, deputy director of
MOFA's East Asian and Pacific affairs department, said at a routine
press conference that negotiations over the aviation right dispute
between Taiwan and the Philippines will continue even if the two
sides fail to reach consensus before Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>Manila in early August threatened to scrap the air accord and
stop allowing Taiwan carriers to ply Philippine routes from Sept. 30
if no new agreement was negotiated by then. It claimed that China
Airlines and EVA Airways had violated the Taipei-Manila pact by
carrying more passengers than allowed under the terms of the
agreement.</P>
      <P>A Philippine mission led by Foreign Assistant Secretary Franklin
Ebdalin held talks with Taiwan officials on Aug. 14 in Taipei, in an
attempt to smooth Taipei's ruffled feathers and its subsequent threat
of economic sanctions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities were enraged by Manila's move, protesting that
Manila violated international precedents that require a minimum of 12
months notice to terminate aviation pacts.</P>
      <P>Liu said the two sides completed minutes of the meeting, with the
Philippine side reiterating its respect for the existing
Taipei-Manila bilateral aviation accord, and affirming that the
agreement has not been revoked and is still valid.</P>
      <P>In a further gesture of goodwill, the Philippine side also noted
that Sept. 30 is not a deadline for the aviation negotiations between
the two countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By K.C. Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the recent tension between Taiwan
and mainland China, US Congressman Vito Fossella (R-NY) has issued a
statement calling for support for Taiwan from the administration of
US President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>Fossella also condemned Beijing for rejecting an application
by Pope John Paul II to visit Hong Kong last month, stressing that
the United States should further help Taiwan maintain its democracy
and prosperity at a time when Beijing is still seeking to deprive its
people of basic religious freedom.</P>
      <P>Clinton's spelling out of his "three noes" policy toward Taiwan
last year during a visit to Shanghai has misled the Beijing
leadership into believing that the United States will agree to its
attempt to control Taiwan, Fossella pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although Washington's "one China" policy acknowledges that there
is only one China, which includes Taiwan, that does not represent
formal recognition that Taiwan is part of communist China, he
explained.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it was the sending of unclear messages to
invaders which caused the First and Second World Wars and the Korean
War, Fossella asserted that history should tell America that
firmly supporting Taiwan will help prevent greater conflict in the
Taiwan Strait in the future.</P>
      <P>Fossella issued the statement after receiving information from
ethnic Chinese US citizens relating to Beijing's repression of
religious freedom in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING, WASHINGTON MAY INK ACCORD IN OCT. ON WTO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China and the United States may
ink an accord in October on Beijing's bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), Administrative Vice Minister of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) Lin Yi-fu said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks were referring to concerns over whether US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
will meet at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum leaders' summit to talk about Beijing's entry into the world
trade regulatory body. The APEC forum will be held in Auckland, New
Zealand, in mid September.</P>
      <P>The MOEA official was responding to reporters' questions as he
attended a seminar on the development of malls and the retailing
industry in 1999.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's WTO entry bid is tangled up with that of mainland
China, whether Beijing is ready to resume talks with Washington, or
even sign an agreement on its entry into the WTO, is being closely
scrutinized by outsiders.</P>
      <P>Although there has been no official information suggesting that
Washington and Beijing will discuss mainland China's WTO bid during
the APEC forum gathering, Lin said Clinton and Jiang are widely
expected to use the opportunity to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>If events proceed smoothly, Beijing and Washington are likely to
ink a WTO accord in October, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>However, there are still more than 20 WTO member countries to
date which have yet to reach bilateral agreements with Beijing on
terms for entry, so that even if Beijing manages to clinch a deal
with Washington over its membership, time is running short for the
mainland to gain entry by the end of 1999, Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is deemed a tall order for Beijing and Washington to complete
bilateral talks on market opening and tariff concessions in just a
few months. However, if Beijing fails to win accession this year, it
will have to wait for many more years to make a successful bid, as
the price of entry is increasing all the time.</P>

      <P>Nearly 24 percent of Taiwan's manufacturers
took an optimistic view of the island's economic recovery, while 17
percent had the opposite opinion and 59 percent saw no change,
according to the results of a July poll released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The result of the survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Council

      <P>July manufacturing sales declined 3.7 percent compared to June, a
3.1 percent decrease from the same period of 1998, while new orders

    <TEXT>
      <P>An economic report judging Taiwan's
business condition released on Friday by the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) shows that while the
economy is currently making an upturn, it remains unstable.</P>
      <P>The business outlook report for July shows that the index of
leading indicators, which gauges economic prospects for the next
three to six months, climbed 0.1 percent from last month to 102.5
points, marking a new high since May 1998 and also posting a
consecutive five-month increase, while the index of coincident
indicators, which reflects present economic activity, declined 1.3
percent from June to 102.5 points.</P>
      <P>The CEPD pointed out that while the indexes of the two indicators
reflect inconsistencies, the business condition monitoring indicator
for July flashed a green light representing steady growth, and the
percentage of firms which anticipate bright prospects for the next
three months rose to 24.</P>
      <P>Taken overall, these factors signify that Taiwan's economy is
well on the way to recovery, but is not yet steady enough.</P>

percent compared with the 4.7 percent in 1998.</P>

to be eyeing former political rival and the current Senior Adviser to
President Lee, Wu Poh-hsiung as his running mate in the 2000

      <P>Wu denied on Friday that Soong had ever contacted him but stopped
short of shutting the door completely on a possible pairing with

Stalling over questions whether he would choose Wu, Soong simply

      <P>The protest was lodged by the Chinese embassy in Canberra, an

      <P>A spokesman for the Chinese embassy said Wei was imprisoned in
China on charges of subversion and that he has been
participating in anti-China movements and activities since he
was allowed to go abroad in late 1997. His activities have caused a
great damage to the interests of Chinese people in the mainland, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the Chinese government was strongly
dissatisfied with Downer's meeting with Wei because Beijing has made
efforts to improve its human rights records while achieving great
success in the political, economic and cultural fields.</P>
      <P>But political experts here said the spokesman was distorting the
truth. Chinese authorities are alleged to have returned to their

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 2ND-LARGEST SOURCE OF TOURIST ARRIVALS FOR HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Belle Chou and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 900,000 foreign tourists
visited Hong Kong in July 1999, with 19 percent of them coming from
Taiwan, the second-highest level among all foreign arrivals, tallies
released on Friday by the Hong Kong Tourist Association showed.</P>
      <P>A total of 913,734 foreign tourists traveled to the former
British colony last month, bringing to 5.95 million the aggregate
number of the total foreign arrivals for the period from January to
July, up 11.1 percent from the same period of 1998, according to the
same statistics.</P>
      <P>Tourists from mainland China were Hong Kong's largest source of
foreign arrivals during the first seven months of this year,
accounting for 30 percent of the total, while Japanese travelers
ranked third by making up 9 percent, the tallies found.</P>
      <P>In July alone, the number of mainland Chinese tourists visiting
Hong Kong posted a 10.9 percent increase on a year-to-year basis,
while the number of travelers from Japan fell by 10 percent, the
association said.</P>
      <P>It attributed the rise in mainland Chinese visitors to the
success of large-scale promotional activities held across the
mainland before the summer, and pointed out that higher airfares on
the Japan-Hong Kong route and lingering economic uncertainties in
Japan were the major factors behind the drop of tourist arrivals from
that country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew predicted on Saturday
that Taiwan's economic growth this year will be 5.7 percent, topping
the four Asian dragons -- Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Siew made the optimistic remark on the island's economic
prospects during an address at the opening in Taipei of the 15th
Kuomintang National Congress.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the theme of "entering the new era in stability,
justice, prosperity and creativity," Siew said that continued
economic growth is the key to whether the nation can continue to
develop.</P>
      <P>He said that over the past year, the world economy has remained
sluggish in the wake of the regional financial storm which started in
mid-1997, but noted that Taiwan has managed to maintain a growth rate
of 4.7 percent, representing moderate growth when compared to the
stagnant or even negative growth suffered by many other nations.</P>
      <P>He said that since the beginning of the year, the development of
the world economy gives cause for cautious optimism, and Taiwan's
domestic consumption and investment have continued, leading him to his
5.7 percent growth prediction for the country.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the people of
Taiwan do not want to live to be 100 years old, according to the
results of a recent survey released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Some 34.2 percent of the people surveyed said they worry most
about becoming ill or disabled in their old age, ahead of 28 percent
who said they are not particularly worried, while around 40 percent
expressed a lack of confidence with Taiwan's medical care.</P>
      <P>At the same time, nearly 30 percent of the respondents said they
feel anxious and uncertain about becoming old, while 53.6 percent of
those polled aged below 65 think they will have a comfortable life in
old age. Meanwhile, 74.2 percent of the respondents currently aged
over 65 said they feel happy in their day-to-day lives.</P>
      <P>Most of those surveyed said they expect to continue living with
their spouses or on their own when they are old, while quite a few of
them (more men than women), also expressed willingness to live with
their children in their dotage, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Although 30 percent of the respondents said they had never given
much thought about how long will they live, most said they hope to be
able to live to at least 70 years, according to the survey. More than
62 percent cited health as the most significant issue in old age,
while a stable income and a positive attitude toward life were also
cited as important factors in a happy retirement.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the biggest potential threat to their lives
in old age, Taiwan's relations with mainland China, environmental
pollution, social violence and public security were cited as the four
leading grave concerns.</P>
      <P>More than half of the respondents said they believe that taking
exercise, eating healthily and maintaining an upbeat mood are
essential to good health, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The islandwide public opinion poll conducted by a local monthly

    <HEADLINE>EFFECT OF HIGHER CRUDE PRICES ON DOMESTIC PRICES YET TO EMERGE: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The effect of a hike in the price of crude
oil on domestic prices will gradually emerge over time, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said that since the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) reached agreement to cut production,
global petroleum prices have begun to surge, citing as an example the
fact that Western Texas crude oil sold for US$11.29 per barrel in
December, but was selling recently for more than US$20 per barrel.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that although the effect on the domestic
economy of fluctuations in crude prices has been less than during
past energy crises, as the production value of Taiwan's petroleum and
chemical industry accounts for one-third of gross domestic product,
the full effect will gradually emerge.</P>
      <P>However, they pointed out that fortunately, due to a 6.43-percent
drop in labor costs in the manufacturing industry in the first five
months of the year, coupled with a labor productivity increase of
8.34 percent, it is estimated that domestic prices, although facing
upward pressure, will still be able to maintain stable levels.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the rebound in world crude prices will
help stabilize the economies of newly developed countries, and will
help prevent the world from plunging into another economic recession.</P>
      <P>They said that a crude price increase will help the refinery and
petroleum and chemical industries, as well as ease the pressure of
economic recession.</P>
      <P>But the MOEA experts also warned that if the price hike is too
big, it will have a detrimental effect on the international balance
of payments, economic development, and domestic prices of such
nations as Japan and Taiwan, which rely heavily on crude imports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-three percent of local women
responding to a recent public opinion poll said they are worrying
about military confrontation across the Taiwan Strait over the
"special state-to-state relationship" controversy.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted by the Awakening Foundation
from Aug. 12-14, with 1,053 valid replies collected.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 74 percent of those interviewed said
they knew President Lee Teng-hui's declaration of cross-strait ties
as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>A further analysis found that the number of male respondents who
have heard of the "special state-to-state" theory exceeded the
number of their female counterparts by 7 percent.</P>
      <P>Career women also far outnumbered homemakers in terms of their
knowledge of the "special state-to-state" theory, 81 percent to 64
percent.</P>
      <P>Asked whether they worry about an eruption of military conflict
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait due to President Lee's
"special state-to-state" definition, 60 percent of female respondents
and 70 percent of male respondents said they don't worry about that.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 33 percent of women interviewed said they worry
about the possibility of a cross-strait war sparked the "special
state-to-state" fracas, while only 22 percent of male respondents
said they have such a worry.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that 35 percent of those who have
relatives serving in the military are worrying about their
relatives' safety amid the current cross-strait fracas over the
"special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, women who said they worry about
their relatives' safety outnumbered male respondents by 13 percent.
Moreover, as high as 53 percent of homemakers interviewed said they
worry about their relatives' safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 53 percent of all respondents said they will
encourage their families or relatives to join the military to
defend their homeland if a cross-strait war erupts, while 30 percent
said they have never thought about such an issue.</P>
      <P>On this issue, male respondents are more willing than their
female counterparts to encourage their relatives to serve in the
military to help defend Taiwan. Career women also outnumbered
homemakers in this regard.</P>
      <P>Asked how to resolve the cross-strait dispute over the "special
state-to-state" theory, the majority of respondents, regardless of
their gender, support for peaceful resolution through consultations
and exchanges. Only 2.4 percent opt for the use of force to settle
the fracas.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Awakening Foundation Chairman Wang
Ju-hsuan said women are more peace-loving, more disgusted with war
and more treasure lives than their male counterparts.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chao-lin, an Academia Sinica researcher, said 99 percent of
wars in human history were determined by men and that women's views
on military confrontation have seldom received serious attention.
"I think policymakers should be due attention to women's opinions in

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China
Air Force on Saturday opened its Pingtung air base in southern
Taiwan for public visit.</P>
      <P>A number of warplanes, including E2T airborne early warning
planes, C-130 transports, S2T anti-submarine planes, AT-3 trainers
and F-5E fighter jets, were parked on the apron for public view.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung air base also invited the noted Shen Lung (Miracle
Dragon) squadron to perform free-style parachuting and other
sensational airborne acrobatic feats, winning critical acclaim from
audience.</P>
      <P>More than 10,000 residents in the southern Taiwan county visited
the air base.</P>
      <P>The event was part of the air force's celebrations of the 62nd
anniversary of the "Aug. 14" victory, which refers to the defeat of
Japanese attack on the ROC's air base in Chienchiao in southeastern
China during World War II. The public display of warplanes was
originally scheduled to take place in July, but was postponed to
Saturday because of poor weather conditions in the Pingtung area over

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
delivered a report on the achievements of his administration at the
ruling Kuomintang party's second meeting of the 15th National
Congress (NC) Saturday in his capacity as a party member.</P>
      <P>In the report titled "Approaching a New Century with Stability,
Justice, Prosperity and Innovation," Siew pledged that his cabinet
will continue its devotion to modernizing the country.</P>
      <P>Siew reported that over the past two years his team has completed
such varied missions as the downsizing of the Taiwan Provincial
Government in order to pursue efficiency, overcoming the tough
economic challenges that followed the Asian economic meltdown and
carrying out social reconstruction and educational reforms to upgrade
the people's quality of living.</P>
      <P>Siew added his executive departments have aggressively pursued
maintaining the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait region, as
well as promoting pragmatic diplomatic relationships between Taiwan
and foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Siew then revealed the four goals of his future administration:
bringing more justice and stability to society, pursuing a more
mature economy while maintaining the current prosperity, putting into
practice a creative and multifarious cultural educational system and
enhancing national security.</P>
      <P>Siew assumed his current post in September 1997, vowing to
strengthen national defense while seeking "peaceful and dignified"
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In his Saturday report, the premier stressed that his mainland
policy of seeking constructive dialogue and exchanges between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will not change.</P>
      <P>In addition, Siew praised President Lee Teng-hui's description of
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" in a
German radio interview on July 9 as a significant move that clearly
defines the sovereign status of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the statement has caused an irrational response from
Beijing, it has won the overwhelming support of the Taiwan people,
Siew said in reiterating the government will continue to try and gain
support from the international community for a redefinition of the
Taiwan-Beijing relationship.</P>
      <P>The NC meeting will last two days with the participants on Sunday
giving their final stamp of approval to the 2000 presidential ticket
of Vice President Lien Chan and Siew.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON `COMMITTED' TO TAIWAN'S DEFENSE: WEINBERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug.  27  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One thing should be made eminently
clear to mainland China: "The United States is absolutely committed
to the defense of Taiwan and will not permit it to be overrun,"
stressed a former US defense secretary.</P>
      <P>In the September issue of Forbes magazine, Casper Weinberger said
the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) strongly implies this, but passage of
the proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement Act would send the message
unmistakably.</P>
      <P>Weinberger said that because the Clinton administration has
wavered too often regarding Taiwan, "there is now a genuine fear that
China might believe it could, with impunity, attack Taiwan, while we
sit by helplessly, seeking a UN vote of disapproval, but doing little
else."</P>
      <P>Were this to happen, the former US defense chief warned, "it
would be the crowning error of all this administration's foreign
policy mistakes, and a legacy of catastrophic proportions for Mr.
(Bill) Clinton."</P>
      <P>Weinberger noted that after Britain and France sold out
Czechoslovakia to secure the infamous Munich Pact with Hitler and
Mussolini in 1938, some Czech leaders were incautious enough to
protest their loss of freedom and the dismemberment of their country.
In reporting those objections to Neville Chamberlain, British foreign
office officials referred to the protesters as "these blasted
Czechs."</P>
      <P>He was reminded of that when Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright all but ground her teeth in public annoyance at Taiwan
President Lee Teng-hui and sent envoys to Taipei to remind him of the
error of his ways, said Weinberger.</P>
      <P>Lee's offense? Weinberger pointed out that he had restated an
obvious truth -- that Taiwan's relationship with the mainland is one
of "state to state." Lee's very able negotiator in the cross-strait
talks with Beijing, Koo Chen-fu, said exactly the same thing. Koo
reiterated that while both sides seek reunification, Taiwan will only
consider it after the mainland moves toward democracy, freedom and
rights for the individual.</P>
      <P>Weinberger added that the US response has been to blame Taiwan --
as Czechoslovakia was blamed in 1938 -- and demand Lee retract his
statements. "Our position seems designed to continue the appeasement
of China that President Clinton began on his ill-fated trip there in
1998 ... and we are encouraging the PRC in an extremely dangerous
way."</P>
      <P>He continued that Taiwan has been making increasingly urgent
requests for defensive arms, particularly an early warning radar
system, but the Clinton administration has consistently answered the
requests with excuses and delays. Against this backdrop, Senators
Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) have introduced The
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which would lift restrictions on the
sales of defensive arms to Taiwan and authorize sales of key weapons
systems, including theater missile defenses.</P>
      <P>The former defense secretary said the TRA, enacted after
President Jimmy Carter abandoned Taiwan, was carefully crafted to
leave the US room to be able to come to Taiwan's aid. Unfortunately,
many people mistakenly believe the Aug. 17, 1982 Communique with
Beijing overrides and reverses the major provisions of the TRA
because the Communique states that the US eventually will end arms
sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Weinberger said he is convinced that the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act would clear up any misconceptions. Hearings on the
bill have amply shown the need for such legislation. There has been
surprising support for the principles of the bill from the Democratic
side, but in view of the lack of time before Congress adjourns for
the holidays, it is doubtful the measure can be enacted this year, he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CRASH HELMETS HELP CUT TRAFFIC ACCIDENT DEATH TOLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The death toll of motorcycle-related
traffic accidents has declined significantly since the law requiring
all motorcyclists to wear crash helmets took effect on June 1, 1997,
the ROC External Injury Prevention Association said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-ta, president of the association, said accident-caused
injury was No. 3 cause of deaths in Taiwan between 1991 and 1997. "It
declined to the No. 4 place for the first time in 1998 thanks to the
legislation of the crash helmets law," he reported.</P>
      <P>Noting that the implementation of the law has helped cut the
accident-related death toll by more than 2,000 over the past three
years, Chiu said the crash helmet law has set the most stunning
achievement in the domestic public health history.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Chiu said the death toll of
motorcycle-related accidents exceeded 7,000 persons annually between
1988 and 1997.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiu said, the death toll dropped to slightly more
than 58,000 in 1998, realizing the goal of the safety helmets
legislation which is aimed at cutting the motorcycle-related death
toll by at least 1,000 a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiu said, the ratio of head injuries caused by
motorcycle-related accidents has also decreased by 33 percent during
the same period. Moreover, the head injuries-related surgeries
involving motorcyclists have fallen 42 percent.</P>
      <P>In all, Chiu said the implementation of the compulsory wearing
of crash helmets has helped the Central Health Insurance Bureau save
about NT$100 million (US$3.13 million) in medical bills per month.</P>
      <P>Pai Lu, an associate professor with National Defense Medical
College, said the accident-related mortality rate has been very high
and that traffic accident has topped all other accidents in terms of
death toll.</P>
      <P>Official tallies show that the annual traffic accident mortality
rate reached 40 persons per 100,000 between 1994 and 1997.</P>
      <P>Pai said even though accidents fell to the No. 4 cause of
deaths in Taiwan last year, the number of people killed in accidents
still reached 10,973, or one death per 48 minutes.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on
Saturday convened the second plenary session of its 15th National
Congress, to formally approve Lien Chan and Vincent Siew as the
party's ticket for the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien and Siew are, respectively, the country's incumbent vice
president and premier.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui called on party members to spare no
effort in helping the Lien-Siew ticket win an overwhelming victory in
the election slated for March of next year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Lee described the upcoming
national election for the ROC's 10th head of state as the most
important vote concerning the country's future development. He said
victory should be listed as the KMT's most important political
mission, noting that winning the campaign will further intensify the
KMT's power base.</P>
      <P>Lee stated his conviction that the Lien-Siew team is the party's
optimum ticket for the 2000 presidential election, adding that they
are also the candidates most favored by the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee, who serves concurrently as ROC president, arrived at the
venue at 8:30 a.m., and received a warm welcome from dozens of young
people serving in the party's youth affairs division.</P>
      <P>Presenting a traditional heavy lamp representing good luck to the
audience, Lee encouraged more young people to enter the KMT, saying
the party is the vehicle that will allow them to fulfill their
creative dreams.</P>
      <P>During his address, Chairman Lee endorsed the KMT's pragmatic and
aggressive policies as well as its efforts for a unified
organization. Lee cited party unity as the reason why the KMT was
successful in elections held last year.</P>
      <P>The election victories proved the KMT is supported by most people
in Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the KMT has successfully helped the
country promote political democracy and stabilize the economy, expand
the ROC's role in the international community and enhance national
security.</P>
      <P>In dealing with mainland China, Lee said, the party has also
gradually opened a new era of exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in a pragmatic manner. He added that in the future the
party will promote goodwill and equal status during cross-strait
dialogues in the hope of narrowing differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>As the party that built the Republic of China in 1911, Lee
said, the KMT is responsible for the country's existence and
prosperity. The KMT is obliged to give the people of Taiwan a more
just and democratic society, Lee concluded.</P>
      <P>Participants in the two-day National Congress will review key
political administration measures and crucial inter-party affairs.
They will then confirm or deny membership into the Central Advisory
Council on the nominees whom were selected by Lee before approving of
the Lien-Siew presidential ticket on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The first plenary session of the 15th KMT National Congress was
convened in August, 1997. At that time, Lee was re-elected chairman
of the party with 93 percent of the vote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CONGRESS APPROVES LIEN-SIEW TICKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   29   (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second plenary session of
the Kuomintang's 15th National Congress formally nominated Vice
President Lien Chan as the party's candidate for president and
Premier Vincent Siew as its candidate for vice president in the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>As the highlight of the two-day congress, party delegates, of
whom 96.3 percent supported Lien's candidacy in a party primary
earlier this month, approved Lien and his choice for his running
mate, Siew.</P>
      <P>When former Vice President Lee Yuan-zu, who presided over the
congress Sunday morning, announced the approval of a Lien-Siew
ticket, there was vociferous applause at the conference site. All
party delegates, led by an emcee, chanted "Lien Chan, elected" and
brandished flags with Lien's name.</P>
      <P>At the same time, images of Lien and Siew appeared on a big
screen at the conference site, accompanying by sayings supporting
their candidacies.</P>
      <P>Then the attendants sang the campaign song of President Lee
Teng-hui and Lien Chan, who ran for office four years ago.</P>
      <P>President Lee, who is also the party's chairman, presented to the
two nominees ribbons with their names and handed over a flag to them
as a token of the party's mandate.</P>
      <P>Saying the nomination represented the party's firm intention to
win next year's presidential race and to solemnly meet the anxious
expectations of the Taiwan people, Lee touted the pair's achievements
and urged all party members to rally behind the candidacy of Lien and
Siew.</P>
      <P>"Now that the nomination has been made," the chairman said, "it
is time for the whole party to campaign for the party's candidates."</P>
      <P>He urged party members to overlook no constituencies in their
efforts to solicit votes for Lien and Siew, and to get across the
message to all the people that support for the KMT candidates ensures
the Republic of China's survival and protects their own security and
livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Lien gave a 20-minute nomination acceptance speech, in which he
thanked the delegates for their support and vowed to devote all his
energies to fulfilling the party's mandate by winning the election.</P>
      <P>Promising that the KMT will form a governing team with
reform-minded people and an administration that fully satisfies the
peoples' desires, Lien outlined four campaign principles: concern for
Taiwan's well-being above all else; safety first; respect for public
opinion; and the predominance of justice.</P>
      <P>Pledging to do whatever is needed to win the election, Lien said
he would fight to win not only votes in the 2000 election but also
the people's respect for the KMT.</P>
      <P>The nomination ended with a climax when Lien, Siew and their
supporters within the party sang in chorus "You are my brothers" to
signify the party's unity.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the congress passed a three-point guideline
that stressed the concept of "New Taiwan People" coined by KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui last year to unite the people on the island;
supported the party's candidates for president and vice president;
and beefed up efforts to recruit younger party members and female
members to inject new blood into the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE BODY URGES US TO GIVE AMNESTY TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  28  (CNA)
(By David Wang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US national Chinese mutual aid
organization on Friday urged private groups to ask Congress to pass
an act granting amnesty to more than 5 million illegal immigrants in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma Wen-wu, chairman of the organization, said here in a press
conference that his organization has mailed copies of a report on the
amnesty of illegal immigrants to 100 senators and 455
representatives, urging them pass the amnesty act to improve illegal
immigrants' quality of living, their physical and mental health, and
work and educational opportunities for their children.</P>
      <P>Ma indicated that most of the illegal immigrants work in the
United States and some of them pay taxes. The amnesty could result in
increased tax revenues for the US government and a decrease in the
exploitation by underground factories of illegal immigrants, he said,
adding that the amnesty is in line with the United States' principles
of democracy and the promotion of human rights.</P>
      <P>The Chinese mutual aid organization will present petitions to the
governors of all 50 US states and will seek the signatures of leaders
of various countries in support of the act.</P>
      <P>Precedents in US history regarding the granting of amnesty to
illegal immigrants are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- 4 million illegal immigrants were granted permanent residency
rights in January 1981;</P>
      <P>-- Some 40,000 illegal agricultural workers were granted legal
immigrant status in 1986;</P>
      <P>-- The so-called "June 4 green card" enabled many students from
mainland China to permanently stay in the United States in the early
1990s; and</P>
      <P>-- President Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty act benefiting some
4,000 Catholics during his tenure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIFFICULT TO DRAW SUPPORT FOR LIEN-SIEW TICKET: KMT LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators from the ruling
Kuomintang said on Sunday that it will be tough to draw support from
grassroots voters for the just-approved Lien Chan-Vincent Siew ticket
in next March's presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT approved the nomination on the second day of a two-day
party congress despite strong opposition from party members.</P>
      <P>Legislators Chu Fong-chi (Taoyuan), Wang Tien-ging (Kaohsiung),
Yang Chung-ying (Taichung) and Ho Chi-hui (Miaoli) said outside the
conference room that it would be very hard to drum up support for the
two candidates, since natural disasters and man-made mistakes
happened during Siew's tenure have made a greater impression on
people than his political achievement.</P>
      <P>They urged the party's core members to take substantial measures
to fight against money politics to win back the people's hearts.</P>
      <P>In response to some KMT legislators' opposition, the KMT's
legislative caucus said everybody should support the party's
nominated candidates, even though they may not share common ground
with the candidates and even though they may have endorsed different
candidates in the past.</P>
      <P>Siew should not be held solely responsible for the problems during
his tenure, said KMT legislative caucus Whip Tseng Yung-chuan, adding
that in light of Siew's complete political career and his integrity,
it is expected that Lien and Siew will gradually win back the
people's support.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Senior Adviser to the President Wu Po-hsiung, who
aggressively sought to be Lien's running mate, said as he took part
in a Buddhist gathering in Taoyuan that he would let his supporters
decide how to make the next move.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions, Wu said he had engaged in talks
with former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong two months ago,
but said he would make a decision on his next move only after
thoroughly evaluating his supporters' views.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is running for president as an independent and who has
led in most public opinion polls, arrived at the Buddhist gathering
later and stressed that he would combine power from supra-party
talents to strive for victory.</P>
      <P>Soong went on to say that about two years ago he discovered that
there was serious discrepancy between the views of grassroots people
and the party's high-ranking officials, adding that the situation has
not improved at all since then.</P>
      <P>He also said there is no split within the KMT; otherwise Vice
President Lien Chan would not have received an overwhelming 96
percent support rating in the party's primary, held earlier this
month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE MAINLAND SPOUSES TO BE ALLOWED TO SETTLE IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) announced on Monday that the annual quota for local people's
mainland Chinese spouses to settle in Taiwan will be raised to 3,600
starting this year.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng made the announcement after a
meeting of all MAC commissioners.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the meeting focused discussion on the annual quota for
mainland spouses to settle in Taiwan and all other related
regulations.</P>
      <P>Based on humanitarian considerations, Sheu said, all MAC
commissioners unanimously agreed to largely increase the number of
mainland spouses to be allowed to settle in Taiwan to 3,600 people
from the current 1,800.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the new quota will take effect after the Legislative
Yuan approves the proposal at its new session scheduled to open next
month.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, mainland people who have married
Republic of China nationals for two full years and have children can
apply to settle in Taiwan. Nevertheless, the ROC government has
imposed an annual quota on such applicants.</P>
      <P>Although the government has many times raised the annual quota,
it still fails to meet the rapidly rising demand. The quota was last
adjusted to 1,800 in 1997.</P>
      <P>Sheu said the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, has also decided to ease restrictions on mainland Chinese
spouses' rights to work and national health insurance coverage after
they are allowed to settle here. "Once mainland spouses obtain legal
residence here, our government will give them good care based on
humanitarianism," he noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has continued to reduce the number
of aged fishing boats in operation in an effort to increase the cost
efficiency of its fishing industry, as well as to prevent ocean
fishing fleet from further expanding, the Council of Agriculture
(COA) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government allocated a total of US$90
million between 1991 and 1995 to buy some 2,300 aged fishing boats
totaling 140,000 deadweight tons, according to Hsieh Dah-wen, deputy
director of COA's Fisheries Department.</P>
      <P>Of the boats, 136 were ocean-going tuna fishing boats, which
together represent about 16 percent of Taiwan's entire ocean-going
tuna fishing boat tonnage, said Hsieh.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan's efforts to reduce the number of aged
fishing boats in operation will be counted as a measure to cut back
the size of the island's fishing fleet, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in response to a recent proposal,
submitted by Japan, asking all fishing parties around the world to
cut their fishing fleets by 20 percent in an effort to protect
dwindling stocks of fish.</P>
      <P>Through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the
Japanese government said it will take the initiative in reducing the
number of Japan's fishing boats by 20 percent and hopes that other
APEC fishing nations around the world will follow suit.</P>
      <P>According to a recent survey conducted by the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization, 60 percent to 70 percent of fish
resources around the globe have been explored, with some fish species
facing the threat of extinction because of over-fishing.</P>
      <P>The Japanese proposal, however, met with opposition from major
fishing nations, including New Zealand, Canada and South Korea,
according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Although the Japanese proposal was temporarily set back, Hsieh
said, the UN effort to stop the global depletion of fish stocks is
expected to continue.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that Taiwan's efforts to reduce the number of aged
fishing boats will be counted by APEC member countries as an attempt
to reduce the size of its fishing fleet, Hsieh reiterated.</P>

      <P>The recent detention of one Australian

resettlement project in Qinghai has cast a harsh light yet again on
mainland Chinese treatment of Tibetans, an Australian newspaper said
editorially Monday.</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "China's Tibet," The Sydney Morning Herald
said the incident "has raised questions over China's claim to World

      <P>The Qinghai resettlement program will put further pressure on the
local population, including ethnic Tibetans, the editorial noted.</P>
      <P>Both Australian and American researchers on the World Bank

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are currently about 600,000 stray
dogs in Taiwan, far less than the 1.3-1.4 million posted four years
ago, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 2 million dogs are house kept as pets,
compared with the 300,000 to 400,000 reported in 1995, officials from
COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
(APHIQ) said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the latest survey conducted by Prof. Fei Chang-yung from
National Taiwan University's Veterinary Medicine Department under a
COA contract, APHIQ officials said the number of stray dogs has
declined by about 50 percent in Taiwan while the number of house-kept
dogs increased by 50 percent over the past four years due to
strenuous government efforts.</P>
      <P>Beginning on Sept. 1, according to APHIQ officials, the entire
canine population in Taiwan will be implanted with IC chips for easy
identification.</P>
      <P>It is expected that by the end of October when the IC chip
implantation is completed, an even more precise count of the canine

    <HEADLINE>NO NEED TO AMEND CONSTITUTION IN LINE WITH 'STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Monday said
that the Republic of China does not need to amend the constitution in
line with President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of the "special
state-to-state relationship" between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a press conference held one day
after he and Premier Vincent Siew were confirmed by the KMT National
Congress as the party's ticket for 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that if he is elected, it would be natural for him
to continue to consult with President Lee, who serves concurrently as
the ruling party's chairman.</P>
      <P>Lien also defended his choice of Premier Siew as his running mate
in the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien lauded Siew as a rare example of someone having executive as
well as legislative experience. Lien said that Siew started his
career at the grassroots level and worked his way up to premier,
serving in various important political and economic posts along the
way.</P>
      <P>Lien said that he has worked with Siew, whom he called
"sincere and modest," for many years. When Lien concurrently served
as premier, he asked Siew to be responsible for implementing the
Asia-Pacific operations hub project, as well as an economic stimulus
plan -- projects Lien described as having proved their benefit to the
nation.</P>
      <P>Siew has also been in charge of cross-strait relations, Lien
added. He called the KMT's ticket very complimentary.</P>
      <P>Asked about the latest survey, which puts support for the
Lien-Siew ticket at 16 percent, Lien implored the media to give a
higher score to the government, saying that Taiwan's economic growth
was the second highest in Asia last year and that this year it is
expected to reach 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Lien also touched on cross-strait relations, saying that five
decades of rivalry between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is
enough.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait will
be more pragmatic and that they will work out their differences on
the principles of "peace, rationality and equality" in order to reach
a mutual benefit.</P>
      <P>Lien said Taiwan's transition from authoritarian to democratic
rule and from poverty to affluence could be a lesson for mainland
China.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that President Lee's "special state-to-state
relationship" redefinition of cross-strait ties sets the record
straight by pointing out that the Republic of China is an independent
sovereign state, and not a renegade province, as mainland China
claims it to be.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the ROC wants to deal with mainland China on
an equal basis and does not want the mainland to treat it as a
provincial government.</P>
      <P>Siew, speaking on the same occasion, was asked if he would
serve concurrently as premier if he were elected vice president.</P>
      <P>Siew said that he would observe the spirit of the constitution
and he personally would not agree to concurrently serve as premier
and vice president.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  29  (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials and academics from the
Republic of China on Taiwan, mainland China and the United States are
meeting in New York amid escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait
over the "special state-to-state relationship" controversy.</P>
      <P>The closed-door roundtable meeting, also known as "Track II"
Taipei-Washington-Beijing dialogue, is being sponsored by the
National Committee on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP). This is the
fifth time that the private US think tank has organized this kind of
three-way unofficial conference since mid-1997.</P>
      <P>Such roundtable discussions, mainly aimed at reviewing the
general situation and policy developments on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and seeking solution to cross-strait issues or disputes,
usually do not have a fixed agenda and the meeting results have
never been published.</P>
      <P>The current session will formally kick off on Monday and ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" declaration is
expected to be the main focus of discussion at the two-day
conference.</P>
      <P>Beijing has reacted furiously against President Lee's declaration
in an interview with a German radio station in July that
Taiwan-mainland China relations should be on a "special
state-to-state" basis. It may have been further angered by the ROC
ruling Kuomintang's adoption of the theory as one of its future
policy guidelines on Sunday.</P>
      <P>While mainland delegates managed to refrain from touching on the
issue during a Sunday dinner hosted by the NCAFP in honor of all
participants, observers said they believe mainland delegates will
certainly blasted President Lee for deliberately advocating the
"special state-to-state" theory to spoil cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The ROC delegation is composed of Tien Hung-mao, a senior
adviser to President Lee and director of the Institute
for National Policy Research, a Taipei-based private think tank;
professor Kao Ying-mao of US Brown University; Soochow
University professor Kuo Cheng-liang; National Chiao Tung University
professor Wei Yung; and Wu Hsin-hsing, deputy secretary-general of
the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Members of the mainland delegation include Xu Shihquan, director
of the Taiwan Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences; Guo Changlin, a mainland Foreign Ministry official who
will attend the meeting in his capacity as a research fellow with
the Beijing-based Contemporary International Relations Research
Center; and Su Ge, an assistant to the director of the Institute of
Diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The American delegates include Winston Lord, a former assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs; and noted
China hands Ralph Clough and Gerrit W. Gong.</P>
      <P>Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state, Kurt
Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, and all senior
executives of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy will
also attend the closed-door discussion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan delegate Kao Ying-mao said the main function of the
roundtable meeting is not necessarily to seek definite agreements or
conclusions. "The main purpose is to exchange ideas and opinions
so as to boost mutual understanding," he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said he believes that mainland China will intensify
diplomatic squeeze against Taiwan after the island's ruling party
adopted the "special state-to-state" theory as one of its major
policy guidelines at its just-concluded national congress.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Kao said he doesn't think that the United States
will easily make concessions to any mainland demand concerning the
Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Some sources said major topics to be discussed at the Aug. 30-31
roundtable will include whether mainland President Jiang Zemin will
push US President Bill Clinton to explicitly promise "no US
support" for the "special state-to-state" theory when they meet in
New Zealand in September; as well as the possibility of cross-strait
military confrontation; possible US reaction in the event of a
mainland attack on Taiwan; US arms sales to Taiwan; and the
feasibility of Taiwan's participation in the US-initiated theater
missile defense (TMD) system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential adviser Wu Poh-hsiung is
likely to be the running mate of independent presidential candidate
James Soong, according to a relative of Soong on Monday.</P>
      <P>Richard Wu, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers Association, whose relationship with Soong is uncle
and nephew, made the remarks to reporters after he attending a
seminar on laws protecting the investments of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Wu said Wu Poh-hsiung and Soong share many things, including
friends and supporters. Therefore, cooperation between the two can
not be ruled out, said Soong's relative.</P>
      <P>He cited Soong, the former Taiwan provincial governor, as saying
that public opinion will dictate Soong's direction and action; hence,
as long as it complies with the people's will, cooperation with Wu
Poh-hsiung is highly likely.</P>
      <P>However, since Soong is still weighing his options for a running
mate, his final decision will not be made until November, Wu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung, who has been trying to position himself for a
vice presidential nomination, was apparently disappointed when Vice
President Lien Chan decided, last week, to chose Premier Vincent Siew
as his KMT running mate in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Lien-Siew ticket approval at the second plenary
session of the ruling Kuomintang's 15th National Congress last
Saturday, whether Wu will be tapped as Soong's running mate has been
the focus of scrutiny by outsiders.</P>
      <P>Wu and Soong met by chance Monday morning at the Yi Ming Temple
(a temple in honor of people with a deep sense of justice) in Hsinchu
County.</P>
      <P>Soong and Wu said hello to each other, shook hands and then
parted. Nevertheless, supporters of both Wu and Soong at
the scene repeatedly called for a Soong-Wu ticket.</P>
      <P>Soong's working team said later that the meeting at the temple
was a sheer coincidence.</P>

      <P>Several Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators will visit the United States in mid-September to express
their support for the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA)
currently being screened by the US Congress, said a DPP legislator
Monday.</P>

13-15 to call on Democratic and Republic Party leaders in the US

      <P>Chai said the main purpose of the visit is to express the DPP's
concern over the TSEA. The TSEA stipulates that any final decision on
Taiwan's future must be approved by the people of Taiwan and that the
US government must help strengthen Taiwan's defensive ability.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-hsien said the group will also inform the US Congress
and the American news media that President Lee's redefinition of ties
across the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship"
has won the support from the majority of people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Because Beijing will probably threaten the island's security
during the 2000 presidential election, they will also urge the United

    <HEADLINE>CAA DISSATISFIED WITH CAL'S FLIGHT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
on Monday rejected a China Airlines (CAL) report on its recent flight
mishap and various flight safety improvement measures, saying the
report lacks substance.</P>
      <P>"CAL didn't show full sincerity and determination to learn a
lesson from the recent tragic incident," CAA Director-General Chang
Yo-heng said after reading the CAL report.</P>
      <P>Chang demanded CAL, Taiwan's flagship carrier, to present a more
detailed report on the possible drawbacks or negligence in its
internal control system and concrete steps for improving its safety
measures within 10 days.</P>
      <P>CAL's Flight CI-642, with 315 passengers and crew members on
board from Bangkok, crash-landed in Hong Kong on Aug. 22 in a driving
rain as Typhoon Sam was sweeping through the former British colony.
The McDonnell-Douglas 11, landing at an abnormal 15-degree tilt,
cracked a wing, which caused a fire, and flipped onto its back after
landing at Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport. Three passengers
already died from the incident and 206 others were injured.</P>
      <P>Responding to CAA's rejection of the carrier's flight safety
improvement plan, CAL President Liu Ke-ai said the airline will make
a further review and come up with a more comprehensive and concrete
package of measures to meet the CAA's requirement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu denied a Hong Kong press report that the Italian
pilot of the ill-fated CAL plane, Gerardo Lettich, had gone missing.</P>
      <P>"The report was incorrect," Liu said, adding that Lettich
returned to his home country after Hong Kong law enforcement
authorities completed questioning on him.</P>
      <P>Liu said Lettich returned to Italy on Aug. 26, while co-pilot
Liu Cheng-hsi came back to Taipei on Aug. 25.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to further improve flight
safety, Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Feng-cheng
will meet with senior executives of eight Taiwan-owned airline
companies to discuss effective measures on Tuesday afternoon to
prevent recurrence of flight mishaps.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to safeguard the rights and
interests of Taiwan businessmen who invest in mainland China and run
afoul of mainland laws, a local business association on Monday called
on Beijing to set up a special court with such cases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association
(TEEMA) Chairman Wu Si-chung made the call at a press conference to
propose the establishment of such a court and discuss regulations
governing the protection of Taiwan investment in mainland China in
light of the recent arrest of six Taiwan businessmen in the
southeastern mainland city of Donguan on allegations of smuggling and
exchange infractions.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hoped the trial of the businessmen will be undertaken
by judges who are familiar with Taiwan's customs in doing business
and with mainland regulations governing investment from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Sheng-hsiung, head of the mainland trade department under
TEEMA who visited Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) to personally put forward the proposal a few
days ago, said in the press conference that MOFTEC promised to
transfer the petition to the Supreme People's Court and the Taiwan
Affairs Office under the State Council to determine whether the
proposal is feasible and justified.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that MOFTEC is aware of the situation that many
mainland Chinese local governments have promised excessive
preferential measures in order to attract investment from Taiwan,
which often results in contravention's to central government
regulations.</P>
      <P>TEEMA's proposal is expected to narrow the discrepancies between
local and central government regulations and accordingly strengthen
the protection to Taiwan businessmen, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Chang Keng-ming, an ROC national who holds a Ph.D. from the
mainland's Politics and Law University, and works as an arbiter on
the Beijing arbitration committee, urged local businessmen investing
in the mainland to seek help from local arbitration committees
instead of settling arbitrarily with local government officials in
disputes.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that the mainland is to formally implement the
regulations governing the protection of investment and businessmen
from Taiwan in October, and that relevant mainland authorities will
promote a fair trade system, covering such areas as tax collection,
for Taiwan businessmen as part of Beijing's equal treatment policy.</P>
      <P>The policy will also allow Taiwan businessmen to report any local
administrative torts and will allow whistle-blowers to remain
confidential and free from retaliation, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are over 3,000 TEEMA member manufacturers with
investments in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT INCLUSION OF `STATE-TO-STATE' THEORY IN RESOLUTION SAID `NATURAL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su
Chi said on Monday that it is only "natural" for the ruling
Kuomintang to include the "special state-to-state relationship"
theory in the resolution passed by its National Congress.</P>
      <P>Su noted that since it was President Lee Teng-hui who redefined
cross-Taiwan Strait ties as "a special state-to-state relationship"
on July 9, and as Lee is also the KMT chairman, it is only natural
that the theory was included in the party's resolution.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Lee's statement only reflects existing
facts and is not a new policy but a political declaration in
anticipation of upcoming cross-strait political dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said that there is no need to amend the constitution in line
with the "special state-to-state" statement, and no question that the
theory violates the constitution.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in an address to legislators who expressed
concern as to whether the constitution will be amended in line with
the theory following the KMT's adoption of it as the basic tone of
its mainland policy.</P>
      <P>The second plenary session of the KMT's 15th National Congress on
Sunday endorsed "stability, justice, prosperity, and creativity" as
the basis of the party's efforts to enter the new millennium, with
"special state-to-state relationship" clearly defined as the basis
for cross-strait ties in anticipation of the new era of cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The party stressed that in line with the National Unification
Guidelines, and its established policy, it will continue to push for
"normal and long-term" relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait toward a unified China under democracy.</P>
      <P>The party also said that it wants to promote cross-strait
constructive dialogue under the principles of parity, as well as
cross-strait exchanges, so as to create an environment conducive to a
win-win situation for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN KMT, DPP POLICIES TOWARD BEIJING: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian said on Monday that he
sees no major differences between his party and the ruling
Kuomintang in policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of Japanese
academics and political commentators.</P>
      <P>Chen said President Lee Teng-hui's defining relations across
the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state relationship"
indicates that the KMT's basic stance on cross-strait ties is
similar to the DPP's.</P>
      <P>Beijing has reacted furiously against Lee's "special
state-to-state" declaration as it regards the declaration as a
move to promote Taiwan independence. However, Chen reminded Beijing
to take note of the word "special" in Lee's definition.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is still no mutually acceptable and
beneficial formula for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
normalize their relations, Chen said he hopes that both sides can
work out a solution through peaceful negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chen exchanged views with his Japanese guests on Asia-Pacific
security and Taiwan's next presidential election scheduled for March
2000.</P>
      <P>Concerning Taiwan's coming presidential election, Chen said he
believes that domestic affairs, not cross-strait ties, will be the
main focus of campaign debate among all presidential hopefuls.</P>
      <P>For his part, Takashi Hirabayashi, head of the Japanese
delegation, told Chen that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
once pushed Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to declare "three
noes" policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Obuchi declined Jiang's demand, indicating that Obuchi is
friendly toward Taiwan," Hirabayashi said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates Obuchi's support for Taiwan, adding
that a democratic, stable and prosperous Taiwan will contribute much
to security and stability in the Asia-Pacific area.</P>
      <P>MOreover, Chen further said he is convinced that close
cooperation among Taiwan, Japan and the United States will benefit
one another, adding that they share common interests and
responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Chen said as a candidate for next year's presidential election,
he is obligated to defend Taiwan's interest, safety and national
sovereignty. He also pledged that if he manages to win the
presidency, he will do his best to promote cultural, economic and
other exchanges with Japan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Middle-ranking officials from Beijing have
stopped visiting Taiwan ever since July 9, when Taipei claimed
statehood in dealing with mainland China, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairman Su Chi said on Monday.</P>
      <P>However, other exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait have not been affected, said Su in an exchange of views with a
group of legislators on ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although, he said he would rather not speculate on whether
Beijing's top negotiator with Taiwan -- Wang Daohan -- will visit
Taiwan this autumn as scheduled, he stressed that he is "not
pessimistic about it."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Beijing has not decided to close channels of
contact with Taiwan, and that the mainland authorities know "it is
better to have Wang come than not" and that "life must go on."</P>
      <P>Citing the current tensions prevailing between Taipei and
Beijing, he also rejected as "inappropriate" one legislator's
suggestion that the MAC should set up a branch office in Beijing,</P>
      <P>He defended the approach taken by the MAC and the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) after a Taiwan-registered freighter was
seized by mainland public security officials last month, saying the
case is under judicial investigation and that Taipei has refrained
from involving itself out of respect for Beijing's judiciary.</P>
      <P>Critics had slammed this policy as "offhand."</P>
      <P>The ship, the Hsinhua, was chartered by the National Defense
Ministry to ship non-military supplies to Taiwan's frontline island
of Matsu when it was reportedly caught smuggling and arrested by
Fujian Province public security officials on July 31.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, who visited the detained crew of the
Hsinhua in Mawei, Fujian, early this month complained to Su that the
MAC and SEF have done nothing to help them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator revealed on Monday that a
local swindler has managed to cheat more than 200 naive and gullible
people by enrolling them in a non-existent US university.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an of the ruling Kuomintang made his
announcement at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan which he
called to warn others not fall for the ruse.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Hsun-ming, who claimed to be the holder of three doctoral
degrees and be the president of the American Pushington University
Group, established the Pichang and Pichichang companies and took out
advertisements in local newspapers to enroll students for the "ghost"
American university for fees of tens of thousands of dollars.</P>
      <P>Unbelievably, the students dutifully attended "classes," even
when they were held in places such as McDonald's restaurants,
although some of them admitted that they felt the class venues to be
"a little strange."</P>
      <P>It was not until Tzeng finally conferred diplomas bearing three
different names for the university that the victims began to smell a
rat.</P>
      <P>One student, who was doubtful of Tzeng's setup, went to the
United States to find out if the university exists, and found that
the address of the so-called university was actually a residential
apartment building.</P>
      <P>Ouyang Yien-heng, the director of the Bureau of International
Culture and Education Relations under the Education Ministry, said
that Pushington University is not recognized by either the Republic
of China or the US governments, and asked students who are suspicious
of foreign schools to check their credentials with the Education

NT$10 billion in next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Huang Hui-chen, director general of the Cultural Affairs

election funds come from.</P>
      <P>He also urged the country's voters not to allow prejudice to

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A controversial Constitutional reform
proposal to extend by two years the term of current National
Assemblymen was scrapped on Monday during a National Assembly
session.</P>
      <P>Apparently bowing to the overwhelming pressure of public opinion,
none of the 254 delegates present at the session raised their hand to
support the proposal which would have allowed them to retain their
seats for an additional two years.</P>
      <P>Even National Assembly Speaker Su Nan-cheng, who supported the
idea as recently as Aug. 9, did an abrupt about-face while presiding
over Monday's debate.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which was aimed at having the National Assembly
elected at the same time as the Legislative Yuan, caused uproar among
the public, with the mass media dubbing it a "self-profiting clause."</P>
      <P>Monday's decision, the last part of the first reading, meant that
the proposal would not receive a second reading on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Also scuttled in the session were five other proposals out of a
total of 21 which were approved on Sept. 13, including one initiated
by the Democratic Progressive Party to lower the voting age from 20
to 18, and another which would have allowed prosecutors and police to
detain suspects for a total of 48 hours without charge.</P>
      <P>Under the current Constitution, suspects should be sent to court
for a hearing within 24 hours of arrest.</P>
      <P>However, several other controversial proposals, which would allow
the National Assembly to decide its own organization law, approve its
own budget, and oblige heads of the Judicial Yuan, Examination Yuan
and Control Yuan to brief the National Assembly on their work -- the
so-called "power-expanding clause" -- passed their first readings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy on Monday denied
that its French-made Lafayette-class missile frigates are plagued by
problems.</P>
      <P>A statement issued by the navy said the six Lafayette frigates,
known locally as Kangting-class warships, have been operating
normally ever since they were commissioned in 1996, and have
performed well on various missions.</P>
      <P>Contradicting a local newspaper report, the statement stressed
that the computer systems used on the frigates are fully
Y2K-compliant following readjustments by the French builders of the
radar-evading "stealth" warships.</P>
      <P>The statement also denied that retrofitted electronic warfare
equipment spoils the ships' radar invisibility, saying the electronic
equipment is totally consistent with the original systems installed
by the builders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SHOULD HELP US IN CASE OF WAR WITH PRC: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has a role in preventing
Beijing from using military force against Taiwan and Canberra must
stand ready to give military support to Washington if the US goes
to war with China, according to a top adviser to US presidential
candidate George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Australian Financial Review in
Sydney, Richard Armitage, who is one of the US delegates to hold
talks with his Australian counterparts on a private sector, said
there was a danger that the ongoing crisis in the Taiwan Strait could
lead to war between the United States and China and that Washington
would expect Australia to contribute to "the dirty, hard and
dangerous work."</P>
      <P>He called on Prime Minister John Howard to help prevent war: "We
do not want to go to war with China, and that is why now is the time
for preventive work. Australia has a role now. John Howard is ideally
positioned because he is meeting the president of China next week."</P>
      <P>"I would hope that the prime minister would make the point that
China needs to resolve the situation peacefully," he added. He said:
"If Australia does not rally round the defense of Taiwan, it would be
the greatest breach of the relationship since World War II," he said.</P>
      <P>Armitage said Australia should also urge Taiwan to work towards
a peaceful resolution. But he said Australians did not fully grasp
that there had been a big change across the Taiwan Strait: "Taiwan is
now a democracy. That is a fundamental change."</P>
      <P>Jiang is scheduled to arrive in Australia on September 6.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US OFFICIAL URGES TAIPEI, BEIJING TO RESUME DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By J. J. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Susan Shirk on Monday urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
resume exchanges and dialogue as soon as possible to help ease
tension in the area.</P>
      <P>Shirk made the appeal at the opening session of a "Track II"
unofficial Taipei-Washington-Beijing roundtable conference organized
by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy.</P>
      <P>The off-the-records, closed-door forum has drawn much attention
as it is being held at a time when Taipei and Beijing are at
loggerheads over Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>In her speech to the meeting, Shirk reaffirmed the US commitment
to the so-called "one China" policy, saying the US stance on the
policy remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Commenting on President Lee's declaration in an interview with
a German radio station on July 9 that cross-strait ties should be
defined as a "special state-to-state relationship," Shirk said
frankly that the US government was surprised by Lee's remarks.</P>
      <P>Shirk also reiterated US opposition to the "special
state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth time that the National Committee on American
Foreign Policy, a private US think tank, has sponsored this kind of
three-way roundtable since mid-1997 aimed at helping boost
cross-strait mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>According to those present at the Monday meeting, scholars from
Taiwan, mainland China and the United States debated hotly on the
"special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>Some participants said argument among academics from the three
sides was far fiercer than before and that Taiwan and mainland
scholars were far divided over the theory.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that some American scholars also said on the
occasion that they feel the timing and content of Lee's "special
state-to-state" remarks were not opportune.</P>
      <P>The Monday session reportedly didn't touch on issues as to
what measures the US government can take to cope with the current
cross-strait tension over the "special state-to-state" theory.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, a senior US military officer at the US Embassy in
Beijing will give a briefing on the general military situation in
the Taiwan Strait area. This will be the first time that a
senior American military officer on active duty has attended the
"Tract II" three-way roundtable.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan and mainland Chinese delegations to the current
session are mainly composed of scholars and policy researchers.
While several incumbent Clinton administration officials, including
Kurt Campbell, deputy assistant secretary of defense, will deliver
speeches during the two-day forum, which will end on
Tuesday. Former Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Winston Lord is also taking part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Observers said the main purposes of the present roundtable
discussion are to dissuade communist China to make miscalculation
of the current situation as well as to push the Clinton
administration not to make any wrong decision on cross-strait
issues amid the escalation of tension over the "special
state-to-state" theory.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER TANG TALKS ABOUT THREAT FROM CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang
Fei said in an interview that there would be no immediate major
threat from mainland China to Taiwan, but "small incidents of a
provocative nature from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) will be
predictable in the future."</P>
      <P>In the interview published in the latest issue of Defense News
weekly, the former ROC chief of the General Staff pointed out that
"My concern is that if China chooses to take military action (against
Taiwan), they will do it step-by-step. But we also believe that using
force would be a last resort, because they are concerned about
international pressure and economic growth."</P>
      <P>Tang indicated that there are many options for Beijing, such as
seizure of the offshore islands followed by missile attacks to
paralyze transportation systems, as a warning to try to force Taiwan
to the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Even if the PRC were to conduct an economic blockade of Taiwan,
it would not be beneficial to Beijing since trade between Taiwan and
mainland China is very interrelated, he said, adding that it would
also bring down foreign investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nuclear weapons aside, Tang is confident that the PLA is not able
to conduct an all-out invasion of Taiwan. Over the long run, he
noted, if mainland China's economy continues to grow, which sustains
Beijing's force buildup, they will add increasing military pressure
on Taiwan. But in the next few years, the military gap between the
two sides will persist "unless our economic situation worsens,"
stressed the defense chief.</P>
      <P>Tang conceded that ballistic missile defense is Taiwan's highest
priority now, although the Ministry of National Defense is still
coordinating different opinions within the ROC government.
"Establishment of a low-tier defense system is feasible (now), and we
still have time to evaluate systems for upper-tier defense," he said.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a heavily industrialized island, if the PRC used
missiles or other conventional forces to attack it will result in
severe damage to Taiwan's economy. "Therefore we have to make
necessary investments to offset pressures from PLA missiles, cruise
missiles and satellite technology," explained the defense minister.</P>
      <P>Tang went on to say that Taiwan is pursuing Patriot Advanced
Capability (PAC) and Aegis radar systems for lower-tier missile
defense. But he added that it is too early to say whether Taiwan will
adopt DDG-51 Aegis-class destroyers as well as the anti-missile
system.</P>
      <P>He told Defense News that the US government has made a commitment
to study which type of advanced early warning radar system will be
provided to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUNTEX DENIES PLAN TO MOVE 7TH NAPHTHA CRACKER PLANT TO WEST AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Tuesday that the Tuntex Group has not given up on its plan to
build a naphtha cracker complex in southern Taiwan in favor of
investment in west Australia.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Ying Chi-ming was responding to newspaper
reports that some of the ruling Kuomintang's businesses will join
with Tuntex to mine liquefied natural gas (LNG) in west Australia.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted Liu Tai-ying, chairman of China Development
and Industrial Bank, as saying that Tuntex and several KMT businesses
-- China Industrial and Development Bank, Central Investment Holding,
and state-owned enterprises Taiwan Power Co. and Chinese Petroleum
Corp. -- will jointly invest a total of NT$200 billion (US$6.21
billion) to prospect for LN0 and establish related facilities in
Australia.</P>
      <P>Reports said that in view of steep opposition from domestic
environmentalists over the building of the proposed naphtha cracker
plant -- the 7th in Taiwan, Tuntex might choose to build the
plant in west Australia.</P>
      <P>The seventh naphtha cracker complex, which was originally to be
located in Pinnan Industrial Park in Tainan, southern Taiwan, is now
undergoing environmental assessment, Ying said. Construction of the
plant has not yet begun, although construction has begun on related
facilities within the complex site.</P>
      <P>He said that the MOEA has checked with Tuntex and learned that it
has not given up on its project in Tainan and that its investment
in Australia is mainly in liquefied natural gas and equipment.</P>
      <P>Ying said that the seventh naphtha cracker project has
encountered opposition from local people in Tainan, mainly because
they are concerned about pollution problem.</P>
      <P>But Ying said that the petrochemical industry has actually made a
lot of improvements in pollution prevention, and the public should
not have a stereotypical view of the industry.</P>
      <P>Ying cited as examples Singapore and Australia, saying that the
two countries have continued to develop their petrochemical
industries, and that the industry will help the development of such
high-tech industries as semiconductors and information technology.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local reports indicated that a NT$600 billion
(US$18.63 billion) eighth naphtha cracker plan will be located in the
state-owned Taiwan Salt Works salt field in Butai, Chiayi County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED NOT TO ABUSE MANDATORY SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition lawmakers on Tuesday
urged the government not to abuse a proposed professional social
service system for the country's conscripts.</P>
      <P>The legislators were responding to a Cabinet proposal to allow
only male college graduates to draw lots to decide whether they can
embark on selected social services as an alternative way to fulfill
their mandatory military service.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet plan, the period for both mandatory
military service and professional social service will be two years,
but the opposition lawmakers said the proposed plan seriously
violates the principles of fairness and professionalism.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Chien Hsi-kun told
a news conference held at the Legislative Yuan that a total of 23
European countries have implemented a professional social service
system for draftees.</P>
      <P>In all those countries, Chien said, the service period for social
service is between 30 percent to 100 percent longer than that for
mandatory military service.</P>
      <P>"If the Cabinet insists on the two-year service period, it should
cut the term for military service in line with the principle of
fairness," Chien said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao
said if conscripts for selected social service are determined solely
on the basis of a lottery, it would violate professionalism and
undermine the value of the social service system.</P>
      <P>He added that social service qualification should instead be
skills-based, with draftees selected according to the various types
of skills required at any given period.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lai said the original purpose of the Cabinet plan to
introduce a social service system for conscripts was to encourage
qualified draftees to opt to serve in professional social services.</P>
      <P>"If the option is determined by lot drawing, the practice would
certainly discourage qualified conscripts from making their special
services available," Lai warned.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to deal with the issue more prudently in
order to live up to public expectations of the much-anticipated
social service system.</P>
