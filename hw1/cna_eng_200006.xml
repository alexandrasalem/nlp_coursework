which is planned for completion in December 1990. Upon completion of
the project, a trip around the island will take only a day.

1989: Lee Huan is sworn in as premier of the ROC.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-CANADA BUSINESS CONFERENCE OPENS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vancouver,  May  31  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual joint conference of the
Canada-Taiwan Business Council and its Taiwan counterpart, the
Canadian Committee of the Chinese National Association of Industry
and Commerce (CNAIC), is scheduled to open on Thursday in Vancouver.</P>
      <P>The conference, the 14th of its kind, will be jointly presided
over by Doug Young, chairman of the Canada-Taiwan Business Council,
and Theodore Cheng, chairman of the Canadian Committee of the CNAIC,
business sources here said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Unlike previous occasions when prominent officials from both
sides attended the conference in order to increase its influence,
this year's event shows an absence of major officials. Some observers
attributed the phenomenon to tenser cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
the inauguration of the Republic of China's opposition
leader-turned-president Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>However, Doug Young, a heavyweight in Canada's Liberal Party,
discounted such speculation, pointing out that the absence of major
officials indicates that bilateral business and trade relations
between Canada and Taiwan have matured.</P>
      <P>The absence of higher level political officials, as well as major
business and industrial leaders from both sides, means the bilateral
Canada-Taiwan trade relationship is now mature enough to not
necessarily require the guidance and assistance of the government,
Young noted.</P>
      <P>He added that after Taiwan is formally admitted into the World
Trade Organization, business and trade exchanges between Canada and
Taiwan will be further bolstered and the method in which they are
conducted will also be different, indicating that the relationship
will mature even more.</P>
      <P>Young stressed that most Canadians are aware of Taiwan's economic
prowess, particularly the island's ability to remain relatively
unscathed by the Asian economic crisis that began to hit the region
in mid-1997.</P>
      <P>He said the Canadian business and industrial sectors have a high
level of confidence in Taiwan's economic ability, private leadership,
and skilled labor force.</P>
      <P>Overcoming trying times such as the devastating earthquake that
hit last Sept. 21, Taiwan has become even stronger and more able to
face any serious challenges that may arise, Young said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Canada's eighth largest trading partner, with two-way
commodity trade totaling some C$5.7 billion and service trade
reaching C$400 million last year.</P>

lower on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TAIEX) on Thursday, with the

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FORMULA REQUIRES CONSENT OF TAIWAN: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  May  31  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should not back any
formula for resolving cross-Taiwan Strait disputes that is
unacceptable to the people of Taiwan, and any solution to the issue
cannot work without Taiwan's consent, emphasized an American Asia
specialist.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa, the executive director of Pacific Forum at the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies,
wrote in the latest issue of the forum's PacNet Newsletter that the
root of Communist China's concerns about the US-Japan alliance is how
the guidelines of a security treaty between the two might apply to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that while China views such alliances and the forward
basing of US troops as vestiges of the Cold War, many Chinese
acknowledge that in the near term the US-Japan alliance, if not aimed
at mainland China, generally contributes to stability in the region.</P>
      <P>"What Beijing fails to recognize fully is that its own future
deeds, not its complaints, will have the greatest influence over how
close the US-Japan link is or needs to be," Cossa added.</P>
      <P>In the current situation, "nothing short of assurances by Tokyo
and Washington that neither will interfere in a cross-strait conflict
is likely to seriously diminish Beijing's criticism about the
revitalized US-Japan alliance. It is equally clear that such an
assurance would be politically impossible and strategically
irresponsible for either to give," he noted.</P>
      <P>The only thing less likely to be accepted than Chinese demands
for "no-interference" assurances from Washington is the US demand for
a "no use of force" pledge from Beijing vis-a-vis Taiwan, he
continued.</P>
      <P>Washington does not want to do anything that might appear to
encourage Taiwan to dramatically alter the current status quo, and
Beijing desires and prefers a peaceful solution, albeit on its terms.
"Nonetheless, each would do well to accept that the other intends to
keep its strategic options open," he wrote.</P>
      <P>As Americans and Chinese discuss cross-strait issues, Cossa said,
"it is important to recognize that their search for common ground is
secondary to the need for common ground between both sides of the
Taiwan Straits."</P>
      <P>"The election and inauguration of Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan's
first opposition party president adds to the challenge but also
presents an opportunity for fresh thinking. Beijing must be prepared
to recognize and respond positively to Chen's overtures, rather than
just demand the impossible," he added.</P>
      <P>The Asian specialist said that "there appears to be no substitute
for genuine cross-strait dialogue, which itself appears possible only
if both sides are willing to go back to their 1992 understanding to
agree to disagree over what `one China' means. Attempts to put a
deadline either on reunification or on cross-strait negotiations are
likely to backfire."</P>
      <P>"A Sino-American Cold War is possible but not inevitable. A true
strategic partnership also seems unlikely, given differing world
views and long-term objectives. Perhaps the best that can be hoped
for is `apprehensive engagement' -- cooperation in areas where
objectives clearly overlap and a commitment to talk about and manage
the many differences and lingering suspicions that continue to
challenge the relationship," he said.</P>
      <P>"This will require serious strategic dialogue, not only between
the US and China, but among the four major powers and with North and
South Korea and Taiwan as well," concluded Cossa.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INVESTMENT IN MALAYSIA INCREASES 13-FOLD IN 1ST QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment made in Malaysia by Taiwanese
businesses surged 13-fold in the first quarter of this year over the
same period last year, sources from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Malaysia attracted US$94 million worth of investment from Taiwan
in the first three months of this year, up 1333 percent over the
level a year earlier, making it the fastest-growing country in
Southeast Asia in terms of soliciting Taiwanese investment, said
officials from the MOEA's Industrial Development and Investment
Center (IDIC).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's private sector channeled a total of US$407.51 million
into Southeast Asia for 108 investment projects in the first quarter.
The amount was an increase of 106.5 percent over the level a year
earlier, IDIC officials noted.</P>
      <P>IDIC officials attributed the surge in Taiwanese investment in
Malaysia mainly to the fact that more Taiwanese high-technology
companies have relocated their manufacturing operations to Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese investment in Singapore during the same three-month
period also soared, increasing a whopping 301 percent over the level
a year earlier, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Investments in Vietnam and Thailand also increased significantly,
up 120 percent and 28 percent, respectively. IDIC officials said more
traditional, labor-intensive Taiwanese manufacturers have relocated
their operations to Vietnam, taking advantage of that country's cheap
labor, inexpensive real estate costs, as well as its imminent signing
of a trade agreement with the United States.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, Taiwan was the largest source of foreign
capital in both Malaysia and Vietnam, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Thailand, meanwhile, was the country that absorbed the largest
amount of Taiwanese investment capital, a total of US$145 million, in
the first three months, they added.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwanese investment in Indonesia and the Philippines
showed negative growth in the first quarter of this year, down 37
percent and 73 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the diminished amount of Taiwanese
investment in Indonesia to such factors as political instability and
anti-Chinese hostility harbored by some Indonesian citizens. Factors
involved in the decreased amount of investment in the Philippines
included unstable government policies, government inefficiency, as
well as the suspension of direct Taiwan-Philippine air links, they
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP NATIONAL CONGRESS TO DECIDE FATE OF 'INDEPENDENCE' PLANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who is
almost certain to be the next chairman of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said on Thursday that the DPP can
consider showing goodwill to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to a Hong Kong newspaper report which
quoted mainland Chinese officials in charge of Taiwan affairs as
having said that so long as the DPP revises its pro-Taiwan
independence party charter, the Chinese Communist Party will consider
embarking on party-to-party contact with the DPP.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, said it's
up to the DPP's national congress to decide whether to revise, shelve
or scrap the so-called pro-independence plank in the party's
charter.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which has emerged as Taiwan's ruling party following
Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration as the Republic of China's new
president, is scheduled to hold its biennial party congress in July.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who had been a Taipei city councilor, legislator and the
DPP's vice presidential candidate for the 1996 presidential election
before assuming his current post, announced his bid to run for the
DPP chairmanship on Wednesday. Without a major heavyweight
challenger, Hsieh is in line to be next DPP chairman. The party will
hold the chairmanship election on June 25.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said although he has his own views on issues related
to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, it's not suitable for him to
publicly expressed too many opinions on the sensitive topic before
the opening of the party's national congress.</P>
      <P>In his own view, Hsieh said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should observe each other and learn from each other while avoiding
provoking tension and unease.</P>
      <P>"Constructive cross-strait interaction is conducive to people on
both sides of the strait," Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities have so far ruled out any contact
with the DPP because of the party's pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said since President Chen, a DPP stalwart, has extended
olive branch to Beijing, the DPP itself can follow suit.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said he believes that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will be able to overcome many technical problems concerning
cross-strait engagement so long as they show goodwill and
sincerity toward each other.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO COMPLETE QUAKE RECONSTRUCTION WITHIN 4 YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chung  Hsing  New Village, central Taiwan, June 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President
Chen Shui-bian on Thursday reassured the Taiwan public that
earthquake reconstruction in central Taiwan will be completed within
four years.</P>
      <P>Chen has required that the Executive Yuan push for a four-year
timetable for the rehabilitation of quake-battered areas so that
economic prosperity can return to the areas and the people there can
once again have happy homes.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at a ceremony marking the
establishment of the Post-Earthquake Reconstruction Promotion
Committee under the Executive Yuan. The committee formally became
operational on Thursday in Chung Hsing New Village, where the Taiwan
provincial government is located.</P>
      <P>Chen said the establishment of the committee marks a brand new
start in post-quake rehabilitation engineering, adding that it also
symbolizes the government's sincerity in delivering on its promises
to the people.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the relevant reconstruction officials and workers of
the reconstruction committee to become good neighbors in the
quake-affected communities, offering assistance and services with
heartfelt compassion similar to that of the Goddess of the Sea,
Matsu.</P>
      <P>Chen said that over the next four years, the committee will heed
the voices of the people, widely adopt suggestions from specialists,
provide barrier-free communication channels, and conduct useful
dialogue with the people and all private groups and organizations.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that no government can run dynamically without a
powerful and capable partner, Chen said the government needs the
private sector to pitch in with the reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>The magnitude 7.3 earthquake that struck on Sep. 21 was one of
the deadliest worldwide this century and the biggest ever recorded on
the tremor-plagued island. It claimed the lives of at least 2,400
people, injured some 84,000, and left 100,000 others temporarily
homeless.</P>
      <P>The tremor also leveled more than 6000 buildings and partially
ruined another 5,600 buildings, including 140 schools, mostly in
counties in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The killer quake caused more than NT$300 billion (US$9.49
billion) worth of property damage islandwide, which represented a 3.3
percent reduction in the country's gross national product (GNP) for
1999.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The entrance of Formosa Plastics Group (FPG)
into Taiwan's fuel oil market may cause money-making Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to suffer financial losses ranging from NT$10
billion to NT$60 billion a year, CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing some 600 CPC staff members during a ceremony marking
the state-run corporation's 54th founding anniversary, Chen urged
employees of CPC and affiliated firms to make concerted efforts to
lower costs and sharpen their competitive edge in the face of
cutthroat competition from FPG.</P>
      <P>In an effort to streamline operations and cut corruption, Chen
said the company has cooperated with the government's discipline
agencies and has uncovered 295 cases of suspected corruption and
irregularities involving CPC staff over the past two-and-a-half
years. The crackdown has helped save some NT$15.4 billion for the
company, he added.</P>
      <P>CPC, one of Taiwan's most profitable government-owned
enterprises, posted annual sales of NT$380 billion in fiscal year
1999, Chen noted. He added that after accounting for pension fund
deductions, the company had a pre-tax net profit of NT$29.5 billion,
exceeding the firm's official target of NT$22.4 billion.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen pointed out, with FPG's imminent entry into
the fuel market, CPC will face an immediate price war in oil
products, with losses likely to reach NT$10 billion to NT$60 billion
a year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CPC President Pan Wen-yen said that as of April 30
this year, there were a total of 603 CPC-run gas stations islandwide,
compared with 1,341 privately-own service stations.</P>
      <P>At present, total sales of gasoline and diesel fuel by private
filling stations exceed sales by CPC-run gas stations. CPC's market
share is doomed to shrink even further if FPG enters the fuel oil
market, Pan noted.</P>
      <P>FPG-produced gasoline and diesel oil are expected to be put on
the market later this year, formally ending CPC's decades-old
monopoly on the oil processing and distribution market in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD WILLING TO MEDIATE CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said on Thursday that if necessary, he will not hesitate to help
mediate relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The head of the Republic of China's highest research body made
the offer during a Legislative Yuan Budget Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for chemistry,
originally intended to explain Academia Sinica's budget plans for
the next fiscal year. However, legislators asked him a variety of
questions, ranging from cross-strait relations and educational
reforms to the performance of the ROC's newly inaugurated
government.</P>
      <P>Lee came out shortly before the March 18 presidential
election to back pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) candidate Chen Shui-bian. Lee's endorsement was believed to
have contributed to Chen's election victory. His action enraged
mainland Chinese leaders who said Lee has lost qualifications for
mediating cross-strait talks by taking side with Chen.</P>
      <P>Lee told lawmakers that he believes mainland leaders have by
now come to understand that their judgment of his role might be
wrong. "There are signs that mainland leaders are revising their
views about me, and if necessary, I'm still willing to serve as a
mediator to help seek a breakthrough to the current cross-strait
logjam," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee, a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, further said
he thinks that a supraparty task force will be inaugurated within a
month to forge a national consensus on sensitive cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said since the new government has been formed,
many affairs, including cross-strait issues, should be dealt with
within the official framework. "Take mainland affairs as an
example. The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and
the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation should play the
crucial role in handling related affairs," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee further said he himself has never intended to serve as
premier, although both incumbent President Chen and former President
Lee Teng-hui had offered the job to him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the widely respected scholar said as Taiwan just
completed its first democratic transfer of power from the
Kuomintang to the DPP, lawmakers should give the new government
"more time and room" to resolve many problems left by the previous
administration.</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes that the island's first transition of power
between different political parties in 55 years has had a positive
impact on local society. "Nevertheless, now is still a transitional
period. We should give the new administration a longer period of
time to implement its new policies and reform measures."</P>
      <P>Lee, who headed Chen's national affairs advisory group
during the final stage of campaigning for the presidency, also
said he doesn't think that the new administration should
indiscriminately deliver on all of Chen's campaign promises or
"checks."</P>
      <P>"I doubt the wisdom to turn all of the campaign checks into
government policies. The new administration should not hesitate to
revise or drop impractical or unrealistic campaign checks," he
added.</P>

      <P>Former US Defense Secretary William
Perry reiterated on Wednesday that the United States will not play a
role as a mediator in talks between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Perry made the statement while meeting with James Soong,
chairman of Taiwan's People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>While expressing his grave concern over the future development
across the Taiwan Strait, Perry told Soong that the United States
will never seek to mediate in negotiations between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Both Soong and Perry have maintained a low profile following
their hour-long meeting at Stanford University, which was focused on
Taiwan's democratization and the future of Taiwan-mainland ties. But
Perry reportedly gave high praise to the performance of the Taiwan
people in the island's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Perry reportedly took the initiative by asking to meet with Soong
upon the PFP chairman's arrival in San Francisco. The former US
defense secretary is slated to lead a delegation to Taiwan and the
mainland in mid-June.</P>
      <P>Soong, currently on a trip to the US, arrived in the United

    <HEADLINE>CISCO CEO TO VISIT TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chambers, chairman and CEO of Cisco
System, the world's largest manufacturer of internet system
equipment, is scheduled to arrive in Taipei next week to attend a
high-tech education summit and to deliver a lecture, sources from
Cisco Taiwan said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Cisco, under the leadership of Chambers, has recently become the
corporation with the highest market value in the world. The company's
rise has also given new fame to Chambers, who has been called "Top
CEO in America,"</P>
      <P>Other titles that Chambers has earned include "the greatest
leader in America," "one of the world's 10 most influential figures
in science and technology innovation," and "Mr. Internet."</P>
      <P>Chambers, who was recently awarded the title of "2000 Internet
Leader" by the American Internet Convention, will deliver a keynote
speech entitled "The Network Effect: Productivity in the New Economy"
to the World Congress of Information Technology (WCIT), scheduled to
kick off on June 11 at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>Chambers will also take part in the Educational Summit on the
Internet Era being co-sponsored by Academia Sinica and the Ministry
of Education, said company sources. During the summit, Chambers will
join Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh and Education Minister
Ovid J.L. Tzeng for discussions.</P>
      <P>During his short stay in Taipei, Chambers will also meet with
ranking officials of the new ROC government to exchange views on
technology exchanges, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Chambers, who regards Taiwan as a lifelong business partner, was
last in Taipei in April, 1999 for discussions on cooperative projects
with Taiwan. One of those projects was one that Cisco is now
cooperating with Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry (III) to
carry out. It involves establishing a cable modem laboratory to
further develop Taiwan's internet hardware technologies.</P>
      <P>Cisco previously helped the III establish a laboratory in Taiwan
to develop asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) technology. ADSL

    <HEADLINE>MOST AMERICANS THINK CHINA'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD POOR: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 1 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large majority of Americans think that
mainland China's government does a bad job respecting human rights,
according to a recent Gallup poll.</P>
      <P>As the 11th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square approaches, the poll found
that 67 percent of the respondents feel Communist China has a poor
record of respecting the human rights of its citizens, with 36
percent describing the record as "very bad."</P>
      <P>Only 18 percent of those Americans surveyed between May 23-24
believe Beijing is doing a good job in this respect.</P>
      <P>At the same time, however, 54 percent of those surveyed said it
is more important to maintain good relations with China than to take
a strong stand on Beijing's poor human rights record.</P>
      <P>Another recent Gallup poll, conducted between May 18-21, showed
that Americans are split on their view of the state of US-PRC
relations, with 51 percent considering China as either an ally or as
a friendly nation and 43 percent considering it as unfriendly or as
an enemy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll, which was conducted prior to the US House of
Representatives' passage of legislation for granting PNTR status for
China, found that 62 percent of the respondents felt the US should
not increase trade with China until Beijing gives more economic,
political, and religious freedom to its citizens, while 56 percent
favored normalizing trade relations with China.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
is scheduled to leave for South Africa in October to co-chair an
international women's meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Friday.</P>
      <P>A MOFA spokesman told a routine news conference that as Lu is one
of the seven female vice presidents in 192 countries around the
world today, organizers of the Seventh Global Summit of Women to be
held in Johannesburg have invited Lu to co-chair the summit with six
other women deputy heads of state.</P>
      <P>The first Global Summit of Women was held in 1988, and Lu
organized the fourth conference in Taipei in 1994 with the
participation of more than 400 outstanding female politicians from
70-plus countries.</P>
      <P>As the ROC does not have formal diplomatic ties with South
Africa, the MOFA spokesman said it remains uncertain in which
capacity or form Lu will visit South Africa.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has never hesitated to try to block the ROC's
engagement with other countries, particularly those with which it
maintains official ties. South Africa switched its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing on Jan. 1, 1998.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the MOFA spokesman said the ministry is now
actively arranging for Lu to realize her overseas travel plan. The
2000 world summit on women's affairs is scheduled for Oct. 5-7.</P>
      <P>Lu, the ROC's first female vice president, has been a democracy
and women's rights activist. She was jailed for more than five years
in the 1980s for her role in a pro-democracy demonstration during
Taiwan's martial law era. She had been a legislator and Taoyuan
County magistrate before assuming her current post on May 20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOFA spokesman said the Dominican Republic, one of
the ROC diplomatic allies in the Caribbean, has invited President
Chen Shui-bian to make a state visit later this year.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA has sent a Dominican Republic travel plan to the
Presidential Office," the spokesman said, adding that it's up to the
Presidential Office to make a final decision on the exact visiting
time and relevant itinerary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANOTHER CHILD SUCCUMBS TO KILLER ENTEROVIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another child died after being infected with
enterovirus (EV), bringing the total number of child deaths caused by
the viral disease in Taiwan to five this year, disease control
officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, 18 other young children have also died this year
of suspected EV infections.</P>
      <P>The latest victim, a four-month-old baby boy from the eastern
city of Ilan, died Thursday of encephalitis and acute inflammation of
the heart muscle in a Taipei hospital.</P>
      <P>The child was sent to an Ilan hospital Monday after getting
serious ulcers and blisters in his mouth and throat, typical
complications caused by EV type-71, doctors said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Kuo-dong, a division head at the Center for
Disease Control (CDC), the victim was an only child living in a
neighborhood with no other young children. Doctors suspect that the
child's mother, a working woman, might be the source of the baby's
fatal illness. The mother has been asked to have her blood tested as
part of the clinical investigation.</P>
      <P>So far this year, there have been 98 suspected cases of serious
EV infection, including the 23 fatal cases, all of them children
under the age of three, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Most of the 98 suspected EV infection cases were reported in
northern Taiwan. Laboratory examination results showed that the
suspected cases included EV type-71, coxsackievirus type A-16, and
coxsackievirus type B-3, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Children younger than five are most susceptible to EV. Early
symptoms of the infection resemble the flu, with fever, headache and
vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and rashes on the palms and
feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly complications include
encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflammation of the heart muscle.</P>
      <P>This year's epidemic appears to be a little more serious than
last year's, said Chen, adding that there were 35 serious cases and
nine deaths reported last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a preschool class in Paiho Township, Tainan County was
ordered to close Friday after two children in the class were rushed
to a hospital in Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Although the children were not clinically diagnosed as having
contracted EV, they are receiving further tests due to their sudden
blurred vision. EV infection, which can cause meningitis and
encephalitis, may also cause blurred vision, doctors said.</P>
      <P>So far this year, there have been 1,300 cases of suspected EV
infection reported in Tainan County alone, although most of them were
not serious cases.</P>

      <P>Taipei-based TransAsia Airways, the third
local airline company to operate international flight services, is
preparing to open a liaison office in Beijing in June, company
sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>A company spokesman said the move is aimed at bolstering services
to Taiwan passengers who transfer from Macau to mainland Chinese
cities, as well as paving the way for the much-discussed "three
direct links" between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>With its current fleet of 10 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft and
nine ATR 72-500/200 jets, TransAsia operates 144 domestic flights, as
well as 12 international daily flights on the Taipei-Macao,
Kaohsiung-Macao, Taipei-Phuket and Taipei-Kinabalu routes.</P>
      <P>Although ticket sales for domestic flights have fallen as a
result of a price hike, TransAsia still managed to post a monthly
business turnover of NT$555 million (US$18 million) in May, up 24
percent over the same month of last year. The company attributed the
growth mainly to brisk sales of its international flight tickets.</P>
      <P>TransAsia sold 3.8 million domestic seats last year, representing
27 percent of Taiwan's domestic flight market, the spokesman added.</P>

      <P>Ace baseball pitcher C.M. Wang of the Taipei
Physical Education College (TPEC) is scheduled to sign a US$2.01
million contract with the New York Yankees next week, TPEC sources
reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The signing of the contract will make Wang the first Taiwanese
college student to join any professional baseball team in the United
States, the sources said.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Wang is expected to leave for the United

leagues, which serve as training grounds for major league baseball
players.</P>
      <P>Wang has been watched by American baseball teams, including the
Mariners and Dodgers, for the last five years, according to his coach
at TPEC.</P>
      <P>With a 148 km-per-hour pitch, Wang has a variety of pitches in
his arsenal, including curve ball, slider, screwball, sinker and
knuckle ball, but the Yankees scout was most impressed by his fork
ball, the coach said.</P>
      <P>Wang is expected to spend his first nine months in the United
States receiving pitching training and playing in the minor leagues.
Later, he will study baseball theory and English at a sister college

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 10-year-old boy went on his own to the
Chiayi District Court on Thursday to ask to disown his mother because
he is afraid of being beaten again.</P>
      <P>The boy, surnamed Chiu, took a taxi after school directly to the
district court to ask judges to place him under his father's custody
rather than his mother's.</P>
      <P>Chiu has been living with his mother since his parents divorced a
couple of years ago.</P>
      <P>He told the judges that he was beaten by his mother every time
she found out that he had visited his father, who lives in another
township in suburban Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Police called both the boy's parents, whereupon the father rushed
to the district court. He said he could no longer stand to see the
child so abused, and added that it was unfair that judges granted
custody of the child to his mother at the divorce hearing simply
because the mother said he was not financially capable of raising the
child.</P>
      <P>The father said his ex-wife is a gambler, insensitive to the
child's needs and unfit to be a mother. The mother did not show up at
the court, but told reporters over the telephone that both the boy
and his father are liars.</P>
      <P>The police allowed Chiu to go home with his father and the judges
agreed that they will look into the case and will possibly grant

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD HOPING CROSS-STRAIT TALKS CAN RESUME SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government hopes high-level talks
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can be held as soon as
possible, an official in charge of the nation's mainland policy said
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), expressed the hope that the mainland feels the same
way, and stressed that the desire to move cross-strait relations
toward positive development is not just "empty words."</P>
      <P>She also said the timing of talks will have to take into
consideration the physical fitness of the two top negotiators -- Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Tsai said that "stark December doesn't seem a suitable time for
the two octogenarians to meet," while the possibility of an October
meeting will depend on efforts by both sides.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the long-established communication channel
between the SEF and ARATS should not be scrapped, noting that it is
still "the most important communication mechanism." The alternative
"track II" or "track III" dialogue channels can only serve as
"supplementary mechanisms," she added.</P>
      <P>Talks between the SEF and ARATS have been stalled since last July
following former President Lee Teng-hui's statement that cross-strait
ties should be regarded as "a special state-to-state relationship,"
drawing Beijing's ire.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin pointed out that the
1992 talks between SEF and ARATS didn't reach a conclusion on the
"one China" issue, other than to "agree to disagree" on the
interpretation of "one China."</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to remarks made a day earlier by ARATS Vice
Chairman Tang Shubei that Taiwan has reversed the agreement reached
in 1992 and that it is due to Taiwan's "troublemaking" that relations
between the two sides are stalled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO TURN `GOODWILL INTO ACTION' TO IMPROVE TIES WITH BEIJING (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said on Friday that the
Republic of China is willing to turn "goodwill into action" and
promote exchanges and cooperation with mainland China on the basis of
mutual respect.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is still recovering from surgery carried out in April
to remove a chest tumor, made the pledge in his first administrative
report to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He told lawmakers that since he was appointed premier of the
ROC's new administration, he has been thinking of the kind of
administration he wants to establish.</P>
      <P>"In my mind, public well-being should be the administration's
priority concern and all administrative programs should contribute to
ensuring national security," said the four-star
general-turned-premier.</P>
      <P>Tang outlined six major categories of his administrative plan --
improving cross-strait relations; declaring war on "black gold"
politics; accelerating economic development; substantiating
educational reforms and boosting cultural development; rejuvenating
government structure and upgrading administrative efficiency; and
speeding up reconstruction of the 921 earthquake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Noting that pursuing peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is
critical to the nation's national security, Tang said the ROC is
willing to hold comprehensive dialogue, including discussion of
political issues with mainland China, on the basis of mutual respect.</P>
      <P>Beijing froze semi-official talks with Taipei last July after
then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui redefined bilateral ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship," and the communist regime has
been pressuring the new ROC administration to embrace its cherished
"one China" policy -- that there is only one China, of which Taiwan
is a part -- in order to allow bilateral talks to resume.</P>
      <P>The government has balked at the demand thus far because the
policy downgrades the ROC to a local government under the People's
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In his report, Tang, a former ROC Air Force commander-in-chief,
chief of the General Staff and defense minister, stressed the
importance of continuing to beef up the nation's defense capabilities
in order to ensure national security, sovereignty and dignity.</P>
      <P>He also called for the establishment of a cross-strait military
mutual trust mechanism to avoid any possible conflict resulting from
miscalculation or misinformation on either side.</P>
      <P>Tang said his Cabinet will also conduct an overall review of the
ROC's decades-old ban on direct trade, transportation and postal
links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"And we regard Taipei's and Beijing's expected accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) later this year as an additional
opportunity to improve bilateral ties," the premier said, adding he
is hopeful that the other side of the strait will reciprocate
"goodwill with goodwill."</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, Tang said the new government will
continue carrying out the previous administration's "pragmatic
diplomacy" to reach out to the world and break Taiwan out of its
Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation.</P>
      <P>"We'll also push for the establishment of a national human rights
commission and reinforce contact with international human rights
organizations in order to bring the ROC back into the world human
rights system," he said.</P>
      <P>Turning to domestic issues, Tang declared an all-out war on
"black gold" politics, saying his Cabinet will integrate the strength
and resources of police, investigation, prosecution and other
relevant law-enforcement authorities to stamp out irregularities in
public works bidding procedures, cut out money-linked politics, wipe
out official corruption, eradicate the involvement of organized crime
in politics, draw a clear line between political and business
interests and crack down on manipulation of the local bourse by
underworld criminal rings.

      <P>Tang further said the government will set up a special
supervisory and management commission to oversee restructuring of
troubled financial institutions, resolve the bad debt and overdue
loan problems and ensure domestic financial and market stability.</P>
      <P>In addition to boosting the development of high-tech industries
to build Taiwan into a "green silicon island," Tang said the Cabinet
will continue helping traditional industries upgrade production,
management and competitiveness and assisting local farmers to cope
with the challenges sure to arise from the ROC's forthcoming WTO
entry and the global trend toward farming trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>Tang, a Kuomintang stalwart, was named by President Chen
Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party to
head the Cabinet partly because the KMT still dominates the
legislature. His premiership was also designed to placate old-guard
military generals who are vehemently opposed to any move toward
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Tang's first administrative report drew mixed reactions from
legislators from the various political parties. While DPP lawmakers
generally gave a thumbs-up to Tang's administrative plans, their
counterparts from the opposition parties, including the KMT, the
People First Party (PFP) and the New Party, criticized him for
failing to present any innovative, forward-looking policy goals or
concrete measures to deliver on President Chen's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Most of the opposition also expressed disappointment at Tang's
failure to explain his Cabinet's stance on several controversial but
very important issues, such as how the government plans to handle the
fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao said Tang's administrative
report lacks vision and shows no innovative thinking.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy on Friday
celebrated the arrival at the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan
of an Anchorage-class dock landing ship (LSD) leased from the United
States.</P>
      <P>ROC Fleet Vice Commodore Huang Cheng-yun said at a welcoming
ceremony that after the 30-year-old vessel, renamed Hsuhai (Radiant
Sea), has completed combat readiness training in mid-June, it will
replace the 50-year-old LSD Chungcheng.</P>
      <P>Anchorage-class ships, which are still in active service in the
US Navy, are fast and have large troop transport capacities, two
qualities that will greatly enhance the ROC Navy's amphibious
operational strength, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Formerly named the USS Pensacola (LSD-38), the Hsuhai will join
the navy's Newport-class tank landing ships (LST) Chungho and
Chungping to form a high-speed amphibious flotilla for rapid response
missions.</P>
      <P>The Hsuhai is one of just five vessels of its class. It is 171
meters long and 25 meters wide with a full displacement tonnage of
13,700 tons. It was constructed by General Dynamics at their Quincy,
Massachusetts, facility and was commissioned by the US Navy in 1971.</P>
      <P>The LSD has a maximum speed of 22 knots and can sail for 14,800
nautical miles without refueling. Armed with a Phalanx air defense
system, it can accommodate 360 fully equipped infantrymen in addition
to light LST's and amphibious tanks.</P>
      <P>Hsuhai is the first of two Anchorage-class LSD's that the ROC
Navy has leased from the United States through the foreign military
sales (FMS) program. The only other decommissioned US vessel in its
class is the USS Fort Fisher (LSD-40), currently berthed in Benecia,
California, according to the US Navy's Naval Vessel Register.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOSTON UNIVERSITY INVITES ROC PRESIDENT TO VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Boston University Chancellor Jon
Westling on Friday invited ROC President Chen Shui-bian to visit and
deliver a speech at his school.</P>
      <P>Westling extended his invitation during a meeting at the
Presidential Office with Chen, who at 49 is the Republic of China's
youngest president.</P>
      <P>Chen said he appreciates Westling's invitation. "I'm more than
willing to accept your invitation. The problem lies in whether the US
government will issue a visa for me to realize the travel plan," the
president said, adding: "But anyway, I'm grateful for your
invitation. And this indicates that Boston really is the cradle of US
freedom and democracy."</P>
      <P>Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark visit to the
United States in 1995 to deliver a speech at his alma mater --
Cornell University. Lee's trip enraged Beijing which viewed it as a
move to promote Taiwan independence. The communist regime retaliated
by unilaterally suspending semi-official dialogue with Taipei and
further vented its spleen by conducting live-fire war games and
missile testing on Taiwan's doorstep.</P>
      <P>Beijing has spared no effort to block the ROC's engagement with
other countries and its presence in the international arena, which
has made it very difficult for senior ROC leaders to visit countries
which diplomatically recognize Beijing instead of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Westling and several other senior Boston University executives
arrived in Taipei earlier this week to take part in a meeting of the
school's Taiwan alumni.</P>
      <P>Chen said he admires Boston University for its liberal
education tradition and its outstanding academic achievements.
The 159-year-old school is one of the top-notch US universities and
boasts the second largest enrollment of foreign students in the
United States. The school currently has 300 students from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, President Chen also met with a delegation of
senior executives from the Barry Goldwater Research Institute, an
Arizona State-based think tank.</P>
      <P>The think tank was founded in 1988 in memory of the late US
Senator Barry Goldwater, a staunch supporter of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, said he admires
Sen. Goldwater for his lifelong promotion of the concepts of "limited
government, economic freedom and individual responsibility."</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his gratitude for the institute's
contribution to promoting cooperation between Taiwan and US
think tanks over past years.</P>
      <P>The president said he hopes private think tanks in both
countries will strengthen cooperation in research on topics related
to Taiwan's development, relations across the Taiwan Strait and
Asia-Pacific peace and stability to help boost regional peace and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>The delegation was led by Tracy R. Thomas, head of the Barry
Goldwater Research Institute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINES SEEKS A LIFT ON TAIWAN'S BAN ON NEW FILIPINO WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila June 02 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs
is seeking a lift on the ban on Filipino workers imposed by Taiwan
government, branding the policy as unfair since it applies only to
Filipinos.</P>
      <P>"We have a large number of skilled Filipinos and besides, if it
is close to us, why is it open to other countries? We need the jobs
there and Taiwan also needs us. Do not think that they don't need
us," Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for Migrant Workers Benjamin
Domingo said.</P>
      <P>Domingo disclosed Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) in
Taipei Representative Rodolfo Reyes has started negotiations to
remove the hiring freeze on Filipino workers.</P>
      <P>"We are not begging, we have a position and our workers have
skills that other nationalities do not have. They should not limit
the entrance of Filipino workers,?" Domingo said.</P>
      <P>He expressed optimism that things would "turn out well in the
next month or so," as the government would also address the concerns
of the Taiwanese side.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials had cited long-standing labor issues such as
the government's blacklisting of certain Taiwanese employers and
recruitment agencies as reasons for the ban.</P>
      <P>They also cited the high rate of Filipino workers who run away
from their sponsoring employers, and said that the Philippine
government's intervention in labor disputes between Taiwanese
employers and their Filipino workers was "unfair treatment."</P>
      <P>The ban will cover new applicants and not Filipinos already
employed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Domingo said that some problems between the two sides are caused
by cultural differences, as some Filipinos bring their workplace
habits abroad. For example, Domingo explained that Taiwanese do not
stage sit-down strikes, a common form of labor protest in the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Domingo said the Filipinos would still be able
to find jobs in Taiwan. Construction-related jobs are plentiful,
because of ongoing restructuring after last year's earthquake, he
said, adding that no other nationalities could take the place of
Filipino health care and related service workers.</P>
      <P>The undersecretary expressed his suspicion that the ban on new
workers was related to the ongoing dispute over air rights between
the two nations, and added that the two issues should not be linked.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is very important to us because its state of
industrialization... It not only provides jobs for our people but
also a place to learn about industries. The air agreement should be
treated as an isolated case," Domingo said.</P>
      <P>Manila unilaterally canceled its air agreement with Taipei in
October of last year due to several violations committed by the
Taiwanese carriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CAN NORMALIZE ECON. TIES WITH M'LAND AFTER WTO ENTRY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Membership in the World Trade Organization
(WTO) will not only provide Taiwan with the benefit of freer global
trade, but also increase the possibility of normalizing economic
relations with China, a leading Taiwanese economist said here Friday.</P>
      <P>"If both Taiwan and China join in the WTO, a considerable amount
of disputes over investment and trade will be hopefully resolved
under the institutional framework and the international
organization," said Wu Rong-I, president of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research.</P>
      <P>Wu's comments were made during a lunch meeting of the eighth
conference on Pacific Basin Finance, Economics, and Accounting, which
ran concurrently with a meeting of the Association of Deans of
Southeast Asian Gradate Schools of Management. Some 200 scholars from
around the world, including mainland China, were in attendance.</P>
      <P>The new Republic of China government of President Chen Shui-bian
has shown a willingness to improve cross-strait relations, Wu said,
adding that only reciprocal good will from China will result in any
progress.</P>
      <P>He noted that the current climate of uneasiness among Taiwan
investors in the mainland stems from China's deliberation over
re-starting political negotiations with Taiwan, a situation that has
left Taiwanese lives and interests insecure.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Taiwanese economist urged Beijing to show a more
reasonable attitude, so that the public on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait can see that there is no imminent crisis. This will result in
increased confidence among Taiwan investors in the mainland, he
added.</P>
      <P>"If China is serious about its saber-rattling tactics and carries
out its threats, it is not unlikely that the Taiwanese investors may
diversify their foreign investment activities from China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>China has encouraged the Taiwanese investors to invest in China
ever since its open-door policy of 1978. But Taiwan's government has
been very careful not to get too close to its menacing neighbor.</P>
      <P>Trade activities are conducted via a third destination, as no
direct links are allowed. Typically, each individual investment
project is limited to less than US$50 million.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and China grew from US$4 billion
to US$25.9 billion from 1989 to 1999, while Taiwan's accumulated
direct investment in China soared from less than US$1 billion in 1991
to US$14.5 billion in 1999, according to Taiwan's official figures.</P>

      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh on
Friday accepted President Chen Shui-bian's appointment to head a
supra-party task force on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>But the 1986 Nobel prize winner for chemistry turned down Chen's
offer to serve as chief senior presidential advisor when Presidential
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung brought the letter of appointment
to him.</P>
      <P>Before the March 18 president election, Lee agreed to head Chen's
national policy advisors if Chen won the election.</P>
      <P>But he told Chang that Academia Sinica is a subordinate
institution under the Presidential Office, and he can present any
proposals to the president in his current position.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, there is no need for him to serve as senior
advisor to the president, and added that it remains unclear whether
it is legal to concurrently serve as Academia Sinica president and

(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to Beijing's state-run Xinhua News
Agency, mainland Chinese radio and television stations boycotted
Taiwan pop singer Chang Huei-mei because the public audience urged
them to do so.</P>
      <P>In a brief news report on Friday, Xinhua claimed that "some
listeners and viewers demanded the stations stop airing shows
featuring Chang Huei-mei," who is known affectionately as "A-Mei" by
her fans in both Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Quoting managers at the Central People's Broadcasting Station and
the Central Television Station, Xinhua claimed that state-run radio
and television stations imposed the "temporary ban" in consideration
of strong negative feedback from their "vast listening and viewing
audience."</P>
      <P>According to the report, the managers also said that their
stations will continue to promote cross-strait cultural exchanges.
They praised Chang as an influential young singer from Taiwan, adding
that this incident will not affect her future participation in
cross-strait cultural exchanges, the news agency said.</P>
      <P>This was Beijing's first official explanation on the ban imposed
on Chang after she sang the Republic of China's national anthem at
the May 20 ROC presidential inauguration ceremonies.</P>
      <P>A soft drink commercial featuring Chang was banned from mainland
Chinese television stations soon after the inauguration, a move that
drew widespread local and international criticism. She has also
reportedly been banned from entering mainland China for three years,
and a ban has also been imposed on sales of her CDs and tapes in

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC lawmakers planning to visit mainland
China should stick to Taiwan's bottom line on "one China" as revealed
in President Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang lawmakers quoted Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen as saying that she hopes the lawmakers will stand firm
on Taiwan's stance regarding the "one China" issue while visiting the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Members of the "E-Generation Alliance," a sub-group of Kuomintang
lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan who have been invited by the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait to
visit the mainland next week, made the remarks to reporters following
a meeting with Tsai.</P>
      <P>According to the "E-Generation" lawmakers, they also exchanged
opinions with Tsai on the proposed "direct religious voyage" across
the Taiwan Strait to facilitate an annual religious journey by Taiwan
Buddhists to Meizhou in mainland China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Chen Chieh-ju, the MAC head agreed to
make efforts on this front, as long as technical issues, such as a
registration of participants in the pilgrimage, can be confirmed
prior to their departure.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Lin Chin-chia, Tsai also asked them to
tell relevant mainland Chinese authorities that she will try to
communicate with Vice President Annette Lu on the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>As Lu is not a member of the ROC government body in charge of
drawing Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, Tsai was quoted as
saying that "I will listen to Tang, not to her," if Lu makes any
pro-independence suggestions.</P>
      <P>Lin cited Tsai as saying that President Chen, Premier Tang Fei
and she have jointly worked out common ground on Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China and that they will continue seeking to patch up
differences with Lu on the "one China" question.</P>
      <P>Lu is viewed by Beijing as a hard-line pro-Taiwan independence
activist, while Chen, a member of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, softened his stance toward mainland China in his
May 20 inaugural address by declaring the "five noes," as long as the
Beijing regime has no intention of using military force against
Taiwan during his four-year tenure.</P>
      <P>The "five noes" are: no declaration of Taiwan independence, no
change of the national title, no inclusion of the "two-states" theory
in the Constitution, no referendum to change the status-quo of the
issue of Taiwan independence or unification with the mainland, and no
abolition of the National Reunification Council or the National
Reunification Guidelines.</P>

      <P>Hung Yu-chin, executive director of the KMT Central Policy

President Chen Shui-bian made during the election campaign, and
should not cheat the voters.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Chu Feng-chih, said that Tang's report
did not touch on the issue of whether the construction of the fourth
nuclear power generating unit will be suspended or not.</P>
      <P>On the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, she said
that she was disappointed over the report, as it failed to present
any formula to break the current stalemate.</P>
      <P>Because of Tang's health problems, the legislators agreed to put
off the interpellation session on the administrative report until
July 4.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, before Tang delivered his report, several KMT
legislators criticized the new government for failing to consolidate
its policies on some important issues, including the legal status of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They criticized Vice President Annette Lu for her recent remarks
that Taiwan's legal status remains up in the air.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Hsieh Chang-ting is the sole
candidate in the running for Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
chairman, as the official registration deadline ended Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh is almost certain to win by default because DPP by-laws
governing elections do not have provisions on the percentage of party
member votes needed for a win in such a case.</P>
      <P>Of the three people who picked up the forms, Hsieh was the only
person to complete the registration process for the June 25 election
of the ninth DPP party chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The DPP will review the candidate's qualifications on June 7,
announce the number of candidates on June 12, organize a policy
debate on June 16, and hold the election on June 25.</P>
      <P>The direct election of DPP chairman by party members began with
the previous term, in which four candidates vied for the position.
Because only one candidate is registered to run this time, the DPP's
central standing committee will decide whether or not to change the
June 16 policy debate to a campaign speech-delivering session.</P>
      <P>Hsieh is a graduate of National Taiwan University Law School and
earned juris master and juris doctor degrees from Japan's Kyoto

Taipei city councilman and a legislator before he took his current
post in 1998.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's campaign platform includes vows to consolidate
intra-party consensus, serve as a stabilizing force for Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GOURMETS CONSUME 300 MILLION CHICKEN TESTICLES A YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan diners annually consume about 300
million chicken testicles, making the island the world biggest market
for the Epicurean delight, said an agricultural official on Friday.</P>
      <P>The demand for chicken testicles -- considered a delicacy by many
Taiwanese -- is so great that the local poultry industry cannot meet
it. Chen Ching-chang, a poultry production official at the Council of
Agriculture (COA) estimates that two thirds of last year's
consumption was smuggled in.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese enthusiasm for chicken testicles is so feverish that it
has brought about a thriving new trade -- scouting the poultry
markets of mainland China and the United States to find new sources,
and smuggled the product into Taiwan en masse.</P>
      <P>The scouts have done such a good job that mainland China has
almost been completely depleted of chicken testicles, said Chen.</P>
      <P>The COA confiscated 21,000 kg of chicken testicles in the first
four months of this year, compared with 23,000 kg of livestock offal.
Most of the contraband originated in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Testicles of almost any animal are prized by Taiwanese as an
natural aphrodisiac. Chicken testicles, known as "chifu" in Taiwan,
are also popular among Taiwan women, who think that eating the organ
can help keep them beautiful. Usually the dish is prepared by
boiling.</P>
      <P>Of course, some people eat the dish because of its delicious
taste. Like peanuts or pretzels, Chifus are often accompanied by
pints of beer.</P>
      <P>Taiwan farms usually slaughter chickens for their meat when the
chickens are at the tender age of six to twelve weeks old, not old
enough for their testicles to be fully developed. Only a few
free-range chickens, which are brought to the market at a relatively
advanced age of 14 to 16 weeks, have full-sized testicles, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Most of mainland chickens are raised on open ranches, and have
bigger testicles than those of Taiwan chickens.</P>
      <P>This makes it easy to differentiate between the underdeveloped
testicles from Taiwan chickens and those smuggled in from mainland
China, not to mention those brought in from the United States. Some
of the American chifus are actually taken from turkeys and are as big
and hard as golf balls.</P>
      <P>A pair of chicken testicles sells here for about NT$20 (US$0.66),
or NT$600 to NT$1,000 (US$20-30) a kilogram, which makes it the most
valuable part of a chicken.</P>
      <P>In mainland China, the product costs about renminbi 10 yen (about
US$1.40) a kilogram. In the United States, chicken testicles are
folded into animal feed or simply disposed of as waste, which are far
less profitable than selling them to Taiwan's gourmets.</P>
      <P>Although the prices of chicken eggs and meat has fluctuated
violently in past years, chicken testicles, riding on the back of
strong market demand, have always sold at a premium in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officials estimate that the chicken testicles
smuggled in from mainalnd China and the United States are two to
three times greater than Taiwan's domestic production, or 200 million
testicles a year.</P>
      <P>With local gourmands evincing such strong euphoria for chifus,
many local chicken farmers are likely wishing that their chickens
would develop more than one pair of testicles per head.</P>
      <P>Agricultural officials warned, however, that the coastline area
of mainland China has been declared an area plagued by bird flu which
is passed over to humans from poultry. Chicken products from mainland
China could transmit the epidemic to the island.</P>
      <P>They called the public to be vigilant against the smuggled
poultry, as it could carry the bird flu virus.</P>

to speak out when one is not called upon to speak: that is called
being froward. Second, to keep silent when called upon to speak: that
is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak out without taking into
consideration the expression in the eyes of the person spoken to:
that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>US ENVOY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Ambassador to mainland China Joseph
Prueher said on Friday he is optimistic about prospects for
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait once both of
them enter the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Prueher, who returned to Washington earlier this week, made the
remarks in a question-and-answer session following his speech at a
seminar sponsored by the Asia Society.</P>
      <P>Prueher said he found that the People's Liberation Army's (PLA's)
tough talks on Taiwan-related issues are partly backlash triggered
by Beijing's move to cut its influence in the mainland society.</P>
      <P>The US navy pilot-turned-diplomat pointed out that the mainland
leadership ordered the PLA to stop any profit-making enterprises two
years ago and tried to arrange for a civilian official to head
mainland China's Central Military Commission. "All these moves have
drawn some backlash from the PLA," Prueher noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taiwan is almost the only topic that
entire mainland China can reach a unanimous view. Therefore, he
said, the PLA has often used this topic to highlight the value of
its existence.</P>
      <P>Many recent articles carried in the PLA-run newspapers featured
hard-line rhetoric on cross-strait problems, Prueher said, adding
that these articles reflected the PLA's official stance.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Prueher said different opinions about
Taiwan-related problems still exist within the ranks of the PLA.</P>
      <P>Prueher said he got an impression through talks with mainland
Chinese military leaders that they all attach great importance to
national security and want to beef up mainland China's military
might. "But I didn't feel that its top military brass hold an
especially harsh attitude toward Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Prueher said he believes that dialogue between
Taiwan and mainland China can resume if the US Senate can smoothly
pass the bill granting permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to
mainland China and global economic integration proceeds
satisfactorily following mainland China's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>As for Washington-Beijing relations, Prueher said mainland China
has agreed to resume talks with the United States on prevention of
arms proliferation and that the two sides may also open human rights
dialogue for resolving some practical issues.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, Prueher said he is optimistic about the prospects
for future US-mainland China relations and Taipei-Beijing
engagement. He added that mainland China must prepare for WTO entry
and should also seek innovative, flexible and constructive measures
to resolve cross-strait problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDENTS SATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT'S HANDLING OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local university students
are satisfied with new ROC President Chen Shui-bian's handling of
issues related to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, according to
the results of an opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Chinese Culture Association from
May 23 through June 1 on randomly chose students at 10 universities
in northern Taiwan, four each in central and southern Taiwan, and two
in eastern Taiwan. The association sent out 1,200 copies of
questionnaires and collected 862 valid replies.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that most university students want the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait increase exchanges and consultation to
boost mutual understanding. The majority of the respondents also
want to maintain peace and the status quo while would neither like to
see de jure Taiwan independence nor an eruption of cross-strait
military conflict.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 79.3 percent of those interviewed said they
are satisfied with President Chen's handling of cross-strait
problems and only 11.8 percent gave a thumbs-down to Chen's
performance in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 51.1 percent said they think Chen's
inaugural speech will help improve cross-strait relations while 36.4
percent said they think otherwise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 75.4 percent said they are confident in Chen's
handling of cross-strait relations in the future, but 18.6
percent said they have no confidence in Chen's ability in
dealing with such sensitive issues.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy finding was that 72.9 percent of the
respondents said they think they are both Taiwanese and Chinese,
three times the number of those who identify themselves as Taiwanese
but not Chinese.</P>
      <P>While 57.4 percent of those interviewed said they think that
mainland China does not understand Taiwan's current situation, 38.9
percent said they don't think so.</P>
      <P>As much as 62.8 percent said they don't think that a
cross-strait war would break out during President Chen's
tenure, and only 25.5 percent said they are worried about the
possibility of the eruption of a cross-strait military confrontation
over the next four years.</P>
      <P>If a cross-strait war were to erupt, 71.1 percent said they
think that the United States might send troops to assist Taiwan, but
23.5 percent said they don't think so. The finding indicates that
local youths hold a strong reliance on the US military assistance.</P>
      <P>Asked how the cross-strait issues should be resolved, 45.5
percent said the two sides should settle disputes through
negotiations and consultations; 40.1 percent said they think
that time will naturally resolve the problems; 7.2 percent said they
hope to see the holding of a plebiscite to decide Taiwan's future;
and only 3.5 percent said they are hopeful that the United States
will mediate a solution to the thorn issue.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 40.5 percent of those interviewed
said they think the status quo will continue to maintain in the long
run; 20.5 percent said they believe that the two sides will
eventually form either a confederation or a federation; 19 percent
said they guess that the two sides will unify under a "one country,
two systems" formula; only 5.7 percent said they think the two sides
will unify through the use of military means; while 14.3 percent
said they still don't know how the current cross-strait deadlock
will be resolved.</P>
      <P>An in-depth analysis of the survey results further found that
most of the supporters of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said they don't think a cross-strait war will
erupt during Chen's presidency. Chen is a DPP stalwart, but he has
soft-pedaled his pro-independence stand since he won the March 18
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Poll results also show that the number of northern and central
Taiwan university students who support peaceful unification was 1.7
fold the number of those who prefer to see Taiwan move toward
independence.</P>
      <P>In contrast, southern Taiwan university students who support
Taiwan independence outnumbered those who back peaceful unification
by 3 percent, according to the survey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SENATE URGED TO CONSIDER PROPOSALS ON BEIJING PNTR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States Senate has been urged
to consider legislative proposals that would address such concerns as
mainland China's proliferation activities as it considers the bill
that would grant the mainland permanent normal trade relations.</P>
      <P>Larry M. Wortzel, director of the Asian Studies Center at the
Washington-based Heritage Foundation said on Friday that while the
House Resolution 4444 passed last week is the first step toward
granting PNTR to mainland China, "it will not resolve either the
specific and important differences that remain between the United
States and China on democratic values and individual liberties, or
serious concerns over China's proliferation activities."</P>
      <P>Indeed, he pointed out, granting PNTR will help make American
businesses more competitive in mainland China and increase trade,
help the mainland Chinese develop a system based on free enterprise,
and promote the development of a middle class in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"But these benefits of trade and the fact that Resolution 4444
deals with other issues must not overshadow the serious concerns that
continue to be expressed throughout America on China's proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction and other activities that undermine
regional stability and threaten US national security," said the
specialist.</P>
      <P>Wortzel added that the debate over PNTR highlighted the fact that
in the view of many Americans, not enough attention has been given to
Beijing's activities in other areas, such as religious freedoms,
democratic reforms, human rights, labor standards, and proliferation
activities.</P>
      <P>Until recently, he said, little parallel legislation had been
introduced in Congress to address mainland China's proliferation or
Beijing's habit of misusing controlled goods, services and "dual-use"
technology. Yet the evidence is growing that Beijing is using
civilian technology for military purposes or for purposes other than
that for which it had been purchased, he said.</P>
      <P>As Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) noted when introducing as
parallel legislation the China Proliferation Act together with Sen.
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) on May 25, "if China is going to be one of
our trading partners, it's not too much to require them to stop
providing weapons of mass destruction to countries who might someday
use them against us."</P>
      <P>Under the bill, any persons, groups or companies within mainland
China, including US persons doing business in mainland China, would
face immediate penalties if they violated international
nonproliferation treaties or agreements or US export control laws in
any way that contributes to proliferation.</P>
      <P>"While there is no perfect means either to detect cheating or to
deter noncompliance with agreements (by mainland China), the
Thompson-Torricelli bill would give the president the lever to press
when the United States does detect China's noncompliance or the
diversion of technology to inappropriate agents or uses," emphasized
Wortzel.</P>
      <P>In the past, he said, mainland China's leaders have managed to
dodge measures that were designed to address noncompliance. "This
bill is an attempt to resolve that problem. More important, its
non-trade punitive measures are consistent with the terms of the WTO
agreement that the Clinton administration recently signed with
China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLAN FOR DIRECT FUJIAN-TAIWAN LINK FOR PILGRIMS TO BE WORKED OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) promised on Friday to come up with a detailed plan within a
month for direct maritime links between Taiwan and mainland China's
Fujian Province for local pilgrims.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen told a group of Kuomintang
legislators from the "E-Generation Alliance" in the Legislative Yuan
that the council will consider an application from Taiwan pilgrims
for direct maritime links between the ports of Taichung, central
Taiwan, and Meizhou in Fujian Province, on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>In light of the bad weather which usually sweeps into the Taiwan
Strait after September, Tsai agreed to the legislators' demand to put
forward detailed plans for regulating such voyages within a month to
allow for a pilgrimage before the weather deteriorates.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the regulations will be designed to ensure that such
direct crossings are for purely religious purposes and do not
compromise Taiwan's security in any way.</P>
      <P>Taiwan forbids direct transportation links with mainland China
and travelers between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait currently
have to travel via a third country or area.</P>
      <P>This restriction has been challenged in recent years by local
followers of Matsu, a Chinese folk goddess enshrined by many temples
as a guardian of fishermen. Matsu followers, especial those
affiliated to Taichung's Chenlan Temple make an annual pilgrimage to
the traditional home of the goddess in Meizhou, and have long
demanded the right to travel directly across the strait to observe
the religious ritual.</P>
      <P>Their demands won favorable responses from candidates of various
political parties during the presidential election campaign earlier
this year, prompted the government to review its long-standing policy
of prohibiting direct trade, postal and transportation links with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In Friday's meeting, Tsai also agreed to put forward in six
months a draft plan to exempt the Taiwan-controlled frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu from the ban on direct links.</P>
      <P>A statue allowing Kinmen and Matsu to open direct trade and
shipping links with mainland China is already in place -- an attempt
to boost the sagging economy on the islands -- but detailed
arrangements to prevent the two islands from becoming a gateway for
Taiwan goods and passengers to and from mainland China is taking time
to hammer out.</P>
      <P>Tsai assured the legislators of the government's commitment to
direct links between the two frontline islands and the mainland, but
she cautioned that they cannot be opened without Beijing's
cooperation.</P>
      <P>She also asked the E-Generation Alliance members, who are slated
to visit mainland China on Wednesday, to rally behind the
government's mainland policy outlined by President Chen Shui-bian in
his inaugural speech that Taiwan is willing to work with mainland
China to sort out the issue of "one China."</P>
      <P>Instead of being bound by ideology, Tsai said, Chen's policy is
squarely based on pragmatism, which is also the principle that will
dictate the new administration's future policy toward the mainland.</P>

      <P>Hou Hsiao-hsien is as essential to

    <HEADLINE>ACTION PLAN TO ROOT OUT `BLACK GOLD' TO BE UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An action plan to eradicate "black gold"
politics -- government links with organized crime -- will be sent to
the Executive Yuan on Wednesday, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan said
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he presided over a meeting of related
government agencies on the eradication of black gold politics.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, the Ministry of Justice will push for
sunshine bills -- laws governing political donations, lobbying
activities and the avoidance of conflicts of interests among civil
servants -- so as to root out the practice of kickbacks and sever
government links with conglomerates.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry will also take reference from Hong Kong to
revise anti-graft regulations, which will require civil servants to
register their assets and subject them to punishment if they are
unable to give a plausible explanation of how they acquired
suspicious assets.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry will also take reference from the
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development and punish local
manufacturers who bribe foreign civil servants.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also learn from Hong Kong's success in setting
up an anti-corruption administration to coordinate the fight against
graft and corruption.</P>
      <P>The participants in Saturday's meeting, which included
representatives of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of
the Interior, the Ministry of the Transportation and Communications,
reached consensus on the crackdown on organized crime, consistent
efforts to eradicate graft, and the establishment of
anti-corruption administration.</P>
      <P>However, they remained divided on the issues of the national
registration of assets and the prevention of money-laundering.</P>
      <P>Yen Ta-ho, director of the Department of Prosecutorial Affairs,
said that participants have said that they hope to speed up the work
on the avoidance of conflicts of interests and the compulsory
entrustment of bonds and securities belonging to civil servants.</P>

the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing as soon as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US `SHUTTLING BETWEEN TWO SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT' MORE ACTIVELY: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official in charge of the Republic of
China's mainland China policy said on Saturday that the United States
has been shuttling between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait more
actively than it did four years ago.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), made the remarks when he spoke at a seminar titled: "Mainland
China and the Asia-Pacific region: Interchanges and Trends" at
National Sun Yat-Sen University in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United States has been shuttling back and forth across the
Taiwan Strait more actively that it did four years ago, Lin said. He
did not elaborate on his statement.</P>
      <P>He said that although the MAC has continued to send conciliatory
gestures of goodwill to the mainland since before Chen Shui-bian's
May 20 inauguration as president, Beijing has yet to respond
positively.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the mainland leadership seems to be
adopting a less-tough stance toward Taiwan, and noted that mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin in recent hotline talks with US
President Bill Clinton said that he has "no intention" of invading
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that Jiang's words were spoken in good
faith.</P>
      <P>He noted that political, economic and social changes in the
mainland have been faster than most people would have imagined. The
rapid growth in the number of mainland Internet users has also
increased the speed of the transformation process and has pushed the
mainland toward a more pluralistic society, pitting the authoritarian
communist regime against a never-before-encountered challenge, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although the mainland has censored news reports
about President Chen, the growing popularity of the Internet has
generated heated online debate about Taiwan in the mainland, with
some chat-room users asking why the mainland cannot follow Taiwan's
lead by holding democratic elections.</P>
      <P>He said that as a spate of problems has emerged in the mainland,
such as continued economic decline, growing social unrest, and
growing disagreement with the Beijing leadership, Beijing can be
expected to tighten its control of the people, step up its crackdown
on religious freedom, media and the democratic movement, and toughen
its stance toward Taiwan in the short term.</P>
      <P>But in the long term, he went on, these moves will only
facilitate the transformation of the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONSUMES `SECOND-HIGHEST AMOUNT' OF NATURAL RESOURCES: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new head of Taiwan's Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) on Saturday urged his fellow
countrymen to practice thrift to preserve the island's environment.</P>
      <P>Citing a 1998 Living Planet Report by the global conservation
organization Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), Lin said the people of
Taiwan consumed 3.4 times more natural resources than the world
average, second only behind Norway among 151 countries surveyed.</P>
      <P>Although the people in industrialized countries used 5.5 times
more natural resources in general than those in the developing
countries, Taiwan's per capita consumption was well ahead of the
United States, who came in sixth, with 2.74 times the worldwide
average. Japan was twelfth with 2.35 times the world's average per
capita consumption, and Germany was 34th. Mainland China was 60th,
and India ranked 87th, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The WWF Living Planet Report, which ranked the pressure the 151
countries created on their environments through consumption of grain,
fish, wood, water, cement and the emission of carbon dioxide, was the
first ever of its kind, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Compared with the world per capita average, Taiwan consumed 7.8
times more fish and 5.21 times more cement in 1998, and 3.16 times
more fish and 4.37 times more cement in 1999.</P>
      <P>Warning that Taiwan's excessive consumption has stretched its
natural resources to the limit, Lin said an economy which pursues
development without caring for the environment will undermine its
economic development because of the deterioration of its environment.</P>
      <P>Touting thrift as the key to conservation, Lin called on his
countrymen to pursue sustained economic development by taking into

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS OPPOSED TO `NATIONAL SECURITY TAX' PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers on Saturday warned the
government not to rashly levy a proposed "national security tax" on
Taiwan businessmen with operations in mainland China amid current
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang legislative whip Lin Chien-jung said he was strongly
opposed to such a proposal, and he reminded the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led administration of adverse political
implications which may arise from the move at a time when relations
between Taiwan and mainland China are facing a crucial change.</P>
      <P>Although he agreed that the implementation of such a tax might
have its benefits, Lin said the government must not make a reckless
decision on the issue but should first discuss the issue with the
legislature and obtain its approval before implementing any new
measures.</P>
      <P>Amid the present strained relations between Taiwan and the
mainland, the KMT lawmaker said levying such a tax would be very
likely to stir up unnecessary political pressure on Taiwan
businessmen in the mainland, and would further cast a shadow of
uncertainty over the future of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>"Such a situation will not be good for Taiwan, which is keen to
pursue stable progress," he stressed. He urged the government to
carefully and thoroughly study the issue, because "many Taiwan
businessmen are being squeezed by the governments on both sides of
the strait."</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after government spokeswoman Chung Chin said
earlier the same day that the government will not rule out the
possibility of drawing up a formal government policy based on a
proposal by S.M. Chen, designated vice governor for the Central Bank
of China, as part of its efforts to regulate Taiwan-mainland economic
activities.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chiu Chuang-liang, the People First Party (PFP) whip,
called on government officials to assess the issue within relevant
government systems.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the proposed plan is in effect a move aimed at
increasing taxes, Chiu contended that the issue must be dealt with
from a viewpoint of national finance, national security and the
cross-strait relationship.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, such an important national policy should be
first fully discussed by government policy-making authorities, and
public comments made rashly by government officials not directly
involved in the issue will only damage the mechanism of government.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislator also reminded the administration that the
implementation of such a highly sensitive policy would very probably
further undermine mutual trust and put Taiwan businessmen with
mainland operations in an even more difficult situation.</P>
      <P>Criticizing Chung and Chen for setting a bad example in publicly
commenting on a government policy not under their jurisdiction, Chiu
said relevant government agencies -- the Mainland Affairs Council,
the Finance Ministry and the National Security Bureau -- should take
charge of charting formal policy in this regard.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiu's view, PFP spokesman Liu Wen-hsiung said ranking
government appointees should not comment on government policy beyond
their administrative domains. He urged President Chen Shui-bian to
correct Chung and Chen for their inappropriate words.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the idea of levying a national security tax on
mainland-based Taiwan investors will not be seen as a friendly move
toward Beijing at a time when Taiwan is seeking to demonstrate its
goodwill to mainland China, Liu claimed that such a chaotic approach
by the new government will in turn negatively affect positive
exchanges between the two sides.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chenlan Temple in
Tahchia, Taichung County, announced on Sunday that it will lead a
large pilgrimage to mainland China's Fujian province on July 16,
initiating the first direct religious voyage across the Taiwan Strait
in five decades.</P>
      <P>Chenlan Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao said that he had performed
a divination rite at the temple Sunday morning, in which Matsu,
goddess of the sea, told him that the pilgrims should set sail on
July 16.</P>
      <P>He said that Matsu had informed him that the 7,000-member
pilgrimage should leave Taichung Harbor on July 16, sailing aboard a
fleet of fishing and tourism boats across the Taiwan Strait to
Meizhou, an island which is part of Fujian province, after making a
stopover on Kinmen, the ROC-controlled frontline island near mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Noting that making the pilgrimage to Meizhou to pay tribute to
Matsu in person is a dream of millions of Taoist believers at Chenlan
Temple, Yen said all the worshippers welcomed and appreciated
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen's recent
remarks that direct religious links with the mainland will be given
top priority in the new government's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Meizhou is located about 72 nautical miles across the Taiwan
Strait from Taichung, and is Matsu's legendary birthplace.</P>
      <P>Yen said he hopes the Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China, will approve the temple's application,
filed on May 23, as soon as possible so that its planned direct
voyage from Taichung to Meizhou can be made on schedule.</P>
      <P>Yen assured the government that Chenlan Temple has ample
experience in handling religious pilgrimages and gatherings of
several hundreds of thousands of worshippers over the past nearly 100
years, and is confident in its ability to conduct the first-ever
cross-strait religious voyage.</P>
      <P>Yen also serves as speaker of Taichung County Council, and has
campaigned for direct shipping links between Taichung and Fujian
province for the past two years.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's printed circuit board manufacturers
will attend an industry summit in Tokyo, Japan, on June 8 to discover
new opportunities for cooperation in the future.</P>
      <P>The Sino-Japanese summit is to be co-sponsored by Taiwan's China

      <P>According to CETRA, Japan's gradual outsourcing of printed
circuit boards in recent years and mainland China's vast cellular
phone market are both factors favorable for Taiwan manufacturers to
seek out cooperative alliances with Japanese companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's third largest supplier of printed circuit
boards, after the United States and Japan. Production value in Taiwan
reached US$3.6 billion last year, or about 10 percent of the world's

old. There are a total of 364,688 vets who are over 65 years of age,
accounting for 19.5 percent of the nation's elderly.</P>
      <P>He also said the commission is now taking measures to grant
veteran status to conscripts who took part in the "August 23 Battle,"
a major cross-strait battle during which mainland China fired
hundreds of thousands shells on Kinmen in 1958. The commission also
plans to grant the same status to members of Kinmen's self-defense
force, local residents who fought in the same battle.</P>
      <P>He said that the number of retired servicemen grows by about
6,000 every year, and the total number of 567,864 is not expected to
vary greatly from one year to next.</P>
      <P>Yang also said that there are currently 14 veterans' homes,
accommodating 13,650 men. Though these facilities offer beautiful
scenery, they are mostly dilapidated, he said, adding that the
veterans are forced to live in cramped quarters, with each only
enjoying 13.38 square meters of space, not up to the standards of
homes for the elderly.</P>
      <P>The commission is now trying to improve the facilities of the
veterans' homes under a four-year plan, and give them more space to
improve their living environment.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, he said that the commission will efficiently use
its communications network to visit the veterans to learn about their
living conditions. He added that it will prioritize the care of poor,
sick, and disabled veterans, as well as those without families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIBETAN/MONGOLIAN AFFAIRS SUGGESTED AS BASIS FOR RESUMED DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official of the Cabinet-level
Mongolian &amp; Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) suggested on Sunday
that negotiators from across the Taiwan Strait resume their
long-stalled dialogue by first talking about Tibetan and Mongolian
affairs.</P>
      <P>MTAC Secretary-General Liu Hsueh-chao said that Tibetan and
Mongolian affairs can be a good basis for reopening the cross-strait
dialogue. Talks between the two sides have been suspended since June
1995 after Republic of China (ROC) President Lee Teng-hui made a
landmark visit to the United States, which Beijing viewed as a move
to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with the mainland, Koo Chen-fu, who is
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), met with his
mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of the quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Singapore in
late April of 1993, a landmark meeting that broke the ice between top
negotiators after an impasse of more than four decades.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang meeting has since been considered the first official
cross-strait dialogue in the history of the thorny relations between
the two sides. The official dialogue, however, was unilaterally and
indefinitely suspended by Beijing in 1995.</P>
      <P>Although Koo visited Shanghai and Beijing in October 1998 and met
with Wang during the trip, the rendezvous was informal and was not
considered by either side as a second Koo-Wang meeting or a
resumption of the official cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Liu said officials from either side can meet to discuss issues
concerning Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>Taipei can also take the initiative of sponsoring cross-strait
seminars on Mongolian, Tibetan and Xinjiang affairs so as to reach
consensus between the two sides on certain issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said that the government should retain the
organization and function of the MTAC so as to dispel Beijing's fear
and suspicion that Taiwan is seeking independence, since according to
the ROC Constitution, Mongolia and Tibet are ROC territory.</P>

Township, Taoyuan County, on Sunday.</P>
      <P>He pointed out the need to discard one's ego so as to see facts

left the Presidential Office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Security was tight at the church, and church goers were barred
from shaking hands with Lee. The unusual security measures were taken

      <P>A civilian alliance to promote the
establishment of a National Human Rights Commission unveiled on
Sunday their draft version of the commission's organic law.</P>
      <P>The National Human Rights Commission Promotion Alliance consists
of 22 human rights, judicial reform, social movement, and attorneys'
organizations that aim to help President Chen Shui-bian make good on
his inauguration promise of establishing such a commission.</P>
      <P>The alliance's draft law included 21 articles that describe the
commission's place in the government, its responsibilities, powers,
and membership.</P>
      <P>The draft advocated a commission that answers directly to the
presidential office, similar to Academia Sinica, the premier research
institution in the country. The draft also stated that the commission
should be supra-partisan with the authority to plan its own budget so
as to guarantee its independence.</P>
      <P>The commission's suggested responsibilities and powers include
the investigation of major cases of human rights violations and
systematic research aimed at coming up with proposals for amendments
to the constitution and laws to bring the nation in line with
international human rights standards.</P>
      <P>Other suggested commission activities include the promotion of
human rights education, regular compilation of national human rights
reports, and the pursuit of cooperative exchanges with domestic and
foreign organizations.</P>
      <P>The draft proposed that the executive, judicial, and legislative
branches all share the rights to select commission members, who
should be experts and scholars from the public sector.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada has approved a new drug to treat
an eye disease blamed for most blindness in people over age 50.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common eye disease
associated with aging. It gradually destroys sharp, central vision.</P>
      <P>The medication, called Visudyne, was co-developed by CIBA Vision
and Vancouver-based QLT Inc. Visudyne is injected into a patient's
arm, then activated by shining a laser into the eye.</P>
      <P>Researchers say it could be used by people suffering from AMD,
including as many as 20,000 new cases of "wet AMD" -- the less-common
form of the disease.</P>
      <P>Patients with the disease lose their ability to read and
recognize faces in as little as two months.</P>
      <P>Approval of the drug comes after two studies on 609 patients in
eight countries, including Canada. Researchers say 67 percent of AMD
patients treated with Visudyne lost less than three lines of vision
on a standard eye chart over two years, compared with 39 percent of
the control group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' ARE PRIORITY OF CHEN ADMINISTRATION: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu,  Fujian  Province,  June  4 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday that establishing the
"mini three links" will be a priority of the new government under the
leadership of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief made the remarks after arriving in Matsu on Sunday
morning for a whirlwind visit in company of Lin Yi-fu, vice minister
of economic affairs, Wu Jung-kwei, director of the Navigation and
Aviation Department of the Ministry of Transport and Communications,
and Liu Teh-hsuen, director of the political and legal department of
the MAC.</P>
      <P>Tsai and her entourage visited the Matsu Defense Command (MDC),
where they were briefed by officials on the current status of Matsu's
military defense. They later visited with officials of the government
of Lienchiang County, who briefed them on port facilities in Matsu.</P>
      <P>Tsai also met with local residents to hear their opinions on the
proposed "mini three links" -- direct trade, transport and
communications between Kinmen or Matsu and coastal cities of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Liu of Lienchiang County recommended that the new government
amend several inadequate regulations to enable the implementation of
the "mini three links", which he said are sorely needed by residents
of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the Lienchiang County government has already drawn
up a temporary statute for commercial links between the Matsu area
and mainland China. The legislation is subject to approval by the
Central Government.</P>
      <P>In return, Tsai said that she and President Chen Shui-bian have
repeatedly expressed the government's position toward the three links
issue. Prior to implementing the three links between Taiwan proper
and mainland China, the government will allow the "mini three links"
between the frontier islands and mainland China. However, she said
that no timetable has been set for establishing them.</P>
      <P>As the implementation of the initial links will be one of the new
government's priorities, she said that she expects them to be in
place by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>She also promised to amend any inadequate laws or regulations so
as to normalize commerce between Matsu and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsai and her entourage also visited the airports on Nankan and
Peikan Islands to get an idea of the facilities' capacity for
handling passengers. The airport expansion project was underway.</P>
      <P>Tsai returned to Taiwan on Sunday afternoon after attending a
symposium with local residents.</P>
      <P>Tsai had previously visited Kinmen accompanied by Gen. Teng
Tzu-lin, director general of the Political Welfare Department of the
Ministry of National Defense, as well as officials from ministries
of Economic Affairs and Transport and Communications. They also
toured defensive fortifications there, and observed Kinmen's port
facilities prior to the opening of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Tsai had kept a low profile on her Kinmen trip due to the
sensitive nature of cross-strait relations. Tsai and her entourage
flew into Kinmen on a military airplane, which stopped at a military
apron to avoid publicity.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Chu Kai-sheng, the commander of Kinmen's defense forces,
was only informed about Tsai's confidential trip on the previous day.</P>
      <P>After being briefed on the military situation on Kinmen by Kinmen
Defense Command officials, Tsai visited the ports at Shuitou and
Liaolowan to inspect the facilities and assess their
passenger-handling capacities.</P>
      <P>Tsai reiterated the government determination to implement the
"mini three links" prior to implementing the direct three links
between the mainland and Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tzai suggested that a
cross-strait consultation center be established in Kinmen and
military observers be stationed on both sides so as to establish
mutual trust.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that Kinmen can serve as a hub for mainland
Chinese people traveling to and from the ROC. He further suggested
that Kinmen be partially opened for mainland Chinese visitors, and
that a special economic zone be established in Kinmen.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei's failure to embrace the
National Unification Guidelines in his first administrative report
will not help enhance national security, an official of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Department of Mainland
Affairs Research, said that although President Chen Shui-bian had
said in his inaugural speech that the National Unification Council
and National Unification Guidelines will not be scrapped, whether or
not he will actually follow them has come into question.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Tang had not followed the lead of past KMT
premiers by reaffirming that he would stick to the National
Unification Guidelines. He said that this shows that with the change
of political power, the guidelines which have pointed the way for the
nation's mainland policy over the years will be put aside.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Chen has not strongly rejected the National
Unification Council and National Unification Guidelines, out of
consideration of national security and stable cross-strait relations.
The KMT official added that Chen's attitude has become remarkably
passive in comparison to the past, when he was the standard bearer of
the opposition pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chang urged Tang to insist on his ideals when he agreed to work
under Chen as premier, adding that Tang had said at the time that he
was accepting the offer to serve the country amid "tense and stark"
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Tang should have his own ideas about improving
cross-strait ties, and not to be confined by Chen's attitude toward
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also said that the democratic development in Taiwan has
reached a level where every step of the development of cross-strait
relations will have to be agreed by the public, and he urged Premier
Tang to stick to his ideas in improving cross-strait ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WELCOMES AUSTRALIA TO BID FOR LNG CONTRACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Darwin,  Australia,  June 4 (CNA)
(By Chin-ling Chi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is welcome to compete
in Taiwan's open bid for supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG),
Republic of China Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said here on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile ahead
of a key meeting of trade ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, Lin told his Australian counterpart that
Australian companies are welcome to compete in open bidding to sell
LNG to Taiwan, which will consider product quality and price, freight
costs, and the quality of after-sale service when granting the
contract.</P>
      <P>Australian LNG (ALNG), an alliance of six major Australian LNG
companies, is poised to bid for a NT$400 billion (US$13 billion)
25-year contract to be offered by Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).
The LNG will be supplied for use in thermo-power generation at
Taipower's new Tahtan Power Plant, which is expected to have an
installation capacity of 4 megawatts when fully operational. The
plant will need about NT$18 billion (US$0.58 billion) worth of LNG
fuel per year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin also exchanged views with Vaile on the fifth vice
economic and trade ministers meeting between Taiwan and Australia,
which is scheduled to be held July 27-28 in Taipei, and on E-IAP
(electronic individual action plan) talks under the APEC framework.</P>
      <P>Vaile, who will chair the APEC trade ministers' meeting on
efforts to build momentum to relaunch a new round of World Trade
Organization (WTO) talks, said Australia fully supports Taiwan's
early accession to the WTO.</P>
      <P>In return, Lin suggested that both sides develop a
ministerial-level communication channel for useful dialogue to
further bolster bilateral business and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lin also urged that Australia increase its purchases from Taiwan
as Australia has long enjoyed a surplus in two-way trade between the
two countries. In 1999, Taiwan exported US$1.92 billion worth of
products to Australia while it imported US$2.68 billion worth of
commodities from Australia, suffering a deficit of US$760 million.</P>
      <P>APEC is composed of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, mainland
China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico,
New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia,
Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam. The APEC
economies account for more than 80 percent of the world's total gross
domestic product and 45 percent of total global trade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is not planning to impose a
security tax on cross-strait business and trade and on individuals
dealing in this sector, Taiwan's top economic planner said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, the newly-installed chairman of the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said he
personally opposes the idea of a security tax and will oppose any
government move to support the initiative.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to legislators questions at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong, also at the
Legislative Yuan, said the imposition of a security tax was only an
opinion expressed by an academic and was far from being a government
policy.</P>
      <P>Shea said that Chen Shih-meng, who is presently a professor in
National Taiwan University's Department of Economics, first made the
security tax proposal while talking about cross-strait business and
trade last month.</P>
      <P>Shea added that the proposal was simply an idea put forth by a
scholar and has nothing to do with the Ministry of Finance or the
government's overall policy.</P>
      <P>Chen has been appointed as deputy governor of the Central Bank of

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR HAS NO INTENTION OF RUNNING FOR KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said on Monday
that he will not seek to serve concurrently as the party chairman of
the Kuomintang because he believes the post is a full-time job that
requires one hundred percent devotion.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an interview with a local radio
station in the wake of Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh's registration as
the sole candidate for the party chairmanship of the Democratic
Progressive Party last Friday, prompting speculation that Ma might be
considering a similar move.</P>
      <P>Ma categorically said he will not seek the position of KMT
chairman, adding that he supports the acting KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
who maintains a "moderate" stance, as the candidate for party
chairman and in his efforts to push for party reform.</P>
      <P>Ma said the KMT's situation is different from that of the DPP,
saying that the KMT has a lot of reform work to do and the future KMT
chairman will have to be able to devote his full energies to the
post.</P>
      <P>The popular Taipei mayor has been viewed as a possible candidate
who might be able to revitalize the KMT after its humiliating defeat
in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>But Ma, who has never taken the initiative in seeking support for
his job as a KMT Central Committee member or as a Central Standing
Committee member over the years, said that this time he will
actively solicit support in his KMT Central Standing Committee member
election bid in order to promote his reform ideals.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the most important task for the KMT at the
provisional meeting of the party's congress later this month is
reform of the party charter so as to pave way for the selection of
party chairman through direct election, as well as a nationwide
registration of its members.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he was "cautiously optimistic" about the prospects
for real reform within the KMT.</P>
      <P>Ma said that reform of the party only began after the election
defeat, and completion of the task will require time, adding that as
long as the party revises its charter to allow for the direct
election of its party chairman to reflect the true voice of its
members, the party will gradually come out of the shadow of its
humiliating loss.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA TRYING TO CURB ONLINE DISSENT</HEADLINE>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's Ministry for Public
Security has drawn up a black list of websites in an attempt to curb
online political dissent, reported the Australian Financial Review on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Internet service providers in China have been warned that they
risk losing their licenses if they do not block access to the
blacklisted sites. The internet cafes now found in almost every city
and town in China have also been warned by the ministry that they
will be closed if their customers are found to be reading the
reactionary material.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Beijing's move against such online dissent is
in response to the increasing use of the internet by groups
expressing anti-government messages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chinese authorities over recent weeks have used more
traditional measures to ensure that the 11th anniversary of the 1989
Tiananmen Square massacre passed as quietly as possible, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a Beijing newspaper as saying that more than
1300 people have been detained in the capital over the past few weeks
for not carrying official identity papers. Amnesty International also
reported last week that 213 people remain in prison or on medical
parole in connection with the 1989 massacre.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WILL CONTINUE PURSUIT OF UN REPRESENTATION: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Republic of China government will
continue pursuing representation in the United Nations, Foreign
Minister Tien Hung-mao said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Tien said the ROC's UN bid is critical to the country's status,
rights and interests in the international community.</P>
      <P>"Although our UN bid has failed to make the agenda of the
annual UN General Assembly plenary session over the past six years
because of mainland China's opposition, we will not be daunted by the
setback," Tien said, adding that the ROC's goal of seeking UN
representation remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>From 1994, the ROC's diplomatic allies presented a proposal to
the UN Secretariat annually asking the UN General Assembly to form a
special task force to study the issue related to Taiwan's UN
representation. The proposal, however, was consistently killed at
the Steering Committee discussion and failed to make the General
Assembly agenda due to mainland China's boycott.</P>
      <P>Tien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has begun
planning for this year's UN bid. "The ministry is also scheduled to
call a meeting between late June and early July to discuss in which
way or form the ROC will re-join the United Nations," Tien said,
adding that scholars, experts and legislators will be invited to
explained their opinions at the planned meeting.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a UN founding member, was forced out of the United
Nations in 1971 when the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution No.
2758 which gave the China seat to Beijing at the expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tien said the MOFA will continue seeking a way for the 23
million ROC nationals' voices being heard in the United Nations.
"We will also actively explore feasible measures for the ROC to take
part in activities of various UN affiliates," he added.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-minister further said the new ROC government
will use new thinking to promote "comprehensive pragmatic diplomacy"
based on the existing foundations.</P>
      <P>Tien said since the ROC upholds democracy and freedom, it
must promote "human rights diplomacy" and "democracy diplomacy"
through actively helping other members of the international
community improve their human rights conditions and creating a
climate conducive for peace and democratic development around the
world.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC's private sector has rich manpower and
material resources, Tien said the MOFA will strengthen cooperate with
civilian organizations in expanding the country's diplomatic
frontiers and cementing cooperation with as many other countries as
possible.</P>
      <P>"To reach this goal, the MOFA will assist private groups in
joining non-governmental international organizations and developing
'Track' II unofficial dialogue and exchanges mechanism," Tien said.</P>
      <P>In formulating the country's diplomatic policy and action plans,
Tien said the MOFA will encourage private think tanks, social groups
or individual members of the public to offer advice as reference.
"The MOFA also plans to conduct opinion surveys to solicit and
integrate public opinions on major diplomatic topics as reference
for future foreign policy adjustments."</P>
      <P>Tien went on to say that he will endeavor to be a
"hard-working, pragmatic and forward-looking" foreign minister and
that youthfulness and professionalism will be guiding principles
in rejuvenating the country's diplomatic work force.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibilities of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu visiting other countries or attending
international meetings, Tien said the MOFA will do its utmost to
help the country's top leaders realize their overseas travel plans
so long as it receives an order.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's consistent attempts to isolate the ROC in
the international community, it has been difficult for senior ROC
leaders to visit countries with which the ROC does not maintain
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>As for the feasibility of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
stopping "zero-sum" diplomatic competition for winning diplomatic
allies, Tien said a cross-strait "diplomatic truce" is unlikely until
after the current cross-strait logjam sees a breakthrough and
bilateral relations make progress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO CONTINUE PRESSURING TAIWAN BUSSINESSMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, June 5(CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will continue putting pressure on
Taiwan businessmen to renounce any Taiwan independence sentiment
because it thinks the same tactic of "mixing politics with business"
worked with regard to former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten, the
South China Morning Post reported today.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a mainland source as saying that the Beijing
leadership was convinced the "mischief" perpetrated by Patten - a
reference to his efforts to promote democracy in Hong Kong - was
contained because Beijing was able to oblige most Hong Kong
businessmen to at least dissociate themselves with the last governor.</P>
      <P>The source revealed that forcing Taiwan businessmen to declare
support for the "one China" policy would remain a major policy on
reunification ahead of the annual series of informal leadership
meetings in the seaside resort of Beidaihe, scheduled to begin in
early to mid-August.</P>
      <P>"Politburo members, regional leaders and other senior cadres
attending the Beidaihe meetings will make a new assessment on
(Republic of China President) Chen Shui-bian," the source was quoted
as saying.</P>
      <P>"They will decide whether tougher measures, including
quasi-military means such as missile tests close to Taiwan, are
called for."</P>
      <P>According to the report, President Jiang and his advisers are
satisfied with the intimidation tactics applied to Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>"Through intermediaries, including influential SAR tycoons, the
heads of most of the big Taiwan companies investing on the mainland
have told Beijing they will not support pro-independence policies,"
the report pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao
confirmed media reports on Monday that Presidential Secretary-General
Chang Chung-hsiung will not be able to attend the funeral of late
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian, due to the wishes of the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Tien said that his ministry will officially relay the Republic of
China government's regrets to the Japanese government and that
President Chen will announce a replacement to attend the funeral
later the same day.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks while answering questions at a
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chung Ming-yao, former ROC representative to Japan and current
National Security Council secretary-general, has been rumored to be a
possible replacement for Chang in attending Obuchi's funeral.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chang said that President Chen also had
expressed regrets about the Japanese government's decision.</P>
      <P>Chang said that such a highly politically-motivated move is not
conducive to positive exchanges between Taiwan and Japan, and added
that it is probably not something that the Japanese public supports.
He also said that the Japanese government was too "sensitive" about
an internal affair like this.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire services, the Japanese government is
slated to hold a public funeral on June 8 for Obuchi, who died last
month due to heart problems. Major world politicians, including US
President Bill Clinton, will attend the services.</P>
      <P>President Chen had originally appointed Legislative Speaker Wang
Jin-ping, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu and Chang
to represent him at the services. But Chang's presence has not been
welcomed by the Japanese government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO DEAL WITH FUTURE 'ONE CHINA' ON EXISTING FOUNDATIONS: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is willing to
deal with the question of a future "one China" based on all existing
foundations, President Chen Shui-bian said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed out that the existing foundations refer to all
agreements, consensus or conclusions reached through dialogue and
contacts between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the past.</P>
      <P>Noting that both sides of the Taiwan Strait are obliged to
jointly face the question of a future "one China," Chen said the ROC
is hopeful that the two sides can forge a consensus based on these
existing foundations.</P>
      <P>The ROC's first opposition leader-turned-president made the
statements while meeting with a delegation from the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think
tank.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by new CSIS President John J. Hamre,
arrived in Taipei on Sunday to attend a roundtable meeting on the
new challenges of the new millennium, to be sponsored by Taipei's
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC).</P>
      <P>President Chen said it is of great significance that the
roundtable meeting will open on Wednesday now that the ROC has
completed its first democratic peaceful transfer of power between
different political parties and that cross-strait relations are at a
critical juncture.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the greatest difference between the two sides
of the strait lies in the ROC's upholding of such universal
values as democracy and human rights, adding that the ROC will play
a more active role in safeguarding and promoting human rights in the
new century.</P>
      <P>Noting that improvement of cross-strait ties are conducive to
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, Chen said goodwill
and sincerity are needed to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He further said his May 20 inaugural speech highlighted three
basic principles -- national dignity, democracy and goodwill. In his
widely watched inaugural address, Chen also made the assurances that
so long as mainland China has no intention of using force against
Taiwan, his administration will uphold a "four noes" policy and will
also not abolish the ROC's existing National Unification Guidelines
and National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>The "four noes" policy refers to no declaration of Taiwan
independence, no changes to the ROC's national title, no inclusion
of the controversial "special state-to-state relationship" concept
into the ROC's constitution and no plebiscite on the
"independence/unification" issue.</P>
      <P>"My assurances signify my administration's unbiased openness
toward the direction of future cross-strait relations. We have no
bias and are willing to deal with the question of a future 'one
China' on the current foundations," President Chen said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that US President Bill Clinton's recent
emphasis on a fourth principle for resolving cross-strait issues --
any solution must have the consent of the people of Taiwan -- is
very important.</P>
      <P>"Since the ROC has become a full-fledged democracy, it must
respect the free will and choice of its people. Taiwan people have
legitimate rights to choose and decide on Taiwan's future," the
president emphasized.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed the ROC's determination to resolve cross-strait
disputes by peaceful means. "The most urgent task for the moment is
resumption of cross-strait dialogue. We are ready to resume talks
and negotiations with mainland china. Now, the ball is in Beijing's
court. We hope Beijing can make a positive response to our
goodwill."</P>
      <P>Chen also said he hopes private US think tanks, like the CSIS,
can help forge "Track II" or "Track III" unofficial contacts between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and between Taipei and
Washington to make for the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA GOV'T URGED TO KEEP REALISTIC TIES WITH US ON TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Australian Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fisher on Monday urged the Australian government to maintain
purposeful and realistic relations with the United States,
particularly on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>In an article on The Australian on Monday, Fisher said the ugly
side of ties between Canberra and Washington can be seen in US
demands that Australia make a commitment on the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>"Defense adviser in Washington Dick Armitage said in September
last year that the US would expect Australia to help out with the
dirty work in conflict with China over Taiwan," Fisher said.</P>
      <P>"It would be far better for more energy to be put into developing
confidence building measures across the Taiwan Straits and also urge
restraint, as (Prime Minister) John Howard has done recently," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Might I point out that since the Union Jack came down on Hong
Kong, there have been direct flights between China and Chinese
Taipei, and they sky has not fallen in?" he said.</P>
      <P>"Clearly Australia should maintain a purposeful relationship with
the US, and with China and all of the members of APEC," he said,
adding "We will best do this with a clear-sighted and realistic
approach that examines every aspect of the Australia-US relationship,
including the good, the bad and the ugly."</P>
      <P>He said that the good side of relations between the US and
Australia was manifested by the "breakthrough when the US House of
Representatives abolished the annual renewal of China's most-favoured
nation status."</P>
      <P>The US move will prove to be good for Australia, Fisher said.
"When permanent normal trade relations are confirmed by the US
Senate, it will not only be a win-win situation for the US and China,
but also indirectly for Australia as it moves China's application
forward to become a member of the World Trade Organization," Fisher
said.</P>
      <P>Another sore point between the two nations is the new US$15
billion farms subsidy package being handed out by the US government
to bolster American farm exports, he said, adding that the subsidies
will put Australia in a bad position to compete in the global market.</P>
      <P>"The US has set a bad example and will prompt other countries to
think hard about how long they can maintain a non-direct subsidy
approach," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO DRASTIC CHANGE ON 'GO SLOW' POLICY: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will
shortly host a meeting of local petrochemical and wafer
manufacturers to discuss easing current restrictions on investment in
the mainland, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA had originally planned a meeting on Monday to discuss
revising the principles governing Taiwan firms investing or engaging
cooperative technology development in the mainland. Many had viewed
the meeting as the forerunner of a drastic adjustment of the nation's
"go slow, be patient" policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>But the MOEA announced on Monday that the meeting had been
canceled because of insufficient preparations. Instead, the ministry
will invite related manufacturers for a discussion within the next
two weeks.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui imposed the "go slow, be patient"
policy toward the mainland in 1996, banning local manufacturers from
investing in infrastructure construction in mainland China, and
subjecting all investments to a cap of US$50 million for each
investment project.</P>
      <P>Lin said that whether to allow petrochemical and wafer
manufacturers to invest in the mainland has yet to be decided, and
whether to raise the ceiling on each investment project to more than
US$50 million is also still up in the air. He added that the minister
will now invite related manufacturers to jointly map out an overall
strategy.</P>
      <P>The new government had said earlier that it would ease the
restrictions as a goodwill gesture toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the loosening of current restrictions on investment
in the mainland should be done gradually. He noted that the
possibility of drastic change in the policy is not high at present,
since moving too quickly would use up Taiwan's leverage on the issue
too soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD HEAD HOPES 'MINI THREE LINKS' IN PLACE BY YEAR END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The country's top economic planning chief
voiced the hope on Monday that the "mini three links" between
Taiwan-controlled outlying islands and mainland China would be in
place by this year, while making it clear that he is opposed to a
"national security tax" plan.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs
and Energy committee, Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) Chairman Chen Pao-chih said he hopes that direct trade,
transport and postal links between offshore islands and mainland
China could be set up by the end of this year, as relevant government
agencies have been actively working on the issue.</P>
      <P>"As not too many laws and regulations are involved in legalizing
the issue, the 'mini three links' are expected to be established by
the end of the year," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD chief, the "mini three links" should focus
on helping the outlying islands -- Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu --
develop their economies, while preventing a detrimental impact on
Taiwan's overall economy.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that clandestine trade has long existed between
remote islands and the mainland, and expressed his hope that
regulating such practices would help develop the local economies on
the outlying islands.</P>
      <P>However, he elaborated that under the "mini three links"
framework, mainland-made products will be only allowed to enter the
outlying islands, while they cannot be transported from those islands
to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, it would make those offshore islands a distribution
center of mainland Chinese goods for Taiwan proper, a situation which
is tantamount to an opening of the 'three direct links' between
Taiwan and the mainland," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said he is in favor of the allowing a "direct
religious voyage" between Taiwan and mainland China, while voicing
his disagreement to a proposed "national security tax" on Taiwan
businessmen operating in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO LIFT BAN ON EXCHANGES OF HIGH-LEVEL VISITS WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu said on
Monday that the Republic of China looks forward to seeing the United
States lift its ban on the exchanges of high-level visits between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lu, the ROC's first female vice president, made the call during
a meeting with a delegation from the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>Lu said the ROC neither opposes Washington-Beijing engagement nor
objects to US granting of permanent normal trade relations to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said, the ROC earnestly hopes that the United
States can adopt "five measures" to further strengthen bilateral
ties and help improve relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"First of all, we hope that the US government will allow its
senior officials to visit Taiwan and also opens its door to top ROC
leaders," said the political dissident-turned-politician.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to suggest that the United States rearrange the
order of priority of the three pillars of its so-called "one China"
policy by emphasizing "peaceful solution" to cross-strait disputes
as the most important principle. At present, the US government
places the "one China" concept at the first place.</P>
      <P>Third, Lu said she is hopeful that US President Bill Clinton
can issue a statement before the end of his presidential term
reaffirming the US stance on peaceful solution to cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, Lu
said the United States should continue selling defensive weapons to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fifth, Lu said she hopes the United Sates can play a more active
role in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait ties, Lu said Taiwan and mainland China
share very special relations because they are both "remote relatives
and close neighbors."</P>
      <P>In addition to geographic proximity, Lu said, the people on both
sides of the strait share common ancestral and cultural links as
many Taiwan people hailed from the mainland. Against this backdrop,
Lu said the people on both sides should be friendly toward each
other.</P>
      <P>"However, in the political arena, the two sides have great
differences and mainland Chinese authorities have never expressed
goodwill toward the people of Taiwan and have not tried to
understand their thinking and opinions," Lu noted.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president further said the transition of the
reins of power from the Kuomintang, Taiwan ruling party for the
past 55 years, to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
should mark an end to previous cross-strait tension and animosity.</P>
      <P>"The DPP administration does not want to confront with mainland
China but instead wants peace and friendship ," Lu said, adding that
the people of Taiwan love peace and democracy.</P>
      <P>Lu, a DPP stalwart, also said Taiwan can serve as a beacon to
guide mainland China's future development.</P>
      <P>For his part, CSIS President John Hamre said he also hopes that
cross-strait issues can be resolved through peaceful dialogue, adding
he believes that the next two years are crucial to the development of
future cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Hamre and two CSIS project directors -- Richard Fairbanks and
Gerrit Gong -- arrived in Taipei on Sunday to attend a roundtable
meeting on the new challenges for the new millennium, scheduled to
open on Wednesday.</P>

      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said
on Monday that a summit between the leaders of Taiwan and mainland
China is possible within the coming four years, and that he would be
very willing to help forge such a meeting.</P>
      <P>Japan's Sankei Shimbun reported Lee as saying he would be willing
to help bring about such a meeting, and that he would also be
prepared to play the role of mediator with Beijing when necessary,
which the daily newspaper said indicated his wish to serve as an
envoy for the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>In the face of the current suspension of regular talks between
Taiwan and mainland China, Lee said that a cross-strait task force
should be set up to work out common ground between the two sides, the
newspaper reported.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of social development, Lee said national
interests should take precedence over any political party's
interests, especially when touching on matters of national concern.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan must stamp out its "black gold" politics
if it is to pursue continued progress, while the well-being of the
people, as well as the safety of their lives and property, are the
most important issues facing the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT SAILING FOR PILGRIMS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   5   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said on Monday that no timetable for opening direct
sailing across the Taiwan Strait for religious pilgrimage is
available at the moment.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
was responding to a press report that the council will unveil a
solution to the "direct cross-strait sailing for pilgrims" issue
within one month.</P>
      <P>"The report is not correct," the MAC said in a three-point press
release. For one thing, the MAC said the feasibility of the proposal
is still under initial evaluation and that no timetable has been set
for unveiling a conclusion of the study.</P>
      <P>Second, the MAC said the evaluation is not for any specific
religious organization.</P>
      <P>Third, the MAC urged local people not to start preparations for
direct cross-strait pilgrimage sailing before the government
finalizes its evaluation and comes to a decision.</P>
      <P>The Taoist Chenlan Temple in Tachia, Taichung County in
central Taiwan filed an application with the MAC last month for
permission to direct cross-strait sailing for religious pilgrimage.</P>
      <P>The Chenlan Temple is dedicated to the Chinese Goddess of Sea,
commonly known as Matsu in Chinese society. Many local Matsu
followers like to make a pilgrimage to a Matsu temple in Meizhou, a
small islet off the coast of southeastern mainland province of
Fujian. As Taiwan bans direct cross-strait shipping services, local
pilgrims usually have to waste much money and time for traveling to
Meizhou via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>The Chenlan Temple plans to lease a Singaporean passenger ship to
directly transport pilgrims to Meizhou from Taichung Harbor
by making a stopover either at Taiwan-controlled frontline
island of Kinmen or the offshore county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>Chenlan Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao announced on Sunday that
the temple has tentatively decided to start the pilgrimage on July
16.</P>
      <P>However, Fu Tung-cheng, director of the MAC's economic affairs
division, stressed that the MAC is studying the issue not because of
the Chenlan Temple's application.</P>
      <P>"We are making an overall evaluation of all similar cross-strait
pilgrimage sailing," Fu said, adding that the MAC has not set any
timetable for finalizing the evaluation.</P>
      <P>If the feasibility study gets a positive conclusion, Fu said,
the MAC will then begin to mull concrete measures for opening direct
cross-strait sailing for religious purposes.</P>
      <P>"We hope private religious groups will not hold unrealistic or
too optimistic expectations of the study result," Fu said, adding
that for the sake of ensuring national security, the MAC hopes
local religious groups will cooperate with the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chenlan Temple Chairman Yen, also Taichung County
speaker, said on Monday that without the MAC's approval, his temple
will not make direct cross-strait pilgrimage sailing to Meizhou.</P>

      <P>With the approach of the Dragon Boat
Festival, one of the most important holidays in the lunar calendar,
various traditional and innovative glutinous rice dumplings, or
Tzungtzu, have hit the market.</P>
      <P>The United Evening News reported that one gold shop in Lukang,

leaves made of gold which are used to wrap the traditional tzungtzu
ingredients -- glutinous rice, meat, and dried mushrooms.</P>
      <P>According to the goldsmith, if you do not mind missing the unique
flavor of bamboo leaves, they are actually more suitable for the
dish, "because they transmit heat quickly and do not get cold so
quickly" as normal, albeit cheaper versions.</P>
      <P>The golden tzungtzu sells for NT$50,000 (US$1,620) each,
which the shop owner claimed is "not too expensive if you consider
that gold tzungtzu leaves can be re-used every year."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker on Monday urged the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to form a
special task force to assist in search for a gravel ship which has
lost contact for more than three months.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an of the newly formed opposition People
First Party said the Hualien No. 1 gravel ship left the Hualien
Harbor in eastern Taiwan at 5 p.m. on Feb. 28, with 21 crew members
and 5,380 tons of gravel on board.</P>
      <P>The freighter, owned by Taiwan's Eastern Shipping Co., was
originally scheduled to arrive at the northern Taiwan port of
Tamshui at 7 a.m. Feb. 29, but it failed to arrive on time. The
ship owner tried to contact its crew, but to no avail. The military
has assisted in search and rescue operations, but no trace or clue
has so far been discovered.</P>
      <P>Lee said a lack of vertical contacts among relevant government
agencies has made "search and rescue work" even more difficult.</P>
      <P>Lee said many questions surrounding the incident. "I couldn't
understand why its crew members had not sent out distress calls if
the ship developed mechanical failures or encountered any other
troubles," she said. The freighter was equipped with four different
distress call devices.</P>
      <P>"And if the ship was abducted, why no relevant information or
news reports have been released from mainland China, Japan
or other neighboring countries?" Lee asked.</P>
      <P>She said the MOTC should immediately form a special panel to
help clarify these dubious points. Relevant government agencies
should also not adopt a hands-off policy and should instead take
necessary measures to help families of all crew members handle
the aftermath.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leader of Taiwan's information technology
(IT) industry on Monday said that he envisions Taiwan becoming a
model digital economy for the world.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, chairman of Acer Group, made the remarks when he and
other representatives of Taiwan's computer industry called on
President Chen Shui-bian to offer their suggestions on the
development of Taiwan's IT industry.</P>
      <P>Shih said that in order to maintain Taiwan's IT edge in the
digital era, the industry's strategy has to be changed. He explained
that the traditional strategy of focusing on hardware manufacturing
should be shifted toward a combination of hardware and software
development.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Shih said Taiwan will have to become a leading
innovator in the IT industry. He envisioned that in five years,
Taiwan will be a leading supplier of information appliances, and a
center for providing digital services throughout the Asia-Pacific
region. He further said that in 10 years, Taiwan will be a model
digital economy for the world.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that in 1993, when he was serving as the chairman of
the Taipei Computer Association, he convened a meeting on IT
strategies. The participants at the time had envisioned Taiwan as a
recognized world center of the IT industry.</P>
      <P>Shih recalled that the officials at the meeting had set goals for
Taiwan to develop at least five mainstream products, to have more
than 5 million personal computers, to produce more than US$40 billion
worth of hardware products per year, and to produce an annual US$12
billion in software products.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association recently reviewed the performance
of the IT industry and found that the goals have all been met, with
the exception of the software industry.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the software industry failed to meet the goal set
in 1993 because the scale of domestic demand is too small.</P>
      <P>Shih was accompanied by Raff Liu, chairman of the Taipei Computer
Association, Miao Fung-chiang, chairman of Mitac Group, and Huang
Pin-jung, chairman of the Eten Information Systems, to meet with the
President.</P>
      <P>They suggested to Chen that he work to boost domestic demand,
upgrade Taiwan's brand names in the world, use mainland resources,
redistribute government resources, and develop the IT industry.</P>
      <P>As the new government has planned to adjust the present "go slow,
be patient" policy, which bans investment in mainland infrastructure
construction and subjects each mainland investment project to a cap
of US$50 million, the suggestion to use mainland resources has
aroused attention.</P>
      <P>President Chen was positive about the outstanding performance of
Taiwan's IT industry, saying that the goal of turning Taiwan into a
"green silicon valley" hinges on the renovation and ceaseless efforts
of Taiwan's leading high-tech firms.</P>
      <P>Chen vowed to provide an open and pluralistic environment, step
up education efforts, and reduce hurdles to development.</P>
      <P>Chen also instructed Eugene Chien, vice secretary-general to the
president, to coordinate related government agencies and present
substantial views and approaches so that the government and private
sector can work together toward transforming Taiwan into a "green
silicon valley."</P>

      <P>This sudden influx of huge numbers of tourists from all over the
island has caused serious traffic problems in Kuantien village and
the surrounding region. The Kuantien township government has already
felled scores of trees in the neighborhood of Chen's home to make way
for a parking lot to accommodate the tour buses which transport
curious passengers to the region every day.</P>
      <P>Not content with this desecration, however, the township
government also plans to widen a major road leading to Chen's home in
order to relieve traffic jams in the area. A further 600 old trees
lining the road will have to be felled simply to accommodate the
project.</P>
      <P>Many local environmental groups have asked Chen to stop the
Kuantien township government from carrying out its expansion project.</P>
      <P>In response to the environmental groups' call to save the old
trees, Chen said the road to his home is known as a "green tunnel"
because of the beautiful mango trees that line its verges. "The old
trees are a valuable asset. If they are felled, it will be a great
loss to all Kuantien residents," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has ordered Chen Tze-nan, a deputy secretary-general
to the president, to contact the Kuantien township government and
urge them to protect the old trees.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to the recent sharp drop in stock
trading volume, stock transaction tax collections in May plunged to a
five-month-low of NT$8.6 billion (US$286.6 million), according to the
Ministry of Finance (MOF) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Dragged down by a plunge in stocks on the NASDAQ, uneasiness over
Taiwan's relations with mainland China, and Beijing's war games since
May 25, equity prices on the Taipei Security Exchange (TSE) plummeted
during May, causing most investors to flee to the sidelines.</P>
      <P>The TSE's weighted price index dropped to 8,281 points on May 11,
near the last year's average level, with daily volumes evaporating to
as low as NT$80 billion (US$2.66 billion) for four consecutive
business days.</P>
      <P>As a result, the stock transaction tax, set at 0.3 percent of
every transaction, declined to NT$8.6 billion (US$286.6 million),
against NT$15.3 billion (US$510 million) during the previo7us month.</P>
      <P>Including the May figure, accumulated revenues from the stock
transaction tax in 2000 have reached NT$116 billion (US$3.86
billion), just NT$6 billion (US$200 million) shy of the NT$122
billion (US$4.06 billion) annual target, due to a booming stock
market earlier this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's largest computer show kicked off on
Monday in Taipei, with over 1,000 domestic and foreign information
technology (IT) companies vying for the attention of an estimated
20,000 international buyers.</P>
      <P>The 20th annual Taipei International Computer Show (Computex
Taipei), organized jointly by the China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), is one of
the three largest IT shows in the world. The five-day exhibition is
being held at the Taipei World Trade Center and the Taipei
International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>CETRA Chairman Lin Chen-Kuo said at the show's opening ceremony
that Computex Taipei is a good indicator of Taiwan's IT industrial
growth for the year. He added that the show, the largest to date,
will draw an estimated crowd of over 20,000 foreign buyers who will
bring in sizable orders for local companies.</P>
      <P>TCA Chairman Raff Liu pointed out that Taiwan's IT industry
achieved an 18.4 percent annual growth rate last year, despite the
impact caused by the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake, and he
estimated that the industry will enjoy a sustained growth rate of
over 10 percent over the next few years.</P>
      <P>Liu also noted that many domestic companies are moving into the
World Wide Web and communications products such as videophones,
television set-top boxes, and other information appliances. This, he
said, shows the international competitiveness of local companies.</P>
      <P>Information Industry Institute (III) adviser Sun Chen-ju said
that following Taiwan's success in the information hardware industry,
the domestic software and service industry has the potential to reach
an estimated market of NT$200 billion (US$6.5 billion) by 2002.</P>
      <P>Computex Taipei features 2,151 booths divided into ten areas:
communications products; display equipment; components and

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Kuomintang lawmakers who planned
to visit mainland China early this month announced on Monday a
cancellation of the trip owing to an absence of an invitation,
according to sources from the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, members of the "E-Generation Alliance," a
sub-group of Kuomintang lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, said the
trip, scheduled for June 7-10, had to be postponed because, as of
Monday, they had not received a formal invitation from mainland
Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>According to "E-Generation" lawmakers, they were supposed to make
the four-day visit, sponsored by Kuomintang Legislator Chen Keng-teh,
at the invitation of Beijing's quasi-official intermediary body, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>They said they have no idea why the ARATS invitation had not
reached Taipei by Monday.</P>
      <P>In preparation for the trip, which they said they attached great
importance to, the lawmakers had visited Taiwan's "King of Business"
-- founder of Formosa Plastics Group, Wang Yung-ching -- to exchange
views. Wang has made a significant amount of investment in mainland
China and was opposed the previous government's "no haste, be
patient" policy to curb expanded Taiwanese investment on the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>They had also met with Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen to exchange views on relevant issues. Tsai was quoted as
having told them that she hopes the lawmakers will stand firm on
Taiwan's stance regarding the "one China" issue while visiting the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that she will make efforts to push for "direct
religious voyages" across the Taiwan Strait to facilitate the annual
religious journey by Taiwanese worshippers to Meizhou in mainland

      <P>The US government will not encourage any
conflict in the Taiwan Strait and should continue to sell defensive
weapons to Taiwan, according to former US Deputy Defense Secretary
John J. Hamre in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hamre arrived in Taipei on Sunday to attend the Seventh Taipei
Roundtable, a meeting on the new challenges for the millennium that
is scheduled to open on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hamre, who is president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank, arrived
with CSIS Asia Program Director Gerrit W. Gong and CSIS counselor
Richard Fairbanks.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States has always urged the governments
on either side of the strait to resolve their political differences
through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Hamre added that he knows from his experience in the US
Department of Defense that the US government carefully considers the
issue of continued military sales to Taiwan every year. With both
primary candidates for the next US presidency openly proclaiming the
importance of Taiwan's security, the United States should continue
its policy of selling defensive weapons to Taiwan, he went on.</P>
      <P>As to whether Taipei and Beijing should return to the 1992
agreement of "one China, with separate interpretations as to the
meaning of the term" as a basis for negotiations, Gong said that
returning to "one China" would be beneficial for both governments.</P>
      <P>Fairbanks for his part said that the United States will continue
to abide by its own "one China" policy and its principle of
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. He also said he hoped that
Taiwan's new government will negotiate patiently with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Seventh Taipei Roundtable is organized by Chinatrust

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER TO VISIT MACEDONIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed on Tuesday that Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao has a plan
to visit the Balkan state of Macedonia late this month.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a newspaper report that Tien is
scheduled to arrive in Macedonia on June 20 for his first overseas
trip since assuming his current post.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry said Tien's travel plan, including the
departure date and itinerary, has yet to be finalized. "When all
relevant details are set, we will make a formal announcement," said a
MOFA spokesman.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said Macedonian Parliamentary Speaker Savo
Klimovski invited President Chen Shui-bian and Foreign Minister Tien
to visit his country when he last visited Taipei in May to attend
Chen's inauguration.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, ROC Minister to Macedonia Peter Cheng
can be promoted to the status of ambassador in the near future. If
all goes well, the sources said Tien's Macedonia trip may take place
either in late June or early July.</P>
      <P>A report carried in Tuesday's United Daily News (UDN) quoted
Macedonian sources as saying that Tien will start an official visit
to Macedonia on June 20.</P>
      <P>The report said Tien may take advantage of his visit to help
pave the way for President Chen to visit Macedonia later this year.
Macedonia forged formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China
in January 1999, making it the ROC's second diplomatic ally in
Europe.</P>
      <P>The UDN report said Tien is likely to visit the ROC's another
European ally -- the Vatican City -- following his Macedonia trip.
According to the report, Tien, a political
scientist-turned-minister, has extensive connections in eastern
Europe. He reportedly helped arrange for former ROC Foreign Minister
Jason Hu to deliver a speech in Poland two years ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA officials said Tien's planned visit to Macedonia
is mainly aimed at cementing the ROC's relations with the
southeastern Balkan state.</P>
      <P>Because of Macedonia's domestic political factors, ROC Minister
Peter Cheng has been unable to present his credentials to the

    <HEADLINE>NP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS TO ORGANIZE GROUP TO VISIT BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Party's (NP's) Legislative Yuan
caucus will organize a delegation to visit mainland China in
mid-June, the pro-unification opposition party announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Feng Hu-hsiang, the NP's parliamentary whip, said the party's
move was prompted by rising public concern here about whether the
government should open direct "three links" and pilgrimage sailing
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Feng said the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) has formally invited the New Party, which
controls less than 10 seats in the legislature, to send a delegation
to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>"The NP's legislative caucus has approved the proposal," Feng
said, adding this will be the first time that the New Party has
organized a mainland visit in the name of its parliamentary caucus.</P>
      <P>Feng said the delegation, to be composed of five to six NP
legislators, is scheduled to leave for the mainland in mid-June for a
weeklong visit.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the group will first visit Shanghai to meet
with ARATS President Wang Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The NP delegation will then travel to Beijing where the group
will meet with senior mainland leaders. "We are hopeful that the
upcoming visit can help break the current cross-strait logjam and
boost mutual reconciliation," Feng said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that topics to be discussed with senior mainland
leaders will focus on issues related to the proposed opening of
direct cross-strait "three links" -- trade, postal and transportation
services, direct "mini three links" between Taiwan's frontline
islands and mainland China's southeastern coastal cities, and direct
sailing from Taiwan ports to Meizhou Island off mainland China's
Fujian province for religious pilgrimage.</P>
      <P>Prior to its departure for the mainland, Feng said, the NP
delegation will pay visits to Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Wang's Taiwan counterpart, and Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) officials to gain a better understanding of the
Republic of China government's stances on all those issues.</P>
      <P>Both SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties. SEF is under the
supervision of the Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that many current cross-strait issues are deadlocked
over the so-called "one China" principle, Feng said he hopes the
NP's upcoming mainland trip can help score a breakthrough in
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Feng said cross-strait relations remain at a low ebb after the
inauguration of the new ROC government. "The New Party wants to
conduct dialogue with Beijing authorities to help minimize
cross-strait misunderstanding," he said, adding that since resumption
of cross-strait dialogue is a national consensus here, the NP
delegation will convey it to top mainland leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONLY 23% SAY TAIPEI MAYOR CAN WIN PRESIDENTIAL RACE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If incumbent Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
challenges President Chen Shui-bian in the next presidential
election, only 23 percent of the public believe the popular mayor
would win, according to a poll released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Focus Survey Research Corp. was commissioned by Taipei City
Councilman Ke Ching-sheng and four of his Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) colleagues to conduct the June 1-2 survey, which has a
margin of error of 3.1 percent. The research firm called 1,000
people, all of whom are over 20 years of age.</P>
      <P>Ke noted that although Ma has stressed that he intends to run for
reelection in the mayoral race, he has recently said that he will
actively solicit support for himself to serve as a Kuomintang (KMT)
Central Standing Committee member.</P>
      <P>In view of the KMT's humiliating defeat in the March 18
presidential election, which left the long-ruling party in disarray,
and the large defection of KMT party members to form the People First
Party (PFP) led by former KMT heavyweight James Soong, Ma is very
likely to represent the KMT as its candidate in the next presidential
election, Ke said.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that more women than men believe that Ma can
win the next presidential election, while voters older than 60 and
people who have received only elementary educations have less
confidence in Ma.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey also found that around 60 percent of Taipei
residents are satisfied with the performance of Taipei City
Government. The approval rating for the mayor is even higher, at 72
percent.</P>
      <P>But only 44 percent of the residents believe that Ma will be
reelected as mayor, showing that there is huge gap between his
approval rating and those whose who deem he will be reelected.</P>
      <P>The survey found that residents' satisfaction over traffic,
social order, and efficiency and service were 59.9 percent, 60
percent, 60.4 percent, respectively, while disapproval ratings were
25.9 percent, 30 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>An analysis of similar surveys over the past 18 months shows that
Ma's approval rating has climbed steadily higher, while
dissatisfaction with the mayor is at its lowest point.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that residents' satisfaction with the Taipei
City Government team as a whole is less than that of the mayor.
However, a well-run city cannot depend on Ma alone, Councilman Ke
said.</P>
      <P>Ke said that the approval rating for Ma has to do with his
personal charisma and his clean image. However, Ma's road to
reelection will he bumpy, as the political scene has changed since
the March presidential election, which saw the KMT lose its
five-decade grip on power to the DPP, he said. Other complications
include Ma's dwindling support from the KMT, and the the formation of
a powerful PFP, Ke said.</P>
      <P>Ke concluded that if all four parties field candidates for
Taipei's mayoral election, and the DPP can successfully field a
capable person, the DPP will capitalize on the support given to
former Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian of the DPP, and retake the mayoral
post from the KMT in next mayoral election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT ASKED TO DECIDE ON DIRECT RELIGIOUS TRIP IN ONE WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) lawmakers on
Tuesday criticized the government's reserved attitude toward allowing
a direct religious voyage across the Taiwan Strait, asking relevant
authorities to respect public opinion and make a final decision on
the issue within a week.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a public news conference, PFP legislative leader Chiu
Chuang-liang said former Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan and
all PFP lawmakers would consider traveling on board the same ship
with followers of Matsu to worship the sea goddess in her birthplace
of Meizhou, in mainland China's Fujian province, if the government
does not change its stance toward the issue.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-piao, chairman of Chenglan Temple in central Taiwan's
Taichung county, has decided to embark on July 16 on a pilgrimage to
Meizhou, an islet of Fujian province, which lies directly opposite
Taiwan. Thousands of local Matsu followers are expected to take part
in the annual event.</P>
      <P>PFP Lawmaker Shen Chih-hui called on President Chen Shui-bian not
to break his campaign promise of permitting the "three direct links"
between Taiwan and mainland China, and further urged Chen to "never
break his promises to Matsu."</P>
      <P>Stressing that both the motive and purpose behind the religious
trip are simple, Shen said the government should allow such a
positive cross-strait cultural exchange amid strained relations
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP legislative spokesman, also blasted the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the highest government agency in
charge of drawing up Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, for its
reservation on the issue.</P>
      <P>He said the MAC has only found fault with some small issues, and
voiced his suspicion that MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is seeking to
pass the buck to Chen.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government's insistence on first opening the "mini
three links," before allowing the full "direct three links" and than
direct religious links does not help resolve practical problems
arising from current bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although the public has long demanded that the government permit
direct cross-strait religious voyages, Liu said the government has
failed to convene a task force meeting to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>As the July 16 scheduled embarkation by Chenglan Temple
worshipers is approaching quickly, Lin urged the government to give
the pilgrims a clear answer as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen said religious faith has nothing to do with
politics, and called on the government to allow them to conduct a
direct religious voyage to Meizhou.</P>
      <P>But if the government refuses to do so, Yen said he and Chenglan
Temple followers will have to carry out the trip via a third country.
"Chenglan Temple will not lead the pilgrims to embark on the trip in
violation of government laws," he noted.</P>

      <P>Forty-two domestic cows turned up negative

bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, from
contaminating the domestic beef supply, the COA will continue to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Lien Chan said that the "mini three links" between
Taiwan-controlled outlying islands and mainland China should serve a
political purpose.</P>
      <P>Lien said the links should not be a unilateral goodwill gesture
of the new government, but should serve the political purpose of
establishing peace zones in Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and Matsu
Islands, and Fujian province in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks when he met with nine KMT legislators to
exchange views on cross-strait relations and party affairs on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the opening of the "mini three links" could not
consider only economic factors, or only be a mechanism to bring the
current clandestine trade between Taiwan's outlying islands and
Fujian province into the open.</P>
      <P>He said that through the process of negotiation, peace zones
could be established in Kinmen, Matsu and Fujian province, adding
that he first broached the idea when he spoke on cross-strait policy
during the presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the KMT's policy toward three links -- direct

    <HEADLINE>RELIGIOUS GROUPS SHOULD NOT PUSH FOR DIRECT SAILING IN NAME OF GOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan,  northern Taiwan, June 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu
said on Tuesday that local religious groups should not pressure the
government to open direct sailing across the Taiwan Strait for
pilgrims in the name of any deity at the moment.</P>
      <P>Lu was commenting on a central Taiwan Taoist temple's plan to
lease a ship to transport pilgrims directly from Taiwan to a mainland
China-controlled islet to pay tribute to Matsu, the Chinese Goddess
of Sea, in July.</P>
      <P>Lu said after attending the opening ceremony for a Dragon Boat
race in Tayuan in the northern Taoyuan County, some 40 kilometers
south of Taipei, that improving relations with mainland China is the
new ROC government's established policy and goal.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said, as Beijing remains hostile toward Taiwan
and has not made any goodwill response to President Chen Shui-bian's
olive branch, local religious groups should not pressure the
government to lift its ban on direct cross-strait shipping
services in the name of the wish of the goddess right now.</P>
      <P>Lu, who quit the post of Taoyuan County magistrate just before
assuming the vice presidency on May 20, further said national
security should always be the top concern in mulling issues related
to cross-strait engagement.</P>
      <P>Lu also said she thinks the time is still not ripe to consider
direct shipping link issues in view of Beijing's continued
saber-rattling against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>There have been calls in local society for opening direct
"three links" -- trade, mail and transportation -- with the
mainland. The Legislative Yuan even passed a bill on opening direct
"mini three links" between several of Taiwan's outlying
islands, such as offshore Penghu County and frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland China's southeastern coastal cities.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the government's approval of the
opening of direct "mini three links" in the near future, the Chenlan
Temple in the central county of Taichung announced a plan on Sunday
to lease a foreign vessel to transport local Matsu followers directly
from Taichung Harbor to Meizhou, a small islet off mainland China's
southeastern province of Fujian, on July 16.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the debate about whether the government should
open direct cross-strait pilgrimage sailing, direct "mini three
links" or overall direct "three links" in the near future, Lu said as
national security and interests are at stake in opening such links,
the government should make a comprehensive evaluation and careful
planning before making a final decision.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said, negotiations with the mainland are needed to
resolve some technical issues. As Beijing remains reluctant to
resume cross-strait dialogue, Lu said she does not think that a
breakthrough to the direct shipping link issue can be achieved any
time soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUSTICE MINISTER ASKS INVESTIGATION BUREAU TO PLAY ITS ROLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Tuesday
said that he has a simple request for the Investigation Bureau --
that the bureau play its "judicial police" role and follow the
directions of public prosecutors when handling cases.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed on Monday that he felt "powerless" when dealing
with the bureau, which is a part of his ministry. He also criticized
the bureau for its lack of impartiality in choosing which cases to
follow up on.</P>
      <P>Chen added on Tuesday that he was not trying to adversely affect
the investigators' morale, but merely hoped to improve the situation
by bringing the problems out into the open.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was reflecting the concerns of some prosecutors
and investigators, who told him that sometimes prosecutors have
trouble directing investigators, and investigators have trouble
getting responses from their superiors on certain cases.</P>
      <P>Investigation Bureau rules require that cases be submitted and
approved before moving ahead with the investigations, a system that
bureau officials said was designed to protect human rights by first
determining the strength of evidence and whether the cases fell under
the bureau's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that many cases ended up at a dead-end because
of the system. In fact, no one in the bureau has the legal authority
to decide what can or cannot be investigated as long as they have a
lead on any possible criminal activities, he said. He added that only
prosecutors have the authority to determine whether to follow up on
cases after preliminary investigations have been conducted.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his ministry and the Investigation Bureau should
start by coming up with a common ground to prepare for future
cooperative efforts against corruption and "black gold" politics. He
added that it is not yet time to name a new bureau director, and that
he will continue to observe the situation for a period of time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POSES NO INTELLIGENCE THREAT TO US: ROC REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington   D.C.,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing Republic of China
Representative in the United States Stephen Chen on Tuesday
categorically denied a May 24 Washington Post report that Taiwan
poses an intelligence threat to the United States.</P>
      <P>In an open letter published in the newspaper, Chen said that he
was dismayed to learn that the US Department of Justice has included
Taiwan on a list of "countries that pose a threat" to US national
security.</P>
      <P>"As my country's principal representative in the United States, I
would like to make it perfectly clear that no personnel or offices
stationed by my government in this country have ever engaged in any
intelligence activities that were illegal or posed a threat to the
United States," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We would never knowingly jeopardize our close and friendly
relationship with the United States. Two-way trade between both
countries totaled US$50.6 billion last year, and there are
significant exchanges between the two countries in the fields of
culture, science, education and tourism," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"As a full-fledged democracy, we share with the United States a
common commitment to preserving peace and stability in Asia," he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He further said that the ill-advised decision to include Taiwan
on the list is most regrettable. "Ta-wei Lee, my country's vice
minister of foreign affairs, has expressed our serious concern to
Raymond Burghart, the director of the American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT)'s Taipei Office, and we have asked for an explanation from the
relevant US authorities," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"In the meantime, however, I would like to assure all of our many
friends and supporters in the United States that the 23 million
people of the Republic of China on Taiwan cherish the traditional
ties of friendship between our two peoples, and we are eager to
continue working with the United States to usher in a new era of
peace and prosperity in the coming century," Chen added.</P>

(By Shu Lu-sheng &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The RAND Center for Asia-Pacific Policy
on Monday sponsored a conference titled "Taiwan Enters a New Era:
Prospects and Implications" in Santa Monica, California.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Government Information Office Deputy Director-General
Frederic Chang delivered a speech at the event in which he said that
new Taiwan administration inaugurated on May 20 is heading into the
new century with confidence.</P>
      <P>He described the recent democratic and peaceful transfer of power
to the administration led by Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party as one of the most significant political
developments in Asia.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the election was an expression of confidence
that the Taiwanese can find ways to resolve the long-standing
impediments to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The GIO official said that the new government hopes to see an
early resumption of cross-strait dialogue between mainland China and
Taiwan, and added that the new government's domestic priority is to
crack down on "black gold" and corruption in politics.</P>
      <P>The main topics of the conference were interpreting the electoral
outcome in Taiwan, the future of Taiwan's political and economic
structure, cross-strait relations, and US-mainland China relations:
Congress and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East Asia
Kurt Campbell told the conference that it remains possible for
mainland China to invade Taiwan by force, although most people
consider the possibility as remote.</P>
      <P>Campbell said that the Taiwan Strait is still filled with crisis,
and added that its development is not so optimistic as many people
have thought.</P>
      <P>He said that cases of miscalculation between Beijing and Taipei
are likely to grow as the two authorities do not understand each
other well, leading to an unstable cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Campbell suggested that the United States intervene positively in
Asia-Pacific affairs so as to create a more stable environment for a
resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, RAND Corporation senior advisor Jonathan Pollack
described Taiwan as a unique political laboratory.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the largest challenge to Taiwan's new
president is how he will deal with the pressure against Taiwan from

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  southern  Taiwan,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
on Tuesday called on all people around Taiwan, regardless of their
party affiliations and ethnic origins, to stand united to work for
national development and progress.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while attending the opening ceremony of a
Dragon Boat race in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan in
celebration of the Dragon Boat Festival, which fell on Tuesday this
year.</P>
      <P>Chen, the Republic of China's first opposition
leader-turned-president, said operating a Dragon Boat needs
coordination and cooperation of all team members.</P>
      <P>"Carrying out national development projects is like operating a
Dragon Boat and cannot rely on individual efforts," Chen noted,
adding that he hopes local people can draw inspirations from Dragon
Boat races and work hand-in-hand to upgrade national
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"So long as we all stand up, Taiwan will stand up. Let us work
together and make concerted efforts to create a bright future for
our country," Chen told a huge crowd of local residents who turned
out to greet the president and watched the annual Dragon Boat race.</P>
      <P>Similar Dragon Boat races were held in many other cities and
counties around the island as a major activity celebrating the
Dragon Boat Festival, one of the three most important
festivals in Chinese society.</P>
      <P>The festival, which falls on the fifth day of the fifth moon on
the lunar calendar, commemorates Chu Yuan (343-290 B.C.), a patriot
poet who drowned himself in a river in an attempt to inspire the
government at that time to launch reforms. Eating Tzungtzu,
or rice dumplings, is another popular custom in celebration of the
festival.

NATIONAL SECURITY TAX PLAN NOT WORTH TRYING: KMT AIDE</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 6 (CNA) Amid hot debate over whether the government
should levy a "national security tax" on mainland China-based Taiwan
businessmen, a raking Kuomintang official said on Tuesday that the
proposed measure is neither praiseworthy nor workable.</P>
      <P>Hailing the country's top economic planner for his outright
opposition to the proposal, Chang Jung-kong, director of the KMT's
Mainland Affairs Research Department, stressed that the measure is
not worth trying and represents a form of political discrimination
against Taiwan businessmen with operations in the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT will continue to remain highly concerned
over the issue as part of its efforts to help protect the interests
of Taiwan investors, and because the disputed plan goes against a
promise made by the present Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
administration that it will ease restrictions on mainland-bound
investment by Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the "national security tax" plan is not the
correct and feasible way to regulate investment by Taiwan firms in
mainland China, the China expert stressed that it will only create a
heavier legal burden on Taiwan businesspeople in the mainland while
encouraging local investors to use illegal means to conduct
investment on the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>What is worse, Chang claimed, is that the motive behind the plan
is to create political discrimination against Taiwan businessmen
operating in the mainland, which he said is not laudable at all.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Po-chih made clear on Monday at the Legislative Yuan that he is
opposed to the "national security tax" plan proposed recently by S.M.
Chen, vice governor-designate of the Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, caucus members of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) at the legislature strongly criticized the DPP administration's
inconsistent stance on the issue, saying that rash comments by
"irrelevant" Cabinet members will only mislead the public.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Hsi-wei said skeptically that Chen raised the
proposal rashly at this moment to underscore "a certain political
significance."</P>
      <P>But he added that he suspected that such an approach would only
reduce the revenues for the national coffers, fuel clandestine trade
and hurt Taiwan industries, an indication that the DPP has yet to
adjust its mindset from that of an opposition party to a ruling
party.</P>
      <P>Chou said Taiwan businessmen in the mainland are being squeezed
by the governments on both sides of the strait, as the mainland
authorities have increased pressure on pro-Taiwan independence firms
while Taiwan authorities are also seeking a way to tackle those
firms' mainland investments.</P>
      <P>He described local firms with mainland investments as "turning
from bamboo shoots to dried bamboo."</P>
      <P>PFP legislative speaker Liu Wen-hsiung also voiced his
disagreement with the tax proposal, claiming that it will force local
mainland-bound investors to invest through a third country, leading
to an outflow of Taiwan capital.</P>
      <P>He also blasted the DPP-led government for allowing any and all
Cabinet members to comment on the issue as they saw fit, satirically
calling it a "ringer vehicle."</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton will dispatch
a Cabinet official to Taipei to attend the upcoming joint meeting of

not be affected by the Senate vote on granting permanent normal trade

replied when he was asked by the CNA about the impact of the upcoming
PNTR vote in the Senate.</P>

delegation to the joint meeting scheduled for June 14-15 in Taipei

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGES MAINLAND CHINA TO BE A `RESPONSIBLE GREAT NATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said on Wednesday that Taiwan and the United States must cooperate to
assist mainland China in becoming a "great nation" that is not only
willing, but also capable of fulfilling its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the Seventh Taipei Roundtable, Chen
said that "great power" status is not illustrated by the active
expansion of a country's military capabilities or by its military
threats against smaller nations.</P>
      <P>As a great nation, Chen noted, mainland China should understand
its responsibilities as a leader in the Asia Pacific region, rather
than attempting to achieve "great nation diplomacy" by suppressing
Taiwan in the international arena and creating tension in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is worth questioning whether or not mainland
China understands the international, political, military and economic
responsibilities a great nation must shoulder, as the nations of the
world attach great expectations to the status of mainland China as a
great nation.</P>
      <P>Even if mainland China understands the responsibilities of a
great nation, does it have the capabilities to shoulder such
responsibilities? Chen asked.</P>
      <P>The Seventh Taipei Roundtable, co-sponsored by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think
tank, and Chinatrust Commercial Bank, kicked off on Wednesday. The
theme of the roundtable this time is the challenges of the new
millennium.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen said that while the international community
expresses a common concern for "collective security," Taiwan still
faces the threat of potential regional conflicts initiated by
individual rogue states.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's role in the new century cannot be
ignored, Chen said the new ROC government is willing and capable of
preserving peace in the region, and the new government has the
sincerity and goodwill to initiate the comprehensive normalization of
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's political democracy is conducive to helping
mainland China learn to shoulder its responsibilities as a great
nation. Positive cross-strait economic interaction has constructive
effects for the globalization and liberalization of mainland China's
economy and for the healthy development of a global trade system, he
added.</P>
      <P>"The avoidance of conflict and the maintenance of peace in the
Taiwan Strait form the cornerstone to realizing stability and
prosperity in the Asia Pacific region in the 21st century," he
continued.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that the governments on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait must respect the free choice of the people. In other words, he
said, the people of Taiwan have the ultimate right to determine their
future. Even US President Bill Clinton supports the notion that the
resolution of cross-strait issues must "have the consent of the
people of Taiwan." President Clinton's words are a demonstration of a
great nation's stature, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted that the long-term friendship between Taiwan
and the United States is based on the two countries' common interests
of democracy, security, and trade. In the process of American
engagement with China, the US has an obligation to enable mainland
China to understand the responsibilities of a great nation, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the US must cooperate to assist mainland China in
becoming a great nation that is not only willing, but also capable of
fulfilling its responsibilities, he reiterated, adding that only then
will the Taiwan-US relationship be solidified and uninhibited by the
potentially destabilizing "China factor."</P>
      <P>Finally, Chen noted that a new government took power in Taiwan on
May 20, adding that the US and China will also have new leadership
within two years. These changes will generate great challenges, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I personally believe that only with greater wisdom, creativity,
and patience, with full appreciation of the meaning of `rights' and
`responsibilities,' can we overcome the serious challenges of the new
century," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EIGHTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS SEE TAIWAN AS AN ALLY: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  6  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighty percent of Americans consider
Taiwan to be an ally or a friendly country, while 51 percent say that
Communist China is a friend or ally of the United States, according
to the latest Gallup poll results released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted May 12-21 based on telephone interviews with
a random national sample of 1,011 American adults, shows that only 9
percent of the American public considers Taiwan as unfriendly, and 1
percent say Taiwan is an enemy of the United States.</P>
      <P>But 30 percent of Americans surveyed say mainland China is
unfriendly, while 13 percent consider it to be an enemy of the United
States.</P>
      <P>In a similar Gallup poll conducted in March 1996, during the
missile crisis across the Taiwan Straits, 59 percent of Americans had
a very or mostly favorable opinion of Taiwan, while 37 said their
overall opinion of Taiwan was mostly or very unfavorable.</P>
      <P>The same poll showed that 39 percent of Americans had a very or
mostly favorable opinion of mainland China, while 51 said their
overall opinion of China was mostly or very unfavorable.</P>
      <P>A September 1979 Gallup poll found that 63 percent of Americans
had a very or mostly favorably opinion of Taiwan, with only 20
percent having a mostly or very unfavorable opinion of Taiwan.
Sixty-four percent of Americans at that time said that they had a
very or mostly favorable opinion of China, while 25 percent had a
mostly or very unfavorable opinion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, CHINA, ARGENTINA SEEN LESS AFFECTED BY KYOTO PROTOCOL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 7 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan, mainland China, and Argentina will
be less affected by the Kyoto Protocol because of their diverse trade
and production structure, but most developing countries will be much
more affected by the emission standards, according to the Australian
Bureau of Agriculture and Resources Economics (ABARE).</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA on Thursday, ABARE Executive
Director Brian Fisher said that "implementing the Kyoto Protocol
would have significant but varied economic impacts on developing
countries, even though they have no emissions targets under the
protocol."</P>
      <P>"The impacts occur through trade and investment linkages with
developed countries, and the net economic impact on any one
developing country would depend on its particular production and
trade structure," he said.</P>
      <P>"Developing countries that rely on exports of fossil fuels , such
as the Middle East, Venezuela and Indonesia, face reduced export
earnings and income. This is because developed countries will reduce
fossil fuel consumption to meet their emission targets," Fisher
continued.</P>
      <P>"But countries that rely on exports of emission intensive goods,
such as Brazil, India and South Korea, tend to benefit from improved
competitiveness as a result of penalties placed on emission intensive
production in developed countries," he said.</P>
      <P>Economies with a more diverse trade and production structure,
such as Argentina, Taiwan, and mainland China are projected to be
relatively less affected, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Fisher said developing countries face up to US$7.1 billion over
the next 10 years in improving their emission standards to meet the
requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The final countdown is only 100 days away,
but Australian organizers of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games are facing
a financial shortfall of US$100 million as about 2.5 million tickets
remain unsold.</P>
      <P>Organizers told reporters that they still need about US$100
million to meet their budget and have found it difficult to sell the
remaining 2.5 million tickets, most of which are to less popular
events.</P>
      <P>David Richmond, the director-general of the Olympic Coordination
Authority, said the organizers face a huge challenge in selling the
large number of remaining tickets.</P>
      <P>Even with some further overseas sales, organizers will still face
a serious revenue shortfall unless they can move large numbers of
tickets for less attractive sports when they begin live telephone
sales on Sunday, said Richmond.</P>
      <P>He blamed part of the difficulty in selling the tickets to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China should stop their
competition on the diplomatic front and adopt new thinking to bolster
bilateral cooperation, Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan on a proposal he made for a diplomatic truce between
Taiwan and mainland China, Tien expressed the hope that the current
situation across the Taiwan Strait will stabilize soon and enter a
new era of dialogue and peace. He noted that this is also the desire
of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While calling for a truce in the diplomatic war between the two
sides of the strait, Tien claimed his ministry will do its best to
consolidate ties with ROC diplomatic allies and boost substantive
links with other friendly countries in order to protect national
dignity within the international community.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister also confirmed reports that he is planning a
trip to Macedonia and pointed out that the major purpose of his visit
to the Balkan state is aimed at strengthening diplomatic relations
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Tien's remarks came on the heels of a statement made by mainland
China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday that "there is no such problem as
a `diplomatic truce' between Taiwan and mainland China under the `one
China' principle."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Security Council (NSC) Vice Secretary-General
Chiu I-jen told local media that the issue of a "cross-strait
diplomatic truce" has been repeatedly put forward by the political
and academic sectors. However, he went on, the fact remains that the
matter cannot be unilaterally decided by Taiwan and will require a
friendly response from mainland China. This, he said, is impossible.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks to reporters after attending a roundtable
meeting in Taipei of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a US-based think tank.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the hotly debated issue about the opening of
"direct cross-strait religious links," Chiu said that it is not
necessary for the NSC to coordinate the matter, as the Mainland
Affairs Council, the government agency in charge of the issue, has so

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan rescue team departed Taipei on
Wednesday for the Indonesian island of Sumatra to help with emergency
aid and search work in the wake of a devastating earthquake which
struck on Sunday, according to sources from Taipei County Government.</P>
      <P>The team, comprising five emergency aid specialists from the
Taipei County Government Fire Department and one medical doctor, is
the first emergency aid mission from Taiwan to conduct rescue and
search work overseas.</P>
      <P>The team took with it 640 kg of rescue and search gear, including
sonar detectors, image probes, electricity generators, digging tools
and satellite telephones.</P>
      <P>In order for the team to respond as rapidly as possible, it left
for Indonesia without waiting for another team from the southern
county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung team, also comprising six men -- five specialists
from the Pingtung Fire Department and one architect -- was scheduled
to take a later flight to the stricken area.</P>
      <P>Going with the Pingtung team will be life detectors, fiber-optic
detectors and other advanced search and rescue gear.</P>
      <P>Both the Taipei County and Pingtung emergency aid teams were
established late last year after Taiwan was battered by a
catastrophic 7.3-magnitude earthquake on Sept. 21, in which nearly
2,400 people were killed, some 8,400 were injured and 100,000 others
were left homeless.</P>
      <P>The teams received four weeks of intensive training in Singapore
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya met the team members before their
departure and presented them with the national flag to signal the
honor and pride of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is time for Taiwan to reciprocate for the
incalculable help and assistance it received from the rest of the
world after the September quake.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the Sumatra earthquake, measuring 7.9 on the
Richter scale, has so far killed at least 117 people and injured

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many of the smaller member countries of the
Organization of American States (OAS) expressed their concerns
Tuesday about the expansion of free trade in the region during a
conference in Canada.</P>
      <P>When Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien opened the OAS
conference, he said Canada would push for a free trade deal for the
Americas because it will benefit everyone in both hemispheres.</P>
      <P>But about 10 foreign ministers from small islands in the
Caribbean expressed their skepticism. Billie Miller, from Barbados,
said the developing countries cannot abandon subsidies to make the
transition to free trade without a great deal of pain.</P>
      <P>"Globalization can have an early, negative impact that may well
outweigh any eventual, positive outcome," he said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sam Condor of St. Kitts and Nevis said that if there is going to
be a free trade agreement, Caribbean countries are going to want
certain exemptions to buy themselves some time.</P>
      <P>"All we are asking is for the international community to
understand that we are at a tremendous disadvantage, and we will need
some concessions," said Condor.</P>
      <P>The most dramatic attack on the pro-free trade stance of Canada
and the United States came from the tiny country of Saint Lucia,
which has a population of just 150,000.</P>
      <P>Saint Lucia's Foreign Minister George Odlum said "there must be
an acceptance of the principle of the redistribution of resources."</P>
      <P>In a speech at the conference, Odlum said that in Saint Lucia,
farmers are feeling more and more insecure as the United States touts
the merits of globalization and free trade."</P>
      <P>Odlum noted that both Canada and the US have reduced their
foreign aid to the region while telling the poorer countries to put
their faith in free trade.</P>
      <P>He told his colleagues there should be more room, not less, for
government assistance in the Americas.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministers of several Caribbean countries said the

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent spate of drills and war games
conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is part of Beijing's
scheme to intensify its military threat to Taiwan, Defense Minister
Wu Shih-wen said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although the ROC Ministry of National Defense (MND)
had not yet released any news about an imminent PLA test-firing of
long-range Dongfeng-31 ballistic missiles in mainland China, he
believed that the test-firing, the fifth of its kind, is designed as
political posturing directed toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By stepping up its military threats against Taiwan, Beijing is
also attempting to persuade Taiwan into recognizing its political
overtures, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wu admitted that the
ROC Armed Forces are at present incapable of defending the island
against Dongfeng-31 missiles, the most lethal nuclear-capable
missiles in the mainland's arsenal and capable of reaching as far as
the western United States.</P>
      <P>The flight path of the imminent Dongfeng-31 test is reportedly to
be from northern Shanxi region toward mainland China's northwestern
Xinjiang region.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said, the ROC military is now has "limited"
capability of defending PLA's M-series missiles launched from the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu, who took office on May 20 succeeding Tang Fei, who
became premier, said a comprehensive reform of the national defense
system is scheduled to be completed by early 2003 which will see the

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of the
nation's policy toward mainland China reaffirmed on Wednesday that
there is no timetable for direct pilgrimages to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), said that the matter is still being assessed, but she
added that the MAC is willing to mull the plan in a positive manner.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks during a seminar when she met with Taiwan
business leaders investing in the mainland and noted that a number of
temples, including Chenlan Temple in Tachia, Taichung County, have
filed applications with the MAC for direct sailings across the Taiwan
Strait to allow devotees of the goddess Matsu to make pilgrimages to
her traditional home in Meizhou, Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>At present, such pilgrimages must take a route through a third
country or area, as direct cross-strait travel is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the MAC must make an overall assessment to gauge
the effect of granting the request on the country's mainland policy
as a whole, especially with regard to national security.</P>
      <P>The Chenlan temple plans to lease a Singaporean passenger ship to
directly transport pilgrims to Meizhou from Taichung Harbor, making a
stopover either at the Taiwan-controlled frontline island of Kinmen
or the offshore county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao announced on Sunday that the
temple has tentatively decided to start the pilgrimage on July 16.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai urged patience, and stressed that the government
has employed "rational thinking" in weighing the policy. She added
that the overall security of the nation must take priority over
religious voyages.</P>
      <P>Chenlan temple is organizing 6,000 pilgrims to make the voyage,
but there are worries that mainland Chinese would be able to
infiltrate the group on its return to Taiwan after the pilgrimage and
enter the country illegally.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that she was happy with Yen's assurance that he will
respect ROC law, adding that as he is concurrently Taichung County
speaker, he should know that he has influence over local followers
and the political environment, and that he should serve as a
law-abiding role model.

    <HEADLINE>US WOULD SHOW CONCERN OVER MAINLAND MILITARY ACTION AGAINST ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China were to decide to resolve
cross-Taiwan Strait problems by military action, the United States
would show its grave concern, as it did in 1996, a US military expert
said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>John, J. Hamre, president of the US-based think tank Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), stressed that the United
States will never accept a unilateral decision by the Chinese
communists to use military force against Taiwan, as US public opinion
always supports a peaceful resolution of the dispute between Taiwan
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hamre made the remarks in a speech delivered at the seventh
roundtable meeting jointly sponsored by CSIS and Chinatrust
Commercial Bank in Taipei. President Chen Shui-bian and Foreign
Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao also addressed the gathering.</P>
      <P>Since the United States has always urged Taiwan and mainland
China to resolve their problems peacefully, it is also very aware
that so long as either side harbors hostility toward the other, the
two sides will not be able to sit down and talk through their
disputes, Hamre said.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether "US concern" means that Washington
may play the role of mediator in cross-strait negotiations, Hamre,
who once served as US vice secretary of defense, said that he knows
Taiwan has high expectations of such a possibility, but added that he
was not sure whether it would be appropriate or workable.</P>
      <P>"After all, Taiwan and mainland China should try to resolve their
problems on their own," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Describing President Chen as very cautious in choosing his words
when addressing cross-strait affairs, Hamre gave high praise to
Taiwan's new president for his rational attitude toward the mainland
-- that Taiwan will not intentionally provoke mainland China, while
the mainland should also adopt peaceful means to mend bilateral
differences.</P>
      <P>Hamre further pointed out that Washington would be glad to see
Taipei and Beijing set up active dialogue channels as long as Taiwan
does not provoke the mainland, a point which he said the Taiwan
people must understand.</P>
      <P>In response to a question raised by a participant at the meeting
on what the United States would do if Taiwan decided to change the
status-quo regarding the unification-independence issue, Hamre said
only that the United States should gain a deeper understanding of
Taiwan than it has in the past. He noted that democracy has come of
age in Taiwan, as it has in the United States, and described this as
an encouraging phenomenon.</P>
      <P>As to a question from ROC National Security Council Vice
Secretary-General Chiu I-jen about the significance of the
establishment of a strategic partnership between the United States
and mainland China, Hamre called the name of the relationship a
"label," and claimed that such ties do not reflect substantive
relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Judging from past US experience, he contended that the United
States is not expected to build a warm relationship with the mainland
solely on the basis of such a concept.</P>

      <P>A Paraguayan company is considering
shipping "three to four cartons" of frozen beef to Taiwan by air in
an attempt to crack the island's growing red meat market, business
sources in the Paraguayan capital said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Arsenio Vasconsellos, a manager of a Paraguayan refrigeration

beef would go on trial sale to sound out how Taiwan consumers like
the beef from far-away Paraguay.</P>
      <P>If the Taiwan market is cracked, Vasconsellos said, future
deliveries will be shipped by sea, a journey of about two months.</P>
      <P>Last year, the ROC government granted Paraguay the right to
export 222 metric tons of frozen beef to Taiwan as part of the
island's bid to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO). Until
recently, however, no local importers have shown much interest in
Paraguayan beef.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government turned down an appeal by Paraguay's
agriculture and meat exporters to lift import tariffs on Paraguayan
beef, saying that a tariff exemption for Paraguay would run counter
to the WTO spirit of free and equal trade opportunities for all
countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports about 50,000 metric tons of beef annually, about
the amount of Paraguay's total annual beef exports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC CHINESE RAPE VICTIMS IN INDONESIA STILL TRAUMATIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many ethnic Chinese women who were abused
and raped during the Indonesian riots of 1998 still have not
recovered from their traumatic experiences, several local private
groups said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, The Garden of Hope, End
Child Prostitution and the Chinese Association for Human
Rights said that some victims have isolated themselves
from the outside world and have refused psychological counseling.</P>
      <P>As the groups jointly donated NT$260,000 collected over two years
to World Vision to finance the next two years of the rehabilitation
project, they said they hope that they can help the women come out of
the shadow of their nightmarish experience.</P>
      <P>Fu Shu-chi, vice executive director of World Vision of Taiwan,
said that of the 168 known cases, only around 70 have solicited
treatment. Many of the women, confined by their traditional concept
of chastity, have refused contact and isolated themselves, he said,
adding that it is this self-imposed isolation which most worries
social workers.</P>
      <P>According to the World Vision of Indonesia, the age of the
victims ranges from months-old babies to people over the age of 90,
some of the victims have tried to commit suicide, while others have
been unable to overcome the fear of being alone and lead a normal
life.</P>
      <P>Fu said that most of those now receiving treatment are
middle-aged women, and that most of them solicited psychological
therapy after encouragement from their families, showing the attitude
of the family is crucial.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Wang Ching-feng, who organized group visits to Indonesia
to lend support to abused ethnic Chinese in the wake of the May 1998
riots which saw the ouster of Indonesian President Suharto, urged
Indonesia not to try to cover up the victims. He added that the
situation which led to ethnic Chinese being used as scapegoats must
change, and said that "ethnic integration and harmony" would be the
best way to solve the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY SEEN AS BRIDGE FOR CROSS-STRAIT PEACE: US THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angles, June 6 (CNA)
(By L.S. Chu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic development in Taiwan was the
focus of a seminar sponsored on Tuesday by the Los Angeles-based
think tank the Claremont Institute.</P>
      <P>Scholars from Taiwan and the United States held extensive
discussions on how to establish a "channel of peace" between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait at the seminar titled "Democracy: the
Bridge between Mainland China and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Institute Director Thomas Silver said that the seminar aimed to
spread the democratic system practiced in the United States and
Taiwan to mainland China, and to influence the people of the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Richard Baum of the University of California at Los Angeles said
that helping the democratization of the mainland will be crucial to
easing the tension between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Baum also said that Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization will help it integrate with world trends and will
contribute to the establishment of a "bridge of cross-strait peace."</P>
      <P>Bruce Herchenshoh, a distinguished fellow of the institute, said
that he cannot agree with mainland China's "one China" policy, and
that he is strongly opposed to Taiwan being a part of China unless
Beijing starts practicing democratic politics.</P>
      <P>He added that he is also strongly opposed to the "one China"
policy espoused by the United States, saying that Washington focuses
too much on prying open the mainland China market, and forsakes its
requests for democratic development in the mainland. He added that
this is an "unwise" approach.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that after US presidential election in
November, there will not be many changes to Washington's current "one
China" policy.</P>
      <P>The scholars from Taiwan, including He Szu-yin, director of the
Institute for International Relations at National Chengchi
University, Chao Chien-ming, director of the Sun Yat-sen Graduate

expressed "cautious" views about the progress of democratization in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was ranked as the fifth-best place
for investment among fifty countries surveyed by a Swiss consultancy
firm, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) disclosed on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a survey conducted by the Business

points, tied for fifth place with the United States behind
Switzerland, Singapore, the Netherlands and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Business Risk Service issued by BERI for June gives Taiwan
"1B," or "good" status in terms of its profit-making chances for
investors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also ranked the second-best country in Asia, next only to
Singapore, but far ahead of Japan which landed in 14th place.
Mainland China and South Korea were tied in 26th position, and
Thailand ranked 28th.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves ranked second among the fifty
countries surveyed and its ability to pay with foreign exchange
listed third. However, its political risk was relatively higher,
ranking 16th, mainly because of its volatile ties with Beijing,

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK URGES TAIWAN POLITICAL PARTIES TO FORGE CONSENSUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A China expert and member of a Washington
think tank on Wednesday urged Taiwan's political parties to begin
forging consensus or risk allowing divisiveness to undermine
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"It is time to cheer for the home team together," said Gerrit W.
Gong, Asia program director and Freeman Chair in China studies for
the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), at a
symposium in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sponsored by Chinatrust Commercial Bank and the CSIS, the CSIS
Taipei Roundtable 2000 titled "The Challenges in the New Millenium"
is the seventh of such meetings of US and local experts held in
Taipei. The scholars and policy-makers met to exchange their views on
a broad range of political and economic issues.</P>
      <P>Gong, a Rhodes Scholar and third-generation Chinese American,
noted that Beijing encourages political infighting in Taipei, but
that Washington hopes to see consensus.</P>
      <P>Gong suggested that Taipei send delegations to Washington over
the next several months, not only to achieve some consensus among US
and ROC lawmakers, but also to work out agreements among the various
political parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, a domestic political science scholar and director
of programs at the Institute for National Policy Research (INPR), a
local think tank, also expressed concern that there's a lack of
domestic consensus, as well as too many "misperceptions" and a lot of
"misinformation" in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lo said that the "best strategy" for the government is to steer
clear of trouble in the Taiwan Strait. Lo suggested that Chen should
first focus on domestic issues to build up national consensus, which
has been lacking -- particularly in mainland Chinese affairs.</P>
      <P>This divisiveness is only aggravated by the fact that Chen lacks
a strong public mandate, he said. Chen garnered only 39 percent of
the popular vote in the March 18 election that propelled him and his
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) into power.</P>
      <P>However, Lo said that the new government now appears to feel more
confident, and perhaps is secure enough to come to the negotiating
table. Whereas previously the DPP's only proposed solution to
cross-strait issues was independence, it has no such predisposition
now that it holds power, and has embraced a willingness to discuss
"three links" and a possible "future one China," he said.</P>
      <P>Lo urged the United States to "encourage" mainland China to come
to the table as well, adding that more dialogues without
preconditions will add to the chance for peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's stance on mainland Chinese issues, Gong said
that it will be "interesting" to watch Chen's attempts to avoid
provocation and yet not to appear weak.</P>
      <P>Gong also claimed that the greatest challenge to the island may
be cyber-security, adding that Taiwan has to defend against possible
invisible attacks from parties who try to sniff out weaknesses in
Taiwan's governmental and civil computer systems.</P>
      <P>Gong said that the concern is not so much that mainland China
will use such tactics, but rather that disaffected groups may be
"volatile" and aim to do harm.</P>
      <P>"Peace is necessary for prosperity. Prosperity facilitates
peace," Gong concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan held a total of US$113.12 billion in
foreign exchange reserves as of the end of May, a figure that allows
the island to maintain its position as the world's third largest
holder of foreign exchange behind Japan and mainland China, despite a
decrease of US$541 million from the previous month, the Central Bank
of China(CBC) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite the one-month drop, reserves increased by US$17.41
billion compared with May 1999. The CBC official attributed the
increase to the huge influx of foreign capital during the past
months.</P>
      <P>Taiwan foreign exchange reserves broke the US$100 billion mark in
August 1999 and jumped to US$110.05 billion at the end of January
2000.</P>
      <P>Foreign reserves then declined to US$113 billion at the end of
March, due to the government's efforts to maintain stability in the
financial markets during the presidential election. However, reserves
bounced back quickly to reach US$113.66 billion at the end of April.</P>
      <P>CBC officials attributed the decrease of foreign exchange
reserves in May to the huge outflow of foreign capital during the
month as well as CBC interference in the foreign exchange market to
bolster the New Taiwan dollar.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A financial executive and economics expert
said on Wednesday that Taiwan is well prepared to face the
"technological shift" of the "new economy."</P>
      <P>Kenneth Courtis, managing director and vice chairman of Goldman
Sachs Asia, said that the world economy is now engaged in a period of
change of the same scope and dimension as the 19th century Industrial
Revolution. The changes are shifting the balance of global economic
and political power, he added.</P>
      <P>Courtis made his comments at the Taipei Roundtable 2000, the
seventh of such meetings held in Taipei for US and local experts to
exchange their views on a broad range of political and economic
issues. The seminar is jointly organized by Chinatrust Commercial
Bank and the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a
Washington think tank.</P>
      <P>Courtis said that he is very optimistic about Taiwan's future,
citing Taiwan's eager embrace of digital technology and the new
economy as a recipe for certain success. He added that those who can
ride the wave across the digital divide will become important
political leaders in the region.</P>
      <P>Courtis noted that in the distant past, American companies were
differentiated between "electrical" and "non-electrical" firms, but
it is now impossible to imagine how a "non-electrical" company could
survive. Similarly, he added that there may be differences between
new economy and old economy companies now, but in the future, there
will only be successful companies and dead companies that are
"dinosaurs in the economic Jurassic Park."</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-chien, former ROC minister without portfolio, noted
that a digital economy is indeed emerging in Taiwan along with its
industrial reform. He predicted increased economic competitiveness
from Taiwan within the next two or three years due to its entry into
the information age, which he said will force mainland China to carry
out its own reforms.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan hospital has reported the first
case of Costello Syndrome, a debilitating genetic disease that causes
a host of physical abnormalities.</P>
      <P>Doctor Ho Chia-wei of Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said
that his patient, a two-year-old baby girl, was born with the
debilitating condition.</P>
      <P>Ho said that for two years, her mother had to endure the stares
of others because of her baby's dark skin, flat nose, curly hairs
and wrinkles on her head, face and palms -- a two year old girl with
an old woman's appearance.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the rare case could not be found in domestic medical
literature, and he is planning to report the case in an international
medical journal.</P>
      <P>Ho said that the girl was first brought for treatment when she
was 18 months old, because of poor digestion and a weak immune
system.</P>
      <P>The little girl's mother said that during her pregnancy, she had 
hyperamniosis, an abnormally large quantity of the fluid in which a
fetus is suspended in its mother's womb. The mother's uterus had 1.5
times the volume of amniotic fluid as that of the average pregnant
woman.</P>
      <P>Ho said the girl also suffers from a hereditary heart ailment,
and she has already undergone one heart operation.</P>
      <P>The doctor said that this is the first such case in Taiwan, and
only the 37th in the world. His initial hypothesis is that the girl's
genetic mutation may have been caused by some sort of insulin
metabolism dysfunction.</P>
      <P>Ho said that as the fat and protein level of the patient is
different from normal children, she has grown to only a little more
than seven kilograms.</P>
      <P>Ho noted that the oldest such patient has reached 38 years of
age, and is still alive and well. He added that his patient has a

      <P>Former United States officials will be
streaming into Taipei this year as they attempt to help break through
the impasse between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Gearing up for the new cross-strait dynamic that is still
unfolding after President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration, former US
Defense Secretary William Perry is expected to arrive in Taiwan at
the head of a US delegation to pitch for a second communication
mechanism between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Perry, who initiated the idea of "track II" contacts in 1998 as a
supplement to the semi-official channel between Taipei and Beijing,
has regularly shuttled across the strait ever since, relaying the
opinions of leaders in Taiwan and mainland China to each other.</P>
      <P>He last visited Taipei between March 7-8, 1999, immediately
following a trip to Beijing. He met with then-President Lee Teng-hui,

      <P>Perry will visit Beijing after Taipei this year, a Foreign
Ministry official familiar with Perry's schedule said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kurt Campbell, former US deputy assistant secretary of
defense for East Asia affairs, will visit Taiwan next week.</P>
      <P>Campbell's Taiwan visit comes after he made headlines in Taipei

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based Beijing official's warning
to Hong Kong business executives to shun alliances with Taiwan firms
that Beijing deems pro-Taiwan independence has caused an outcry in
the special administration region, according to a opinion poll on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the Democratic Party, found 62 percent of
the respondents considered the warning a violation of the "one
country, two systems" principle laid out by Beijing as the basis for
taking over the former British colony in 1997.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent of the 727 people interviewed in the survey
said the warning jeopardizes economic development in both Hong Kong
and mainland China, according to the poll's results.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed about two thirds of the respondents believed
the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region should
ask Beijing to ensure that such interference will never happen again.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Party officials urged Beijing to require its
representatives stationed in Hong Kong to refrain from any remarks
that undermine the "one country, two systems" principle and sap
foreign investor's confidence in Hong Kong's capitalism.</P>
      <P>Although Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa has conveyed to
mainland Chinese officials based in Hong Kong the public's concerns
about their interference in Hong Kong affairs, the Democratic Party
said it is not enough.</P>
      <P>The party called Tung to seek clarification from leaders in
Beijing so as to quell overseas investors' suspicions about mainland
China's 1997 commitment to keep Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalism
intact for 50 years.</P>
      <P>The poll, carried out between June 2-5, was aimed at gauging the
public's response to a Beijing official's warning that Hong Kong
businessmen should stay clear of business figures who favor Taiwan
independence when choosing Taiwan-based partners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR US OFFICIAL SUPPORTS CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior US Department of State
official has voiced support for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
to follow the example of Seoul and Pyongyang in holding a summit
meeting to help forge a consensus on major issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary for East Asia and
Pacific affairs, made the statement in an American Embassy Television
Network program, titled "Dialogue," on Monday.</P>
      <P>Shirk said since both ROC President Chen Shui-bian and
his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, hope to see progress
in cross-strait relations, a meeting between them after a new round
of "Koo-Wang" talks will be a dramatic and appropriate development.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks refer to meetings between Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu and Beijing's
Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) President
Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>The first Koo-Wang meeting was held in Singapore in 1993 to lay a
framework for regular cross-strait dialogue and exchanges in the
absence of official ties. Koo and Wang met again in Shanghai in
October 1998 after a five-year hiatus in high-level cross-strait
contact. Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to mainland Chinese
President Jiang, originally promised to make a reciprocal visit to
Taiwan last year, but Beijing postponed Wang's Taiwan visit
indefinitely after former ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" in an
interview last July. There are signs recently that a new round of
Koo-Wang meeting is likely to take place this autumn.</P>
      <P>In her response to an inquiry from mainland Chinese reporters,
Shirk said the United States has a legal obligation to help Taiwan
defend itself.</P>
      <P>"We are very careful in our arms sales to Taiwan. They are
always purely defensive," Shirk said, adding that cross-strait
problem is really a difficult one that is going to take effort by
the two sides to build a more positive basis for the relationship
across the Taiwan Strait -- through their economic exchanges and
political dialogue.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shirk said, the United States would like to see
"military confidence-building measures" across the Taiwan Strait,
and eventually a reduction of arms on both sides of the strait. "So
that is something that would be highly desirable from the standpoint
of everyone."</P>
      <P>The US State Department published the full text of Shirk's
speech in the "Dialogue" program on its Internet website. In the
program, Shirk held talks with reporters in major mainland
Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
through satellite links. Nearly half of the 20-plus questions posed
by mainland journalists were related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the US public understand that the United States is
likely to get involved once a cross-strait military conflict breaks
out, Shirk said the US public are fully aware of this and that it is
one of the major reasons that the United States hopes the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait can hold dialogue to defuse tension.</P>
      <P>Shirk further said how the United States will cope with a
cross-strait conflict will depend on the actual situation, but she
added that a general understanding is that the United States will
respond if any side uses force in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Touched on the possibility of a cross-strait summit meeting,
Shirk said some mainland people are worried about new Republic of
China President Chen's party affiliation. Nevertheless, Shirk said,
the US government is impressed by Chen's goodwill message toward
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen is a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party, Taiwan's main opposition party until Chen took the reins of
power from Lee Teng-hui of the Kuomintang on May 20.</P>
      <P>Shirk said Chen has laid out the "infrastructure" for
cross-strait relations under his presidency, including the ROC's
constitution, no abolishment of the existing National Unification
Guidelines, and a "four noes" policy, which refers to no declaration
of Taiwan independence, no changes to the ROC's national title, no
referendum on Taiwan's future and no inclusion of the
"state-to-state" theory in the constitution.</P>
      <P>Shirk said the Clinton administration sees some positive signs
in the cross-strait relationship. "We see that both sides of the
strait, Beijing and Taipei, are proceeding in a very pragmatic and
moderate manner, and in fact seem to be inching their way toward the
resumption of dialogue...And this is an effort that is strongly
encouraged on both sides by the United States."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLAN FOR INITIAL DIRECT LINKS TO BE COMPLETED IN 6 MONTHS: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairperson
Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday that the plan for small-scale direct
links between Taiwan-controlled outlying islands and mainland China
will be completed in six months.</P>
      <P>But the government will not fix the timetable for implementation
of the plan as it involves the development of political interaction
across the Taiwan Strait, she told a committee of the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief told the lawmakers that the government is positive
in promoting the small-scale direct trade, postal, and transportation
links between Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu and mainland China, but
priority consideration must be given to national security.</P>
      <P>She noted that the Cabinet-level MAC will complete its evaluating
and planning operations on the issue in six months, with the hope of
promoting favorable cross-strait interactions.</P>
      <P>But Tsai also stressed the need for considering related issues,
such as the nation's security, economic and social development, laws,
the government's overall mainland policy, and Beijing's response.</P>
      <P>On the demand by a local religious group to be allowed to make a
direct religious pilgrimage between Taiwan and Fujian on July 16,
Tsai said that such a direct voyage will only be allowed when the
government completes its plan for small-scale direct links.</P>
      <P>However, she pointed out that it will not be a problem if the
religious group sails for mainland China via Japan's Ishigaki Island,
as it did last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IT INDUSTRY TAKES AIM AT HOUSEHOLD IT APPLIANCE MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The trend of decreasing personal computer
(PC) prices in the world market has affected the profit margin of
Taiwan's information technology (IT) industry, and computer
manufacturers are seeking to shift their production lines to
household IT appliances.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Taiwan-made IT product output totaled US$46,989 million,
making Taiwan the third largest supplier of IT products in the world.
Taiwan grabbed the biggest share of the global market for laptops,
monitors, main boards, change mode power supplies, computer cases,
scanners, keyboards, mouses, and CD-R drives.</P>
      <P>Hardware makes up a fairly high proportion of Taiwan's IT
industry, and orders from leading international brands account for a
lion's share of Taiwan's hardware output. As the profit margins of
Other Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products are declining, the
manufacturers need to develop products of higher value.</P>
      <P>Laptops have been most influenced by the trend of decreasing
prices. In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's laptop output
totaled 6,468,000 units with the value amounting to US$1,794 million,
indicating a 58 percent growth in quantity, but only a 12.3 percent
growth in value as compared with the same period last year.</P>
      <P>At the 2000 Computex Taipei being held at the Taipei World Trade
Center Exhibition Hall from June 5-9, at least 200 manufacturers are
introducing their latest household IT appliance designs to the
market.</P>
      <P>Many international computer manufacturers interested in the
household IT appliances market are seeking alliances with Taiwan's
computer and peripherals manufacturers to take advantage of Taiwan's
solid hardware manufacturing background.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA DOING ITS BEST TO SEAL MOSEL VITELIC DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  7  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian federal government is doing
everything it can to try to seal a deal with Taiwan's Mosel Vitelic
to relocate the company's microchip processing operations to Quebec,
said Canada's Industry Minister John Manley on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Manley, who is playing a large role in the push for the
investment project, said the federal government will do everything
possible to help the provincial government of Quebec strike the Mosel
Vitelic deal.</P>
      <P>Manley even visited Taiwan in person in September 1998 to meet
executives of Mosel Vitelic to convince the Taiwanese company to
relocate its microchip processing operations to Canada -- which would
represent a C$3 billion investment in the country and 1,500 new jobs
for Canadians at the high-technology plant, while indirectly creating
some 6,500 other job opportunities.</P>
      <P>He added that although there has been no major silicon wafer
manufacturer located in Canada to date, making the country relatively
more backward in this field of high-tech production, seeking the
Mosel Vitelic deal is not simply aimed at redressing this unfavorable
situation.</P>
      <P>"The company is keenly welcome to come to Canada because the
investment will create a great number of job opportunities," Manley
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bernard Landry, deputy premier and minister of finance
in Quebec, said the province is "almost certain" that Mosel Vitelic
will formally announce in July that it will set up a silicon wafer
plant near Montreal.</P>
      <P>Landry said it is hoped that the federal government will provide
some C$200 million as an incentive subsidy for the Taiwanese project,
coupled with a 10-year tax holiday to be offered by the Quebec
government.</P>
      <P>According to reports from Taiwan, Mosel Vitelic's spokesman said
recently that the company has ruled out all other countries and areas
overseas for the giant investment and that only Canada and Germany
remain as possible locations.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Chang Dong-lung said that unless Canada comes up with
useful incentive programs, which require legislative approval, in the
near future, the company does not exclude the possibility of choosing
Germany as the location for its new 12-inch wafer plant, according to
the reports.</P>
      <P>An official from the Canadian Ministry of Industry said the
ministry has several investment incentive programs which can be
applied to induce Mosel Vitelic to locate in the country. The most
feasible one is the Scientific Research and Experimental Development
Program, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ANNOUNCES PROPOSED ARMS SALE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 7 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States announced on Wednesday
the proposed US$356 million sale of two electronic systems for use on
Taiwan's US-made F-16 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>Pending the expected approval by Congress, Washington will
transfer 48 AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pods, worth $122
million, and 39 sets of Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods, with an
estimated value of $234 million. The sale will include related spare
parts, support equipment, personnel training, and related items.</P>
      <P>The prime contractors will be Raytheon Company's Electronic
Systems Division of Goleta, California, and Lockheed-Martin Corp. of
Orlando, Florida, respectively.</P>
      <P>A Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pod is the export derivative of a
system known as LANTIRN (Low-altitude Navigation and Target Infra-Red
for Night). This system increases the F-16's capability of flying and
targeting at low altitudes and in poor visibility.</P>
      <P>The United States announced the sale of 28
Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods to Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pods are used to jam enemy
radars and to help the F-16 evade incoming missiles.</P>
      <P>Today's announcement marks the first proposed arms transfer to
Taiwan after the island's voters chose a new government on March 18.</P>
      <P>On March 7, the United States announced the sale of Hawk air
defense missiles and upgrades for one of Taiwan's aging air defense

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that Communist China and Taiwan
are "divided by a yawning gap created by history, culture,
society, the economy, and basic values," is an enormous impediment to
better relations between the two, reported The Washington Post

places.</P>
      <P>"It explains why China's appeals for reunification with Taiwan
based on race, history and national identity, which have some
resonance among overseas Chinese communities, fall largely on deaf
ears on this island of 23 million people. It illustrates why Taiwan's
claim to a separate identity, put forth by Chen in his inaugural
speech, garners no understanding in China," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Pomfret said recognition of this widening gap has convinced some
Communist Chinese officials, particularly in the military, that "it
will take a war for Beijing to gain control of Taiwan. This faction
remains a vocal lobby for action."</P>
      <P>However, he said, Communist China's civilian officials hold sway
in the government for the time being and argue that negotiations
could do more to solve the issue. So far, however, no talks are in
sight.</P>
      <P>"The fundamental issue is that China wants to unite with Taiwan,
while the island and its government are moving in the other
direction. China feels it has all the power of history and race on
its side. Its aging president, Jiang Zemin, is concerned with his
legacy and wants at the very least to avoid being blamed by history
for losing Taiwan," Pomfret said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, however, 45 percent of respondents in the most recent
government opinion poll identified themselves as Taiwanese, while
only 14 percent considered themselves Chinese -- a huge change from
the 1980s when almost everyone considered themselves Chinese, he
said. The remainder of the respondents said they feel they have "dual
identities."</P>
      <P>"China says we have got to accept the `one China' principle
before we go into talks. Well, the basic problem is most of us don't
want that. And we are a democracy now," a senior official in Chen's
government was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Pomfret added that with government monopolies in numerous
industries being eliminated by democratization, Taiwan's economy is
now one of the most competitive and free-wheeling in the world. The
average per capita income is around US$13,000, more than 10 times
that of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Optimists argue that over time, as the economic gap between the
two sides narrows, relations will improve. But almost everyone in
Taiwan also stresses that unless China begins to embrace political
reform, Taiwan will continue moving further and further away, said
Pomfret.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAILS US ARMS SALES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
on Thursday it welcomes any US arms sales that can help upgrade the
Republic of China's defense capabilities and safeguard peace in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to reports that the US Pentagon has
announced sales to Taiwan of two weaponry systems designed to
upgrade the defensive and navigation capabilities of its F-16 jet
fighters.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the Clinton administration will
transfer to Taiwan 48 AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pods,
worth US$122 million, and 39 sets of Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods,
with an estimated value of US$234 million. The sale will include
related spare parts, support equipment, personnel training and
related items.</P>
      <P>The proposed deal, worth a total of US$356 million, is pending
an expected approval by Congress. It also marks the first proposed
arms transfer to Taiwan after the island's voters chose a new
government on March 18.</P>
      <P>The MND would not confirm the deal, saying it is the ministry's
established policy not to make any comment on US weaponry sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon announcement, the prime contractors of
the proposed arms sales will be Raytheon Company's Electronic Systems
Division of Goleta, California, and Lockheed-Martin Corp. of Orlando,
Florida, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon also said the sales of electronic countermeasures
pods and Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods "will not affect the basic
military balance" in the Taiwan Strait region.</P>
      <P>Military sources said Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods are the export
derivative of a system known as LANTIRN (Low-altitude Navigation and
Target Infra-Red for Night). This system increases the F-16's
capability of flying and targeting at low altitudes and in poor
visibility.</P>
      <P>The United States announced the sale of 28
Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods to Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AN/ALQ-184 electronic countermeasures pods are used to
jam enemy radars and to help the F-16 evade incoming missiles.</P>
      <P>On March 7 this year, the United States announced the sale of
Hawk air defense missiles and upgrades for one of Taiwan's aging air
defense radars for an estimated cost of US$206 million.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports and imports registered a
double-digit increase in May, according to customs-clearance
statistics released by the Finance Ministry on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Exports were listed at US$13.15 billion, up 23.8 percent over the

billion.</P>
      <P>The island enjoyed a trade surplus of US$440 million, down
US$1.37 billion from May of last year.</P>
      <P>Continued economic growth in North American and European
countries as well as stronger-than-expected economic recovery in
Asian countries were factors in the substantial increase in Taiwan's
exports and imports in May.</P>
      <P>This was the eighth consecutive month that Taiwan's foreign trade
registered a double-digit increase.</P>
      <P>Exports in the data and communications industries and of 
electronics, steel, machinery, and optical products all increased
substantially, while exports of heavy chemical products grew 29.6
percent to US$2.05 billion.</P>
      <P>Imports of capital equipment, and agricultural and industrial
materials also posted large increases.</P>
      <P>In the first five months of this year, Taiwan's exports totaled

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following in the steps of the first Taiwan
rescue team, which was from Taipei county, a team from the southern
county of Pingtung departed Thursday for Indonesia to help with
emergency aid and search work in the wake of a devastating earthquake
which struck the island of Sumatra on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung team, comprising five emergency aid specialists from
the city's Fire Department and one architect, boarded a China
Airlines direct flight to Jakarta where they will transfer to a
flight to Sumatra, where the earthquake killed at least 117 people
and injured nearly 700 others. The temblor measured 7.9 on the
Richter scale.</P>
      <P>According to the team leader, the Pingtung rescuers did not bring
the tools used to search through destroyed buildings in Taiwan after
the island was battered by a catastrophic 7.3-magnitude earthquake on
Sept. 21 last year. He explained that Indonesian buildings are
structurally different from buildings in Taiwan, so the tools would
not be useful there.</P>
      <P>Instead, the team took life detectors, fiber-optic detectors and
other advanced search and rescue gear, he noted.</P>
      <P>Also departing for Sumatra on Thursday was a medical team
comprised of 12 doctors and nurses who volunteered their services to
aid the Indonesian quake victims.</P>
      <P>The Taipei County team, comprising five emergency aid specialists
and one doctor, took with it 640 kg of rescue and search gear,
including sonar detectors, image probes, electricity generators,
digging tools and satellite telephones, when it left for Indonesia on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Both the Taipei County and Pingtung emergency aid teams were
established late last year after Taiwan was jolted by the killer
earthquake -- the deadliest Taiwan quake of the 20th century -- which
claimed the lives of nearly 2,400 people, injured some 8,400 and left
100,000 others homeless.</P>
      <P>The teams had received four weeks of intensive training in
Singapore earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The disaster in Sumatra marks the first time that emergency aid

    <HEADLINE>LABOR UNIONS HOPE SENATE PROCEDURES DELAY PNTR PASSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite their disappointing defeat in
the US House of Representatives last month, labor unions are
counting on the Senate's unique procedures to give them a chance to
delay passage of the legislation that would grant Communist China
permanent normal trade relations status.</P>
      <P>These labor unions are hoping that the debate in the Senate will
be framed on Beijing's horrible human rights record.</P>
      <P>However, 10 Democratic senators sent a joint letter on
Wednesday to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) and Minority
Leader Thomas Daschle (D-SD), urging them to bring the PNTR
legislation to the floor at the earliest possible date before the
Senate recess, which begins on July 4.</P>
      <P>While labor lobbyists admit they have little chance of stopping
the passage of the bill, they hope to slow it down enough to push a
vote closer to the election in November, or perhaps into the next
Congress.</P>
      <P>"If there is any way to stop it, it's going to be a procedural
issue," said Mike Mathis, government affairs director for the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</P>
      <P>If the Senate passes a bill different from the House version, a
conference committee could send it back to the House, leading to
another controversial vote there, noted labor groups.</P>
      <P>Several senators, including Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Jesse Helms, a Republican from North Carolina, and Paul Wellstone, a
Democrat from Minnesota who are on the committee's panel on East
Asian affairs, have raised serious concerns about Beijing's human
rights record and prison labor practices, among other issues.</P>
      <P>Sen. Helms has also promised a "robust debate" on whether to
grant Communist China PNTR status, which would include a discussion
on Communist Chinese threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.;
and several others told a Capitol Hill press conference that a letter
signed by 10 members of the Senate New Democratic Coalition will be
sent to Senate leaders Lott and Daschle Wednesday to express their
desire for an early vote on PNTR.</P>
      <P>"There will be efforts from opponents to offer amendments that
they will seek to win support for. This bill, in our opinion, is so
important that we are offering our support to defeat all such
amendments, knowing that many of those amendments may well be
amendments of merit that under other circumstances we would support,"
the Democrats said.</P>
      <P>They also called on their colleagues in the Senate to join them
in achieving the objective of early final passage of the PNTR bill.</P>

      <P>The 2000 Asia-Pacific Cultural Summit is
scheduled to kick off Friday in Taipei with the participation of
mayors, officials and delegates from 26 cities from around the region
as well as Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 2000 Asia-Pacific Cultural Summit, the first of its kind in
the Asia and Pacific Rim region, is also the first large-scale
international gala activity that the Taipei City Government's Bureau
of Cultural Affairs has sponsored since the bureau's inception more
than two years ago.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh will deliver a keynote
speech entitled "The Dilemma of Asian Values" during the opening
session of the summit, scheduled to run from June 9 to June 11 at the
Grand Hotel.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cultural Affairs Bureau said that during the
summit, delegates from the cities will take part in discussion panels
on "the differences of Asian cultures, the challenges of
modernization, and the feasibility of establishing a long-standing
mechanism of electing Asian cultural cities" -- models of cultural
development and protection.</P>
      <P>The 26 delegations will also be required to each take seven
minutes during the opening session to introduce their respective
cities, cultures and peoples.</P>
      <P>At a pre-summit press conference, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou noted
that Europe initiated the election of cultural cities and related
gala activities on that continent 15 years ago. Asia, with its
diverse and equally-important cultures, should emulate Europe and
engage in similar activities to help energize Asian cultures as well
as bolstering friendship among the cities in the region.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Taipei Bureau of Cultural Affairs,
said the summit is a golden opportunity for people in the region to
conduct talks on a city-to-city basis. To show that high-technology
is also part of the culture, the entire process of the summit and
related activities will be broadcast online, allowing people from
around the world to witness the activities as they happen, she
added.</P>

      <P>Acting Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan said on
Thursday that he is not optimistic about the way that President Chen
Shui-bian's new government is handling the souring relations between

      <P>Lien, who lost his presidential bid to Chen in last March 18's
election, made the remarks while meeting with John Chipman, director
of the London-based International Strategy Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The former vice president said that Beijing does not trust Chen,
even if Chen has borrowed the KMT's mainland policy and used the
KMT's language. He added that he is therefore not optimistic about

      <P>Lien admitted that Chen's May 20 inaugural speech was moderate
and pragmatic, and was praised by foreign countries, including the
United States and Japan.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday that diplomatic interaction between
Taiwan and mainland China cannot be considered to be the same as a
truce in the diplomatic war between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai said Taiwan has no intention of engaging in any vicious

added that it is undeniable that Beijing is the biggest challenge
facing Taiwan in its efforts to explore Taipei's presence in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>"A greater international role is a must for a nation's continued
development," the MAC chief noted.</P>
      <P>The MAC head made the remarks at an interpellation session at the

      <P>As long as mainland China responds with good will to Foreign
Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao's recent proposal for a truce in the
cross-strait diplomatic wrangle, Tsai said the MAC, in conjunction

feasibility of transforming bilateral competition in international
circles to peaceful co-existence.</P>
      <P>"That would also boost the overall interests of the international

      <P>A 10-member Republic of China medical team
left for Sumatra on Thursday to offer humanitarian medical services
to people injured in a killer earthquake that rattled the Indonesian
island on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The team, composed of 10 surgeons, dentists, nurses and
volunteers, was organized by the Luchu Club, a private association of
medical professionals in Taiwan. The association has long offered
free medical services to aborigines around the island and refugees
in war-torn countries around the world.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-chun, head of the team, said the group will mainly offer
auxiliary medical services to Indonesian quake victims because it
only took simple medical facilities and pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>Most of the mission members are no stranger to offering medical

    <HEADLINE>PNTR PASSAGE WOULD INHIBIT US ABILITY TO BLOCK TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Once the United States completes
legislation to grant permanent normal trading relations to Communist
China, no US administration will be able to block transfers of vital
technology to that country "without risking an international trade
war and sanctions against the US economy from the World Trade
Organization," an analyst has warned.</P>
      <P>Kenneth Timmerman, a writer who has investigated sales of US high
technology to China for six years, wrote in the current issue of The
Washington Times' weekly magazine that the Dongfeng-31 long-range
missile, to be test-fired by the Communist Chinese military, is a
product of the Clinton administration's policy of allowing US
companies to ship vital technology and equipment to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Timmerman said a Communist Chinese scientist who defected had
told him that Beijing "acquired most of the specialized military
equipment and technology they needed for the DF-31 in the United
States with the help and approval of the Clinton administration."</P>
      <P>The scientist described in great detail how technology and cash
from Lockheed, Martin Marietta, and Motorola enabled his superiors at
China's Hexi Machinery and Chemical Company to develop a new
generation of solid fuel strategic missiles that eventually resulted
in the development of the DF-31, wrote Timmerman.</P>
      <P>The State Department bolstered the defector's account in April by
accusing Lockheed of 30 violations of the Arms Control Act and
International Traffic in Arms Regulations in their peddling of rocket
technology to Communist China.</P>
      <P>The defector told Timmerman that the deal with US defense
contractors came at just the right time. "Our factory was in trouble
before I started working there. Then we got a major contract from the
US and things took off." Motorola's contribution to Beijing's missile
program was a result of its deal with Great Wall Industries Corp. to
launch 12 of its Iridium global satellites.</P>
      <P>"As part of the contract, the Chinese agreed to develop a `smart
dispenser,' allowing them to launch several satellites from a single
rocket," Timmerman wrote, adding that this was a feat which up until
then Communist China could not perform.</P>
      <P>"Our US partners gave us the specifications and technical
assistance to produce the dispenser," the defector was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>The help China got from Motorola gave them the ability to build
multiple warhead missiles. For the Communist Chinese, the deal was a
success, but for Motorola, it ended in disaster. The Iridium project
went belly up and they had to destroy the 12 satellites the Chinese
launched for them, noted Timmerman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Martin Marietta, since merged with Lockheed, helped
Hexi develop a so-called solid fuel "kick motor," which is used to
push satellites into earth orbit. "Before we received this help from
the United States, China had never succeeded in developing
propellants powerful enough to be used for strategic-range solid fuel
rockets," the defector said.</P>
      <P>With the DF-31 up and running, Timmerman said, China is now
working on a new ICBM, the DF-41, which will have a range of some
7,500 miles. Intelligence sources say the new missile is expected to
carry multiple nuclear warheads, according to the Cox Committee
report on Communist China's theft of US nuclear secrets released last
May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE'S DEPUTY PM SAYS TAIWAN-M'LAND REUNIFICATION 'INEVITABLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee
Hsien Long said he believes that reunification between mainland
China and Taiwan is only a matter of time.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday,
Lee said Beijing no longer believes that the Taiwan issue can be
deferred indefinitely, but it has not yet worked out when or how to
act on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Brigadier Lee, son of Singapore's elder statesman Lee Kuan Yew,
is visiting Australia as a guest of the Commonwealth government,
which regards him as a future leader in his country.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is quite clear that Beijing would likely take the
"fateful steps" if Taiwan moved to break away from the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said President Lee Teng-hui's declaration of a "special
state-to-state" relationship between mainland China and Taiwan last
July transformed Taiwan into "the single most urgent item on China's
agenda."</P>
      <P>No leader in Beijing can afford to be blamed for losing Taiwan.
They will discuss and assess it carefully among themselves before
reaching a collective view, probably later this year, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, acknowledged that he does not know whether China's
"one country, two systems" formula can provide a basis for
reunification.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has said the formula is not a solution, but that does not
mean `one China' will not one day come to pass because the mainland
is quite determined," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the only player that has the ability to stop a
Communist Chinese takeover of Taiwan is the United States. But he
doubted whether the United States is as prepared to fight as the
Communist Chinese are.</P>
      <P>In his view, reunification eventually will happen, but he
cannot be sure about when or how it will happen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSSIE JOURNALIST RECOUNTS HER HORRIFYING TAXI RIDES IN BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 8 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A veteran Australian journalist stationed
in mainland China recounted her horrifying experience from taking
taxis in Beijing, the capital of the world's most populous country.</P>
      <P>Lynne O'Donnell, correspondent of the mass-circulation newspaper
The Australian, recounted her horrifying experience when she recently
took a taxi from the Beijing Airport to her office in the center of
the city.</P>
      <P>She recounted that when the taxi left the airport freeway, a van
swung dangerously into the taxi's path. "The van overtook us and
half a dozen thugs hung out of the window, spitting and swearing in
our direction," she wrote.</P>
      <P>"When we stopped behind the van at the next set of lights,
the thugs climbed out and walked towards us. To my horror, and
despite my shrill protestations, the taxi driver also got out," she
said.</P>
      <P>The lights changed and the van drove off, she said.</P>
      <P>"My luggage and I were stranded in the middle of a busy highway
as the driver and the louts bumped chests on the verge," she said.</P>
      <P>The taxi driver only said that the thugs had been rude to him.
"What could I do?," he asked.</P>
      <P>Several days later, O'Donnell said she had the misfortune of
finding herself in the care of another taxi driver who happened to
have a flat tire on her way to an appointment. The driver grabbed
her and demanded the full fare for an incomplete journey, O'Donnell
recounted.</P>
      <P>"My attempts to take advantage of a much-ballyhooed taxi
complaints hotline came to naught. For a week, no one answered the
phone, and when they did they wanted details in writing," she said.</P>
      <P>"The customer is king in Communist China? Not in my lifetime," she
concluded.</P>

mid-July, Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Y.
H. Chang said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks for Transportation and Communications

Lawmaker Chen Ming-wen, who expressed his dissatisfaction with the

      <P>Stressing that she wants the complex to be opened for public

put forward a clear timetable at present, because part of the air
traffic control system is still being tested.</P>
      <P>The opening of the second CKS terminal had been originally
scheduled for February this year, but it was postponed because of the

    <HEADLINE>FIRST LADY PROMOTES WELFARE SERVICES FOR SPINAL CORD PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China First Lady Wu Shu-chen on
Thursday attended the opening ceremony for a new activity center in
Taipei for people who have suffered spinal cord injuries or problems.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since
suffering a serious spinal cord injury in an alleged politically
motivated traffic accident in 1985, Taiwan currently has about 30,000
spinal cord patients.</P>
      <P>"More worrisome is that the number of spinal cord patients has
been increasing at a speed of 1,200 people annually," Wu said, adding
that many spinal cord patients are young or middle-aged men, with an
average age of 28.</P>
      <P>Noting that almost all spinal cord injuries are caused by
traffic, workplace and sports accidents, Wu said spinal cord patients
must endure physical inconveniences and psychological trauma, as well
as becoming a burden to family and society.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we should pay more attention to spinal
cord issues and to the plight of sufferers," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The first lady went on to say that she is pleased to see the
opening of the new activity center operated by the Lin Yu-chi
Memorial Foundation to promote welfare services for spinal cord
patients.</P>
      <P>Also present at the ceremony was Cheng Hung-chih, a neurosurgeon
at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital (VGH) who specializes in the
study of "central nerve injury repair strategies" with the aim of
helping spinal cord patients.</P>
      <P>Cheng said at the ceremony that the VGH opened a neural
regeneration laboratory in May 1996 which was authorized by the
Department of Health in July 1998 to begin clinical experiments on
spinal cord repair. "So far, we have performed microsurgery and used
`growth factors' to treat five spinal cord patients whose conditions
have improved significantly with the treatment," he explained.</P>
      <P>Cheng said his research team has performed numerous experiments
on animals and has found that injured central nervous systems can be
regenerated through special treatment using microsurgery and growth
factors.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who is also chief doctor for First Lady Wu, said the
team's research results will be published in an authoritative
international magazine later this year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday
inspected the Ministry of National Defense (MND), where he listened
to defense affairs briefings in his capacity as the nation's
commander-in-chief.</P>
      <P>Chen's first inspection visit to the ministry since taking office
came a day after defense minister Wu Shih-wen confirmed that mainland
China was showing signs of preparing to test fire its Dongfeng-31
ballistic missile.</P>
      <P>Reports have said that mainland China has recently deployed
combat troops and advanced weapons in the Nanjing Military Region.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is widely expected to continue its military
posturing in an effort to intimidate Taiwan's public, but Beijing's
fundamental stance toward Taiwan will not begin to become apparent
until after the August Bedaihe meeting of senior Beijing officials.</P>
      <P>Top military officials, including Wu, Chief of the General Staff
Gen. Tang Yao-ming, and Director of the General Political Warfare
Department Gen. Teng Tzu-lin, lined up to greet Chen according to
formal military protocol, an indication of the significance of the

      <P>The army, navy, and air force commanders-in-chief were also on

    <HEADLINE>`NATIONAL SECURITY TAX' UNFAIR TO LOCAL FIRMS: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposed "national security tax" on
mainland China-based Taiwan firms would be unfair to those companies
if the measure were to be put into practice at present, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the proposed plan would increase the tax burden and
operating difficulties for Taiwan businesses with operations in the
mainland, who are already heavily restricted by the mainland Chinese
authorities.</P>
      <P>As the proposal does not form a part of current or future
government policies, the MAC head said she has not even assessed the
feasibility of the much-debated plan, which was raised recently by
S.M. Chen, vice governor-designate of the Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>Tsai, the top government official in charge of charting Taiwan's
policy toward the mainland, made the remarks at an interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with regard to the long-awaited direct "mini three
links" -- trade, transport and postal -- between the
Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands and offshore islets of
mainland China, Tsai categorically promised to carry out the plan in
the near future.</P>
      <P>Tsai claimed that she will work out a concrete package to
implement the plan within six months, but added that there will not
be a specific timetable, because the establishment of such a linkage
also depends on the attitude of the other side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>However, she pointed out that she will first seek to legalize the
existing clandestine direct trade between the two sides in an effort
to reduce smuggling before imposing the new measures.</P>
      <P>If mainland China responds with goodwill to those measures, Tsai
said the government will then consider also opening Penghu Island to
direct trade, transport and postal links with mainland China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung carried out a successful
12-hour liver transplant operation on Wednesday, giving a woman a
section of liver donated by her son.</P>
      <P>Both Lin Yun-ju, 24 and his mother Wu Feng-ying, 50, recovered
well from the surgery, and by Thursday morning, Wu's new liver was
beginning to secrete badly needed bile, said Dr. Chen Chao-lung head
of a team of 10 surgeons who carried out the surgery.</P>
      <P>The 12-hour procedure involved two separate operations, one to
remove 750 grams, or 56 percent, of Lin's healthy liver and the other
to transplant it into Wu, who suffered from biliary cirrohsis.</P>
      <P>Chen estimated that Lin will be released from the hospital in a
couple of days while Wu will remain in intense care for two weeks to
undergo anti-rejection treatment, as is usual for liver graft
patients.</P>
      <P>It was the hospital's 43rd liver graft operation with liver
tissue from a live donor, and the first case where a son donated part
of his liver to his mother, said Chen.</P>
      <P>He added that people can survive with only 20 percent of their
liver, but noted that most liver diseases are not diagnosed until
more than 80 percent of the liver is damaged and the patient is
already terminally ill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT THANKS VETERAN FOR CREATING SCULPTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
received a special gift at the Presidential Office on Thursday -- a
bronze bust of himself crafted by a retired military serviceman.</P>
      <P>Chen told the maker of the bust, Sun Tien-heng, that he deeply
appreciates the gift.</P>
      <P>"Today is my happiest day since my inauguration simply because of
your invaluable present," an emotional Chen told Sun, who is in his
late 70s.</P>
      <P>Chen, a native Taiwanese who at 49 is the ROC's youngest
president, said he was moved by Sun's sincerity and love of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sun, a veteran who moved to Taiwan in 1949 when the Chinese
Communist Party took control of the mainland, has created many bronze
sculptures featuring ROC national founding father Dr. Sun Yat-sen and
the late President Chiang Kai-shek.</P>
      <P>After Chen won the March 18 presidential election, Sun spent two
months creating Chen's bust with the intention of presenting it to
the new president as a gift. A local newspaper reported Sun's wish
and Chen's aides helped arrange for Sun to present his creation to
the president in person.</P>
      <P>Sun said that although he and Chen come from different ethnic
groups, he believes that Chen will work for Taiwan's well-being.</P>
      <P>"I really admire your democratic thinking and generosity," Chen
said in return, adding that Sun's remarks echo his own constant
exhortation that the end of the election should mark the beginning of
a "grand reconciliation" in local society and the rise of reason.</P>
      <P>Chen said he did not think he deserved Sun's gift. "The people
who really deserve praise and `enshrinement' are the 23 million
residents of this island who have jointly created enviable economic
and democratic achievements with limited resources over the past five
decades."</P>
      <P>The president further said he will treasure Sun's gift as an
invaluable objet d'art and place it in his study. "The bust will
remind me of Sun's generosity," Chen said, adding that he hopes that
ethnic sentiment or rivalry will become things of the past and that
people of different origins will work hand-in-hand to create an even
brighter future for the nation.</P>

      <P>The Kinmen Coastal Patrol detained three
mainland Chinese fishermen on Thursday for illegally peddling
agricultural products in Taiwan waters.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese sampan Tung Teng Yang was gathered with some
40 other fishing boats near the northern shore of Kinmen, when two
patrol boats broke up the group and gave chase.</P>

detained the three people on board for illegally trafficking farm
goods in violation of a statute governing relations between the

      <P>The sampan carried what the coastal patrol said was a typical
family-style smuggling group along with their wares, which included
dates, seaweed, glutinous rice, tea, sesame oil and ginger.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Hsin-bang, interim captain of the Kinmen Coastal
Patrol, the northern shore of Kinmen has long been a blind spot in
the patrol's anti-smuggling efforts because their large patrol boats
have trouble entering the shallow waters in the area.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said that the patrol has recently acquired inflatable
boats and light patrol craft which have allowed increased access to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer remained the top killer of local
people in 1999 and accidents became the No. 2 cause of death for the
first time last year because of the devastating 921 earthquake, the
Department of Health (DOH) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>It was the 18th consecutive year that malignant cancer topped
the list of 10 biggest causes of death among the people of Taiwan,
the DOH said.</P>
      <P>As the 921 earthquake alone claimed 2,437 lives, accidents
emerged as the second largest cause of death in 1999, rising
from the fourth place a year ago.</P>
      <P>The eight other major killers were stroke, heart disease,
diabetes, chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, pneumonia, kidney
ailment, suicide, and hypertension, in descending order.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy trend was that the number of people who
committed suicide has increased steadily in the recent years.
In 1998, suicide made the top 10 killers list for the first
time in 1998 and moved up one notch to ninth place last year.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, a total of 2,281 local people
committed suicide in 1999, or an average of six people killed
themselves each day. Meanwhile, the highest death rates of suicide
were recorded in Taitung County, Nantou County, Keelung City, Yunlin
County and Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>Nantou, Yunlin and Miaoli ranked among the hardest
earthquake-stricken areas. Nevertheless, DOH officials said it needs
a long-term observation to determine the impact of the 921 earthquake
on the suicide rate.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said elderly people were the high-risk group for
suicide, while people of 35-49 years old were the age group with the
largest number of suicide deaths.</P>
      <P>DOH data also show that the death rates of hypertension and
pneumonia dropped significantly last year, while the death rate of
diabetes rose substantially. "The causes for these changes require
further studies," a DOH official said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, the average life expectancy of local
people reached 74.85 years in 1999, slightly higher than 1998's
74.83. The statistics also show that local women lived longer than
their male counterparts. The average life expectancy of local women
was 77.97 years in 1999, while that for their male counterparts was
72.28 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT ISSUE PROPOSED FOR DISCUSSION AT G8 SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Security in the Taiwan Strait is of grave
concern to the international community, and the upcoming G8 summit
should put the issue on its agenda for discussion, a British military
expert commented on Thursday.</P>
      <P>If the G8 group agrees to discuss the issue, it will not only
reflect European countries' high degree of concern over security in
the strait, but will also help ease Washington's difficulties in
"handling" cross-strait affairs, said John Chipman, director of the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).</P>
      <P>He made the remarks to reporters following a meeting with
Republic of China Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao to exchange
views on the international situation.</P>
      <P>Although Chipman said he is willing to raise the proposal with
the world's eight major industrial powers, he also admitted that it
will be a serious challenge, because Japan may not be willing to
discuss issues within its own region, while some European countries
may expect the United States to take the initiative in making such a
suggestion.</P>
      <P>But he added that in any case, inviting G8 countries to discuss
the issue of Taiwan Strait security and making a proposal to Taiwan
and mainland China to resume their negotiations would be a
"pioneering move."</P>
      <P>However, Chipman said he will not suggest that the G8 group issue
a detailed statement on the issue, elaborating that it would be
better for the group to release a cautious declaration to stress the
importance of the resumption of cross-strait talks, because
cross-strait security is of great concern to both the Asia-Pacific
region and the entire international community.</P>
      <P>Turning to mainland China, the IISS head said that to his
knowledge, the mainland is also willing to rekindle talks with Taiwan
as soon as possible. He claimed that Beijing would be unlikely to
overreact if the G8 group were to include the Taiwan security issue
in its discussions.</P>
      <P>The G8 countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia -- are slated to hold a summit
meeting in Okinawa in July to discuss issues related to
globalization, currency policies and weapons proliferation.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Chipman also met Chairman Lin Yi-hsiung of
the Democratic Progressive Party, which now is Taiwan's ruling party
following the victory of its candidate Chen Shui-bian in the March 18
presidential race.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether Taiwan and mainland China should
return to the "one China, separate interpretations" framework
supposedly agreed upon by both sides in 1992, Lin said that it is now
meaningless to argue over whether the two sides effectively reached
any consensus that year.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the most important task for Taiwan and mainland
China at present is to reopen talks to forge a new agreement.</P>

the head of the Investigation Bureau (IB) publicly on Thursday after
an fight between them went public.</P>
      <P>Chen refused to shake hands at the Legislative Yuan with Wang
Kuang-yu, director of the IB, although Wang had already offered his
hand out at the urging of legislators who tried to mediate between
them.</P>
      <P>The scene, captured by TV cameras and broadcast on evening TV
news shows, was only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
      <P>Chen, who has been in office for barely two weeks, was at odds
with the IB even before he took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>He has criticized the bureau's work and pledged to break the
bureau into two or even three separate agencies after he received a
brief from the agency before he assumed office, drawing public
opposition from the IB.</P>
      <P>He complained on Wednesday that he cannot control the bureau
although he is technically the direct superior of the Justice
Ministry's crime-investigating arm.</P>
      <P>Chen accused the national crime-fighting arm of resisting his
instructions and those of ordinary prosecutors, and of probing
criminal cases selectively.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the head of the IB has warned him through various
lawmakers to stop "poking his nose into the business of the bureau"
which considers itself more a private controlling tool of the
country's leaders than a normal law-enforcing agency.</P>
      <P>Although they touched a chord among the rank-and-file
prosecutors, Chen's complaints did not win much sympathy from his
Cabinet colleagues and superiors, with President Chen Shui-bian
making it clear that he will not step into the dispute.</P>
      <P>Calling it a matter for the Cabinet, the president said he
believed Premier Tang Fei can handle the problem properly.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chang Chun-hsiung
told the press on Thursday that it would be difficult to transform the
IB, which is a major pillar of the country's security network, into a
simple law-enforcement agency under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>He also said he hoped Chen and Wang can pocket their pride and
work together for the nation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Security Bureau Director Ting Yu-chou, who is
the country's supreme security official, praised Wang as a
hard-working and law-abiding government official.</P>
      <P>Ting said the IB plays a major role in national security and
cannot be replaced immediately by any other agency. He added that he
believed the dispute between Chen and Wang will be solved through
time once they learn how to get along with each other.</P>
      <P>Also that day, a group of prosecutors from the Chiayi District
Prosecutors' Office wrote an open letter on Thursday backing Chen's
power struggle with the IB in which they claimed that detectives from
the bureau often ignore prosecutors' instructions when probing
criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Noting that many former justice ministers have been forced to
step down after trying to rein in the "intractable" agency, the
prosecutors said they would rally behind the minister's efforts to
bring the IB under control.</P>

cruelty and irresponsibility provoked widespread revolts which led to
his suicide.

born. He extended Russian territory around the Baltic and Caspian
shores, reformed the administration of the state, and founded St.
Petersburg as a new capital.

stop fighting at midnight, surrendering to the Nazis.

1951: The judgment of the Nuremberg court is fulfilled in the
United States as the noose slips over the head of the last Nazi
condemned by the Nuremberg tribunal to hang for "crimes against
humanity." In all, 24 of Hitler's top men were accused on a number of
different counts. Twelve men, including Nazis Hermann Goering and
Joachim von Ribbentrop, were given the death penalty.

1959: The United States launches the George Washington, the first
nuclear submarine with Polaris missiles.

with the Republic of the Philippines as Manila recognizes the
mainland Chinese communist regime.

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT, US CABINET MINISTER TO ATTEND JOINT CONFAB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian and several
senior US officials will attend the 24th Annual Joint Business
Conference of the ROC-USA and US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Councils
to be held in Taipei June 14-16, organizers said on Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Taipei-based ROC-USA Business Council said
President Chen will deliver an address at the opening ceremony of the
joint conference.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from Washington, D.C. said US Secretary of
Transportation Rodney E. Slater has also been invited to make a
keynote speech at the opening session.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the two business councils and
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), a quasi-official organization
authorized by the US government to handle relations with Taiwan in
the absence of official ties, will formally announce Slater's Taipei
visit on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Slater will be the first US Cabinet minister to visit Taiwan
after Chen was sworn in as the Republic of China's first opposition
leader-turned-president on May 20.</P>
      <P>Slater is an old friend of US President Bill Clinton. Both are
from Arkansas, and Slater was Clinton's special assistant for
community and minority affairs back in the late 1980s when Clinton
was the governor of Arkansas.</P>
      <P>Observers said Slater's presence at the upcoming conference
signifies the importance the US government attaches to its business
relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The theme of this year's conference will be "21st century
business opportunities." Hundreds of senior industry and business
executives from Taiwan and the United States will attend the
three-day conference to discuss a broad range of issues related to
information technology, finance and banking, biotechnology, power
generation and energy resources, transportation services and many
other relevant topics.</P>
      <P>Organizers said all conference goers will also be allowed to
attend a roundtable meeting on defense and aerospace industry
development and a breakfast meeting to be sponsored by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei. This will be the first time that
Taiwan participants to the annual joint conference are offered
access to the two seminars. In the past, the two events were open
only to American business executives.</P>
      <P>Organizers further said the agenda of the transportation seminar
will discuss the possible impact on harbor and shipping services of
Taipei's and Beijing's accession to the World Trade Organization
later this year, and that the information technology session will
focus discussion on the impact of broadband technology on Taiwan's
and Asia's telecommunications industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, a special seminar on the delicate
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular relations will also be held
during the annual event.</P>
      <P>Organizers will also sponsor a one-day investment seminar on
June 15 for multinational business groups or financial
institutions to seek suitable joint-venture partners and investment
opportunities.</P>
      <P>The joint conference of the ROC-USA and US-ROC (Taiwan)
Business Councils is the largest annual gathering of trade and
finance officials and business leaders from the two countries to
boost bilateral economic exchanges and cooperation. The event
has been held in Taiwan and the United States alternately.</P>
      <P>Raymond Burghardt, director of the AIT's Taipei Office and the de
facto US ambassador to Taipei, will attend the annual meeting as head
of the US delegation.</P>
      <P>Other members of the US delegation will include Phil Agrass, a
deputy assistant secretary of the US Department of Commerce, Senator
John D. Rockefeller, Frank Carlucci, chairman of the US-ROC (Taiwan)
Business Council, and David Laux, president of the US-Taiwan Business
Forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN KEENLY EXPECTS RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE: KOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been keenly expecting the
resumption of official cross-strait dialogue, which was suspended
unilaterally by Beijing last year, Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China reiterated on Friday.</P>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the quasi-official intermediary body
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said that sometime this October
would be an ideal time for his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, to visit Taipei to reopen official cross-strait dialogue,
according to a report in Yomiuri Shimbun on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Japanese daily, Koo, who is part of an
official Taiwanese delegation in Tokyo to attend the funeral service
for the late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi scheduled for Thursday, said
a visit by Wang to Taipei to resume the long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue is the common wish of most of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo, who is also a senior advisor to the ROC president, last
visited Shanghai and Beijing in late 1998. He said that if Wang finds
it difficult to go to Taiwan, he would be willing to travel to the
mainland to resume the talks, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>Koo noted that as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not
reached a consensus on the "one China" issue, cross-strait dialogue
is conducive to reaching an agreement on the issue. "Both sides can
also talk about unification-related matters, as long as the dialogue
is resumed," he said.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), was previously scheduled to visit
Taipei last autumn for the second "Koo-Wang" meeting -- an event that
was expected to resume the long-stalled official cross-strait
dialogue, the Japanese daily reported.</P>
      <P>The visit, however, was unilaterally suspended by Beijing last
July after the ROC president at the time, Lee Teng-hui, spelled out a
redefinition of the cross-strait relationship as a "special
state-to-state" relationship, which Beijing considered as another
move by Lee promoting Taiwan independence, the report said.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore in April 1993,
marking a landmark ice-breaking meeting of officially-appointed
negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China after more than four
decades of no contact in the wake of the civil war in China which
ended in 1949.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PLAN TO EVACUATE ROC NATIONALS FROM SOLOMON ISLANDS PUT ON HOLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Contingency plans to evacuate Republic of
China nationals from the Solomon Islands have been put on hold after
fighting in the tiny Pacific island nation reportedly eased, a
foreign affairs official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Henry Chen said that
the ROC embassy in the Solomon Islands reported that the rival
parties have reached a two-week cease-fire agreement and that normal
flights in and out of the country should resume shortly.</P>
      <P>After fighting erupted in the Solomon Islands earlier in the
week, the ministry on Thursday convened a task force of officials
from various government agencies which decided that a goodwill naval
flotilla visiting the area would stand by for an evacuation of ROC
nationals until the situation in the country calmed down.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands is one of 29 nations that has diplomatic ties
with the ROC.</P>
      <P>MOFA estimates that there are over 800 ethnic Chinese presently
in the Solomon Islands, including 50 staff members of the ROC embassy
and members of an agricultural mission, all of whom are safe, along
with their dependents.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the latest report from the ROC embassy said that
nine ROC passport holders have boarded the naval ships and are
preparing to return home.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that first priority will be given to ROC nationals
and passport holders, but added that for humanitarian reasons, it
will also do everything in its capacity to help other Chinese
residents.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands has been the scene of ethnic conflict for the
past 18 months. The rebel Malaita Eagle Force, led by Honiara lawyer
Andrew Nori, took Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu hostage on
Monday and seized key installations around the capital in an
attempted coup.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPECIAL OPERATION BENEFITS PARKINSON'S PATIENTS FOR 5 YRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  8  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian researchers have found that the
benefits of an extraordinary operation to help people suffering from
Parkinson's disease can last for more than five years.</P>
      <P>In this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
Toronto researchers reported that the benefits of having a
pallidotomy are long-term. The operation relieves tremors of the
hands and feet and allows people with Parkinson's disease to move at
a more normal speed.</P>
      <P>Pallidotomy involves inserting an electrode into the patient's
brain. An electrical current is used to locate and destroy a
pea-sized part of the brain that causes the symptoms of Parkinson's
disease.</P>
      <P>The patient remains awake during the operation in order to help
guide the surgeon through the maze of brain cells.</P>
      <P>Peter Kingston is one patients who has benefited from having a
pallidotomy. He has suffered from Parkinson's for 30 years and could
barely walk six years ago. The operation has given him back his
mobility.</P>
      <P>"The surgery has turned back the clock on their illness," said
Dr. Andres Lozano, a pioneer in Parkinson's research and one of the
study's authors. "They've reverted back to the stage they were in
their illness five years before, where they were more independent."</P>
      <P>The surgery isn't a cure. As the disease inevitably progresses,
many people have to go back on medication. And the surgery has risks.</P>
      <P>"There are some patients, fortunately not in our hands, but in
others who have died from this surgical intervention. There are
patients who have had strokes and hemorrhages in the brain as a
complication of this procedure," said Dr. Anthony Lang, a Toronto
neurologist.</P>
      <P>Still, Kingston said the risks were worth it. Now he's back
working at his regular job and enjoying walks he couldn't have
managed before the operation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE SHOULD BE DENIED US STUDENT VISAS: FEDERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Federation for American Immigration
Reforms has urged the US government to deny student visas to all
future mainland Chinese applicants because its feels almost all of
them will likely try to stay in the United States after graduating.</P>
      <P>The anti-illegal immigrants group pointed out in its latest
report that Communist China sends more students to the United States
than any other country -- more than 50,000 last year. It added that,
when applying for student visas, all of them promised to return home
after they finished their education in the US, but almost all of them
are expected to stay in the country instead.</P>
      <P>Some mainland Chinese students manage to remain by taking hi-tech
jobs at American firms, earning them admission as permanent
employment-based immigrants. Others marry US citizens, making them
eligible to live in America as immediate relatives. Many just
"disappear" and remain in the country illegally, pointed out the
federation.</P>
      <P>A US immigration official in Beijing was quoted as saying that
his experience was that 99 percent of mainland Chinese students
remain in America after graduating. US counterintelligence officials
say that some mainland Chinese students are spies, ordered to report
what they learn about physics, computer science, and other high-tech
disciplines to the Beijing regime, according to the federation's
report.</P>
      <P>This was also one of the conclusions arrived at last year by the
House Cox Committee on Communist Chinese espionage, which noted in
its investigation report that Chinese students have access to
high-performance computers at national weapons laboratories, said the
federation.</P>
      <P>The laws guiding the issuance of visas state that non-immigrant
visas should not be granted if the interviewing officer suspects that
the applicant does not intend to return to his or her homeland.
"Since almost no Chinese foreign students actually return, that
should be reason enough to deny student visas to Chinese applicants,"
emphasized the group.</P>
      <P>It cited a recent survey of students at mainland China's top five
universities which found that 70 percent of them planned to study
abroad, and most of them wanted to go to the United States.</P>
      <P>There are 128 American colleges and universities that have at
least 100 mainland Chinese students in attendance, with three
quarters of all the students being graduate students, according to US
statistics.</P>

immigrants on Thursday and are continuing to track down their Taiwan
connections, CGA authorities reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>A mainland man identified as Lin Xinchuen, 23, from Fujian
Province was arrested at the door of a convenience store in Hsinying
City, Tainan County. He admitted that he sneaked into Taiwan recently
and stayed at a place arranged by a Taiwanese man surnamed Lee.</P>
      <P>The other illegal, a 50-year-old, identified as Guo Renzu, also
from Fujian, was arrested in Dahshu Township, Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Information gathered by CGA officials shows that "snake heads"
across the Taiwan Strait have been smuggling mainland people from the
mainland to Taiwan at a cost of 21,000-38,000 renminbi per head.</P>
      <P>The illegal immigrants, most of whom are from Fujian, are
transported by mainland fishing boats to waters off the west coast of
Taiwan or the Penghu islands in the Taiwan Strait, where they are
picked up by local connections, the CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Thursday, CGA investigators discovered an illegal

    <HEADLINE>BCC OPENS KINMEN RELAY STATION TO SERVE BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, June 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based Broadcasting Corporation of
China (BCC) formally opened a relay station on the Republic of
China-controlled frontline island of Kinmen on Friday to serve
audiences on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>BCC, which is owned by the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling party
until May 20, said the Kinmen relay station will offer
round-the-clock broadcasting services for troops and civilians
residing in Kinmen as well as for residents in coastal areas of
mainland China's Fujian province, which lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>BCC Chairman Chien Han-sheng went to Kinmen to preside over the
inauguration of the relay station, which cost some NT$70 million
(US$2.3 million).</P>
      <P>Chien said the opening of the relay station marks an end to a
decades-long monopoly of Kinmen airwaves by mainland China-based
radio stations.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, since the relay station began broadcasting
programs on an experimental basis on April 13, FM 96.3 has become one
of the most popular radio channels among military servicemen and
civilian residents on Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The relay station, located on Mount Tawu, the highest peak in
Kinmen, will provide the most popular news, music, fashion and
cultural programs broadcast on BCC's various networks, Chien said.</P>
      <P>"People residing throughout Kinmen can from now on receive BCC
programs all day long," Chien went on, adding: "The approximately 6
million residents of Fujian's Xiamen, Zhangzhou and Chuanzhou areas
can also receive our programs clearly."</P>
      <P>Chien said he believes that the BCC relay station on Kinmen will
soon become the fastest channel for Taiwan investors in the Fujian
area wishing to hear information about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Allowing Taiwan businesspeople in the coastal Fujian area to
hear voices from their homeland will mark yet another breakthrough in
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait," Chien said, adding that BCC is
hopeful that the new relay station will help boost cross-strait
cultural and information interchanges.</P>
      <P>Chien further said BCC is scheduled next year to open a similar
relay station on Matsu, another ROC frontline island off the
southeastern mainland coast, to serve garrison troops and civilian
residents there. Matsu is only a few kilometers away from the
mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit to mainland China by former
Legislative Yuan President Liu Sung-pan is a "purely personal trip,"
an official of the opposition People First Party (PFP) said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chuang-liang, PFP legislative whip, confirmed that Liu took
a leave of five days from the PFP caucus to visit a Taiwan
businessman friend in the mainland, and added that he is scheduled to
return on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chao-jung, who is close to Liu, said the friend,
who has good relations with high-level mainland officials, including
President Jiang Zemin, has repeatedly invited Liu to visit, and has
tried to arrange for him to meet with Jiang, although Chen said the
meeting might not take place given the current cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Chen said that it is difficult to communicate with the mainland
at present, and added that the government should encourage the
private sector to set up dialogue channels to convey the mainstream
views of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He dismissed allegations that Liu has himself solicited meetings
with mainland leaders as "absolutely untrue."</P>
      <P>Chiu also said that Liu received an invitation from his friend
several months ago, and "it is natural" for him to go now. He will
apparently also try to learn first-hand about the situation of Taiwan
businessmen there during the visit, his first to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that a PFP-organized group providing services to
Taiwan businessmen in the mainland is expected to go there in July,
and said that a series of public hearings will be held in late June
to discuss the government's mainland policy and its direction. He
pointed out that Liu's visit will give him a better understanding of
the situation in the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is to open its doors
wider to mainland Chinese people who have married ROC nationals, the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said
it has drafted a bill amending current regulations governing visits
to Taiwan by mainland Chinese spouses.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, director of the MAC's Legal Affairs Department,
said at a public hearing sponsored by the opposition People First
Party's (PFP's) Legislative Yuan caucus that pending approval by the
legislature, the amendment bill will allow mainland spouses to stay
in Taiwan for up to one year per visit until such time as they are
granted residence status.</P>
      <P>At present, mainland spouses can stay for a maximum of six months
on each visit.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, Liu said, mainland spouses will also be
able to apply to revisit Taiwan for "family reunions" after they
leave Taiwan. "And their applications will not be subject to
restrictions imposed by the current annual permanent residence quota
for mainland spouses," he added.</P>
      <P>The new bill will also allow those mainland spouses who have
children with legal household registration in Taiwan to extend their
duration of stay to three years, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Under the new bill, Liu said, each mainland spouse will also be
given a health insurance number, so that he or she will be able to
join the ROC's National Health Insurance program.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Liu said, the new measures can be implemented
from July 1 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>At present, the ROC offers an annual quota of 3,600 for mainland
spouses applying for permanent residency in Taiwan. PFP legislators
present at the hearing urged the government to further increase the
quota in order to meet the rising demand.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said the quota is set in-line with the
government's population policy. "According to the current rules, it
takes only about four years for prospective mainland spouses to
obtain permanent residency here," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STAFF TRIES TO DISPEL MISGIVINGS ABOUT LU'S `BAD GUY' REMARKS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's staff said on
Saturday that she never said anything to the effect that President
Chen Shui-bian will play the role of the "good guy" while she plays
the role of the "bad guy" in the new government.</P>
      <P>The staff was trying to counter the flap caused by Lu's remarks
while addressing the National Forum on Women's Affairs. Lu avoided
the media on Saturday morning, only passing a message through her
security guards that she "would not accept interviews."</P>
      <P>Lu said during her address on Friday that men have been
responsible in the past for causing the tensions between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, and that Beijing has vented its anger on
two Taiwanese women -- herself and A-mei, the pop diva who sang the
ROC national anthem at President Chen's inaugural ceremony.</P>
      <P>Lu praised President Chen Shui-bian's "high intelligence" for
picking her as vice-president and to play the role of "bad guy."</P>
      <P>She also pointed out that Chen also asked Tsai Ing-wen to serve
as the top policy-maker concerning the ROC's mainland policy and
Chung Chin to be the government's spokesman, allowing the "beautiful
voice of Taiwanese women to emanate from the political stage."</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office later on Friday issued a statement saying
that the nation's constitution provides for the president to be
responsible for military affairs, foreign relations, cross-strait
affairs, and major policy decisions.</P>
      <P>The statement said that some people may believe that related
policies or comments related to the above mentioned areas of
responsibility carry a "bad guy and good guy" design, or that such a
design has been used with the purpose of confusing the actual meaning
of the government's policies, but this is "untrue."</P>
      <P>Members of Lu's staff said she "absolutely" did not say that
"President Chen plays the role of the good guy, and she plays the
role of bad guy."</P>
      <P>According to her staff, Lu actually meant that Chen was wise in
choosing a woman deputy, and that mainland China, from President
Jiang Zemin to various news media, which have called her a "traitor"
and "scum of the Chinese nation," have relentlessly launched a smear
campaign against her and have turned her into the "bad guy."</P>
      <P>The staff said that the Vice President does not think the
statement issued by the Presidential Office was aimed at her and
stressed that there is good coordination between the president and
vice president, adding that the vice president will respect the
nation's constitution.</P>
      <P>They said that the timing of the Presidential Office's statement
creates the false impression of a connection to her statements,
adding that the public need not worry about there being poor
communication within the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Sources at the Presidential Office said privately on Saturday
that Lu needs to be careful in her articulation because of her
high-profile position and that her words could trigger different
responses if they are over interpreted.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party urged that the vice president
exercise self restraint and that the Presidential Office explain
clearly the vice presidential powers in order to stave off similar
controversies in the future.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chuang-liang, the PFP whip in the Legislative Yuan, said
that Lu should restrain herself and should not randomly speak on
behalf of the Presidential Office.

      <P>Vice Professor Kuo Cheng-liang of Soochow University even
suggested reforming the constitution to give the president the power
to replace the vice president if Lu continues unchecked.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that Lu's remarks on Friday are tantamount to a
confirmation that Taiwan is using a "double-handed" strategy in the
handling of cross-strait relations, which he said endangers national
security.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that Chen of the pro-independence DPP party has
continued to send out conciliatory messages to the other side of the
Taiwan Strait since his election on March 18, but the United States
and mainland China might question Chen's goodwill and sincerity

    <HEADLINE>ASIA MUST WALK ITS OWN PATH SAYS ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said on Saturday that Asia must walk its own path, rather than
blindly pursue western values.</P>
      <P>While hailing such western values as liberty and equality, Lee
said that Asia cannot just follow the road of western countries. "We
must walk our own path so as to be able to create a new era for
Taiwan in the coming new millennium, because our environments have
become too deplorable," he stressed.</P>
      <P>He said that if mainland China's level of petroleum consumption
reached Taiwan's present level, the entire global supply, at present
production levels, would not be enough to meet the mainland demand,
pointing out that this indicates that Taiwan has gone too far in
terms of the amount it consumes.</P>
      <P>"If this situation continues, we will not be able to secure
sustained development, and this will affect our younger generations,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Judging from history, Lee said Asia has a rich legacy of
contributions to the entire world and claimed that the continent can
make even greater contributions to mankind if it knows which
direction to move in.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2000
Asia-Pacific Cultural Summit, whose focus this year was on the
"Dilemma of Asian Values."</P>
      <P>Scores of representatives from 26 Asian cities took part in the
two-day event sponsored by the Taipei City Government's Bureau of
Cultural Affairs at the Grand Hotel.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou also gave a speech at the gathering,
welcoming the foreign dignitaries with a quote from Confucius -- "it
is a great pleasure to meet friends from far away."</P>
      <P>Ma said this event provides a good opportunity for cultural
exchanges among Asian countries, and he expressed the hope that the
summit could be further bolstered in the future.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwan City Government attaches a great deal of
importance to cultural activities as part of its efforts to build
Taiwan's largest city into a world-class capital by giving its
citizens the chance to fully participate in all these activities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO EVIDENCE OF KICKBACKS FOR FRIGATES PURCHASE: DEFENSE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There has been no evidence that any one in
Taiwan received a commission from the purchase of six French-made
Lafayette-class frigates in 1991, said the Ministry of National
Defense (MOND) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a response to reports in the Paris-daily Le Figaro on Friday,
the ministry pointed out that a special committee consisting of
military prosecutors and ombudsmen at the Military Justice Bureau had
been formed last year to look into allegations that kickbacks were
involved in the US$2.8 billion deal.</P>
      <P>Both Chief of the General Staff Tang Yiau-min and the defense
minister at the time, Tang Fei, who is now the premier, have vowed to
get to the bottom of the case, but the military investigators have
thus far turned up no evidence supporting Le Figaro's claims that
military leaders and former ruling party Kuomintang's leaders
benefited from the deal.</P>
      <P>The MOND said its investigators have asked French authorities on
six different occasions for more information into the alleged
scandal, and the French side's reply each time has not implicated
anyone in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOND added that, according to the terms of the contract, it
is entitled to claim damages from the frigates' French builder if it
is discovered that any kickbacks were factored into the price tag of
the warships.</P>
      <P>Le Figaro quoted anonymous sources as saying that Thomson-CSF,
the French builder of the six frigates, paid a total of 2.5 billion
francs in commission to Taiwan's Kuomintang officials, senior
military officers, and even Beijing officials to preempt their 
opposition.</P>
      <P>The paper said the kickbacks were paid with the French
government's connivance, adding that ROC Navy officer Kuo Li-heng
was imprisoned for receiving a payment of 1.5 million francs from
Thomson-CSF brokers.</P>
      <P>Former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas has come under
investigation for allegedly accepting bribes for the approval of the
sale of the warships to Taiwan in 1991.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MATSU PILGRIMS WILL TAKE LEGAL ROUTE TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, May 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese followers of Matsu, the goddess of
the sea, will begin their annual pilgrimage to mainland China as
scheduled on July 16 by taking a lawful route through a third country
or area, said the chairman of Chenlan Temple on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-piao made the announcement after days of heated debate
on the issue of direct pilgrimages from Taiwan to mainland China. He
said that even if the government cannot complete the measures related
to direct cross-strait pilgrimage sailing before July 16, the
followers of Matsu, who worship at Chenlan Temple in Tachia,
Taichung, will depart on that date as was earlier decided upon during
a solemn ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yen said the pilgrims will take a legal route through a third
country or area, instead of going directly to mainland China, to the
goddess' traditional home in Meizhou, Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Yen said he had pushed for direct cross-strait sailing because he
wanted to spare the elderly followers from the burden of a long and
laborious trip.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the followers appreciate the new government's
goodwill, noting that the Mainland Affairs Council had said earlier
this month that it would present a proposal within a month on opening
the Taichung-Meizhou route on a "trial basis."</P>
      <P>But Yen said that after asking Matsu and deciding on the date of
departure, the MAC backed down from its promise, saying the matter
involved national security as well as quarantine problems and the
issue of which flag to fly on the vessel and would not be resolved in
time.</P>
      <P>Chenlan Temple had planned to lease a Singaporean passenger ship
to directly transport pilgrims to Meizhou from Taichung Harbor,
making a stopover either at the Taiwan-controlled frontline island of
Kinmen or the offshore county of Penghu.</P>

visit mainland China from June 25 to July 2.</P>
      <P>CNFI Chairman K. C. Lin will travel at the head of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>An earthquake measuring 6.7 on the

kilometers north of the Jade Mountain. Five aftershocks with
magnitudes ranging from 4.3 to 5.1 were recorded.</P>
      <P>This was the second time in less than nine months that the
mountainous Nantou County was stricken by strong quakes. The
landlocked country was still recovering from the killing quake which
hit Sept. 21 last year, killing more than 2,400 people islandwide.</P>

      <P>More aftershocks with magnitude of up
to five on the open-ended Richter scale are likely to jolt Taiwan
in the next two weeks, a seismologist warned on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsin Tsai-chin, deputy director of the Central Weather Bureau,
made the remarks while briefing Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun on the
latest earthquake which hit Taiwan early Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>The quake, measuring 6.7 on the Richter scale, jolted the
mountainious Nantou county in central Taiwan at 2: 37 a.m., leaving
two dead and 35 injured.</P>
      <P>Hsin said that more than 100 aftershocks, eight of them
with magnitude of four, have been recorded by 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>He said that most of the quakes repeatedly jolted the mountainous
areas stricken by the 7.3-scale Chichi quake, which had left over
2,400 people dead, 11,000 injured and 100,000 homeless, on Sept. 21
last year.</P>
      <P>Although those quakes had only limited impact on the densely
populated city areas, but they may add to the fragility of the earth
surface of the areas, and thus causing frequent landslides.</P>
      <P>Saying that more aftershocks will come in the next one to two
weeks, Hsin however ruled out the possibility of new quakes that will
be stronger than the Chichi quake.

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S INAUGURATON MARKS CULMINATION OF TAIWAN'S REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Representative Tom Lantos (D-Cal.)
said on Friday that the May 20 presidential inauguration of
Democratic Progressive Party leader Chen Shui-bian "marked the
culmination of decades of political, social and economic reform" of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lantos told the House floor that "Chen's ascent to power -- the
first President not a member of the long-dominant Kuomintang (KMT)
party -- is only the latest illustration of the democratic culture
that characterizes Taiwan in the 21st century."</P>
      <P>Taiwan reflects the principles envisioned by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the
founding father of the Republic of China, when he led the successful
movement to overthrow the Chinese emperor and the imperial system
nearly 90 years ago, he said.</P>
      <P>While events following Dr. Sun's victory have been tumultuous --
civil wars, World War II, the establishment of the People's Republic
of China, and the transfer of the Republic of China to Taiwan, this
history has "strengthened the Taiwanese people and forced them to
overcome obstacles in the way of their freedom and prosperity,"
emphasized the California Democrat.</P>
      <P>Lantos said he is confident that Taiwan under the leadership of
President Chen Shui-bian will continue to work for peace with
mainland China in the years to come.</P>
      <P>He urged members of the US Congress to join him in offering
wholehearted congratulations to President Chen and Vice President
Annette Lu on their inaugurations, and in commending the people of
Taiwan for their commitment to peace, democracy and human rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NP DELEGATION WILL VISIT MAINLAND CHINA TO PROMOTE RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party (NP) will organize
a delegation to visit the mainland to promote reconciliation between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Elmer Feng, NP whip in the
Legislative Yuan, said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Feng said that the delegation, at the invitation of Beijing's
semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), will depart for the mainland next Sunday for a weeklong
visit.</P>
      <P>Before the departure, Feng said the delegation will confer with
Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, and officials of the Straits Exchange Foundation, ARATS'
Taiwan counterpart, to garner their opinions in order to convey a
more accurate voice of Taiwan's government to Beijing leaders.</P>
      <P>Feng said that the delegation members will first stop in Shanghai
where they will call on Wang Daohan, ARATS chairman and mainland
China's top negotiator with Taiwan. He added that they will then
travel to Beijing to meet with leaders there.</P>
      <P>Feng said that the delegation will not rule out the possibility
of exchanging views with Beijing leaders on direct cross-strait
links, the "mini" cross-strait links, and direct cross-strait
religious pilgrimages -- all issues that are being hotly debated in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the development of cross-strait ties is now stalled
over the "one China" row, and he expressed his hope that the visit
will help secure a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted that Taipei embraces the "one China"
principle before the two sides can resume stalled talks, while Taipei
has maintained that "one China" can be an issue -- but not a
precondition -- for talks.</P>
      <P>Feng said that the two sides need a dialogue, as cross-strait
tensions continue to simmer in the wake of the inauguration of
President Chen Shui-bian on May 20, despite his series of
conciliatory notes. The NP official said that his party, which has
long supported unification, is in a good position to help both sides
resume dialogue as well as reduce misunderstanding between them.</P>
      <P>Feng said that six NP legislators have confirmed that they will
take part in the delegation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Outspoken Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara
spoke highly of the Republic of China's former President Lee
Teng-hui, President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a front page Sankei Shimbun article, Ishihara said that he was
deeply impressed by the Republic of China's first peaceful transition
of power on May 20, which the Tokyo mayor had attended.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said that he would never forget the kindness and respect
shown by the newly-inaugurated Chen when he escorted former President
Lee away from the inaugural site immediately after the transfer of
power.</P>
      <P>He compared Lee's facial expression at the time to that of a
Japanese Samurai warrior -- satisfied that he had fought the good
fight. Ishihara added that although Lee's expression may have caused
speculation about his role in the defeat of the ruling Kuomintang,
there is no doubt that Lee is a patriot. He said that Japan's
political scene has lacked such a ruler since the end of World War
II.</P>
      <P>Ishihara also gave praise to President Chen for his determination
and dedication in supporting the welfare and interests of the people
of Taiwan, in spite of assuming power at the relatively young age of
49.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said that he was also deeply impressed by the gentle yet
determined look in the eyes of Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>The controversial mayor noted that President Chen and his Vice
President Annette Lu had been imprisoned for their political beliefs
and have paid highly for their successful pursuit of democracy and
freedom. The sharp expressions in their eyes stem from their devotion
to their beliefs and willingness to sacrifice, qualities that cannot
be found in Japanese politicians today, Ishihara said.</P>
      <P>Ishihara called on all Japanese politicians to emulate Lee, Chen
and Lu. He stated that Japanese politicians should fight for the
interests of the people and the nation, instead of engaging in
factional party politics and infighting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is rushing to prepare
against possible mudslides after an earthquake measuring 6.7 on the
Richter scale hit central Taiwan early Sunday, with thunderstorms
forecast for the next several days.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei on Sunday said the government will allocate
NT$200 million (US$6.5 million) to a mudslide prevention and control
fund.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is still recovering from surgery at Veterans General
Hospital in Taipei, said that the Ministry of National Defense (MND),
the Council of Agriculture (COA), and other government agencies have
all thrown in their efforts in response to the Sunday quake.</P>
      <P>According to government spokesman Chung Chin, Tang telephoned
Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen immediately after the quake and
instructed Wu to order troops in central Taiwan to coordinate with
local government officials in disaster response efforts.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) recently completed a draft
proposal to mark off mudslide-prone zones and limit large-scale
development in those areas. Nearly 300,000 hectares will be protected
from development under the proposed plan.</P>
      <P>Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pei-hsian on Sunday urged the
central government to set up a mudslide preparation fund ranging from
NT$500 million (US$16 million) to NT$1 billion (US$32 million) to
provide for immediate, effective help to the government-designated
disaster area. Nantou County was the epicenter of both Sunday's
temblor and last September's devastating quake, which measured 7.3 on
the Richter scale.</P>
      <P>Peng also noted that his proposal for the military to adopt
mudslide-prone zones has been accepted by Tang. Peng said that
placing responsibility for these zones on the armed forces will be
beneficial to mudslide prevention efforts as a whole.</P>
      <P>Tang was defense minister at the time of last year's Sept. 21
earthquake, which killed 2,400 people. Land-locked Nantou County is

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six activists opposed to the construction
of Taiwan's fourth nuclear plant are to unveil alternative options to
the controversial project on Monday.</P>
      <P>The six, including Lai Ching-lin, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party whip in the Legislative Yuan, as well as five college
professors, have been confirmed as members of the roughly 20-member
reassessment committee. They are expected to contend with five
scholars in the committee who are in favor of continuing the
construction.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs set up the committee to reassess
the project. The committee is expected to deliver its report within
six months.</P>
      <P>Lai and the scholars are expected to unveil six alternative
options to the proposed nuclear plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The options reportedly include the use of alternative energy
sources, including wind-generated electricity, geothermal power, and
solar energy, all of which are better for the environment.</P>
      <P>Other options include liberalizing the power industry by allowing
the private sector to compete in the power-generation industry and
thereby cut costs. The government has already pumped NT$40 billion
into the construction of the 4th nuclear plant, a figure that
could expand by another NT$40 billion if those contracted work on the
plant is stopped.</P>
      <P>However, continuing the construction could be even more costly,
as the total cost of the nuclear facility reportedly could accumulate
to NT$400 billion.</P>
      <P>Other options to be presented include increasing the efficiencies
of the island's other three nuclear power plants, power
co-generation, and measures to conserve energy. Finally, to avoid
scrapping the new plant altogether, they will advise turning it into
a natural gas power generator, which would require building a natural
gas pipeline from Yungan in Taoyuan County to Aoti in Taipei county.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSFORMING TAIWAN INTO 'GREEN SILICON ISLAND' TOP PRIORITY: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top economic policy planner
has said that Taiwan will be transformed into a "green silicon
island" by pooling the strengths of the government and private
sector.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said the idea was broached by President Chen Shui-bian
during the presidential campaign, and that the first priority of a
national four-year plan will be to transform the Taiwan into a "green
silicon island."</P>
      <P>Chen said that to realize the goal, the CEPD has to cease its
outdated thinking, which puts too much emphasis on production, and
find a way to make economic development compatible with environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he is hoping that science-based industrial parks,
which have successfully blended economic development and
environmental protection, can be expanded to the whole island.</P>
      <P>The CEPD will also combine the proposed national pension and
subsidy for the elders so as to efficiently use social welfare
resources, he said.</P>

      <P>The first case of Japanese encephalitis
this year in Taiwan was reported in Pingtung, southern Taiwan,
doctors said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The patient, a 56-year-old cleaner who lives in Pingtung county,

of high fever, headache, and drowsiness. His family originally
suspected that he had got a cold.</P>

adults can also be affected, adding that one's living environment is
the largest factor in acquiring the disease.</P>

more vulnerable. The patient's occupation may also have played a
role. As a cleaner, he may have contracted the disease from a

Pacific country moves toward a possible civil war after a raiding
party from Papua New Guinea seized control of one the nation's

evacuation of Australians and other foreigners if the security
climate deteriorated, adding that Australian troops would serve as
peace keepers if they were sent.</P>
      <P>His comments came in response to comments by John Homelo, acting

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS DPP WINS INCREASED RECOGNITION, SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people's attitude toward major
domestic political parties has changed significantly following the
island's first democratic transition of power, according to the
results of an opinion survey released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,011 adult residents, conducted by the
mass-circulation United Daily News (UDN) from June 9-10, found that
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has won the recognition of
more than half of those interviewed for its performance since taking
the reins of power from the Kuomintang for the first time on May 20.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that the DPP also took leads in terms of
popularity and social image.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 51 percent of the respondents said they
were satisfied with the DPP's performance as a ruling party, while
21 percent gave a thumbs-down to the 13-year-old party's performance
over the past three weeks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42 percent said they were dissatisfied with the KMT's
performance as an opposition party, and 29 percent gave a thumbs-up
to the party's performance.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the respondents were divided over the
newly formed opposition People First Party's (PFP's) performance,
with 32 percent giving a positive evaluation and 31 percent giving
a thumbs-down.</P>
      <P>Asked whether they like the DPP, 53 percent said "yes" while 29
percent said "no." In contrast, 41 percent said they like the KMT,
compared to 40 percent who said they dislike the party, which ruled
Taiwan for 55 years until May 20.</P>
      <P>While 36 percent of those interviewed said they like the PFP, a
roughly equal 31 percent said they don't like the party, headed by
charismatic former Taiwan Governor James Soong, who lost to DPP's
Chen Shui-bian with a narrow margin in the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Poll results further found that the DPP (48 percent) was thought
to be the most dynamic and vibrant among major local political
parties, followed by the PFP (16 percent), the KMT (5 percent) and
the New Party (1 percent).</P>
      <P>Forty percent of those interviewed also said they thought that
the DPP most cares about public opinion; 19 percent chose the PFP; 5
percent cited the KMT; and 2 percent opted for the New Party.</P>
      <P>Asked which party attaches greatest importance to social
justice, 35 percent cited the DPP, compared to the PFP's 17 percent,
the KMT's 6 percent and the New Party's 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The DPP was also perceived to be the most active in promoting
political and social reforms, 46 percent; followed by the PFP, 12

    <HEADLINE>LEE'S VISIT TO JAPAN NOT VERY POSSIBLE IN A YEAR: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China (ROC) Representative to
Japan Lo Fu-chuan said on Monday that one of his most important
missions is to push for the Japanese government to allow a visit by
former President Lee Teng-hui in six months to a year, but that he
doubts that it will be possible.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions in an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan, Lo admitted that chances are slim for the
arrangement of such a Lee visit to Japan within a year, especially
considering the many exchanges of ranking mainland Chinese and
Japanese officials that are scheduled for September and October.</P>
      <P>But Lo made it clear that he will do his best to help arrange a
visit by Lee to Japan as soon as possible. The former Republic of
China president enjoys wide admiration in Japan.</P>
      <P>The new ROC representative to Japan went on to say that he has
met several Japanese political heavyweights, including former
Premier Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, as well as more than 200 Japanese
Parliamentarians to exchange opinions on bilateral relations between
the two countries since assuming the post over two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>In an effort to prevent an impasse in two-way communications with
Japan's younger political leaders and to respond to the Japanese
government's concerns about the new administration of President Chen
Shui-bian, Lo also vowed to further strengthen contacts between
Taiwan and all Japanese circles.</P>
      <P>Replying to lawmakers' question of why bilateral Taiwan-Japan
ties have remained at a low ebb in recent years, Lo attributed the
situation to Japan's serious fear of mainland China and to its
long-standing conservative tradition.</P>
      <P>Lo, however, pointed out that Japan's political sector has
markedly changed its attitude toward mainland China. Furthermore, the
Japanese academic spectrum has also in recent years gained a deeper
understanding of the importance of the issue of security across the
Taiwan Strait, he added.</P>
      <P>He contended that Taiwan in the future should gauge its relations
with Japan based upon a larger framework under which Japan should
understand that Taiwan's multilateral ties with the United States and
Southeast Asian countries are of great importance to security in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Turning to the question of a proposal by John Chipman, director
of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies,
that the Group of Eight (G8) powerful nations include the
cross-strait security issue in its upcoming summit meeting in
Okinawa, Lo told legislators that relevant ROC authorities have been
working on coming up with a policy on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that further discussion would be required
before a decision is made on whether the highlighted issue should be
Taiwan Strait security or Asia-Pacific security.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang lawmaker Chen Shei-saint expressed his suspicion that
the proposal is an attempt to make the Taiwan Strait issue an
international matter, a move which he claimed will undoubtedly
provoke strong protest from Beijing, since it considers the issue to
be internal.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the Taiwan Strait issue is not a simple
question, and the G8's decision on whether to include it should be
respected.</P>

MIT PROFESSOR EMPHASIZES CREATIVITY IN INTERNET ERA</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 12 (CNA) A Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) professor said on Monday that educational systems in East Asia
put too much emphasis on memorization, thereby hurting students'
creativity.</P>
      <P>Dr. Lester C. Thurow, Lemelson Professor of Management and
economics at MIT's Sloan School of Management, made the comments
while delivering an address at the 2000 World Congress on Information
Technology (WCIT) being held in Taipei June from 12-14.</P>
      <P>Thurow also suggested that Taiwan work to emulate successful
high-technology development in Finland, where concentrated efforts in
telecommunications technology have made the Finnish firm Nokia a
world leader in mobile telephony.</P>
      <P>Thurow noted that Finland is a small country with limited
resources, but has nevertheless succeeded by concentrating on one
specific field in hi-tech development, a model that other small
countries should use as an example.</P>
      <P>The professor of management and economics said that an
enterprising society should encourage creativity and tolerate
failure. A US survey shows that most newly-established firms there
experience at least two bitter failures.</P>
      <P>As the world's third largest supplier of information technology
(IT) products, Taiwan is seeking to secure an important role in the
IT era. Thurow said that creative and experienced hi-tech personnel,
good infrastructure and large investments in research and development
are required to make Taiwan a leader in this field.</P>
      <P>Countries like the United States can afford tremendous R&amp;D
investments, he said, adding that the US$300 billion investments in
IT R&amp;D projects in the US represents only 3 percent of the nation's
gross national product (GNP). Small countries will find it difficult
to catch up with leading industrial countries in terms of R&amp;D
investments, said the professor.</P>
      <P>Thurow also pointed out that retail stores have not undergone
many changes in the past 500 years, but traditional retail formats
will be challenged over the next 10 years. With Internet shopping
gaining in popularity, he predicts that by the year 2010, half of all
retail businesses will be forced out of the market.</P>
      <P>In addition to the IT industry, the professor said that
biochemistry and microcomputer technology will play key roles during
the next 50 years. He said that the new definition of "superpower" is
a country that has the ability to dominate the world with supreme
technologies.</P>
      <P>Thurow is recognized as one of the most influential economists of
the late 20th century.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Information technology is affecting the
distribution of wealth and influencing human lives in a positive way,
the head of a US-based computer company said on Monday at the 2000
World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT), currently being held
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Carly S. Fiorina, president and CEO of Hewlett-Packard, stressed
the human factor in technological development and applications. In
her speech "Invent/Reinvent: Strategic Imperatives for the Internet
Era," she specified how the Internet can offer solutions to existing
problems.</P>
      <P>The HP CEO said that her firm has applied Internet technologies
to solving food distribution problems in the United States. She also
stressed that the Internet has expanded educational horizons.</P>
      <P>The IT leader said that a good format for success in the Internet
era can be learned from the Darwinist concept of survival of the
fittest. In the new era, only firms that are able to adapt to the new
challenges of the IT era can survive.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing the importance of the human factor in applying
technology, Fiorina said that information technology is meaningful
only when it can serve the welfare of mankind.</P>
      <P>Noting the HP has been in Taiwan for 30 years, Fiorina praised
the nation's ability to continuously innovate. Taiwan remains an
important source of computer and part supplies to the multinational
corporation, and HP will purchase NT$4.5 billion worth of IT products
from Taiwan this year, the HP president disclosed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the government's announcement of
a plan to work out concrete measures to set up the "mini three links"
in six months, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said on Monday that in
principle, it respects Premier Tang-fei's decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>However, KMT spokesman Jason Hu said that his party will ask the
government to put forward within a month an assessment on the impact
of a direct religious voyage across the Taiwan Strait, now that
relevant authorities have repeatedly said that such a cruise would
affect national security.</P>
      <P>Hu stressed that the KMT's stance is that the government should
take into account the "overall" public interests when outlining
measures to allow direct religious trips across the Taiwan Strait as
well as the so-called "mini three links" -- direct trade, transport,
and postal links between Taiwan-controlled frontline islands and
offshore islets of mainland China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>If a direct religious voyage by Taiwan pilgrims to the mainland
is found to pose no threat to national security, the KMT will
actively push for the legislature to allow such trips based on the
existing legal framework and public support.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT's policy toward the direct religious
voyage is based on its concern for the needs of the people, an
attitude which he said has nothing to do with any "certain temple."
The religious voyage to the mainland has been promoted by Taichung
County's influential Chanlan Temple.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks after he and other opposition lawmakers
visited Tang to gain an understanding about the government's attitude
toward the issues regarding direct religious voyages and the "mini
three links."</P>
      <P>Following the meeting with opposition lawmakers, Fang promised to
work out an evaluation on the "mini three links" within three months,
and to follow up with detailed measures in six months. Any direct
cross-strait religious trips will be first put into practice under
this framework.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, People First Party legislative spokesman Liu
Wen-hsiung said they are happy about Tang's promise. He also urged
the premier to fulfill his pledge that he will push for the
resumption of a cross-strait dialogue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>If the government takes the initiative to talk with the mainland
on setting up the "mini three links," it will help the international

      <P>Taiwan businessmen based in North America

      <P>C.H. Chuang, vice chairman of the North American Federation of

NAFTBA members will officially raise the proposal in their annual

      <P>The former president last visited the United States in 1995, when
he made a trip to his alma mater, Cornell University. The visit
sparked fury among the Beijing leaders, who saw it as a move to

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR UNVEILS ALTERNATIVES TO 4TH NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party on Monday unveiled alternatives to the construction
of Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-lin, convenor of an environmental policy panel under the
DPP legislative caucus, together with a number of scholars from an
anti-fourth nuclear plant group, presented the options at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Lai described six options to replace the nuclear plant as: power
co-generation; upgrading of energy efficiency; improvement of
industrial infrastructure; expansion of natural gas production;
promotion of recycling energy sources; and liberalization of the
power industry.</P>
      <P>Lai and several of the group members are also members of a
reassessment committee set up by the Ministry of Economic Affairs
that will present a report within six months on whether to continue
with construction of the fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Lai stressed that there are supporters within the state-owned
Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) for the building of a natural gas
plant to replace nuclear power generation.</P>
      <P>Taipower was given a green light to build the fourth nuclear
plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, in March 1999. Although it first
broached the idea in 1980, detailed plans to build the first two
generators were only sent to the Atomic Energy Council for review in
Oct. 1997, due to the strong opposition to nuclear power.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) has estimated that it
can build a natural gas pipe that would connect natural gas
collecting stations in Yungan, Taoyuan County, and Shenao, Ilan
County, and then transport gas to the site of the fourth nuclear
power plant, which could instead become the site of a natural gas
power plant.</P>
      <P>Lai said that while it is estimated that the first generator of 
the natural gas plant could be completed in five years at a cost of
NT$10.7 billion (US$326.21 million), the construction of the fourth
nuclear plant is expected to cost NT$900 billion. (US$29,22
bullion).</P>
      <P>Lai noted that electricity consumption by the island's
industrial sector now accounts for 60 percent of the total
consumption, compared with about 50 percent in Europe and United
States, and around 40 percent in Japan and South Korea.</P>

      <P>The majority of local people will oppose
the opening of direct sailing across the Taiwan Strait for
pilgrimage if the Republic of China's national security is at stake,
according to the results of an opinion poll released on Monday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,098 adult residents, conducted by the
Taiwan Area Public Administration Society over the weekend, found
that 87.5 percent of those interviewed said they would oppose the
Chenlan Temple's plan to transport pilgrims directly from Taichung
Harbor in central Taiwan to mainland China's Meizhou islet off Fujian
province if the plan would affect national security.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, if the direct pilgrimage plan poses no
threat to national security, 60 percent of the respondents said they
would throw support behind the plan, but 34.3 percent said they
still could not agree to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that 52.9 percent of those interviewed said
they feel Chenlan Temple Chairman Yen Ching-piao has been pressuring
the government to open direct cross-strait pilgrimage voyage in the

      <P>Meanwhile, 68.2 percent said they think it is inappropriate for
legislators to demand the government allow Chenlan Temple followers
to embark on a direct pilgrimage to Matsu's birthplace in Meizhou.</P>
      <P>About 75 percent said they think the government should conduct
a comprehensive feasibility and impact study before opening direct
religious links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Forty-two percent of those interviewed also said they support
the Cabinet's plan to complete the direct "three links" feasibility
study within six months, and 64.3 percent said they believe that the

      <P>Asked whether they would worry about national security if the

mainland right now, 60 percent said "yes" while 35.4 percent said
"no."</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 64.1 percent of the respondents said

cooperate and exchange expertise in information technology (IT) for
mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that cross-strait cooperation in the IT fields
can help forge new opportunities for lasting peace in the Taiwan
Strait," Chen said, adding that as the top leader of the Republic of
China, he is obliged to improve cross-strait relations and maintain
peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chen also delivered a speech at the WCIT2000
opening ceremony. In his speech, Chen detailed his hope to make
Taiwan a "Green Silicon Island" in 10 years.</P>
      <P>"We hope that our future generations will enjoy not only highly
developed technology but also a clean healthy environment," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the ROC government plans to initiate a
"Humanity Technology Island" to promote a balanced development of
both culture and technology.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the spirit of 'respect for nature, concern for
people' will gradually be fostered, so that technology will not
overburden nature during this time of vast development," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC will promote the parallel development of
technology integration and humanity technology, Chen said it is
expected to integrate theoretical research, applied and industrial
technology into the spirit of humanity and environmental
friendliness.</P>
      <P>"With the technology and product trade to other parts of the
world, I believe positive interaction between Taiwan and our friends
will be promoted, that we will all work together to realize a 'Green
Global Village,'" the president added.</P>
      <P>WCIT2000 is the first global IT event to be held in Taiwan. The
three-day extravaganza brings together more than 1,500 IT experts,
scholars, administrators and business executives from 85 countries
around the world.</P>
      <P>A total of 30 IT heavyweights, including Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates and John Chambers, president and CEO of Cisco Systems Inc.,
will deliver speeches on various IT-related topics during the
three-day meeting.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economics expert said on Monday that a
unified currency for Asia might serve as an economic catalyst to help
solve the cross-Taiwan Strait problems.</P>
      <P>Speaking on "optimal currency areas and capital markets for the
new economy" at the 2000 World Congress on Information Technology,
Robert Mundell, professor of economics at Columbia University and
winner of the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economic Science, said Taiwan
should not consider cross-strait investment interaction a threat.</P>
      <P>He suggested the formation of a unified Asian currency region,
with the greater China region -- mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan
-- as a sub-region.</P>
      <P>Mundell said Taiwan should not step aside from the mainland
Chinese market, and added that the mainland is expected to join the
World Trade Organization and that its marketplace is gradually
opening to the world.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan's success in advancing its information industry,
Mundell said that as the third-largest hardware supplier in the
world, the island should reinforce its advantages in this field.</P>
      <P>Optimistic about the future of Internet-inspired economies,
Mundell said that information technology can help lower the costs of
conventional economies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOME TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES SHOULD BE SAVED: VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said on
Monday that some traditional industries should be helped toward "a
rebirth."</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks as he reported to a Legislative Yuan
committee on a package to revitalize traditional industries.</P>
      <P>The legislators also asked him about a statement Sunday by
economist Lester C. Thurow that traditional industries which are not
viable should be allowed to fail. Thurow was speaking at the 2000
World Congress on Information Technology which opened in Taipei on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Thurow said that while some traditional industries could use new
technology to maintain their competitive edge, many others should be
phased out. He added that as long as Taiwan produces more new and
high value-added products, then it is not a bad thing for traditional
industries to move overseas.</P>
      <P>Lin said Thurow's words may not necessarily fit Taiwan's
situation, and added that some of the island's traditional industries
that have good fundamentals will be helped.</P>
      <P>He also said, however, that the government has only limited
resources, and that some traditional industries that have lost
competitiveness will be unable to continue even if tax incentives are
offered.</P>
      <P>He noted that although bicycle manufacture is deemed a
traditional industry, some manufacturers have dedicated themselves to
the development of new and high value-added products, and pointed out
that their products remain highly competitive.</P>
      <P>To help traditional industries to obtain land for plant
construction, Lin said the government will coordinate a development
fund under the Executive Yuan to provide NT$10 billion (US$324.67
million) to purchase land which can then be rented to
small- and medium-sized industries.</P>

      <P>A Japan-ROC Dietmen Council delegation led
by Chairman Sadanori Yamanaka will visit Taipei in July, Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang met with Yamanaka last week while attending the Japanese
government and ruling Liberal Democratic Party-sponsored funeral
service for late Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on June 8.</P>
      <P>He said Yamanaka had changed his mind about resigning and hoped
to lead a delegation to visit the Republic of China in July after the
election of Lower House slated for June 24.</P>
      <P>Wang described Yamanaka as a heavyweight Japanese politician who
has always been concerned about the security of Taiwan and events
related to Taiwan. Wang added that Yamanaka has a deep passion for
Taiwan because he is a graduate of Taipei Normal School and used to
teach at Likan Primary School in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka helped to obtain pensions for Taiwanese who served in
the Japanese Imperial army and helped to win compensation for local
people who had postal deposit savings when Taiwan was under Japanese
rule.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan will extend a formal invitation to Yamanaka
on June 26, Wang went on.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the ROC-Japan Parliamentary Council, which was
originally composed of KMT parliamentarians, will also be expanded to
include parliamentarians of all parties.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he promoted the idea of a visit to Japan by former
President Lee Teng-hui, Wang said that as the issue is too sensitive

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said on
Monday that the government will try to "modify" foreign workers'
wages so that employers will no longer have to pay them the basic
minimum wage.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative interpellation session, Lin said that
if the move is successful, foreign workers will not be paid on the
same basis as the basic wage for local laborers, currently NT$15,800
per month.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Chin-lan (KMT-Kaohsiung County) said that
foreign workers in Taiwan enjoy a higher basic wage than they can
obtain in their own countries, which she claimed increases local
production costs.</P>
      <P>Lin said that his ministry will hold talks with the Council of
Labor Affair (CLA) on the issue. The CLA has recently proposed
cutting working hours and cutting the number of foreign workers, as
well as raising the basic wage for ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Hsiao pointed out that if the CLA proposals are implemented, it
will deal a heavy blow to the islands manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Lin also claimed that foreign workers actually earn more than the
basic wage in Taiwan, and said he hoped that the situation for local
employers will improve after foreign workers' wages are no longer
bound to the basic wage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LABOR GROUP DEMANDS SAY AT INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONGRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of media workers on Monday demanded
a say in the 2000 World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT2000)
which opened in Taipei that day.</P>
      <P>The National Federation of Mass Media Trade Unions said in an
open letter that workers' views should be taken into account when the
congress discusses on its third and last day on Wednesday how
information technology (IT) may be applied to create better lives for
human beings.</P>
      <P>In what they called an effort to expose the seamy side of the
much-touted "new economy" created by IT, the group claimed that the
new economy developed at the cost of workers, many of whom have lost
their jobs.</P>
      <P>Unless social justice is fully respected, they said, the new
economy will undo hard-earned achievements in job security since the
industrial revolution, and will make workers' lives a misery again.</P>
      <P>Expressing concern that the new economy will lead to a widening
of the gap between rich and poor, the letter demanded that workers'
rights be put on the agenda of the congress and that labor
representatives be allowed to take part in the congress which has
brought together about 1,500 leaders of the IT industry, government
officials and academics from 80-plus countries.</P>
      <P>Citing Taiwan as an example, they said the rush of local media to
enter cyberspace and remain competitive has led to the cutting of
many graphic media jobs and has forced many senior and less-educated
workers to face the prospect of mass layoffs.</P>
      <P>They called on the congress attendees to extend their support for
their demands for Taiwan's labor laws to be changed so that employers
would be forced to offer employees six months of training to prepare
them for finding new jobs before any layoff.</P>
      <P>They also asked for the implementation of a tax on e-commerce to
finance a vocational training program for laid-off workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation
and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital plan to establish craniofacial
centers in Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines and mainland China to
help children with cleft palates, a hospital official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Gung Craniofacial Center primary physician Luo
Lun-chou, the 20-year program seeks to establish one craniofacial
center per 10 million people in these countries. Mainland China, for
example, would need 60 centers, he said.</P>
      <P>Luo said that three medical personnel from the Philippines are
currently in Taiwan to learn craniofacial plastic surgery procedures
and patient-care techniques, while Cambodia will send two medical
professionals to Taiwan in July. These "seed training" initiatives
are being sponsored by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to the center, one in 500 newborns in Taiwan have cleft
palates, but they receive good medical care. Luo and other Chang Gung
medical experts recently returned from their third voluntary medical
mission to Cambodia, where children do not have the same
opportunities for good medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Lou said that cleft palate patients tend to have trouble drinking
and speaking, and some even remained that way until the age of 21,
when the Chang Gung physicians performed plastic surgery on them
during one of their missions.</P>
      <P>Luo added that his center and the foundation will also extend
their training sponsorship programs to other medical fields such as
dentistry and language therapy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAY PEAK IN OVERDUE LOANS BY STATE-RUN BANKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overdue loans by Taiwan's seven state-run
banks peaked in May to a record NT$333.5 billion (US$11.11 billion),
the Ministry of Finance announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Defaulted loans accounted for more than 5 percent of total loans
in all except one of the seven banks.</P>
      <P>Chang Hua Commercial Bank topped the list with a total of NT$50.9
billion in unpaid loans, or 6.37 percent of the money it lent to
borrowers.</P>
      <P>It was followed closely by Hua Nan Commercial Bank, with 5.99
percent of its loans, or NT$46.1 billion, unpaid; Taiwan Cooperative
Bank, at 5.79 percent, or NT$65 billion; First Commercial Bank, at
5.69 percent, or NT$47.7 billion, The Medium Business Bank of Taiwan,
at 5.52 percent, or NT$36.7 billion; and the Land Bank of Taiwan, at
5.04 percent, or NT$55 billion.</P>
      <P>Bank of Taiwan was the only state-run financial institution with
an overdue loans rate of less than 5 percent, at 2.48 percent, or
NT$32.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Ministry of Finance blamed the increasing amount
of unpaid loans to the disastrous Sept. 21 earthquake which
destroyed or damaged many buildings used as collateral for
bank loans.</P>
      <P>The officials explained that the more overdue loans a bank has,
the weaker its health. They added that the MOF has cut the business
tax on banks by half to help them write off the bad loans after the
Sept. 21 earthquake, in the hope that the overall bad loan rate can
be reduced to less than 2.5 percent in five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT POLL SHOWS PARTY RANKS THIRD IN APPROVAL RATING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A poll commissioned by the Kuomintang shows
that public approval of the KMT ranks third after the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the newly formed People First Party
(PFP), KMT Spokesman Jason Hu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the poll sends a warning signal to the KMT, and
added that the party is planning to form a "rapid response" mechanism
to try to narrow the gap between the party's own estimation of itself
and what the public thinks of it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another poll, conducted by the United Daily News,
shows that the DPP led in "satisfaction," "approval," and "social
image," among all the parties, and that PFP also led the KMT in
"political party image," and "identification," as well as "image."</P>
      <P>The KMT began an excruciating period of soul-searching and vowed
to make across-the-board reforms after its humiliating loss to the
DPP in the March 18 presidential election that ended the party's five
decades of rule in Taiwan. Independent presidential candidate James
Soong, a former KMT stalwart, finished close behind the DPP's Chen
Shui-bian and formed the PFP soon after the election. The KMT's Lien
Chan finished a distant third.</P>
      <P>Hu said the results of the KMT's own poll are similar to those of
the local paper, adding that in terms of political party
identification, the DPP was followed by the PFP, the KMT and the New
Party. Hu would not disclose the exact figures of the approval
ratings received by each party.</P>
      <P>But sources said the poll shows that the approval rating for the
DPP was 29 percent and the PFP obtained nearly 20 percent, while the
KMT garnered only a little more than 10 percent. The sources said
they were "mystified" by the results since the KMT had put so much
effort into reform since its defeat.</P>
      <P>In order to try to improve its poor image rating, Hu suggested
that the KMT Central Policy Committee should conduct a poll on one or
two major issues closely related to the public every week and then
publish the results to use as reference in its monitoring of the DPP
administration.</P>
      <P>Wang Tan-ping, executive secretary of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said frankly that the reason the public has lost
confidence in the party is because it has lied to the public, and has
always had the habit of broadcasting good news but hiding the bad.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American	expert in electronic commerce
proposed at the 2000	World Congress on Information Technology that
certain principles for internet policy making should	be defined as the internet has changed everything including government.</P>
      <P>James Gilmore, governor of Virginia and chairman of the US
Advisory Committee on	 Electronic Commerce,	said Tuesday that the
internet has led to	transformations	 in commerce as well	as in
society, adding that	the internet does not	fit into the existing
global structure, which	is divided by national boundaries.</P>
      <P>Since the	old rules of	governing may	not work well in the emerging internet age, Gilmore said	 that certain principles for internet policy	making should be defined.</P>
      <P>The five principles named by Gilmore mostly refer to ethics.
Gilmore pointed out that, first of all, "the internet cannot be a
medium only for	the privileged."</P>
      <P>The second principle suggests that "government must marshal the
internet to become more efficient and	productive in the delivery of
its services, just as the private sector does."</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Gilmore urged the establishment of an	international
order that frees individuals from unnecessary taxes and tariffs that

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING NEED NEW FRAMEWORK FOR RELATIONS: MAC CHIEF (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
craft a new framework for bilateral relations, Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said in a recent interview with
CNA.</P>
      <P>"We hope to negotiate a brave new framework for engagement with
mainland China," the Republic of China's new top mainland policy
planner expounded.</P>
      <P>In her view, Tsai said, President Chen Shui-bian's call in his
widely watched May 20 inaugural speech that the two sides of the
strait jointly deal with the question of a future "one China" means
that Taiwan and mainland China should pool their wisdom to work out a
new structure for constructive interaction.</P>
      <P>The sophisticated but self-effacing legal expert further said she
does not think that the future of cross-strait relations should still
be restricted to just three options -- unification, independence or
the status quo.</P>
      <P>In the face of the changing world situation and the arrival of
the new millennium, Tsai said the two sides of the strait need to use
new thinking to sketch out a new framework for sustainable peaceful
engagement. And the new framework must allow either side to decide
its own affairs, she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that "unification" and "independence" are not necessarily
completely incompatible in defining cross-strait relations, Tsai said
the anticipated co-existence framework should be flexible enough to
accommodate the demands of both pro-unification and pro-independence
members of the general public.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, precisely defining unification and
independence is no easy task. "There is only a razor-thin line
between them," she explained, adding that if either side of the
Taiwan Strait insists on a rigid, clear-cut definition of their
relationship, there will be no room left for flexibility or
"breathing space."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that since Taiwan and mainland China have been
separated for more than five decades, they need room, flexibility,
tolerance and patience to forge goodwill and consensus for resolving
thorny bilateral disputes.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that our two sides can forsake old-fashioned logic
and use novel thinking to formulate a new framework or formula for
peaceful co-existence and co-prosperity," said the soft-spoken policy
planner.</P>
      <P>Tsai came into the public limelight only after she assumed the
top MAC post under Chen's administration. But in fact, the former
international trade law professor at National Chengchi University is
no stranger to cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>She was a commissioner of the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission
and an adviser to the National Security Council during the Kuomintang
government era.</P>
      <P>In the past, she often represented Taiwan at meetings of major
international trade bodies, such as the World Trade Organization
(WTO) and its precursor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), as well as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum.</P>
      <P>Tsai was noted for her sharp mind, delicate sensibility,
eloquence and composed manner in negotiations for Taiwan's membership
or interests in those multilateral trade organizations.</P>
      <P>With her rich experience in international negotiation and debate,
Tsai was selected as a member of a delegation headed by Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top
negotiator with Beijing, which embarked on an ice-breaking visit to
mainland China in October 1998.</P>
      <P>Tsai took part in Koo's two rounds of meetings in Shanghai with
his mainland counterpart Wang Daohan, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS). She was
also present at Koo's meetings in Beijing with mainland China's
leading officials in charge of Taiwan-related affairs, including
President Jiang Zemin, Vice Premier Qian Qichen and ARATS Vice
President Tang Shubei.

    <HEADLINE>NEW FRAMEWORK FOR CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai is believed to be the chief architect of the
controversial "two states" or "special state-to-state relationship"
theory unveiled by former ROC President Lee Teng-hui last July.</P>
      <P>Beijing accused Lee of promoting Taiwan independence by defining
cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" and
angrily announced an indefinite postponement of a planned reciprocal
visit to Taiwan by Wang, which was originally scheduled for the
autumn of 1999.</P>
      <P>Tsai said in the CNA interview that the "special state-to-state"
definition faithfully depicts an existing political reality and
should not be interpreted as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>"What I want to stress is that the `special state-to-state'
relationship' theory is largely compatible with Beijing's cherished
`one China' principle," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she said that as the theory has been "seriously
misunderstood," the new ROC government has decided not to mention it
again.</P>
      <P>"The decision is a goodwill gesture toward Beijing," Tsai said,
adding that the MAC is willing to take any measures conducive to
confidence-building between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Asked about the dispute over Beijing's so-called "1992 consensus
on the `one China' principle," Tsai said the SEF and ARATS indeed
discussed the issue in 1992, but failed to reach a consensus on the
definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>"As a result, the discussion ended in disarray, with each side
insisting on its own interpretation of `one China,'" Tsai emphasized,
adding that the ROC cannot accept Beijing's latest explanation of the
so-called 1992 consensus on the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Beijing said in a 2,000-word comment on Chen's inaugural speech
that it would be willing to resume cross-strait dialogue if Taipei
were to abide by the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>According to Beijing, the "1992 consensus" means that both sides
insist on the "one China" principle -- there is only one China of
which Taiwan is an inalienable part.</P>
      <P>"As Beijing has consistently claimed that `one China' refers to
the People's Republic of China, we were unlikely to have agreed to
this principle," Tsai stressed.</P>
      <P>In fact, Tsai said Beijing itself has many times changed its
stance on whether the two sides reached a consensus in their 1992
discussion.</P>
      <P>"Beijing denied in 1996 and 1998 the existence of the so-called
1992 consensus, but now it insists that there is what it calls
`consensus,'" Tsai said, adding that if Beijing's latest claim were
correct, it would not have bothered to deny the consensus' existence
in 1996 and 1998.</P>
      <P>Asked how the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can break their
current logjam, Tsai said the ball is now in Beijing's court, as Chen
already did his utmost to show goodwill and sincerity toward mainland
China in his inaugural address.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said the new ROC government attaches great
importance to the interaction and long-term relationship between SEF
Chairman Koo and ARATS President Wang.</P>
      <P>"I believe that the two elder statesmen are the persons most
likely to develop the good chemistry needed to reach a consensus on
sensitive cross-strait issues," Tsai said, adding that cross-strait
relations still must rely on the efforts of the two men, at least for
the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she believes both Koo and Wang hope to meet again to
complete their historic mission of helping achieve a breakthrough in
deadlocked cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Tsai said the two sides should make
concerted efforts to pave the way for a new round of Koo-Wang talks
to rejuvenate the cross-strait dialogue channel for sustainable
constructive interaction.</P>
      <P>"We have never stopped preparations for Wang's visit, and Koo has
also expressed his willingness to travel to the mainland again to
meet with Wang if necessary," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the WTO issue, she noted that both Taipei and Beijing
are expected to join the Geneva-based world trade regulatory body in
the fourth quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Tsai said she does not think Beijing will boycott Taiwan's WTO
accession because "essentially simultaneous entry" by both sides of
the Taiwan Strait is an international consensus and a condition for
the United States to grant permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to
mainland China.

      <P>"Moreover, a boycott by mainland China would certainly cause a
regression in cross-strait relations, a development that the Beijing
leaders would not like to see," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As for the opening of direct "three links" with the mainland, she
said the MAC is studying the feasibility and possible impact of
opening direct cross-strait trade, mail and transportation links.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC will give priority to considering the opening
of direct cross-strait pilgrimages to meet the demand of local
followers of Matsu, the Chinese Goddess of the Sea.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she said, the MAC is scheduled to complete a
comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility and possible impact on
Taiwan's national security of the proposed opening of direct trade,
mail and transportation links between Taiwan's outlying islands and
mainland China's coastal cities, commonly known as direct "mini three
links," within six months.</P>
      <P>According to a bill passed by the Legislative Yuan earlier this
year, the government can legalize direct "mini three links" before
the opening of overall direct cross-strait three links to help boost
the economic development of such outlying islands as Kinmen, Matsu
and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Tsai said national security is the top concern in preparing for
opening either direct pilgrimages or "mini three links." Moreover,
she added, resumption of cross-strait dialogue is needed because
Taiwan can unilaterally open neither direct "mini three links" nor
direct religious voyages.</P>

      <P>Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore III on
Tuesday urged government policy leaders from around the world to
embrace the Internet as an opportunity to usher in "an era of the
individual" instead of seeing it as a digital divide.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 12th World Congress on Information Technology
(WCIT) on the topic of "Governing in the Internet Age," Gilmore, who
also chairs the US Advisory Committee on Electronic Commerce, said
that governments need to adopt a new, different view of the Internet.</P>
      <P>Gilmore urged the world's governments to embrace the principle of
universal empowerment by working toward making the Internet as
available to everyone as the telephone is today. He added that
governments should marshal the Internet to become more efficient and
productive in the delivery of its services in the same way the
private sector does, and pass on the resulting savings to the people.</P>
      <P>Gilmore also advocated an Internet that is free from unnecessary
taxes and tariffs on e-commerce. He criticized the European Union's
recent decision to collect the EU's Value Added Tax from Internet
sellers, saying that some of the sellers may not even be connected
with the EU. Gilmore also criticized the EU's recent discussions
concerning implementing rules that would require EU citizens to turn
over their passwords.</P>
      <P>Gilmore said that the Internet is reshaping the business world by
making commerce more available to small businesses and individuals
that were once limited by physical space. He said that all these
businesses can now market worldwide because everyone is "next-door"
on the Internet.</P>
      <P>Other speakers in Tuesday's high-powered lineup included
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, who said that the ongoing industry
transitions will depend on further technological breakthroughs from
Microsoft's partners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This year marks the first time that the WCIT, a biennial event,

      <P>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates on Tuesday
praised Taiwan companies as a key that "made things happen" in the
growth of the global computer industry over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Speaking to industry and government leaders on the second day of
the 12th World Congress on Information Technology (WCIT), Gates said
that the ongoing industry transitions will depend on even more
technological breakthroughs from Microsoft's partners in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gates predicted that teleconferencing, wireless, and voice
recognition technologies will play "a very critical role" in the home
and in the business environment of the future. Real time
collaboration will make businesses more efficient, he added.</P>
      <P>Gates said that a possible transition to a speech interface for
the personal computer of the future is comparable to the shift from
text-based DOS to Microsoft's Windows graphical user environment,
particularly in terms of the controversy and skepticism generated
among industry experts and consumers during the transition. However,
he predicted that speech recognition will become a commonplace
technology in the future.</P>
      <P>Gates described the current phase of the Internet revolution as
one that is about driving profitability and making existing
businesses more efficient. He said that the trend is moving away from
a "presentation network" to a more personalized system that puts the
user in control. Better security and higher standards for software
and hardware products will be a hallmark of the future Internet
environment, he added.</P>
      <P>Gates also predicted that set-top boxes, mobile videophones, and
other market-focused information technology products will make a
splash in the future.</P>
      <P>WCIT 2000 marks the first time that the conference is held in

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the White House, the American
business community, and some Democratic senators have all called for
the swift passage of the bill granting Communist China permanent
normal trade relations status, US Senate Republican leader Trent Lott
said Monday that he would not rush to schedule a vote on the
important bill.</P>
      <P>Sen. Lott (R-Miss) told a press conference that he knows there is
broad support for the PNTR legislation in the Senate and he has
always indicated his support for it. But he pointed out that if the
Senate rushed through trade bills each time they had strong feelings
on certain legislation, they would have gotten into all kinds of
trouble by now.</P>
      <P>He is going to meet with all sides in the next two weeks to hear
the thoughts of people from the manufacturing, agricultural, and
labor sectors and to make sure that the senators will have a chance
to have their say and offer amendments, said Lott.</P>
      <P>Even though a large number of senators would prefer not to change
the PNTR bill, Lott noted that several senators who support the bill
would not want to vote against the amendment proposed by Sen. Fred
Thompson (R-Tenn.) to ban China from further proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction. So he needs time to work out an arrangement for
the Thompson non-proliferation amendment and the PNTR bill to be
dealt with as separate legislation.</P>
      <P>Besides, the Senate majority leader said, he has got to continue
to look for ways for the Senate to move several appropriations bills

    <HEADLINE>ALTERNATIVE TO TMD SYSTEM EXISTS FOR TAIWAN: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rather than include Taiwan in a
region-wide Theater Missile Defense system, the United States could
continue to provide the island with "low-tier" missile defense
technology, including upgraded Patriot missiles and early warning
radar, while giving it additional protection via sea-based TMD on
American warships, according to an American Asia expert.</P>
      <P>Greg May, assistant director of the Washington-based Nixon
Center, wrote in a recent analysis that Beijing's opposition to
missile defense must be studied in the context of China's glaring
vulnerability. Unlike Russia, which has more than enough missiles to
overwhelm a limited American national missile defense system, China
only has around 20 ICBMs, all are DF-5s capable of hitting North
America but take several hours to prepare for flight.</P>
      <P>In the event of a preemptive nuclear strike, "China would be
lucky to get any of its DF-5s in the air. When an NMD system is added
to the mix, China worries that even its minimal deterrent capability
will be rendered invalid," noted May.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, "China believes American missile defense
programs will harm its regional interests. Beijing worries that a
US-led TMD effort will expand America's influence in East Asia and
blunt China's short- and intermediate- range ballistic missiles,
which China uses to compensate for its poor navy and air force," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Most importantly, Beijing fears TMD extension to Taiwan would
create a de facto alliance between Taipei, Washington and Tokyo that
would destroy any chance of China-Taiwan reunification," he noted.</P>
      <P>None of this is to say that missile defense is a bad idea simply
because China dislikes it. "China cannot dictate US decisions and it
is ridiculous to suggest, as Beijing often does, that America has an
obligation to leave itself and its allies completely vulnerable to
missile strikes. However, the US would be foolish to totally ignore
China's concerns, thus insuring maximum damage to US-China
relations," added May.</P>
      <P>One of the key factors that will determine whether the US can
pursue missile defense while avoiding a new Cold War with China will
be whether the US extends TMD to Taiwan, he wrote.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wants to join a TMD system as a way of boosting its
security ties with the United States and Japan. "But given Taiwan's
proximity to China, a costly TMD system capable of intercepting
missiles at very high altitudes does not necessarily make military
sense," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"South Korea has opted out of TMD due to similar cost-benefit
concerns. Rather than officially include Taiwan in a region-wide TMD

    <HEADLINE>MEETING BETWEEN TWO KIMS SEEN RAISING HOPES AND FEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tuesday's meeting between President Kim
Dae-Jung of South Korea and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il is
being forced to carry an "enormous freight of expectations,"
according to a veteran columnist in Australia.</P>
      <P>In a commentary in The Australian, the daily's foreign editor
Greg Sheridan said Kim Jong-Il's recent visit to mainland China
before Tuesday's summit indicates that the dictator could be willing
to implement some economic reforms in North Korea.</P>
      <P>"But if the North were to embrace even the most modest of
economic reforms, and make even the smallest symbolic gesture of
goodwill to South Korea, it could expect substantial aid and rapid
economic benefits," he commented.</P>
      <P>"Of course, there are countless ways in which the summit could
still go totally wrong," he noted.</P>
      <P>"The US is keen for Kim Dae-Jung to press his counterpart on
nuclear and missile issues, especially as suspicion is growing that
the North is reneging on its 1994 deal to abandon its nuclear weapons
program. There is particular suspicion that the North has constructed
a new and secret nuclear weapons laboratory at Kumchangri, in the
country's remote northwest," he said.</P>
      <P>"Be that as it may, if the summit is any kind of success, it will
be the most hopeful development in Korean security for a very long
time," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>But Sheridan also noted that predicting the behavior of
Pyongyang's erratic leadership "is always difficult," citing the
one-day postponement of the summit between the two Kims as an
example.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CISCO TO INVEST 500 MILLION US DOLLARS IN TAIWAN IT COMPANIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chambers, the chief executive officer
of computer industry giant Cisco Systems, said on Tuesday that his
company will invest US$6 million in Taiwan next year, leading to a
total investment of US$500 million by 2003.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference at the World Congress on
Information Technology (WCIT), Chambers praised Taiwan's government
and educational institutions for supporting the local technology
environment. However, he urged Taiwan companies to continue to
innovate, bolster their research and development efforts, and open up
new markets.</P>
      <P>Chambers said that Taiwan's infrastructure developed at a rapid
pace over the past two years, with an expanding wireless
communications market, ever lowering telecommunications fees, and an
increasing number of Internet users. He added that he foresees
tremendous growth opportunities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his speech to some 1,500 industry leaders at the same
occasion, Chambers noted that every company is in transition because
of the ongoing information revolution. Countries that were unable to
catch the first wave of the industrial revolution now have the
opportunity to surpass even Europe and the United States during the
second revolution brought about by the Internet, he said.</P>
      <P>Chambers added that the ability to "keep a finger on the pulse of
the customer" can enable a company to do well in the fast-paced
information society. He said by way of example that Cisco changed its
market approach seven times in a single decade. Cisco now ranks first
in corporate market value in the United States.</P>
      <P>WCIT 2000 marks the first time that the conference is held in
Asia outside of Japan. Industry experts from more than 80 countries
around the world are attending the three-day event, which opened on

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI, BEIJING URGED TO LEARN FROM 2 KOREAS FOR RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC lawmakers across the political
spectrum on Tuesday urged top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to learn from two Koreas to seek reconciliation and a
breakthrough to their current deadlock.</P>
      <P>The legislators made their appeal at a Legislative Yuan
plenary meeting as North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung opened a historic summit in Pyongyang on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao said the two Koreas used
to be bitter rivals, but now they are holding their first summit
meeting in 55 years.</P>
      <P>"Seeing the two previously feuding Koreas get down to talks, I
feel sad that relations across the Taiwan Strait are still mired in a
logjam," said Lai.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker from the small pro-unification opposition party
urged mainland China to show goodwill by suspending Taiwan-targeting
military exercises for one year or at least allowing Wang Daohan,
Beijing's top negotiator with Taipei, to visit Taiwan this autumn.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai advised ROC Vice President Annette Lu to stop
provocative rhetoric against Beijing. He also pushed President Chen
Shui-bian to take concrete steps to signify his sincerity to improve
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that Chen's administration set a timetable for
opening direct trade, postal and transport links with the mainland
in preparation for two sides' accession to the World Trade
Organization in the fourth quarter of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The move can also signify our goodwill toward Beijing to help
foster a friendly atmosphere for resumption of long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue," he noted.</P>
      <P>Wang Tien-ching, a lawmaker from the newly formed opposition
People First Party (PFP), said he hopes the ongoing North-South
Korean summit could inspire Taiwan and mainland Chinese leaders to
seek feasible ways to break their current impasse.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cheng-tse of the Kuomintang, the Republic of
China's ruling party until May 20, said if the top leaders of the two
Koreas, which had fought bitterly in the past, can sit down to
talks, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have no excuse to continue
resisting "detente."</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Lin said, the thousands of detained illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants can be sent back to their homeland as early as
possible and mainland spouses of Taiwan people can receive better
care here.</P>
      <P>"We also hope mainland leaders can forsake attempts to use force
against Taiwan and that the long-stalled Koo-Wang talks can resume
soon to pave the way for a cross-strait summit to craft a new
framework for peaceful engagement and constructive interaction," Lin
urged.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks refer to meetings between Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Wang
Daohan, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang held a historic meeting in Singapore in 1993 to lay
a framework for SEF-ARATS exchanges, and they met again in
Shanghai in October 1998 when Koo made an ice-breaking visit to
the mainland. Wang originally planned to made a reciprocal visit
to Taiwan last autumn, but Beijing announced an indefinite
postponement of Wang's travel plan after former ROC President
defined cross-strait relations as a special state-to-state
relationship in July 1999. Beijing regarded Lee's definition as a
move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN MEETS CHAMBERS, GATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
received Cisco Systems President and CEO John Chambers and Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, respectively, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen, who first met with Chambers, said he was very happy to
receive the leader in Internet infrastructure development, who was
recently named one of the world's most prominent CEOs by Fortune
magazine. Under Chambers' leadership, Cisco Systems has been the
fastest-growing company in the world, and Chambers fully deserves the
title of "digital world leader," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Chambers' success has a lot in common with his own
administrative philosophy. He invited Chambers to be his personal
technology adviser, which he said would allow him to learn from the
executive's success and introduce a more entrepreneurial
administrative culture to government agencies, sharpening their
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Chen said while meeting with Chambers that his major philosophy
in regards to running the country is as follows:</P>
      <P>-- He tries to listen to the different voices of the people.</P>
      <P>-- He is in favor of a government of all the people, because the
success of a country lies in working together rather than in just one
individual's efforts.</P>
      <P>-- His goal is to transform Taiwan into a "green silicon island"
by 2010 so that the island can be a pioneer of the world digital
economy in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>-- He will try to develop a spirit of partnership between the
central and local governments, as well as between the government and
the private sector.</P>
      <P>Chambers also summed up his strategy for success. He told Chen
that running Cisco has taught him that the customer should always
come first, and that a firm should maintain a high level of quality
as well as a loyal team. He added that his company constantly seeks
to use new technologies to upgrade its competitiveness, and always
has an eye on its strategy.</P>
      <P>The Cisco Systems chief said he is very impressed by Taiwan's
technological development, and voiced his willingness to set up a
lifelong enterprise-government partnership with the ROC government to
help Taiwan further develop its technology education.</P>
      <P>Chambers presented a ceramic painting to Chen, and wished good
health and prosperity to the Republic of China's new head of state
and its people.</P>
      <P>Chen described his meeting with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates as
a kind of summit, noting a slogan of his presidential campaign --
"young leaders, world trend."</P>
      <P>Chen said he had been criticized by his rivals for being too
young to vie for the presidential post. Chen again dismissed such
criticism, pointing out that Gates had established Microsoft at the
tender age of 19.</P>
      <P>Chen said in the meeting with Gates that any entity that wants to
keep a competitive edge -- whether a government, an enterprise, or an
individual -- must follow two principles: it must maintain a high
degree of creativity and invention, and have the courage to face
failure so as to quickly get rid of old burdens and move toward
broader new horizons.</P>
      <P>Thanking Chen for his time, Gates said Taiwan's choice of Chen as
the nation's new leader is a very important development which carries
a special significance.</P>
      <P>Gates hailed the efforts made by ROC authorities to sponsor the
2000 World Congress on Information Technology currently being held in
Taipei, and said the event provides a good opportunity for all
information technology figures to exchange their opinions and seek
out new partners.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIA'S YOUNGEST HEART TRANSPLANT PATIENT CHECKS OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's youngest heart transplant patient
checked out of National Taiwan University Hospital on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi-kai underwent the heart transplant operation at the
same hospital in March, when he was only five months old. He weighed
just four kilograms at the time, but has grown to 5.1 kilograms since
the surgery.</P>
      <P>Chang was diagnosed as suffering from hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle, right after his birth
in late September. He soon developed the symptoms of restlessness,
cold sweats, and dyspnea, or difficulty in breathing.</P>
      <P>Chang also showed no appetite, and was growing more slowly than
normal. Doctors told his family that the only way to save him would
be to undergo the heart transplant operation.</P>
      <P>After five months of waiting, Chang received a replacement heart
from a one-year-old baby who had died of a brain tumor.</P>
      <P>After the surgery, Chang's system has shown only very mild signs
of rejecting his new heart. Under the hospital's excellent care, he
has become more lively than ever before.</P>
      <P>Although he currently consumes half of his baby formula through a
tube feed, it is better than before when he could not even have baby
formula, said his grandmother.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wang Shui-shen, a surgeon at the university hospital, said
that the new heart has, by itself, shrunk to fit inside Chang's chest
cavity, and that it will grow with Chang in the future.</P>
      <P>Wang said that performing a heart transplant operation is safer
in patients who have reached 10 years of age, since the risk for
patients under 10 is five to six times greater than that of adults.
He added that Chang is the youngest person in Asia to have received a
heart transplant operation.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said on Tuesday
that Taiwan and mainland China should work to boost mutual
understanding and bilateral exchanges after a separation of more than
50 years.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when meeting with US Senator John Rockefeller
(D-W.V.), who is currently visiting Taipei to attend the 12th World
Congress on Information Technology and the 24th annual joint Business
Conference of the US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council and the ROC-USA
Business Council.</P>
      <P>Lu thanked Rockefeller for his long-standing support of the
Republic of China, and expressed the hope that the senator will
continue to back Taiwan in the US Congress.</P>
      <P>The vice president also asked about the current status of
entrepreneurial cooperation between Taiwan and West Virginia, saying
that she would be very happy to see even greater fruit from two-way
cooperative ventures.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller, who has long maintained very close relations with
Taiwan, said he is also very concerned about the development of
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and underscored
the importance of maintaining security in the strait.</P>
      <P>As a good friend of the ROC, Rockefeller promised to continue
supporting Taiwan and providing advice to the ROC government.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller also paid a visit to Premier Tang-fei later the same
day. He took the opportunity to hail Chen's recent efforts to reduce
cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>According to the US senator, Chen's remarks on cross-strait
relations have been quite appropriate, and the US side feels that his
words have to some extent helped dissolve bilateral tensions between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Teng praised Rockefeller as a genuine friend, and urged the US

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed on
Tuesday that the Republic of China is willing to open dialogue and
negotiations with mainland China on the principles of parity,
democracy and goodwill.</P>
      <P>Chen made the vow during a tea party held at the Presidential
Office in honor of resident representatives of countries with which
the ROC does not maintain formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The president said he is hopeful that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can resume dialogue and work hand-in-hand to ensure
peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the ROC government will pool wisdom and
resources with private groups to promote "total diplomacy" with a
view to strengthening exchanges and cooperation with countries
around the world and to participating in as many international
organizations and activities as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen and Vice President Annette Lu jointly hosted the tea party
to express their gratitude for the attendance of foreign envoys at
their May 20 inauguration, which also marked the ROC's first
democratic transition of power from the long-ruling Kuomintang to
the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chen, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, also expressed
thanks to all the foreign resident representatives for their
contributions to promoting bilateral relations between the ROC and
their home countries.</P>
      <P>As an economically free and prosperous democracy, Chen said, the
ROC is more than willing and can afford to take part in international
humanitarian aid or relief projects.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said because of Beijing's constant boycott, the ROC
has been shut out of many international organizations and unable to
forge normal diplomatic relations with major countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate all the support your countries have given to us
for our bid to join major international organizations and activities
in past years. And we hope your countries can offer us even more
recognition and support for our national cause in the future so that
we can join forces with the international community to create a new
century of peace and prosperity," the president urged.</P>
      <P>More than 60 resident foreign representatives and their spouses
attended the tea party. Among the participants was Raymond
Burghardt, head of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in
Taiwan, which represents US interests in Taiwan in the absence of

      <P>A group of
osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) patients, more commonly known as the
"glass babies," left for Tokyo Tuesday to embark on the first ever
overseas trip of their lives.</P>
      <P>Thirteen OI patients, whose ages range from 5 to 35, will be
accompanied by 32 volunteer social workers, family members and
medical personnel during their four-day tour of Japan, which will
include a day at Tokyo's Disneyland -- a mecca for most children in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Cathay Pacific donated the air tickets and accommodation in Japan
for the 13 OI patients, who suffer a hereditary disease characterized
by abnormally brittle, easily fractured bones. The remaining 32
visitors paid their own fees, according to the Taipei-based Chinese
OI Patients Association.</P>
      <P>The patients suffer from a deficiency of typelprocollogen, a
fibrous protein constituent of bones and cartilage, tendons, and
other connective tissues. Their physical problems involve abnormally
developed teeth and bones, as well as eyesight and hearing problems.</P>
      <P>The patients don't grow normally, and are usually baby-sized even
when they reach the age of adulthood. They also have weak hearing and
grayish-blue sclera, the normally white fibrous tissue that covers
all of the eyeball except the cornea.</P>
      <P>Lin Li-chih, founder of the Chinese OI Patients Association and a
"glass baby" himself, said at the age of 29, he has the same mind and
intelligence of a normal grown man, but with a body of a
three-year-old child -- coupled with brittle, easily fractured bones.
He added that he will need to be taken care of all his life, and
cannot move around without a wheelchair.</P>
      <P>An 11-year-old female OI sufferer surnamed Lin, who is among the
tour group, lay in a wheelchair looking like a one-year-old baby. She
said that she is thrilled to be able to board an airplane to fly

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said on
Tuesday that he listened carefully to the "voice of the people"
during his 12 years as Taiwan's head of state.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks when he received around 40 representatives
of Taiwan businessmen from the world who had come to pay tribute to
the former president.</P>
      <P>In a 30-minute address, Lee also said that he was receiving the
representatives as "old friends."</P>
      <P>He noted the three features of Taiwan's business councils, saying
that they have pooled the strength of Taiwan businessmen around the
world, that they have prepared Taiwan for the introduction of high
technology to upgrade the development of local technology, and that
they have played a role in establishing close relations with
neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said that with Taiwan business investment around the world
totaling US$150 billion and with its foreign exchange reserves of
US$120 billion, the two figures combined makes its economic might
"even stronger than Japan's."</P>

      <P>He expressed the hopes that Central Bank of China will help
Taiwan businessmen solve their financing problems, that the Ministry
of Education will help with the education of the children of Taiwan
businessmen, and that Taiwan businessmen will cooperate with each in
the field of information exchange.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that he was happy to see the peaceful transfer of
political power. But he did not respond to calls from his visitors
that he continue to lead the Kuomintang, which has been in disarray
since its humiliating defeat in the March 18 presidential election.
Lee stepped down as party chairman to take responsibility for the

      <P>The US International Trade Commission
(ITC) on Monday ruled in favor of Taiwan at the second remand of a
final antidumping investigation on imports of static random access
memory (SRAM) semiconductors from Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) urged Beijing on Tuesday to resume cross-Taiwan Strait
dialogue as soon as possible in line with the world trend of
reconciliation and peace.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin noted that the leaders of South
and North Korea started a historic summit in Pyongyang on Tuesday,
which is expected to produce positive effects on peace on the Korean
peninsula and on the security and stability of the East Asia region.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Korean summit is a significant event that proves
that two sides with differing political stances and systems can
establish dialogue and communication channels as long as they try to
eliminate the differences in their political stances in order to
pursue reconciliation and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Echoing ROC President Chen Shui-bian's words in his inaugural
speech on May 20 that "now is a new opportunity for the two sides (of
the Taiwan Strait) to create an era of reconciliation together," the
MAC official urged the mainland Chinese authorities to work with the
ROC to normalize cross-strait relations and resume as soon as
possible bilateral dialogue and negotiations based on the existing
foundation.</P>
      <P>If the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can move in the same
direction, a summit between the leaders of the two sides is
foreseeable, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said the Korean
summit will not only help promote the security of Northeast Asia, but
will also bring detente to the tense cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen added that officials of the ROC's
representative office in South Korea will closely observe the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Microsoft Corp. will establish a Windows
hardware quality lab (WHQL) in Taipei to allow more Taiwan makers of
computer hardware to acquire "Windows certificates," Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates said in Taipei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference on the second day of the biennial 2000
World Congress on Information Technology, Gates said the Microsoft
WHQL will help accelerate marketing in world markets of hardware and
related products produced by local manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Gates also said software remains the key to global business in
the future at a time when many enterprises are seeking new
possibilities to further expand their businesses in the Internet
arena.</P>
      <P>Gates said Microsoft will continue to reinforce creativity in
more complex broadband technology, guaranteed-secure Internet
transactions, personal computers fitted with microphones, and
wireless telephones with computer screens.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Microsoft's ideal is to create a new service
platform to bring about numerous business opportunities for thousands
of companies and clients that cooperate with Microsoft.</P>
      <P>Gates said that Internet business is now swiftly entering its
third stage -- an Internet service that is very personalized that
will allow enterprises, consumers and program developers to obtain
tailor-made services at any time, anywhere, using any
Internet-compatible equipment.</P>
      <P>Answering questions about a court-ordered breakup of Microsoft,
Gates described the federal ruling as an "unfortunate distraction"
that he believed will eventually be resolved in Microsoft's favor.</P>
      <P>He claimed last week's ruling, which imposed restrictions on
Microsoft's business conduct, "did not reflect reality" and was a
"rewriting of the rules" in terms of giving consumers a choice of
products.</P>
      <P>"We all know this is a fast-paced competitive business. We thrive
on competition. If anything, the most this kind of misguided lawsuit
can do is to draw our team together," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PYONGYANG SUMMIT INSPIRATIONAL TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC Vice President Lien Chan said
on Tuesday that the ongoing summit between South Korea and its
reclusive northern neighbor is inspirational to relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien, now the acting chairman of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's ruling
party until May 20, further said whether the historic meeting in
Pyongyang between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and his North
Korean counterpart Kim Jong-il can succeed depends on the previous
preparatory works and the current general environment.</P>
      <P>As for the possible impact on cross-Taiwan Strait relations of
the "two Kims" summit, Lien said it needs further observation and
study.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland
Affairs Research Department, said he sees little possibility for the
top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to meet in the
foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>Chang said although there is no immediate crisis of the eruption
of a military conflict between the two sides, their relations
remain deadlocked.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the two Koreas basically enjoy an
equal status and that neither of them forsakes the goal of
eventual unification. "The relations between them can be defined as
a special state-to-state relationship," he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to cross-strait relations, Chang said when the KMT was
in power, it repeatedly urged the mainland Chinese government to
accept the concept -- "China is a divided country."</P>
      <P>"However, Beijing consistently rejected the KMT's call,
insisting that Beijing itself, not Taiwan, has inherited China's
sovereignty," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, mainland China has traditionally
harbored a "bullying mentality" toward Taiwan due to their huge gap
in size and population.</P>
      <P>"Mainland leaders have been unwilling to face up to the
cold reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been
separately ruled and do not subject themselves to each other's
jurisdiction," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He recalled that Taiwan has long welcomed top mainland
leaders to visit the island. "In 1995, then-ROC President Lee
Teng-hui suggested that he and his mainland counterpart, Jiang
Zemin, met in an international setting. However, Jiang bluntly
snubbed the proposal."</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chang said he thinks that chances for a
cross-strait summit in the foreseeable future are slim.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the current "two Kims" summit, Chang Wu-yueh, head
of the Tamkang University's Mainland Affairs Research Institute,
said mainland China should draw inspiration from the development of
Seoul-Pyongyang relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two Koreas have conducted official contacts since
1972 and have consistently treated each other on an equal footing in
the international community. "Neither of them worries that their
engagement on an equal footing would result in permanent
division," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further said as mainland China's land area is 270 times that
of Taiwan and its population 60 times Taiwan's, Beijing leaders need
not worry that treating Taiwan as an equal would drive Taiwan farther
away or hinder eventual unification of the two sides.</P>

      <P>Hewlett-Packard (HP) CEO Carly Fiorina on
Tuesday lauded the entrepreneurial spirit of Taiwan manufacturers and
the resolute policy of the government, factors which she said are
bound to turn Taiwan into a "green silicon island."</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council, Fiorina squeezed some time out of her tight
schedule to feature in an ad in which she echoed her words on the
opening day of the World Congress 2000 on Information Technology
(WCIT) to promote the excellence of made-in-Taiwan (MIT) products.</P>
      <P>Fiorina said the entrepreneurial spirit of Taiwan manufacturers
and their high competitiveness are the biggest advantages that are
moving Taiwan forward, and added that Taiwan enterprises have
performed brilliantly in invention and reinvention.</P>
      <P>A comparison of the perception of the words "made-in-Taiwan" 30
years ago and now will show that MIT now stands for a world-class
quality, and that MIT products are outstanding both in inventive R&amp;D
and design.</P>
      <P>Bill Gates, chairman of computer giant Microsoft and Andrew
Grove, chairman of Intel, have featured in similar ads produced by
CETRA in the past.</P>
      <P>Fiorina attended a discussion panel earlier in the day with local
business leaders Miao Feng-ching of Mitac and Douglas Hsu of Far East
Group, to exchange views on finding a pioneering spirit and on the
courage and challenges of leaders.</P>
      <P>She said that Taiwan enterprises maintain a full competitive edge
by offering high value-added products through its consistent
inventiveness, adding that MIT products are now world-class.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, Taiwan and other Asian business leaders
display relative modesty, which she said aims to cover their
competitiveness, a point that US enterprises need to learn.</P>
      <P>Fiorina, who has been rated by the Fortune magazine as the most
valuable business anger in the US for two consecutive years, also
spoke of the key to HP's success, which she attributed to correct
decision-making and giving her staff a free environment to pursue
their innovations.</P>
      <P>She also cited the Chinese wisdom of the "middle way" as a

    <DATELINE>New York, June 12 (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty US-based mainland Chinese scholars
and students issued a joint open letter to the Kuomintang on Monday,
reminding the Republic of China's ruling party until May 20 that its
future lies in entire China.</P>
      <P>The group of mainland scholars and students, led by Xin Haonien,
a visiting professor at Columbia University, issued the open letter
a week before the KMT holds an extraordinary national congress to
discuss party rejuvenation after its embarrassing defeat in
Taiwan's March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The mainland scholars and students said in the letter that
although some people rule out the KMT's possibility of regaining
power in Taiwan, they believe that the party still have a
bright future in entire China.</P>
      <P>The letter said as the KMT has never ceased pursuit of progress
throughout its 100-plus years of history, it is unlikely to fall
apart nor to be defeated.</P>
      <P>While KMT members feel frustrated by the election defeat,
the letter said, they should find comfort in the realization of
democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT defeat proved the fairness and openness of
the March 18 vote, the letter pointed out that the KMT, unlike
mainland China's Chinese Communist Party, does not face any threat
to fall apart. Moreover, it said, the party does not lose the
freedom or chances to take part in future elections in Taiwan or
even in mainland China some day.</P>
      <P>The letter reminded its members that the party has a glory
history, completing six great missions in the past century --
overthrowing the corrupt Ching dynasty and establishing the Republic
of China; defeating war lords and unifying the whole China;
resisting Japanese aggression; enacting the democratic "ROC
Constitution"; insisting on its anti-communist policy; and building
Taiwan into a prosperous democracy.</P>
      <P>The letter said so long as the KMT can keep in line with
Taiwan's and even entire China's public opinions, work firmly to
defend Taiwan's democratic system, and strive for China's
unification under freedom and democracy, the party will certainly
have a bright future in Taiwan and entire China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Any company which is capable of
transforming astronomical and fast-growing data into useful
information is entitled to enjoy the best competitiveness, EMC
President and COO Joseph Tucci said in Taipei on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a speech on the second day of the World Congress 2000 on
Information Technology (WCIT), Tucci said that at a time when
Internet development is entering the "fourth stage," the volume of
online data is increasing four-fold annually rather than the one-fold
annual growth of previous years, a fact which indicates the
importance of data storage.</P>
      <P>In a speech titled "Where the World's Information Lives," Tucci
estimated that the global data storage market will reach US$44
billion this year, based on the fact that most of EMC's clients spent
half of their information-related operational costs on data storage.</P>
      <P>Quoting David Moschella from his book "Waves of Power," Tucci
said there are four stages in the development of computer science and
application. In the first stage -- the system-centric era -- computer
users had a population of 10 million worldwide.</P>
      <P>In the second stage -- the PC-centric era -- some 100 million
people used computers and related systems, Tucci said.</P>
      <P>In the third stage -- the Internet-centric era -- about 300
million regularly surfed online.</P>
      <P>In the fourth stage -- the content-centric era -- which has
recently kicked off, the Internet population worldwide is expected to
reach 1 billion in five years, Tucci went on.</P>
      <P>He said that by 2005, all data will be stored in digital form and
the world will be facing the greatest-ever "information wave." He
added that information itself will become increasingly invaluable
with the growth in the number of users.</P>
      <P>EMC is a world leader in intelligent storage systems, software

the project, Ing said a formal contract is expected to be signed in
four to six weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the MOU, TSC, led by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, will supply "bullet" train carriages and locomotives, as
well as signaling, communication and electrification systems for
Taiwan's high-speed rail line.</P>
      <P>To hedge against risks of exchange rate fluctuations, THSRC will
pay for TSC products in three currencies, the New Taiwan dollar, the
Japanese yen and the US greenback.</P>
      <P>The electrification system to be used by THSRC will be an
upgraded and modified version of 700E being used in Japan's
Shinkanen systems, Ing said, adding that the Shinkansen's good
security records and its electrification system's environmental
friendliness are major factors that THSRC decided to pick TSC as its
supplier and partner. TSC has promised to offer five-year
maintenance services and to help train relevant personnel.</P>
      <P>THSRC, a business and industry consortium, won the NT$440 billion
contract in July 1998 to build the 340 kilometer-railway under
a BOT (build-operate-transfer) formula.</P>
      <P>Ing said TSC will obtain a 10 percent stake in THSRC by
contributing about NT$13.5 billion in cash. "The first installment of
capital from TSC, about NT$2.4 billion, is expected to come in late
this year," she said, adding that THSRC's capitalisation is scheduled
to increase to NT$132.1 billion in five years.</P>
      <P>Except for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, TSC partners also include
Marubeni Corp., Mitsui Corp.' Sumitomo Corp., Kawasaki Heavy
Industries, and Toshiba Electric.</P>
      <P>TSC unexpectedly defeated the Alstom-Siemens Eurotrain consortium
last December to win exclusive negotiating rights for the
THSRC's core system and equipment contract.</P>
      <P>Eurotrain consortium, which was named THSRC's "preferred bidder"
on a preliminary 1997 deal for the supply of the equipment and
systems, in January filed an injunction with the Taipei district
court to bar THSRC from signing the contract with the Japanese
consortium.</P>
      <P>The legal action was dropped after the judge said Eurotrain
failed to provide sufficient evidence for an injunction against
THSRC.</P>
      <P>Construction on the high-speed railway, linking Taipei in the
north and Kaohsiung in the south, started last year and the rail
system is expected to become operational in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE INDUSTRIES TO BE ALLOWED TO INVEST ON MAINLAND: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said on
Wednesday that about 94 percent of industries will be allowed to
invest in mainland China in the future.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in a report on investment activities across
the Taiwan Strait at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economic
Affairs and Energy Committee.</P>
      <P>The business executive-turned-minister told lawmakers that the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is reviewing the previous
Kuomintang government's "go slow" policy on mainland China-bound
investment.</P>
      <P>"We are considering whether we should further ease restrictions
on investment in mainland China," said Lin, a former vice chairman
of China Motor Corp., an affiliate of Yulon Motor Group.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, about 72 percent of industries are
allowed to invest in mainland China and only 4 percent are on an
off-limits list. The remaining industries are subject to
government screening and approval on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOEA is mulling whether to liberalize
investment in mainland China's upperstream petrochemical industry
and semiconductor industry, both of which are now on the
"off-limits" list.</P>
      <P>In the near future, Lin said, some industries on the
"off-limits" list will be moved to the list of "screening
and approval on a case-by-case basis," and about 24 percent of
those on the "screening" list will be included into the "free
investment" list.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, mainland China was very eager to attract
Taiwan investment eight to nine years ago. "But it has now become
more selective and reserved to the fields to be open to Taiwan
investors," he noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin said, as most of Taiwan-owned companies on the
mainland are export-oriented, they are keener than their
mainland counterparts to see opening of direct cross-strait trade,
postal and transport links.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lin said the MOEA will also review the
current ban on the direct cross-strait "three links." If national
security can be ensured and cross-strait dialogue can resume, he
said, the government does not rule out the possibility of taking
bold steps to ease the "three links" ban.</P>
      <P>Lin further said mainland China now badly welcomes Taiwan
investment in upperstream petrochemical, wafer and
telecommunications industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR TO TURN ROC CAPITAL INTO A CYBERCITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Wednesday said
that the capital city must forge itself into a "cyber city" in order
to become a competitive international metropolis as well as a
regional center in the information revolution.</P>
      <P>Speaking to industry and government leaders from over 80
countries on the final day of the biennial World Congress on
Information Technology (WCIT), Ma said that Taipei must break away
from the traditional mindset of building the city on its limited
physical space. Instead, he added, Taipei is embracing information
technology to make municipal information and services widely
available to the public through the Internet.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the establishment of an expansive public information
network will allow the citizens of Taipei to spend less time on
traffic-prone streets running errands or even commuting to work.
According to Ma, the number of vehicles per kilometer of Taipei city
road is 1,058, compared to 141 in Tokyo, 173 in Singapore, and 267 in
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was elected to office in December 1998, said that by the
end of his term in 2002, all of the city government's 57 "level one"
agencies and their direct subordinate agencies will have attained a
ratio of one computer per employee. Also by 2002, he said that the
city will have installed 800 public information kiosks, with an
initial 200 kiosks in place by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance of universal access to the Internet,
which he called "the most influential tool of the 21st century," Ma
said that Taipei plans to provide network services on the same
commodity principles of existing public utilities: affordability and
convenient accessibility. Beginning this year, Taipei is offering
every one of its citizens a free, life-long email address, added Ma.</P>
      <P>WCIT 2000 marks the first time that the conference is being held
in Asia outside of Japan. The theme of WCIT 2000, an industry event
spanning three days, is "IT for a Better World: A New Millennium."
WCIT 2002 will be held in Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI WILL NOT MEDDLE IN TSEA LEGISLATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  13 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new government of the Republic of
China will stand firm on its policy of not meddling in the "Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act" (TSEA) legislative process in the US
Congress, the ROC representative office here said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the office, Taipei would be glad to see the US
Congress pass the bill, but it will not try to interfere. The ROC's
position on this matter has not changed with the recent inauguration
of Presdient Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), the office noted.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office added that the Foreign Affairs
Ministry in Taipei has also instructed it to underscore the ROC's
unchanged stance toward the issue.</P>
      <P>Outgoing ROC Representative Stephen Chen was strongly criticized
by the then opposition DPP lawmakers for failing to lobby US
congressmen for approval of the bill.</P>
      <P>The TSEA, initiated by pro-ROC senators and House
representatives, was worked out with the aim of further boosting
two-way military exchanges between Taiwan and the United States. The
TSEA passed the House of Representatives last October, but failed to
gain enough support later in the Senate.</P>
      <P>The US administration has repeatedly said that it will not
support the TSEA legislation under the pretext that Taiwan's security
has been well served by the existing Taiwan Relations Act.</P>

    <HEADLINE>44-HOUR WORKWEEK A `WIN-WIN' POLICY, SAYS ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi on
Wednesday described the Cabinet-version of shortening the workweek
from 48 hours to 44 hours as a "win-win" policy beneficial to both
capital and labor.</P>
      <P>Lin said the proposed shortened workweek legislation, pending
approval by the Legislature on Friday, should not adversely affect
Taiwan's overall competitiveness as the industrial and business
sectors will be allowed six months to adjust before the program
formally takes effect on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>The industrial sector can accelerate automation and improve the
production process in order to reduce the impact of the shorter
workweek, Lin added.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan passed an amendment on Wednesday cutting the
maximum number of work hours per week without any preconditions from
48 to 44, starting Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>The amendment allows workers to either have one-and-a-half days
off each week, two days off every other week twice each month, or
three days off at one time each month.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was pleased to hear about the passage of
the 44-hour workweek proposal, which was one of his election
promises, said Presidential Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Chang said the president expressed the wish that the proposal
will be passed smoothly by the Legislative Yuan on Friday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government spokeswoman, Chung Chin, told reporters
at a press conference in the wake of the amendment's passage that
Premier Tang Fei described the amendment as a commendable agreement
reached by the government, employers, and workers.</P>
      <P>The 44-hour workweek program is one of the Cabinet's major
administrative guidelines for 2001 passed by the Executive Yuan on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Federation of Labor, the top labor group in Taiwan,
welcomed the amendment, calling it a new example of conciliation
between capital and labor.</P>
      <P>Five other major labor groups, including the Federation of
Industrial Labor Unions in Taiwan, all expressed their satisfaction
with the proposal.</P>
      <P>Business, however, seemed less than pleased with the development,
as the Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI), the largest
group of industrial entrepreneurs in Taiwan, said it accepted the
amendment with a feeling of disappointment.</P>
      <P>CNFI Deputy Secretary-General Kuo Yung-hsiung said the government
should let employers and employees resolve the matter in a way that
is acceptable for both sides. He said the government should not step
in and make decisions for the two sides unless negotiations break
down.</P>
      <P>The shorter workweek is expected to have a direct impact on about
half of all the manufacturing industries islandwide, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Cabinet's passage of the 44-hour workweek, Far
Eastern Textile Vice President Wang Hsiao-yi said the shortened
workweek threatens to cost manufacturers a 10 percent increase in
personnel costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KIMS' SUMMIT SEEN HAVING POSITIVE IMPACT ON CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The historic summit between North and
South Korean leaders will have a positive impact on the possible
meeting between Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian and
People's Republic of China President Jiang Zemin in the foreseeable
future to sort out cross-strait differences, political experts said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Wednesday, Gary Klintworth, a
veteran China-Taiwan expert, said that "if an isolationist and
hostile Kim Jong-Il can put up such an amicable smile to greet his
South Korean counterpart Kim Dae-Jung, there is no reason why the
Chinese leader could not do that."</P>
      <P>"The extraordinary pictures of the North Korean dictator Kim
Jong-Il greeting South Korea's democratically elected President Kim
Dae-Jung at Pyongyang airport offer the best hope we have had in
decades that substantial change may be about to occur in the world's
looniest Stalinist redoubt, North Korea," said Greg Sheridan, foreign
editor of The Australian.</P>
      <P>Other experts said that the amicable meeting between the two Kims
has captured the imagination of rival leaders or countries and could
help ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula while offering hope for
reconciliation after 50 years of hostility between the two rival
Koreas.</P>
      <P>"It will be easier for China's Jiang Zemin and other leaders to
shake hands with their Taiwanese counterparts. If the North Korean
leader can do it, why can't the Chinese leader do the same,"
Klintworth said.</P>
      <P>He pointed that it's easier for mainland China to hold talks with
Taiwan because both Taipei and Beijing have been in contact since
Taiwan in 1987 lifted a ban on its citizens visiting relatives on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Returning to Canberra a few days ago from recent trips to both
Taiwan and China, Klintworth said he had the impression that
moderates in mainland China were gaining the upper hand in forming
policy, particularly regarding matters on the reunification with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an article published in The Australian on Wednesday, Kevin
Rudd, a former Australian diplomat and now a federal Labor Party
member of Parliament, said that history possibly repeats itself in
international politics.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes, just sometimes, in the otherwise tawdry world of
international politics, you have the sense that you just might be
seeing history in the making, such as Richard Nixon's meeting with
Mao Zedong, Boris Yeltsin standing on the tank in front of the
Russian Duma, and the resignation of President Soeharto," he noted.</P>
      <P>He said the "sunshine policy" of rapprochement and engagement
with North Korea championed by South Korea's President Kim Dae-Jung
is working and he believes "the first, perhaps faltering step has
been taken."</P>
      <P>"Let's hope Beijing and Taipei are watching," he added.</P>
      <P>Experts said reconciliation between North and South Korea would
not only ease tensions in the Korean Peninsula, but would also reduce
fears of North Korea's nuclear threat.</P>
      <P>The United States will be one of the Western powers hoping to see
that reconciliation happens between the two Koreas as this would pave
the way for possible reconciliation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, experts said.</P>
      <P>But they also acknowledged that it will be quite a long time
before reunification occurs on the Korean peninsula and that leaders
of the two countries need lots of patience and wisdom to overcome the
obstacles on the way to their eventual target.</P>
      <P>They believe the Korean case could be applied to Taiwan and
mainland China in their search for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"The first summit of the two Kims has set a good example for both
Chinese and Taiwanese leaders and it could give inspiration to both
Jiang Zemin and Chen Shui-bian," Klintworth said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IT SHOULD BE USED MORE IN MEDICAL FIELD: MEDICAL EXPERT</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The application of information technology
(IT) should not be confined only to business but should also be used
in the medical field to allow more people to lead better lives,
Operation Smile Founder William Magee said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a speech on the third day of the World Congress 2000 on
Information Technology (WCIT), Magee, founder of Operation Smile,
Inc., said that his organization has already conducted
"long-distance, cross-continent" craniofacial surgical procedures
through the medium of television conferencing and the Internet.</P>
      <P>The operations help change the lives of many people and make the
world more beautiful, Magee said in his speech titled "Information
Technology Changing the Face of the World."</P>
      <P>Although Magee's speech was not directly related to the
development of the IT industry and business, he was so eloquent and
touching that he received a standing ovation from the conference
attendees.</P>
      <P>Magee, whose Operation Smile has conducted plastic surgery on
children all over the world, including Vietnam, Myanmar, Nicaragua
and Columbia, said children who suffer facial defects usually suffer
from very low self-esteem all their lives, but added that this can be
changed with just a four- or five-minute operation.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, children from poor, remote, and backward
areas are unlikely to ever get the opportunity to benefit from even
such a simple, fast procedure.</P>
      <P>He noted that last year, under the sponsorship of Operation
Smile, local surgeons in Colombia conducted several craniofacial
surgical procedures on children, with help provided by plastic
surgeons in the United States communicating via a broadband Internet
system.</P>
      <P>Magee added that he is now planning an online college in the hope
that through Internet teaching, medical personnel in backward areas
can learn more advanced technologies and medical knowledge so as to
help them upgrade their practices.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and seven other Asian countries
will inaugurate the Asian Internet Network on Thursday with the aim
of gradually reducing regional fees, officials at the Communications
Authority of Thailand (CAT) said.</P>
      <P>The co-founders of the project are Thailand's CAT, Chunghwa
Telecom of Taiwan, Indonesia Satellite Corp., Japan's KDD, Long
Distance Telephone of the Philippines, Korea Telecom, Singapore
Telecom, and Telekom Malaysia, said the officials.</P>
      <P>The collaboration was initiated two years ago in a bid to reduce
the net traffic routes to the United States and bring cheaper charges
to users. Furthermore, the initiative will enhance the speed capacity
of traffic among the eight countries.</P>
      <P>The Asian Internet Network is connected with the Internet gateway
in each of the eight countries with an initial bandwidth capacity of
512 kilobites per second.The bandwidth volume can be increased by 70
percent if demand grows.</P>
      <P>This fee structure was the most hotly debated topic at an IT
ministerial meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
held last month in Mexico.</P>
      <P>According to a report by Singapore's IT Ministry during the

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON WISHES SUCCESS TO ROC-USA, USA-ROC JOINT BUSINESS CONFAB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton sent his
greetings to the participants in the 24th annual Joint Business
Conference of the US-ROC (Taiwan) and ROC-USA Business Councils,
which kicked off on Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Clinton said he appreciates the work of the two councils in
promoting broader and closer economic and trade relations between the
American people and the people of Taiwan, and extended his best
wishes for a successful and productive conference.</P>
      <P>In his message, Clinton said both the US-ROC (Taiwan) Business
Council and the ROC-USA Business Council have made important
contributions to the development of strong economic relations between
the United States and Taiwan, and he is confident that this year's
meeting will further advance those ties.</P>
      <P>He said the theme of the conference -- "Taiwan's New Landscape:
Business Opportunities in the 21st Century" -- is especially
appropriate this year, as Taiwan coped exceptionally well with the
Asian financial crisis, demonstrated remarkable resilience in its
quick recovery from last September's devastating earthquake, and
recently completed the peaceful transition of power from one
political party to another.</P>
      <P>"We hope this year brings a historic development that will
influence the activities of both of your councils -- the entry of
both Taiwan and the People's Republic of China into the World Trade
Organization," he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's and the PRC's accessions will benefit the two
economies, increase cross-strait stability, and help to strengthen
the world trade system. We hope that American companies will make
their own contributions to this process," he continued.</P>
      <P>Clinton said that over the past five decades, through hard work
and good management, Taiwan has become the world's 17th-largest
economy and the United States' seventh-largest trading partner.
"These are impressive accomplishments upon which Taiwan continues to
build," he went on.</P>
      <P>"We note and applaud the new leadership's desire to further open
Taiwan's economy by promoting greater transparency and international
competitiveness," he said.</P>
      <P>"We will be watching closely for further opening in the
telecommunications sector, improvements of intellectual property
rights, improvements in government procurement procedures,
strengthening of the supervision and regulation of the banking
sector, and speedier privatization," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL AIDE LAMENTS PROPOSAL TO RECALL VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung on Wednesday lamented a planned proposal raised by
opposition lawmakers to recall Vice President Annette Lu, saying that
such a move will affect the stability of the new government.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the proposal to remove Lu comes at a time when the
new government of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has been
inaugurated for less then one month, Chang claimed that the move will
cast a shadow of political uncertainty over Taiwan that will not
benefit the people.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that President Chen Shui-bian and Lu "get along
very well" and denied rampant speculation that the two are at
loggerheads.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came on the heels of a news conference called
by Kuomintang lawmaker Mu Min-chu earlier the same day, in which she
said she would put forward a motion in the Legislative Yuan to recall
Lu, and that the proposal had been endorsed by 54 legislators -- the
required 25 percent of the legislature -- from the KMT, the People
First Party and the New Party.</P>
      <P>However, Mu added that she might reserve the right to raise the
proposal, and that she was still considering allowing Lu's fate to be
decided by the Taiwan people through a public plebiscite.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that her planned recall motion is aimed at giving Lu
a warning, the KMT lawmaker strongly criticized the vice president
for violating the spirit of the Constitution by repeatedly making
improper comments on cross-Taiwan Strait relations, seriously
undermining national security since her inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Mu said various of Lu's remarks, such as her description of
herself as "devil's advocate" and her claim that Taiwan's status
remains undetermined, have provoked fear among the Taiwan people, and
that she must be warned immediately as part of efforts to ward off
military conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative whip Cheng Pao-ching said the DPP
caucus had instructed DPP lawmakers not to endorse the proposal and
was seeking to negotiate the matter with its KMT counterparts in a
bid to persuade them not to pursue the idea of recalling Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu refused to comment on the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-TAIWAN STRAIT ISSUE SAID TO BE BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO ASIAN PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Authoritarian China's determination to
gain control over democratic Taiwan is the biggest challenge to
long-term peace and stability in Asia, apart from the danger of
all-out war on the Korean peninsula, according to an editorial in the
Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>In a commentary on Wednesday, the daily's foreign affairs and
defense correspondent David Lague said there are forces at work on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait that make "conflict almost inevitable
unless political and economic collapse on the mainland derails the
Communist Party's plan to absorb Taiwan. This could have catastrophic
consequences."</P>
      <P>He said any serious conflict between China and Taiwan would draw
in the United States. "Despite the ambiguity of the defense
relationship between Washington and Taipei, it is widely understood
that the leader of the free world would have no choice but to help
one of Asia's most vibrant democracies," he said.</P>
      <P>"Quite simply, no US administration could let Taiwan be overrun.
Once the US got involved, it would demand that Australia assist," he
said.</P>
      <P>"Canberra would have little choice, no matter how unpalatable
this would be to the powerful pro-China lobby in the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade," he noted.</P>
      <P>He quoted some analysts as believing that rational thinkers in
Beijing understand that China could not win a war in the Taiwan
Strait and will exercise restraint. They believe Taiwan can be
persuaded to negotiate with the mainland and that a compromise for
unity can be reached over time. Lague said bluntly that this is
fantasy.</P>
      <P>He said China's determination to absorb Taiwan can be seen by the
fact that recovering Taiwan is at the top of President Jiang Zemin's
political agenda and by the fact that Beijing has sown it into the
public's mind that the recovery of Taiwan is an urgent task central
to national unity and worth heavy sacrifices. To back down would be
unthinkable, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, "the strength of Taiwanese nationalism grows
by the day. No Taiwanese government could agree to surrender real
power to Beijing and expect to survive."</P>
      <P>"It is a grim outlook shared by some of Australia's defense
planners. The best hope for peace would seem to be dramatic political
change on the mainland," he added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued a press
statement on Wednesday urging the general public to make concerted
efforts to save the Indian pitta, an endangered bird.</P>
      <P>The statement said President Chen Shui-bian is concerned about
the fate of the bird, which has been listed as an endangered species
worldwide.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is home to possibly the world's largest number of
surviving Indian pittas and is widely believed to be the most
important natural habitat for the bird, local conservation groups
have recently launched a publicity campaign to protect the species.</P>
      <P>In response to an appeal by local conservationists, Chen urged
relevant government authorities to take immediate action to protect
the Indian pitta, also known as the blue-winged pitta.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan loses this rare bird, it seems to me that the island
will have been deprived of one of its most beautiful colors," Chen
said, adding that the loss for Taiwan would also be a loss for the
whole world.</P>
      <P>The president further said he believes that Taiwan will deserve
its reputation as a beautiful island only when it can strike a
balance between nature conservation and industrial development.</P>
      <P>"We will be able to enjoy sustainable development only when we
can maintain an environment suitable for harmonious co-existence
between humankind and nature," Chen added.</P>

on Wednesday received Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos
Geyer, who was in Taipei to attend the ongoing World Congress 2000 on
Information Technology.</P>
      <P>Chen asked Bolanos to convey his thanks to Nicaraguan President
Arnoldo Aleman for his attending his inauguration ceremony on May 20.</P>
      <P>He said the fact that the Nicaraguan president and vice president
have visited the ROC less than a month apart reflects the friendship
between the two countries, and added that the ROC should have more
appreciation of this friendship.</P>
      <P>Chen praised Bolanos for his courage in overcoming difficulties
in his political career and added that he is a good example for the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Bolanos was once a successful entrepreneur, but was jailed for
six months by the Sandinista government after he entered politics.</P>
      <P>"We saw hope and inspiration from Bolanos. The Republic of China
is mired in a difficult international environment, and we should
stand up and have hope like Bolanos," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Bolanos for his part said the election of Chen and Annette Lu as
president and vice president of the ROC represents not only a victory
for the Taiwan people, but also for the world's democracy fighters.</P>
      <P>He noted that the ROC and Nicaragua have maintained close
relations since the two countries reestablished diplomatic ties in
1990, and added that Nicaragua will continue its firm support for the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finnish information technology expert Risto
Linturi on Wednesday sketched a vision of life in the information
society on the final day of the 12th World Congress on Information
Technology (WCIT).</P>
      <P>Speaking to some 1,800 industry experts from 86 countries around
the world, Linturi said that he envisions a society where a citizen
can broadcast self-made programs from the living room, use a mobile
phone connected to the Internet to evade GPS-radio-collared bears in
the wild, and control the radio, the lock, and the VCR from that same
phone.</P>
      <P>He said that his "Helsinki Arena 2000" project will be a catalyst
for many other projects and companies, and that the scope is
comparable to Kennedy's vision of putting a man on the moon.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the project aims to eventually build the
Finnish capital into a cybercity with ubiquitous Internet connections
in homes and offices.</P>
      <P>Linturi described an ongoing project to create an interactive
virtual replica of the city of Helsinki. He said that a user would be
able to dial a phone number by going to the receiver's virtual door
and ringing a virtual doorbell. If he wanted a taxi, he could simply
jump higher in the virtual landscape, look for the closest free taxi,
and wave it down with a click of the mouse -- or the phone.</P>
      <P>In Linturi's vision, which he said is already reality in some
areas of Finland, even bears, wolves and reindeer are fitted with
radio tracking devices.</P>
      <P>Electronic windshields will allow drivers to see a virtual road
and virtual traffic signs, and when everyone in Finland carries a
mobile phone, Linturi envisions streetlights that turn off
automatically when there are no mobile phones nearby. Finland has a
70 percent mobile phone penetration rate and is widely expected to be
one of the first countries to reach 100 percent.</P>
      <P>Linturi said that his vision is now embraced by many
telecommunication companies and organizations in Finland, and that
the advances in technology in recent years have helped them to take
many concepts into commercial usage on accelerated schedules.</P>
      <P>He added that perhaps fixed wires will not even be necessary in
the future, citing as an example Taiwan's own Helios solar aircraft
project that is designed to fly 20 kilometers above a city, with each
unmanned aircraft supplying 20 gigabits of local capacity.</P>
      <P>WCIT 2000 marks the first time that the biennial conference has
been held in Asia outside of Japan. The theme of the three-day event
is "IT for a Better World: A New Millennium." WCIT 2002 will be held

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) on Wednesday
decided to halt a visit by its lawmakers to mainland China slated for
mid-July, saying that the cancellation was made out of consideration
of the delicate relations between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made public after PFP Secretary-General
Chung Jung-chi met with Liu Sung-pan, former legislative speaker and
party stalwart, Liu Wen-hsiung, legislative PFP caucus spokesman, and
Chen Chao-jung, legislative party whip.</P>
      <P>According to sources close to the pro-unification opposition
party, PFP lawmakers are worried about a visit to the mainland at a
time when Taiwan-mainland ties are very sensitive. They added that
the chances of realizing the planned trip are slim, unless mainland
China would permit similar visits by legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Beijing has rejected planned visits of subgroups of both the DPP
and KMT.</P>
      <P>Although the trip by PFP lawmakers was aimed at providing
services and boosting communication with Taiwan businesspeople based
in mainland China, Liu Sung-pan expressed his suspicion that such a
goal could not be achieved in any event.</P>
      <P>Liu, who recently returned from a visit to the mainland, said
that the PFP and the New Party could not afford to run the risk of
assuming responsibility for relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should they make a turn for the worse at this sensitive
time.</P>
      <P>The former legislative speaker also denied speculation that his
recent mainland visit was aimed at paving the way for a trip by PFP
Chairman James Soong. He explained that he is opposed to a Soong
visit to mainland China if the PFP leader still wants to pursue
broader horizons in Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>In addition, recent Hong Kong newspaper reports have said that
mainland China is seeking to abandon its insistence on the "one
China" principle and set up new cross-strait communication channels,
possibly talking directly to the PFP. These reports have reportedly
cast a shadow of fear over the party, and forced it to make a final
decision to cancel its visit to the mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>June 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 500 business leaders from the Republic of
China and the United States gathered in Taipei on Wednesday to take
part in the three-day 24th Joint Conference ROC-USA &amp; US-ROC (Taiwan)
Business Councils which opened that day.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of the conference titled:
"Taiwan's New Landscape: Business Opportunities in the 21st Century,"
President Chen Shui-bian noted that trade between the United States
and the ROC has thrived over the years, increasing from less than
US$4 billion in the mid-1970s to US$50.6 billion in 1999.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the United States is Taiwan's
"largest export market and second-largest import source," while
"Taiwan is the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States
and America's fifth-largest export market for agricultural products."</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that the next four years will be "critical for
Taiwan to thoroughly transform itself," and vowed to improve
conditions for industrial development, government efficiency and
privatization, thus providing innumerable opportunities for trade and
business in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater, who arrived here
on Wednesday to attend the joint conference, read a greeting from US
President Bill Clinton to the participants.</P>
      <P>Slater, the highest-ranking US official to visit the ROC since
the May 20 inauguration of the new administration, said later that
his participation continues a long-standing tradition, noting that
his predecessors -- Sam Skinner and Federico Pena -- took part in
1991 and 1994, respectively.</P>
      <P>Slater, who like Clinton is an Arkansas native, also said his
participation reflects the importance the United States places on its
economic and commercial relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that he is "extremely interested in the e-commerce wave
hitting Asia," and added that he was planning to discuss e-commerce
as well as other economic and transportation issues with business
leaders during his visit.</P>
      <P>Speakers at the plenary session of the conference also included
C.Y. Wang, chairman of the ROC-USA Business Council; Frank Carlucci,
chairman of the US-ROC Business Council; ROC Economic Affairs
Minister Lin Hsin-yi; John Rockefeller, honorary co-chairman of the
US-ROC Business Council; and Jeffrey Koo, honorary chairman of the
ROC-USA Business Council.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is also the chairman of China Steel Corp., noted that
two major recent IT events in Taipei -- Computex and the World
Congress on Information Technology -- have aroused keen interest and
attracted a large number of business leaders to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the next two days, participants in the conference will
examine international developments and discuss a number of key
topics, including the influence that changing US/China/Taiwan
relations will have on US business here. Also, workshops will be held
on information technology, banking &amp; finance, power &amp; energy,
transportation, defense &amp; aerospace projects, and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>Delegates to the conference will deliver papers on "broadband's
impact on Asia and Taiwan's wireless revolution," "financial market
consolidation: promises &amp; pitfalls," "the importance of venture
capitalists &amp; strategic investors," and "what Taiwan &amp; China's WTO
accession means to ports &amp; carriers."</P>
      <P>The conference will also host its first "investors' forum"
Thursday and introduce attending firms to facilitate the formation of
partnerships and strategic investment alliances.</P>
      <P>US delegates also included Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Aviation and International Affairs A. Bradley Mims, Department of
Transportation Chief of Staff Jerry lee Malone, State Department
Adviser David Keegan, Former Assistant Defense Secretary and
Vice-Chairman of the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies
Kurt Campbell, and Director of the Office of Korea and Southeast Asia

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the next four years, Taiwan will provide
innumerable trade and business opportunities for the United States,
said President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the joint conference of the ROC-USA
and US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Councils, Chen said he believes that it
is critical for Taiwan to thoroughly transform itself and emerge with
a new look in the next four years.</P>
      <P>Recalling his May 20 inaugural speech, wherein he proposed a
vision of national growth centered transforming Taiwan into a "green
silicon island," Chen promised to gradually introduce the
environmentally-friendly approach of science-based industrial parks
to every corner of Taiwan, and transform the nation into a "green
silicon island" with a knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>Chen told the conference that his administration will initiate a
series of plans for infrastructure modernization. Meanwhile, improved
conditions for industrial development, better government efficiency,
privatization, and incentives for private participation in public
construction projects will lead to increased investment and foster
Taiwan's capacity for long-term economic growth.</P>
      <P>Urging US enterprises to seize the opportunities of Taiwan's
transformation, Chen said he hoped investment by US firms in Taiwan,
which stood at US$1.1 billion at the end of 1999, will continue to
grow. He said that increased US investment would enhance the
opportunities for hi-tech industrial interchange, to the mutual
benefit of both the ROC and the USA.</P>
      <P>The ROC-USA and US-ROC(Taiwan) Business Councils are private
non-profit organizations of American and Taiwan business executives.
It alternates every year between Washington and Taipei. Wednesday's
conference is the 24th of its kind and will last for three days,
ending on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEE TENG-HUI NOT TO ATTEND KMT CONGRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui
will not take part in the party's coming extraordinary national
congress scheduled for June 17-18 in Taipei, KMT spokesman Jason Hu
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, gave his blessing to the congress, and he called on
all party members to stand firmly behind acting Chairman Lien Chan as
he attempts to implement party reform.</P>
      <P>Lee stepped down as KMT head in late March in the wake of the
party's humiliating defeat in the March 18 presidential election,
which saw the end of five decades of KMT rule in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien had invited Lee to attend the congress as a VIP. Whether Lee
would accept the offer had been of great concern to party members.</P>
      <P>Lee hadn't given his answer until KMT Secretary-General Lin
Fong-chen phoned him Tuesday night. During the conversation, Lee
clearly said that he will not attend the congress.</P>
      <P>Since his term as Republic of China president came to an end on
May 20, Lee has devoted himself to Christian preaching, charity
activities and taking care of unprivileged groups. He also has become
honorary chairman of the Taiwan Research institute, a private think
tank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the KMT's Central Standing Committee earlier in the day
approved draft amendments to the party's charter to tighten the
qualifications of candidates for party chairman.</P>
      <P>Under the revised charter, any party member who has a criminal
records, or who has had his or her party membership revoked or
suspended for more than a year will not be allowed to run for party
chairman.</P>
      <P>The latter part of the measures was seen by a non-mainstream
faction of the party as move to block James Soong -- a former KMT
secretary general who was kicked out of the party for running against
Lien in the last presidential election -- from conducting a comeback.
Mainstream KMT stalwarts have repeatedly denied that accusation.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is founder and chairman the People First Party (PFP) ,
has been called on by many KMT members to return to his former party
and vie for its chairmanship.</P>
      <P>In the future, party members will engage in direct secret
balloting to choose party chairmen. The next chairman will be the
last KMT head to be chosen during the party congress.</P>
      <P>The party's Central Committee will also be transformed with all
existing departments being merged into four, dealing with party
policy, elections, publicity and administration.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments are pending approval by the upcoming party
congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOO SUPPORTIVE OF CABINET MOVE FOR 44-HOUR WORKWEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce, on Wednesday expressed
his support of the Cabinet's move to shorten the legal number of
weekly working hours from 48 to 44.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan adopted an amendment on Wednesday that cuts
the maximum legal number of weekly working hours from 48 to 44,
starting Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Koo said although the shortening of work hours will result in a
decrease in the nation's total production, he would support the
practice of the shortened workweek once both capital and labor reach
a consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>The amendment allows workers to either have one-and-a-half days
off each week, two days off every other week, or three days off at
one time each month.</P>
      <P>Before passing the amendment, Chen Chu, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), said in a special
report that the CLA favors the implementation of a shortened workweek
on a step-by-step basis with the ultimate goal of shortening the
number of weekly work hours to 40.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that advanced nations such as the United States,
Canada and Japan have long practiced the 40-hour workweek, while
France this year further shortened the number of weekly working hours
to 35.</P>
      <P>The legal number of weekly work hours in both South Korea and
Singapore is 44, while Vietnam and mainland China already practice a
five-day workweek, the CLA chairman added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the gradual shortening of number of weekly work
hours from 48 to 40 is one of the new government's most important
labor policy goals.</P>
      <P>The proposed shortened workweek legislation is subject to
approval by the Legislative Yuan on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD CONGRESS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WRAPS UP IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 12th World Congress on Information
Technology (WCIT) greatly boosted Taiwan's international prominence
and brought over NT$1 trillion's worth of business opportunities to
local companies, WCIT chairman Richard Yin said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yin said at a press conference that WCIT 2000, a three-day
industry event that ended here on Wednesday, successfully showed
Taiwan's ability to host a world-class technology congress. He added
that "technology diplomacy" is far more beneficial to Taiwan than
"money diplomacy."</P>
      <P>James Wong, chairman of the WCIT's host organization Information
Service Industry Association of China, Taipei (CISA), said that many
people had misgivings three years ago about a small country like the
Republic of China's capability to host the biennial world congress,
but that the past few days had proved Taiwan's ability.</P>
      <P>At the WCIT, several global information technology (IT) industry
leaders announced their plans to continue to invest in Taiwan
companies. Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina promised to purchase
US$4.5 billion worth of IT products from Taiwan this year, and Cisco
Systems CEO John Chambers also said that his company will invest a
total of US$1 billion in Taiwan's IT industry by 2003.</P>
      <P>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates also spoke at the event on Tuesday.
He praised Taiwan companies for having "made things happen" in the
global computer industry over the past 25 years. Gates went on to
predict that wireless technology and the speech interface will play
critical roles in the home and business environments of the future.</P>
      <P>Red Hat Chairman Robert F. Young spoke out for the virtues of the
"open source" model of software development. He said on Tuesday that
as people rely more and more on technology, they should be allowed to
use software freely. Young added that Red Hat, which publishes the
Linux operating system, earns its profits from maintenance and
services -- rather than from royalties, like Microsoft's proprietary
Windows system.</P>
      <P>Other high-powered speakers outlined their visions of life in the
information society. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said on Wednesday that
his city aims to provide universal access to the Internet and break
away from the physical limitations of traffic congestion to become a
competitive international metropolis. Patricia Hewitt, the United
Kingdom's Minister for Small Business and e-Commerce, also described
the UK's IT developments on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Finland's Risto Linturi, who initiated the Helsinki Arena 2000
project, sketched a vision of a high-tech wireless nation where the
mobile phone takes on the functions of a remote control, electronic
key, global positioning system, and reindeer tracker. Finland, where
70 percent of the population carries a mobile phone, is widely
expected to be one of the first countries to reach a 100 percent
wireless market penetration rate.</P>
      <P>WCIT 2000, with its theme of "IT for a Better World -- A New
Millennium," was attended by some 1,800 industry experts, academics,
and government officials from 86 countries. This marked the first
time that the congress was held in an Asian country other than Japan.
The 13th WCIT will be held in Adelaide, Australia, in 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO KOREAS' SUMMIT AN INSPIRATION FOR TAIWAN AND MAINLAND: CAMPBELL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The historic Pyongyang meeting between the
leaders of South and North Korea should be an inspiration for both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, Kurt Campbell, former Assistant Defense
Secretary, said here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Campbell, who played a crucial role in the US cross-strait policy
when he was in charged of East Asian Affairs in the US Defense
Department, made the remarks when he called on Tsai Ing-wen,
chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Campbell exchanged views with Tsai on a wide range of issues,
including cross-strait relations, the internal situation in mainland
China, and the current status of the Asia and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the first-ever meeting of leaders of South Korea
and North Korea will be positive for the establishment of permanent
peace on the Korean peninsula, and for security and stability in all
of East Asia.</P>
      <P>Campbell said that the two Koreas' summit should be an
inspiration for the disputants across the Taiwan Strait, since even
though both sides still harbor hostility toward each other, the two
leaders are taking an innovative approach and are sitting down to
talk.</P>
      <P>Campbell, currently vice chairman of the Center for Strategic &amp;
International Studies, further suggested that Taiwan strengthen its
relations with Asian and Pacific countries under the framework of
regional security.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has had close
relations with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung, he suggested that
Taiwan consider strengthening bilateral relations with South Korea in
the future.</P>
      <P>He also said that the US and international community have a new
perception of Taiwan's democracy after the island's March 18
presidential election, which saw the Kuomintang's defeat by the DPP
after a five-decade rule. But mainland China is now more worried than
ever about the island's democracy, he added.</P>
      <P>He also expressed concern about the cross-strait stalemate,
saying that though cross-strait tensions have eased, both sides
should avoid moving in a negative direction.</P>
      <P>President Chen's handling of cross-strait relations have showed
skill, rationality and sincerity, which has won the support of the
international community, Campbell said, adding that if Chen can
further forge a domestic consensus, cross-strait relations will
benefit.</P>
      <P>Campbell suggested Taiwan learn more about mainland China's
mindset through an alternative mechanism of communications, commonly
known as the "track II" dialogue channel. He added that official
dialogue channels are often too rigid to work well.</P>
      <P>Campbell again expressed support for the "track II"
communications channel after a closed-door meeting with scholars on
the cross-strait situation Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>He said that the "track II" dialogue channel is important in that
it will create space and inspire dynamic thinking, as well as foster
a spirit that would be conducive to solving problems.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan will face grave challenges from the
mainland in the next few months, or even next few years, so he had
cautioned Taiwan leaders to handle cross-strait relations in wise and
meticulous manner.</P>
      <P>He also said that he is worried that military exercises in
mainland China are actually a method to gather momentum to use armed
force against Taiwan, and thus should not be treated as "routine"
military exercises.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey released by a technology research
center has found that the world will spend US$3 trillion on
information and communication technology (ICT) in 2000.</P>
      <P>The top ten ICT countries make up 80 percent of the world's
market, and North America leads the other continents in terms of ICT
spending, according to the World Information Technology and Services
Alliance (WITSA).</P>
      <P>The figures are the result of a WITSA survey, and were released
by WITSA Chairman Robert B. Laurance and WITSA President Harris N.
Miller at a press conference. The officials were here to attend the
World Congress on Information Technology in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the world's top 55 ICT countries are
responsible for 98 percent of total worldwide ICT spending, including
expenditures on computer hardware, software, and services;
communication hardware and services; office equipment, and the
establishment of inner-corporation computer-systems.</P>
      <P>The survey, which WITSA began in 1998, showed that ICT
development in the world is imbalanced, with the top 10 ICT countries
holding an 80 percent share of the world market.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, there were 260 million computers with Internet access
at the end of 1999, an addition of 90 million units compared to the
previous year. In total, about 400 million computers were sold in
1999.</P>
      <P>North America is still the ICT powerhouse, having spent US$796
billion on ICT in 1999. Meanwhile ICT spending in the Middle East and
Africa expanded by 26 percent between 1997 and 1999. In Asia, the
figure increased 18 percent in the same period.</P>
      <P>By country, Sweden is the world's leading ICT spender. Swedes
spent an average of US$3,200 per capita on ICT in 1999, a growth rate
of 9.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The United States, the world's ICT giant, was third in terms of
per-capita ICT spending. Americans spent US$2,700 per capita on ICT
in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST DPP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE REPEAL OF INDEPENDENCE PLANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators and party heavyweights are opposed to the repealing of
the pro-independence plank contained within the party's charter,
sources from Legislative Yuan said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Chao-nan is planning to file a proposal to
scrap the pro-independence plank to be discussed during the DPP's
national congress in July.</P>
      <P>Chen has said that the DPP, which has emerged as the ruling party
following Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration as the Republic of
China's new president, no longer requires the pro-independence plank
as Taiwan is already a sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>Chen said scrapping the pro-independence plank would serve two
purposes, namely showing goodwill to Beijing and testing Beijing's
attitude toward today's Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung discounted Chen's words, saying
Beijing's ambition and hostility towards Taiwan is obvious and cannot
be redressed simply by the DPP's scrapping of its pro-independence
charter.</P>
      <P>Shen said he also does not think that Beijing will appreciate or
recognize the DPP's goodwill if the party repeals the
pro-independence plank, a move which would be difficult to
accomplish.</P>
      <P>According to DPP charter regulations, initiating the process of
repealing any article in the party charter requires an endorsement by
at least 20 national congress delegates, and actually repealing an
article requires a yes vote by at least two-thirds of all the party
members.</P>
      <P>Chen has said that he has, through certain channels, informed
President Chen Shui-bian about his plans to propose a repeal of the
pro-independence plank during the upcoming national congress.</P>
      <P>"The president did not offer any response to my plan, and I
assume `no response' means `tacit consent'," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Later in the morning, the Presidential Office made a statement
discounting Chen's remarks, saying that Chen's reading of the lack of
a response from the president as meaning tacit consent was completely
wrong.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office's stance on not intervening in party
affairs is patently clear, officials at the office said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who is almost certain to
be the next chairman of the DPP, said whether or not to revise,
shelve, or scrap the pro-independence plank should be discussed at
the national congress, adding that party members should not shy away
from related discussions.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said President Chen Shui-bian clearly made known his
position on cross-strait relations during his inaugural speech, in
which he spelled out his "five nos" overture, one of which is that as
long as Beijing shows no intention of attacking Taiwan militarily,
Taiwan will not hold a plebiscite on independence -- a move
tantamount to a freezing of the pro-independence plank.</P>
      <P>Hsieh suggested that the DPP further promote bilateral exchanges
with mainland China as the DPP only has a limited understanding of
Beijing and vice versa. He said he himself would like to visit the
mainland in his future capacity as the DPP chairman to further
bolster ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO DROP 'ONE CHINA' SHACKLES FOR RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan lawmaker urged
mainland China on Thursday to free itself from the shackles of its
cherished "one China" principle and deal with cross-Taiwan Strait
issues in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the pro-unification People First Party
(PFP) said mainland Chinese leaders should draw inspiration from the
just-concluded summit meeting between North Korea and South Korea to
foster a thaw in the long-deadlocked cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that the two Koreas are similar in size, with
their territories closely connected. Moreover, the governments of
the two Koreas ban bilateral civilian, economic and cultural
exchanges. They even had serious military conflicts in the past.
"But now their leaders get down to talks without setting any
preconditions. The development on the Korean peninsula is an
inspiration to both sides of the Taiwan Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin has said
Beijing consistently supports the reunification of the two Koreas
through negotiations, Chou said he simply couldn't understand why
mainland China refuses dialogue with Taiwan and rejected the two
Koreas' summit diplomacy as a model for cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Beijing declines to resume cross-strait dialogue until the
Republic of China government explicitly agrees to its "one China"
principle that recognizes mainland China's sovereignty over Taiwan, a
term that Taipei cannot accept.</P>
      <P>Chou said mainland China should free itself from the "one
China" shackles and adopt a more realistic, pragmatic and generous
attitude in dealing with cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Another PFP legislator, Liu Wen-hsiung, also urged mainland
China not to reject mainland travel plans proposed by lawmakers of
other major Taiwan political parties.</P>
      <P>Beijing authorities have consistently declined engagement with
the ROC's new ruling party -- the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party. Earlier this month, Beijing also turned down a
prospective mainland visit organized by the Kuomintang's subgroup
e-Generation Alliance in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Beijing has agreed to a PFP plan to send a
delegation to visit the mainland in mid-July. However, the island's
newly formed opposition party has canceled the plan for fears that
the PFP might be labeled as "Beijing's mouthpiece" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said if Beijing accepts the PFP's advice and opens its
doors to Taiwan lawmakers of different political stripes, the PFP
will revive its plan to organize a delegation to visit the mainland
for talks with Taiwan investors there and with mainland officials in
charge of Taiwan affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD UPGRADE RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN: OPINION LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Congress should pass the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act and the next administration should upgrade
US relations with Taiwan by at least allowing high-ranking executive
branch officials to visit the island republic, said an American
conservative leader Wednesday.</P>
      <P>David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, wrote
in the latest issue of The Hill, a weekly newspaper, that Democratic
Progressive Party leader Chen Shui-bian's victory in the March 18
Republic of China presidential election came amidst mainland Chinese
threats of military action against Taiwan if it elected a candidate
that refused to accept that there is only one China and Taiwan is a
part of it.</P>
      <P>The threat may or may not have been real, Keene pointed out, but
Chen has softened his line on independence considerably since winning
the election. He pledged that, as long as Beijing resists the
temptation to use military force against Taiwan, his government will
not declare independence or promote a national referendum on the
question.</P>
      <P>"His problem, however, is that the question of whether the 22
million citizens of the Republic of China on Taiwan will remain free,
quasi-independent, and in control of one of the world's strongest
economies won't be decided in Taiwan's capital, but instead in
Beijing and, to a lesser extent, in Washington," noted the
conservative leader.</P>
      <P>Keene told his readers that mainland China has never wavered in
its stated desire to take Taiwan. Moreover, Beijing's leaders have
consistently charged that anyone who questions their right to take
Taiwan by whatever means they ultimately deem appropriate "is a
threat to peace in Asia."</P>
      <P>The Communist Chinese regime has never controlled Taiwan, and few
on the island are prepared to let them do so. Those on Taiwan who
support reunification "support it contingent on a change of regime in
Beijing. They are not more willing to voluntarily surrender what they
have spent generations building than are the most radical leaders of
the DPP," emphasized Keene.</P>
      <P>He said the United States should feel proud of what the Taiwanese
have built in Taiwan. "After all, the Republic of China exists today
only because of the protection we extended to it over the years. Just
as importantly, it is one of the few nations anywhere that has done
what our founders hoped many nations would do -- emulate the example
of the United States by creating free institutions of their own."</P>
      <P>But many in the United States are not proud of what Americans
helped create. "They see Taiwan instead as a stumbling block, a
nuisance that stands in the way of hopefully better relations with
China. A lot of folks here would, in fact, like to see Taiwan
vanish," he wrote, adding that this is just what Beijing is counting
on.</P>
      <P>Of course, Keene said, "if it becomes clear to the Chinese that
our commitment to our ally on Taiwan isn't very deep, the likelihood
that Beijing will resort to force against the island will increase
exponentially. We cannot let that happen, for moral as well as
strategic and historic reasons."</P>
      <P>He said the mainland Chinese might like to seize Taiwan, but they
are not fools. They'll only unleash the People's Liberation Army if
they think they can get away with it. Many in Congress understand
this and are prepared to pass legislation underscoring US commitment
to Taiwan and giving it access to the defensive military technology
it needs to guarantee its own security.</P>
      <P>He concluded that the legislation should be passed, adding that
"we should do more. The next administration should upgrade our
relations with Taiwan by at least allowing high-ranking executive
branch officials to visit the place."</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  14  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors are more likely to detect colon
cancer if they use the colonoscopy method instead of a barium enema
test, according to a new study published in Thursday's "New England
Journal of Medicine."</P>
      <P>Some scientists have questioned the effectiveness of the enema
technique in comparison to the newer method of colonoscopy.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that barium enema examinations missed 79
percent of the small polyps found by a colonoscopy and 61 percent of
still-benign tumors. Also, in 14 percent of the cases, the enema test
diagnosed a problem where there actually was none.</P>
      <P>But the colonoscopies are not entirely foolproof, missing 20
percent of the still-benign tumors, according to the study.</P>
      <P>The findings cast new doubt on the value of barium enemas. In
this older technique, the inner surface of a patient's colon is dyed
with barium and then X-rayed. In a colonoscopy, a lit tube is
threaded through the large intestine to search for cancerous cells or
potentially cancerous growths.</P>
      <P>A colonoscopy is more expensive and a bit riskier, but the
researchers found that it is more likely to detect cancer cells.</P>
      <P>The US National Polyp Study looked at 580 volunteers who needed
to have their colons re-examined after an initial examination
revealed at least one polyp that appeared ready to develop into a
tumor.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan and Norway are waging a public
relations war in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to have the
moratorium on commercial whale hunting lifted, reported the
Australian on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Australia will be the host of the annual International Whaling
Commission (IWC) meeting in Adelaide next month, and Japan has
already employed the Melbourne-based public relations firm Shandwick
International to spearhead their efforts, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>Both the Australian and New Zealand governments strongly oppose
the lifting of the global moratorium on commercial whaling.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the PR campaign comes in the form of leaflets
sent to Australian homes comparing the ban on whaling to the idea of
"foreigners telling Australians they couldn't eat meat pies."</P>
      <P>Japan has continued to hunt whales despite the global moratorium
under the guise of scientific research, although it has continued to
argue its case for commercial whaling on the basis of cultural
tradition, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In 1999, Japan killed more than 500 minke whales in the Antarctic
and North Pacific and is extending its research program to include
Sperm and Bryde's whales. While Japan continues to oppose whale
sanctuaries, Australia and New Zealand have been the champions of the
cause. Whale-watching is an important element of the two countries'

    <HEADLINE>US COMPANIES URGE TAIWAN TO FURTHER OPEN MARKETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several US business executives attending a
US-Taiwan business conference in Taipei urged Taiwan on Thursday to
expedite the opening of its capital and telecommunications markets.</P>
      <P>David Hoffman, director of accounting firm Pricewaterhouse
Coopers, said that the Republic of China's regulations governing
telecommunications and related industries seem to be disordered and
unpredictable, a phenomenon which has resulted in chaotic development
of the market.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan opened its cellular phone market in 1996,
and in the short period since then, almost everyone on the island has
begun using mobile telecommunications devices. But despite the
increase in the number of mobile phone subscriptions, Taiwan's
quality of service has actually diminished, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that opening the market either too quickly or too slowly
would adversely affect the normal development of the industry,
Hoffman urged authorities in Taiwan to reassess related policies and
regulations on opening the island's telecommunications market.</P>
      <P>Hoffman made the remarks during the Taipei American Chamber of
Commerce (AmCham) Breakfast &amp; Briefing, which is part of the ongoing
24th Joint Conference of the ROC-USA &amp; US-ROC (Taiwan) Business
Councils.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the breakfast briefing, AmCham President Paul J.
Cassingham said most US companies and individuals in Taiwan feel that
the liberalization of Taiwan's telecommunications market has been
moving at a snail's pace.</P>
      <P>Peter Kurz, director of US firm Xlinux, said Taiwan has been too
slow not only in opening its telecommunications market, but also in
liberalizing its capital market.</P>
      <P>Kurz urged Taipei to expedite the liberalization of its capital
and finance systems, and adopt a global perspective.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other American delegates at the meeting ridiculed
Taiwan's Legislative Yuan as unpredictably wild in adopting
legislation. They added that the legislature has failed to come up
with any commendable plans on infrastructure development, and hasn't
made any progress on the high-speed railway development plan or
Taipei's serious parking problem.</P>
      <P>US Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater, who was also
invited to attend the breakfast briefing, said despite the fact that
Taiwan's government is now in a transitional phase, the island is
still a valuable trading partner for the US. He added that US
executives should take advantage of the many business and trade
opportunities that are available here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC GOVERNMENT WANTS CLOSER COOPERATION WITH US: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said on Thursday that the
Republic of China's new government looks forward to further expanding
cooperation with the United States in various fields.</P>
      <P>The four-star-general-turned-premier made the statement during a 
meeting with visiting US Secretary of Transportation Rodney E.
Slater, who arrived in Taipei on Wednesday to attend the annual
joint conference of the ROC-USA and US-ROC (Taiwan) Business
Councils.</P>
      <P>Slater is the first US Cabinet minister to visit Taiwan since
the ROC completed its first democratic transition of power from the
Kuomintang to the Democratic Progressive Party on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tang extended a warm welcome to Slater, saying his visit
symbolizes close substantive ties between the two countries. For his
part, Slater conveyed US President Bill Clinton's concern about
Tang's health. Tang is still recuperating from surgical wounds
caused by an April surgery to remove a chest tumor.</P>
      <P>Tang told Slater that the ROC government is studying the
feasibility of opening direct trade, postal and transport links
between Taiwan's outlying islands and mainland China's coastal
cities, commonly known as direct cross-Taiwan Strait "mini three
links." "We expect to finalize the evaluation and planning work in
six months," he said, adding that the opening of "mini three links"
will pave the way for eventual opening of direct "three links"
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tang, who had been air force commander-in-chief, chief of the
General Staff and minister of national defense before assuming the
premiership, said in the past, the ROC regarded the triangular waters
surrounding Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China's Shanghai area
mainly from military viewpoints.</P>
      <P>In the future, Tang said, the ROC will gradually adjust this
strategy and strengthen planning for opening commercial shipping
services in the area as part of its efforts to promote the
cross-strait "three links" policy and to build Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific operations center.</P>
      <P>Slater said the United States believes that the opening of
direct cross-strait trade, transport and mail links will certainly
bring many new business opportunities to US companies, particularly
those in maritime and air transport services.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Slater said, Taiwan can offer fair business
opportunities to US firms in carrying out its ambitious Asia-Pacific
business hub project.</P>
      <P>Noting that a large number of Taiwan students have done advanced
studies in the United States, Tang said the US assistance in
training high-caliber manpower has provided a solid basis for close
economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He further said the just-concluded World Congress on
Informational Technology 2000 has brought many business
opportunities to Taiwan companies and signified Taiwan's development
potential in the promising information technology (IT) field.</P>
      <P>"We also believe that there will be ample room for ROC-US
cooperation in the IT field in the future," Tang said.</P>
      <P>In response, Slater said he shares Tang's views. "Information
technology will be an important realm for US-Taiwan cooperation in
the future," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US, ROC EXPERTS DISCUSS IMPACT OF BROADBAND, WIRELESS REVOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's information technology (IT)
industry is poised to take off with the advent of wireless and
fixed-line broadband technology, said IT experts at an annual
conference between ROC and US business councils on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Joseph J. Fan, president of industry heavyweight Taiwan Cellular
Corp., predicted that in the future, more subscribers will access the
Internet by using wireless access protocol (WAP) technology and the
upcoming third generation (3G) wireless technology.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 24th Joint Conference of the ROC-USA and US-ROC
(Taiwan) Business Councils on Thursday, Fan and other industry
leaders said that Taiwan's existing mobile phone and cable television
infrastructure will allow for the rapid development of broadband
technology throughout the island.</P>
      <P>According to Fan, Taiwan's mobile phone market penetration rate
reached 52.5 percent by the end of 1999, ranking the island ninth in
the world. South Korea has since overtaken Taiwan, and now boasts a
57 percent market penetration rate.</P>
      <P>In 77 percent of local homes, cable is already in place, making
it the best broadband technology format for Taiwan, according to
Raymond Chang, Senior Vice President of Giga Media. In comparison,
only 65% of homes in the US are equipped with cable service.</P>
      <P>The development of personalized and interactive broadband content
will be essential to bolster consumer acceptance of the new
technology, he added.</P>
      <P>US Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, honorary co-chairman of the
US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Council, concurred with the other experts on
the significance of broadband technology. However, he highlighted the
possible social issues that may emerge as a result of the disparity
between infrastructure-rich metropolitan areas and
infrastructure-poor rural areas.</P>
      <P>Rockefeller said that businesses with easier access to greater
bandwidth will be more competitive than firms that lack such access.
He added that the result will be "disastrous" for the less-wired
regions, where unemployment will add to a collective feeling of being
left out of the information revolution. He went on to urge countries
to find ways to promote the development of broadband infrastructure
in all areas.</P>
      <P>Herbert Chang, Vice Chairman of KG Telecommunications, said that
Taiwan is ready for broadband, but only if issues regarding
regulation, technology, and content are resolved in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>Nelson Chang, deputy chairman of the ROC-USA Business Council,
said that the new economy in Taiwan will be fueled by business
opportunities that increased bandwidth will provide.</P>
      <P>JD Howard, managing director of Taiwan Nortel CHT, a strategic
partnership between Chunghwa Telecom and Nortel Networks, said that
the wireless revolution will benefit Taiwan's IT industry by
increasing demand for exports of components, end user devices,
services, and software.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RAY OF HOPE SEEN IN RESUMPTION OF ROC-ROK AIRLINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming first tourist ministers
meeting under the framework of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum may provide an opportunity for Taipei and Seoul to
discuss resumption of direct airlinks, sources said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>ROC Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan
has decided to personally attend the first-ever APEC tourist
ministers meeting scheduled for July 5-8 in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Sources said Yeh's South Korean coutnerpart is expected to
raise the airlinks issue during bilateral talks with Yeh under the
APEC framework.</P>
      <P>While the Republic of China is unlikely to take the initiative to
bring up the airlinks issue during an APEC event, it will not shun
the topic if South Korea puts the problem on the agenda for bilateral
talks.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) said the ROC will initially discuss
only resumption of flyover, technical landing and passenger flight
services with South Korea, and will not consider airborne cargo
transport and fifth freedom issues for the moment.</P>
      <P>The ROC cut diplomatic ties with South Korea on Aug. 24, 1992
after Seoul switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing,
and direct flight services between the two countries were also
suspended from Sept. 15 that year.</P>
      <P>South Korea has been eager to resume direct airlinks with Taiwan
but is reluctant to upgrade its substantive ties with the ROC for
fears of offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>MOTC sources said the ROC is willing to negotiate the airlinks
issue with Seoul based on the principles of equality, reciprocity and
mutual respect. Moreover, MOTC sources said, the ROC is hopeful that
the annual bilateral ministerial-level economic cooperation
conference can be resumed along with the resumption of direct
airlinks.</P>
      <P>The ROC also hopes that South Korea can send an official
delegation, to be headed by its civil aeronautics administration
chief, to Taipei to negotiate airlinks resumption issues with
parallel Taiwan officials. Meanwhile, MOTC sources said, a formal
agreement on the airlinks resumption should be signed by civil
aviation chiefs of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The first APEC tourist ministers meeting will focus on four
themes -- removing barriers to investment in the tourist industry;
expanding the travel market; ensuring sustainable development in
tourist management; and promoting tourism to boost economic and
social development.</P>
      <P>In addition to multilateral discussion, bilateral talks between
APEC members on matters of mutual concern will also be arrranged
during the upcoming APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>APEC is a 21-member regional economic cooperation forum
dedicated to promoting free trade and capital flow. Both Taipei and
Beijing are its members.</P>

      <P>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is

      <P>The MND said that the drill being conducted off the coast of

      <P>A visiting Honduran senior official called
on Thursday for closer cooperation between the Latin American state
and the Republic of China in developing the hi-tech industry.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Gerardo Zepada, director of the

seeking Taiwan's experience in information technology (IT)
development to speed up the development of Hondura's IT industry.</P>
      <P>Zepada, who also visited Taiwan in 1980 and 1993, said he was
impressed by the progress of the island's hi-tech industry since his
last trip, and added that there are many lessons that the Honduras
could learn from.</P>
      <P>Noting that telephone penetration is only 10 percent of the
population in Honduras at present, Zepada said wireless telephones
rather than the landline system would help his country to catch up

      <P>Zepada also noted that human capital is at least as essential to
the IT industry as the infrastructure, and said Honduras is launching
programs in schools to teach Internet skills and train skilled
workers for the country's IT industry.</P>

American states in Central America has helped many states in the

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER PROPOSES REMOVING INDEPENDENCE CLAUSE FROM PARTY PLATFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chao-nan of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday formally proposed the removal
from the party's platform of the clause that promotes Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>The First Article of the DPP platform and its appendix stipulate
that the party aims to establish a sovereign and independent Taiwan
Republic.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the independence clause is no longer justifiable
now that the DPP has become Taiwan's ruling party, because Taiwan is
in fact a sovereign country. In order to secure cross-Taiwan Strait
peace, the clause should therefore be removed, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen denied news reports that his decision to initiate the
proposal was prompted by Beijing officials who he met late last month
and who said that mainland China would renounce the use of force
against Taiwan as long as the DPP agreed to ditch its Taiwan
independence platform.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he will definitely push ahead with the proposal,
despite the difficulties lying ahead, although the chances of his
proposal being adopted by the party's heavyweights are slim.</P>
      <P>Under DPP regulations, a change in the party platform requires
endorsement from at least two-thirds of the delegates to its national
congress. The party is to hold its national congress in the middle of
next month.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said Beijing would not drop its
hostility toward Taiwan simply because the DPP agrees to abandon its
independence plank, while Legislator Lin Chuo-shui said that Chen's
move resulted from his "misunderstanding" of the existing
cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Lin said that ever since Chen Shui-bian's inauguration as
president on May 20, Beijing has been making "rational adjustments"
in many areas which it would not have tolerated in the past.</P>
      <P>In other words, he went on, both Taiwan and Beijing are now
trying to adapt themselves to each other, and Chen should not rush to
push his proposal because it is in contradiction to the development
trends of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Po-lun, who is a member of Chen Chao-nan's "New
Century Congress Office" faction in the party, also lamented the
suggestion, saying it would simply be "troublesome" to President
Chen.</P>
      <P>However, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, who is almost certain to be
the next DPP chairman, said that scrapping or keeping the
independence guideline will be key to the DPP's development
direction, and that the party should not attempt to escape the issue.
He also said he favored discussion of the proposal in next month's
party congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO PLAY MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday urged
the United States to play a more active role in helping to maintain
balance and stability in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while meeting with visiting US Secretary of
Transportation Rodney E. Slater, who arrived in Taipei on Wednesday
to attend the 24th Joint Conference of the ROC-USA and US-ROC
(Taiwan) Business Councils.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was encouraged by US President Bill Clinton's
decision to send Slater, one of Clinton's best friends and
colleagues, to attend the annual joint business conference in Taipei
to signify the US government support for the new Taiwan
administration.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China and the United States share a
very close and cordial relationship, Chen said he believes that
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait is not only in the interests
of the ROC but also complies with US interests in the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the United States pledged in its 1982
"six assurances" not to serve as a mediator in cross-strait
relations, it should play a more active role in helping to maintain
Taiwan Strait peace and Asia-Pacific stability and security, as well
as to improve and normalize cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>"I believe that my appeal exactly reflects a common hope and
expectation of the people of our two countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said he is convinced that the
just-concluded summit meeting between the leaders of North and South
Korea is inspirational to future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"So long as our national security is not at stake, we are willing
to promote direct trade, mail and transport links with mainland
China," Chen said, adding that he is hopeful the United States will
play a positive role in pushing for resumption of cross-strait
dialogue to smooth the way for opening the "three direct links."</P>
      <P>Chen also said the ROC supports the US granting of permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) to mainland China with a view to making
it abide by international regulations and norms.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, mainland China is also expected to gradually move
toward democratization, thus helping to maintain peace, stability and
security in the Taiwan Strait and the entire Asia-Pacific region,"
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>While granting PNTR status to mainland China, Chen said, the
United States should also push for Taipei's and Beijing's essentially
simultaneous accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his expectation that more
ministerial-level US officials from various fields can make frequent
visits to Taiwan to further upgrade bilateral ties and cooperation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Slater acknowledged that cross-strait ties are a
great challenge to the new ROC government. "With your wisdom,
pragmatic attitude and constructive strategy, I believe you will be
able to overcome all difficulties and reach the goal of improving
relations with the mainland," Slater said, adding that the United
States, as a reliable friend, will continue to support cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Slater also assured Chen that the US government is now working to
help both sides of the Taiwan Strait to enter the WTO by the end of
this year.</P>

      <P>Overseas Chinese and foreign investments in

      <P>Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos
Geyer led a mission to Taipei on Thursday to seek Taiwan's investment
in his country's textile industry.</P>
      <P>Because the US Congress recently passed additional preferential

from Taiwan's textile manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Under the newly approved measures, which become effective on Oct.

      <P>Taiwan Textile Federation Chairman Huang Yao-tang told the media
that Nicaragua is a good place for textile investment because it is a

      <P>Nicaragua has provided many incentives for foreign investors.
Taiwan's official statistics show that in the past 10 years, the
island's investment in that country has amounted to more than US$100
million.</P>
      <P>Business cooperation between the two countries is also growing

      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Affairs Ministry on
Thursday welcomed the successful conclusion of the summit meeting
between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader
Kim Jong Il.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials described as significant the fact that
the two leaders opened their historic dialogue without any
preconditions set, and they said it should serve as a good sample for
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The meeting drew to an end late on Wednesday with agreements
signed that aimed at reducing tension and enhancing economic
cooperation on the divided Korean peninsula.</P>
      <P>However, the officials, who asked not to be named, said that
Taipei would be more interested in the consensus Kim Jong Il reached
during a May 29-31 trip to mainland China, and how he persuaded the
Beijing leaders not to oppose, and even perhaps to encourage, the
summit.</P>
      <P>The officials said that it remains to be seen whether Beijing
gave its blessing to the summit in the hope that it would result in
the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's ties with North Korea, the officials said that
bilateral trade and economic relations will improve should North
Korea adopt an open-door policy in the wake of the summit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SLOW PACE OF TAIWAN'S LIBERALIZATION OF ENERGY MARKET COMES UNDER FIRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The alleged slow pace of the Republic of
China government in deregulating the energy market came under fire
from businessmen in a conference on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the second day of the Annual Joint Conference of the ROC-USA 
and the US-ROC (Taiwan) Business Councils, both US and ROC business
representatives criticized the Taiwan authorities for not opening up
the island's energy market faster.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum,
the attendees said Taiwan is lagging behind in privatizing its
petroleum and power industries and opening them to foreign
competition.</P>
      <P>Noting that there currently are nine bidders for licenses to
generate power in Taiwan, Hsu Chih-yi, a researcher at the Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research, said the private sector is clearly
interested in entering the energy field.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to accommodate the private sector's
enthusiasm by opening the power market wider as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>However, the poorly conceived opening of Taiwan's
telecommunications market has caused chaos and a degeneration of
phone services, according to David Hoffman, the general director of
the Pricewaterhouse Coopers accounting firm.</P>
      <P>In his view, the Taiwan authorities bungled the work of
liberalizing the telecommunications market by enacting confusing
rules to regulate the new market.</P>
      <P>Paul Cassinghan, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei (AmCham Taipei) said the Taiwan authorities' slowness in
opening the telecommunications market was the focus of criticism of
the AmCham members last year.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsing-shan, chairman of the Evergreen Marine Corp. Ltd,
blamed the government for what he called "dragging it feet" on
opening direct maritime links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Likening shipping and trade to two wheels on a car, Lin said
bilateral trade between Taiwan and mainland China cannot thrive
without direct maritime links.</P>
      <P>The three-day conference, the 24th of its kind, will continue its
discussion on biotechnology and information technology on Friday
before coming to a close later that afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-VERSION SHORTER WORKWEEK PASSED IN LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new, shortened workweek program, allowing
Taiwan's workers and employers to work 84 hours every two weeks
instead of the former 96 hours, was passed overwhelmingly at the
Legislature on Friday, sources from the Legislative Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Under a first-class mobilization drive, the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), which holds a majority in the Legislature, successfully
overturned the Cabinet-version of a shortened workweek that was
passed by the Executive Yuan on Thursday. That version would have
reduced the workweek from 48 to 44 hours.</P>
      <P>The KMT-version of the shortened workweek, allowing most of the
country's laborers to enjoy two days off every two weeks, a privilege
that public functionaries are already entitle to, is expected to be
brought into force on Jan. 1, 2001, the Legislative Yuan sources
said.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-ching, KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said KMT
legislators are thrilled at having overridden the Cabinet-version
that was passed by the Executive Yuan without the consultation of
lawmakers, particularly the KMT legislators.</P>
      <P>Noting that the shortening of the workweek is a world trend, Hung
said the number of work hours per week is presently 37.4 in Japan and
41.7 in the United States.</P>
      <P>The passage of the KMT-version marks the first major setback for
the Democratic Progressive Party, which became Taiwan's ruling party
when Chen Shui-bian was inaugurated as the new president of the
Republic of China on May 20.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Federation of Labor, the top labor group in Taiwan,
welcomed passage of the KMT-version of the shortened workweek.</P>
      <P>Federation Chairman Lin Huei-kuan, however, said he is slightly
worried that the 42-hour workweek program may cause some harm to the
interests of less-privileged labor groups if the KMT fails to come up
with measures to offset the impact of the sudden reduction in weekly
working hours.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI),
the largest group of industrial entrepreneurs in Taiwan, said it
accepted the amendment with a feeling of disappointment.</P>
      <P>Describing himself as "disappointed and helpless," CNFI Chairman
Lin Kun-chung warned that the 42-hour workweek program will
undoubtedly deal an "immediate and major" blow to the country's
industrial sector. He estimated that it will have a direct impact on
about half of the manufacturing industries islandwide when it takes
effect.</P>
      <P>CNFI Deputy Secretary-General Kuo Yung-hsiung said the 42-hour
workweek will deal a major blow to small and medium-sized
enterprises, particularly the traditional manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>Kuo said he hopes that the lawmakers listen more to the voice of
the people, rather than indulging in political wrestling in the
Legislative Yuan as such actions are far from serving the interests
of the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO PROMOTE YOUNG STARS TO CPC CENTRAL COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Jun. 16 (CNA)
(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Potential political stars as young as 35
will be promoted to the powerful Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) during its next congress in 2002 as part of
Beijing's efforts to rejuvenate the party, reported Hong Kong iMail
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Rejuvenation of the party will be the main topic on the agenda
during the two-week closed-door meeting of senior leaders at the
seaside summer resort of Beidaihe late next month, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The report quoted mainland sources as saying that the leaders
would discuss elevating a group of young cadres, aged between 35 and
45, to the policy-making Central Committee at the 16th party congress
to be held in the autumn of 2002.</P>
      <P>At the 15th party congress convened three years ago, the average
age of members of the 344-strong Central Committee was 60, with only
21 members below the age of 45.</P>
      <P>Qualified officials in their thirties could be promoted to
departmental posts while talented and competent officials in their
forties could be offered higher level jobs at the provincial level,
such as the position of governor or vice-governor, the report added.</P>
      <P>Top party leaders apparently believe it is essential to increase
the number of Central Committee members under the age of 45 at a time
when more foreign state leaders are in their late forties or early
fifties, said the report.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the rejuvenation drive will formally
begin after the Beidaihe meeting, and Zeng Qing-hong, a rising star
and protege of mainland China's President Jiang Zemin, has been
assigned to take charge of the process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUESTIONS REMAIN ON INTER-KOREAN RELATIONS: EDITORIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a stunning initial breakthrough
made by the leaders of North and South Korea in their first summit,
questions remain on how the two rival countries can overcome a host
of difficulties to forge eventual reunification after 50 years of
separation.</P>
      <P>An editorial published Friday in the Sydney Morning Herald said
that "just as the reunification of Germany depended on changes in the
German people, the future of Korea, a nation divided since 1948, is a
matter entirely in the hands of the Koreans themselves."</P>
      <P>"If the people of North and South Korea make a new destiny for
themselves, as they appear ready to do, even the most powerful
nations of the world -- including the United States, Japan, China and
Russia, all of whose interests converge on the Korean peninsula --
will have to accept that," the editorial added.</P>
      <P>"There will be hesitations and prevarications and many obstacles
on the way to reunification. But a new course has been set.
Wednesday's agreement between the two leaders is mostly very general.
Its commitment to reunification, based on proposals already put
forward for a federation or confederation as a starting point, will
need hard pushing, on many fronts," it pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an editorial published in the Australian said that
"there is an unfettered sense of optimism surrounding the signing

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ONLY BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN AMNESTY'S HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  June  15  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was hardly mentioned in Amnesty
International's report on human rights violation concerns this year,
according to sources from the London-based human rights organization.</P>
      <P>In its latest annual report, Amnesty International only said that
Taiwan is still being criticized for its continued use of the death
penalty.</P>
      <P>The human rights watchdog group said that, over the past year,
authorities in Taiwan have demonstrated the intention of improving
social welfare and human rights protection by passing new laws and
amending out-of-date legislation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the organization said, Taiwan still uses the death
penalty "very often" -- executing at least 24 prisoners in 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Amnesty International said no region on earth was
spared last year as deadly conflicts ignited around the globe and
almost two-thirds of the world's nations were accused of human rights
abuses.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was among the countries accused by the
organization, which charged that Beijing conducted its most
heavy-handed crackdown on dissent in a decade during the year. The
group also noted the thousands of arbitrary arrests, unfair trials,
and widespread torture that occurred in that country.</P>
      <P>"The year 1999 saw the most serious and wide-ranging crackdown on
peaceful dissent in China for a decade," Amnesty said in the report,
challenging Beijing's "sincerity in signing key human rights
conventions over the previous two years."</P>
      <P>"Thousands of people were arbitrarily detained by police and some
were sentenced to long prison terms after unfair trials or sent to
forced labor camps," the report pointed out.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   16   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan said the government has made flight safety
one of its top priorities and expressed the hope that the rate of
aviation incidents could be cut to zero.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks while making a round of inspection of the
Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) on Friday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Yu-hern reported that the incident
rate for aircraft over 20,000 kilograms in weight was three per 1
million hours of flight over the past decade, with the rate being
reduced to 2.32 incidents per 1 million flight hours this year.</P>
      <P>The CAA is working toward the goal of a zero incident rate in the
next three years, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh stressed that the government has made flight safety one of
its top priorities, and the goal will require the cooperation of
every related government agency, adding that she hoped a zero flight
incident rate could be achieved right away.</P>
      <P>She asked the CAA not to let its guard down on flight safety at
any time, noting that currently three quarters of all flight
incidents are due to human factors.</P>
      <P>She also instructed the CAA to closely monitor airline operations
and point out any major flaws before an incident may occur.</P>
      <P>Yeh later toured Eva Airways and China Airlines, where she tried

    <HEADLINE>ROC FM TO LEAVE FOR MACEDONIA, VATICAN VISIT ON JUNE 20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao will leave
for an eight-day overseas trip on Tuesday, which will take him to the
Republic of China's only two allies in Europe -- Macedonia and the
Vatican City, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Friday.</P>
      <P>This will be the scholar-turned-minister's first overseas visit
since assuming office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiang-pu, director of the MOFA's European Affairs
Department, told a routine news conference that Tien's visit is
mainly aimed at cementing the ROC's bilateral relations with
Macedonia and the Holy See.</P>
      <P>Liu said Tien has received a formal invitation from his
Macedonian counterpart for his upcoming visit. During his stay in
Macedonia, Tien will hold talks with senior Macedonian officials on
matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Tien will inspect the 12 ongoing ROC-Macedonian cooperative
projects and review progress in construction of an export processing
zone (EPZ) in Bunardzik, an industrial city near Macedonian capital
Skopje. The EPZ is an ROC-Macedonian join venture designed to attract
Taiwan businesspeople to invest in the southeastern Balkan state.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tien will sign an agreement with Macedonia on the
establishment of a US$10 million development fund to help boost
Macedonia's economic development. The ROC will donate the money, and
the two countries will form a joint committee to manage the fund.
According to the soon-to-be-signed accord, Liu said, Macedonia will
only use interest income from the fund to finance various
carefully selected development projects.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Tien will also donate a batch of computers
and relevant equipment to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the ROC is now Macedonia's second largest
donor. When former ROC Premier Vincent Siew visited Skopje last year,
he also offered US$10.5 million in aid to Macedonia on behalf of the
ROC government.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macedonia attaches great importance to its ties with
the ROC, Liu said relations between the two countries have been
growing steadily.</P>
      <P>Macedonia forged formal diplomatic ties with the ROC in January
1999, making it the ROC's second ally in Europe after the Vatican
City.</P>
      <P>Following his Macedonia visit, Tien will travel to the Vatican
City on June 24 for a four-day visit. In addition to meeting with
his Holy See counterpart, MOFA sources said Tien is likely to meet
with even higher-level Vatican officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BANANA GROWERS IN HOT WATER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, June 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's banana growers
have been caught in an unprecedented dilemma these days as they face
cut-throat competition in Japan and disastrously low prices at home
because of over-production.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-produced bananas have faced fierce competition in Japan
since May this year, when the Philippines began dumping its bananas
at lower-than-reasonable prices, sources from the Kaohsiung Fruit
Growers Association claimed on Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese varieties, which used to be the Japanese consumer's
banana of choice because of its sweetness, are now exported to Japan
at unit price of 1,400 yen per carton, a price even lower than its
production cost of about 1,750 yen, the association lamented.</P>
      <P>In February, March and April this year, before the Philippines'
"mountain banana" had entered the Japanese market in large
quantities, Taiwan's bananas enjoyed reasonable export prices there
-- at an average price of 2,500 yen per 12-kg carton, the fruit
growers noted.</P>
      <P>Since early May, however, Philippine banana exports to Japan have
increased 37 percent, and the "mountain banana" has reached over 4
million cartons.</P>
      <P>Lower-than-reasonable export prices have driven banana growers to
shun the Japanese market -- a situation that has pushed down
wholesale and retail prices in domestic markets as a result of local
over-supply.</P>
      <P>Lee Chih-jung, agriculture director of the Kaohsiung County
Government, suggested that the central government buy the stockpiled
bananas and then have the fresh stocks incinerated in order to avoid
turning the fruit into a "bad apple" in the island's fruit market.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese bananas are mainly grown in the southern counties of
Kaohsiung and Pingtung and in central Taiwan's Taichung County. Their
cultivation is a major source of income for farmers in those three
counties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US PENTAGON CHIEF STARTS HECTIC VISIT IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Defense Secretary William Perry
met with Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao on Friday
for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Perry, who has been shuttling between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait over the past couple of years to push for the establishment of
an unofficial "Track II" cross-strait dialogue channel, arrived in
Taipei on Thursday evening for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>His current visit, Perry's first trip to the island since the new
ROC government was inaugurated on May 20, was made at Tien's
invitation, and their meeting on Friday took place behind closed
doors.</P>
      <P>Also present at the meeting were Eugene Chien, deputy
secretary-general to the president, Chiou I-jen, deputy
secretary-general of the National Security Council, and Chen
Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) which
charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>The agenda was believed to focus on topics related to the
long-deadlocked Taipei-Beijing relations and the delicate triangular
Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Perry paid a visit to Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Perry met later in the day with MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen for
an exchange of views on cross-strait relations, mainland China's
internal situation and the general political and economic climate in
the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He will also meet with President Chen Shui-bian, the ROC's first
opposition leader-turned-president, and Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen
before his departure for Shanghai on Saturday to continue his East
Asian tour which will also take him to Seoul and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile on Friday, MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung said that
although the ROC government consistently recognizes the value of
"Track II" or "Track III" unofficial dialogue channels to the
promotion of cross-strait communications, it believes that the most
urgent task for the moment is engineering a resumption of regular
dialogue between the SEF and Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies authorized by
their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Noting that "Track II" or "Track III" can only help bridge
cross-strait contacts, Chen said substantive issues can be discussed
only via officially authorized SEF-ARATS dialogue channels. He added
that he does not hope to see the involvement of "Track II" or "Track
III" in any substantive talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO HEED IMPACT OF DECREASED FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Friday asked the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) to pay attention to the impact on Taiwan's
industry of cutting the number of foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks during a public hearing with the theme of
"moving toward a middle way of foreign labor policy" convened by
Legislator Lin Feng-hsi of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin cited the example of British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, saying that Blair, of the Labor Party, himself has said that
ensuring the competitiveness of business is the first step toward
safeguarding the rights of workers.</P>
      <P>Blair said that the "middle way" will create a win-win situation
for both labor and business, Lin added as he urged the government to
follow suit.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that as the government now seems to be moving toward
tightening its policy toward foreign laborers, domestic businesses
have had difficulty finding laborers to fill labor-intensive and
night-shift positions, even though the pay meets the standards
requested by the labor unions.</P>
      <P>He lamented the fact that the labor shortage has caused a lowering
in production capacity and delays in new investment plans.</P>
      <P>The record high unemployment rate among aboriginal people has
also led CLA Chairman Chen Chu to state that she will work toward
controlling the number of foreign laborers, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Shao-ping of the Kuomintang said to let foreign
laborers be entitled to the same minimum wage is detrimental to
domestic laborers.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Chi-jen said that the council will still
cut the number of foreign laborers by an average of 15,000 per year
as instructed by CLA Chairman Chen, but it will also pay attention to
the impact of the decreased number of foreign laborers on industry.</P>
      <P>Kuo noted that the most affected domestic laborers are mainly
aboriginal laborers, and the industries suffering from the decreased
number of foreign laborers include the high-tech, traditional, and
construction industries.</P>

make "groundless" speculation over the issue.</P>
      <P>Ever since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's

repeatedly said he is willing to serve as a special envoy between

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese officials are supportive
of the annual pilgrimage to mainland China from central Taiwan, Yen
Ching-piao, chairman of Taiwan's popular Chenlan Temple, said here on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Yen arrived in Beijing on Wednesday on behalf of Taiwanese
worshipers of Matsu, the goddess of the sea, to seek official support
for a pilgrimage from central Taiwan's Taichung County to Fujian
Province's Meizhou Island.</P>
      <P>He said the cross-strait voyage will begin as scheduled on July
16, as he obtained a favorable response from mainland Chinese
officials.</P>
      <P>Yen, who also serves as speaker of Taichung County Council, said
he asked Beijing officials to cooperate for the convenience of the
approximately 6,000 pilgrims and media representatives from Taiwan
when they arrive in Fujian.</P>
      <P>According to Yen's spokeswoman Liu Shu-mei, he was entertained
with a luncheon on Thursday by officials from the State Council's
Taiwan Affairs Office, including Deputy Director Li Bingcai and Li
Yafei, deputy secretary-general of the semi-official Association for

      <P>Also on Thursday, according to Liu, Yen met with mainland vice
communications ministers and exchanged views with Hu Hanxiang,
director of the Water Transportation Administration under the
Ministry of Communications, on details of the informal cross-strait
voyage.</P>
      <P>Hu told Yen that the mainland authorities will render assistance
to the pilgrims whether they proceed to the mainland via air or sea,
according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen stressed that Chenlan Temple respects the Republic
of China government's recent resolution that it will make a decision
on "direct religious links with mainland China" in six months, and
that until then, all Taiwanese pilgrimages to the mainland should be
made through a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Yen said the pilgrimage scheduled to set off on July 16 will take
a route through a third country or area, but added that the exact

    <HEADLINE>KMT ACTING CHAIRMAN ANALYZES PARTY'S DEFEAT, CALLS FOR REJUVENATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Acting Chairman Lien Chan on
Friday attributed his party's defeat in the March 18 presidential
election to a combination of factors, including the party's loss of
idealism.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president and the KMT's standard-bearer in
the presidential race, made the remarks at the opening of a meeting
of the KMT's old-guard Central Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>Lien said the KMT has left admirable legacies in its 55-year rule
of Taiwan, including developing the island from an agricultural
backwater to a booming economic powerhouse and completing its
democratization.</P>
      <P>"Despite this outstanding record, several major reasons have
prevented us from winning enough popular support in the hotly
contested presidential election," Lien noted, adding that the party
should conduct soul-searching, self-examination and self-improvement
in order to regain power in time for the next presidential election
in four years' time.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that the most serious problem facing the KMT is
its loss of idealism. "Our party's basic concepts have become
obsolete and have lost their appeal to young party members and
general voters," he said.</P>
      <P>He also cited the following other reasons for the KMT's
embarrassing election defeat:</P>
      <P>-- The KMT's policy-making mechanism lacks democratic spirit, and
consequently, its decisions have often failed to comply with
mainstream public opinion or have fallen short of public
expectations. Moreover, limited participation in the policy-making
process by rank-and-file party members has minimized their
identification with the party.</P>
      <P>-- The party's nomination mechanism for the election of various
levels of public functionaries could neither meet the public's high
expectations nor satisfy the intraparty demand for fair competition.
As a result, the KMT has faced the crisis of splits before nearly
every major domestic political election.</P>
      <P>-- Because of the party's long grip on power and opposition
parties' "ill-motivated" mudslinging, the KMT's image has been
"distorted" as a conservative, interest-oriented and gang-linked
political group.</P>
      <P>-- The KMT's grassroots apparatus has become rigid and almost
inactive, and many party activities have been unable to elicit public
interest or meet public demand.</P>
      <P>To cope with these problems, Lien said, the party has formed a
reform committee to work out a comprehensive party re-engineering and
rejuvenation plan for sweeping intraparty restructuring.</P>
      <P>"We must review and examine our defects and deficiencies
sincerely, stop passing the buck and end any meaningless intraparty
squabbling," Lien urged.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged all KMT members, regardless of seniority and
ethnic origin, to stand united and work together for the party's
sustainable development and bright future.</P>

      <P>Longbaoshan, a village 70 kilometers
north of Beijing, is in the path of an advancing desert, with huge
sand dunes creeping a few meters closer every year, the Sydney
Morning Herald reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the paper reported that each year,
2,640 square kilometers of once-arable land is turned into desert,
but added that what has really made Chinese people sit up and take
notice lately is that the sands are now heading towards Beijing at an
alarming rate of two kilometers a year.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also suffered more than a dozen severe dust storms
since April this year. The latest storm dust last week reduced
visibility to a few hundreds meters and coated the city in a film of
dust, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Longbaoshan's plight has attracted attention because it is so
close to Beijing and this has prompted Premier Zhu Rongji to urge
people to plant more trees in a bid to slow the pace of
desertification, the daily reported.</P>

mainland China -- about 2.6 million square kilometers -- is now

    <HEADLINE>MAC CONCERNED ABOUT ARREST OF TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Saturday expressed its concern about the reported arrest of
30-plus Taiwanese businesspeople in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, was
responding to a report on the alleged arrests "for unknown reasons"
by Legislator Chu Hsing-yu of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>According to Chu, two senior executives with Hungqing Plastics
Co. in Dongguan, Kuangdong Province, a company owned by Winston Wang,
son of Taiwan's business tycoon Wang Yung-ching, were among those
detained.</P>
      <P>As Winston Wang recently formed a US$6.4 billion joint venture
with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's son Jiang Mienheng for
a silicon wafer production plant, the arrest of the two Hungqing
executives has caused much speculation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chu's report, Fu Don-cheng, director of the MAC's
Economic Affairs Department, said the arrests could be related to
mainland China's anti-tax evasion campaign.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China has continued investigating the tax records of
individual companies. We think that the reported mass arrest of
Taiwan businesspeople could be part of mainland China's anti-tax
evasion operations," Fu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Fu went on, the MAC will keep a close watch on the
development of the event to determine whether mainland China has any
other considerations or intentions in detaining so many Taiwan
businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Fu further said mainland China's ongoing anti-tax evasion
campaign will not affect Taiwan's current policy on mainland
China-bound investment.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has adopted a "go slow" mainland investment
policy, Taiwan entrepreneurs have poured US$30 billion to US$40
billion into the mainland for various investment projects over the
past decade. Mainland China now boasts some 40,000 Taiwan-owned
companies, according to mainland tallies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OPENS EXTRAORDINARY SESSION IN SOMBER MOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By  Lilian  Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The vanquished Kuomintang on Saturday held
its first party congress since the party's defeat in the March 18
presidential election in a mood of deep sorrow and soul-searching.</P>
      <P>Acting KMT Chairman Lien Chan led party delegates in a
presentation of flowers to the large statue of KMT founder Dr. Sun
Yat-shen at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall before the opening of the
KMT's extraordinary session of the 15th National Congress at the
hall.</P>
      <P>Party heavyweights such as former Legislative Yuan President
Liang Su-yung looked downcast, and Wang Tso-yung, former head of the
Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, wept when they sang
National Anthem and a song in memory of Sun Yat-sen and pondered the
humiliating election loss that saw the KMT ousted by the Democratic
Progressive Party after more than five decades in power on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his opening address to the two-day meeting, Lien urged all
party members to work toward the party's victory in the next
election.</P>
      <P>Lien, the standard-bearer of the KMT in the election debacle,
said that the party lost the election because of serious internal
problems, including a major party split.</P>
      <P>He noted that the "party members could not unify," and that the
party failed because "it could not get the backing of the majority."</P>
      <P>Lien said the party's reforms will address the following
issues: reviving the party members' ideals to fight for the party's
goal; bringing democracy to the party's policy-making and its
nomination procedures for public functionaries; and finding a
mechanism to rejuvenate the party.</P>
      <P>He also defined the KMT as a "democratic, just and innovative
party for the people," and that its ideals, based on the three
principles of Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- nationalism, democracy and social
well-being -- aim to build a secure and high-quality Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien who ran unopposed for the party chairmanship, garnered 94.83
percent, or 1,597 votes out of 1,684 present delegates, to be elected
to the post. The figure was slightly lower than the percentage of
votes he won when he was nominated as the party's presidential
candidate last August.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui stepped down after the
presidential election to take responsibility for the defeat.</P>
      <P>Lien said that while he felt deeply for losing the presidential
election, he decided nonetheless to run for the party chairmanship
because of his commitment to the party. He added that he has
unshirkable responsibility toward the party, and vowed to revive its
past glory.</P>
      <P>Lien was expected to ask the party congress to approve his four
nominated party vice chairmen -- former Premier Vincent Siew,
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, former Presidential Adviser
Wu Poh-hsiung and former Defense Minister Chiang Chung-lin.</P>
      <P>In addition to the election of the party chairman, two other
major issues on the congress agenda will include the passing of the
party reform package and a revision of the party platform, both of
which were expected to be discussed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, protesters skirmished with party workers several times
outside the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, with KMT diehards demanding
the expulsion of Lee Teng-hui from the party, transparency in the
party assets, and the popular election of the party chairman.</P>
      <P>The protests erupted when Lin Feng-cheng, secretary-general of
the KMT Central Committee and KMT Spokesman Jason Hu arrived at the
scene.</P>
      <P>The old KMT members and party workers scuffled and exchanged
punches, and Chien Wei-chang, director of the KMT's Evaluation and
Disciplinary Committee, had his jacket torn by the angry protesters.</P>

      <P>Two inmates serving jail terms at a
military prison in Hsintien, Taipei County, staged a breakout on
Friday, according to a press statement released by the Prosecutor's
Office of the Northern Martial Court on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The press release said the two prisoners, identified as Hsu
Cheng-hsiang and Lai Han-wei, climbed the razor-wire wall of the
prison after being allowed out of their cells for a smoke and made
off on a stolen motorcycle.</P>
      <P>The press release said a manhunt has been launched by police and
military police, and added that military prosecutors are looking into
the incident to see if anyone should be held responsible for the
breakout.</P>
      <P>According to the United Daily News, the two fugitives stopped a
woman and commandeered her motorcycle. She reported the incident and
police erected roadblocks on the roads leading out of Hsintien but
did not catch the men, described as convicted thieves.</P>
      <P>According to the motorcyclist's account, the fugitives might have
suffered cuts while climbing the razor-wire fence, and one of them
might have broken his foot.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top economic planning body on
Saturday urged innovation in industrial technology, saying successful
research and development is the only way to ensure the nation's
continued economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
that in the dawn of the "information economy," the government and
private sectors have to work hand-in-hand in the research of patents,
and stressed that only innovation will ensure a competitive edge and
growth potential.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's Overall Planning Department said that statistics on
patents approved by the United States between 1993 and 1998 show that
approved Taiwan applications jumped from 1,510 to 3,805 during the
period, averaging an annual growth rate of 21 percent, or
fourth-highest in the world.</P>
      <P>In terms of the patent approval rate averaged out according to
population, the number of patents originating in Taiwan was higher
than those of Germany, Canada, France, Britain and Italy, and
1.4-fold and four-fold higher, respectively, compared to the figures
recorded in South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that application of information will be the prime
mover of societal progress and economic growth in the future, and it
urged the government to step up local research and development and
encourage people to devote themselves to patent research.</P>

      <P>The Kuomintang's assets totaled more than
NT$78 billion (US$2.5 billion) as of the end of April, KMT
Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the assets of the former ruling party include
NT$49 million-worth of bank deposits, NT$4.4 billion-worth of stocks,
US government bonds worth NT$600 million, NT$1.3 billion dollars in
funds for development of party affairs, long-term investment capital
of NT$62.7 billion, and NT$8.7 billion-worth of land and real estate.</P>
      <P>Lin made the report at a two-day extraordinary session of the
party's 15th national congress held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>As the KMT's huge assets have long been viewed by the public as a
result of its notorious "black gold" -- mobster- and money-linked

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National security and social stability must
take precedence when considerations are being given to setting up
cross-Taiwan Strait links with mainland China, an ROC official in
charge of mainland affairs said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, director of the Department of Economic Affairs
under the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said economic development
of the offshore islands belonging to Taiwan should take into
consideration the needs of the people living there rather than just
resorting to the so-called "mini three links" to achieve the
development goal.</P>
      <P>Fu made the remarks at a news conference when answering questions
from reporters on government regulations on development on offshore
islands and the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to direct trade, transport, and
postal links between the Republic of China-controlled frontline
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the nearby offshore islets of the
mainland's Fujian Province, which lies directly across the Taiwan
Strait from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, the MAC, in compliance with e ROC laws, will
complete an assessment of the "mini three links" as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that satisfying the needs of the local people
on the two frontline islands is the core issue, and that the
establishment of the "mini three links" is not necessarily the best
strategy for obtaining this goal.</P>
      <P>Fu added that setting up the "mini three links" should not be
equated to the establishment of full "direct three links" between
Taiwan proper and mainland China, and noted that the mini links must
be implemented before any regular direct links.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that establishing the mini links must be made
based upon national security and social stability.</P>
      <P>With regard to the hotly debated "direct cross-strait religious
pilgrimages," Fu said the MAC has made it very clear that such
pilgrims must travel through a third country or area aboard
foreign-registered vessels.</P>
      <P>He was responding to requests that mass pilgrimages be given
permission on a case-by-case basis to make direct crossings from
central Taiwan's Taichung Harbor to the island of Meizhou, off the
Fujian coast. According to legend, the island is the birthplace of
Matsu, goddess of the sea, and thousands of local followers of Matsu
make the crossing each year as part of a religious ritual.</P>
      <P>Fu concluded that while the ROC government of course wishes to
allow direct religious cross-strait pilgrimages at the earliest date,
many legal issues are involved and the top priority must be that
national security and dignity are fully ensured.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei will be discharged from
the Taipei Veterans General Hospital on Sunday, ready to begin his
normal working schedule.</P>
      <P>Tang, who checked into the hospital on April 15 to have a tumor
removed from his chest, has been recovering well, according to his
doctors, who added that Tang's white blood cell count, blood
pressure, breathing and pulse are all normal.</P>
      <P>Since being sworn in as Republic of China's new premier on May
20, Tang had been working at the Executive Yuan part-time on the
advice of his doctors and of President Chen Shui-bian, who insisted
that Tang should make his health his first priority.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun stressed nevertheless that Tang had been
in full charge of Cabinet affairs during his convalescence.</P>
      <P>Yu said that while many might be under the impression that he
took over administrative affairs during Tang's hospitalization, the
premier had actually been able to issue instructions, read
information and receive phone calls in his hospital bed.</P>
      <P>Yu said that he had only acted as a communicator and coordinator

    <HEADLINE>KMT SHOULD REFORM TO REFURBISH ITS IMAGE: KMT SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang should refurbish its image
through reform, KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an extraordinary session of the party's 15th KMT
national congress, Lin urged all party members to commit themselves
to the party's cause and put it before personal gains, saying that
only commitment can inject enthusiasm into the party bureaucracy and
distinguish it from an "ordinary administration."</P>
      <P>Noting that the party has lost its attraction for the nation's
youth and is graying quickly, the party secretary-general called for
the recruitment of new blood into the party and urged that they be
offered broad access to the political arena.</P>
      <P>Admitting that the party has fallen out of alignment with public
opinion because of its undemocratic policy-making mechanism and its
undemocratic way of picking up party candidates in races for public
office, Lin said this has resulted in a mass exodus of dissidents
that has threatened the party's unity.</P>
      <P>Now that a new and fully democratic mechanism has been prepared
for approval during the meeting, Lin said he hopes the party members
will abide by the new democratic system and will respect the results
worked out through due process.</P>
      <P>As to the work of improving the party's image, Lin lambasted the
media for what he called their "pathological interest" in exposing
the party's seamier side while ignoring its achievements.</P>
      <P>This biased coverage contributed to the party's landslide defeat
in the presidential election, said Lin.</P>
      <P>He pledged to communicate with the media efficiently in order
that the public can be given a "true picture" of the party rather
than a "misleading, distorted" one.</P>
      <P>Liu Chao-shiuan, the co-convenor of the party's reform panel,
urged the candidates vying for membership of the party's central
standing committee to run honestly, without wheeling and dealing,
wining and dining, or offering bribes, all of which he admitted have
been widespread in previous party elections.</P>
      <P>"Although we have lost the power to rule, the KMT still holds the
majority in the Legislative Yuan and can flex it muscles as long as
it can unite its members," he said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to convince suspicious members that the party will
not transform itself into a party focusing on "Taiwan, rather than
the Republic of China," KMT Acting Chairman Lien Chan said at the
beginning of the conference that the party's policy of
"Taiwanization" is not designed to rid it of its Chinese origins.</P>
      <P>However, Lien told his comrades that the KMT will follow the
principle that "Taiwan is the top priority, rank-and-file party
members enjoy supremacy."</P>
      <P>His remarks were interpreted by Chang Jung-kung, director-general
of the KMT's Mainland Affairs Research Department, as referring to
the KMT's policy of "standing in Taiwan while setting its gaze on
mainland China."</P>
      <P>In other words, Chang said, "Taiwanization" is a means for the
party to inspire mainland China to step out on the same path as that
followed by Taiwan.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang heavyweights at an extraordinary
session of the party's 15th national congress on Saturday called for
party unity while protesters outside the session's venue called for
the expulsion of former party chairman Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Secretary-General John Chang called on his comrades to
unite rather than point the finger at former party leaders.</P>
      <P>Elections of legislators and magistrates of local governments
scheduled for next year are a serious challenge for the party after
its humiliating defeat in the March 18 presidential election, and
unity will be more important than ever if the party hopes to remain a
major political player in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang would not comment on whether the KMT should team up with
the opposition People First Party in the upcoming elections, other
than to say that the matter needs careful study.</P>
      <P>On a separate note, the illegitimate son of late President Chiang
Ching-kuo also revealed that he could travel to Chiang's home
province of Zhejiang in mainland China as soon as this autumn to
visit the graves of Chiang's ancestors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a KMT
stalwart, echoed Chang's view that unity is more important than
passing the buck for the election defeat.</P>
      <P>He called on the protesters gathered outside the Sun Yat-sen
Memorial Hall, the venue of the KMT congress, to calm down and direct
their energies to party reform.</P>
      <P>Later that afternoon, KMT Acting Chairman Lien Chan was formally
elected party chairman, whereupon he promised to make the party a
driving force for the country's democracy, freedom, stability and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>He said he considered the chairmanship a great honor and that he
was confident he could stand up to the challenges facing the KMT.

PRESIDENT URGES NTU GRADUATES TO MAINTAIN `CREATIVE MINDS'</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 17 (CNA) President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
encouraged graduating students at National Taiwan University (NTU) to
maintain their creativity and ingenuity after leaving school to start
their new lives.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an NTU commencement ceremony, Chen said that like
himself in his new job, all new NTU graduates will be freshmen in the
places where they will work or study following their graduation.</P>
      <P>"Although some people may worry that rookies might encounter many
problems in a new environment or workplace, I believe that they can
inject new blood and vitality into an old organization," said Chen,
who assumed the presidency on May 20.</P>
      <P>The human rights-lawyer-turned-president further said he is
convinced that tenderpads can more easily shed old burdens and carry
out sweeping and innovative reforms than can the "old guard."</P>
      <P>"I firmly believe that where there are dreams, there are hopes
and dynamics to pursue progress," Chen said, adding: "So long as you
can keep a creative mind and enterprising spirit, uphold your ideals,
bravely face setbacks and carefully examine the reasons behind
failures, you will be able to carve out a road to success."</P>
      <P>Chen, himself an NTU alumnus, recalled many fond memories of his
years at NTU. "I am proud to be an NTU graduate. Many senior
officials in my administration, including Vice President Annette Lu,
are also NTU alumni. Our school really has cultivated a large number
of outstanding talents for our country."</P>
      <P>Noting that NTU is considered Taiwan's No. 1 university, Chen
said he hopes the school can further develop itself into the island's
first globalized top-notch university.</P>
      <P>"More important, I hope more NTU graduates can sense Taiwan's
mainstream impulses and become the first people to help cast light
into the many dark corners in our society," the president said.</P>
      <P>Chen, who at 49 is the ROC's youngest president, further said he
believes that only by sharing what they have learned at NTU with
underprivileged persons will NTU alumni be able to live up to general
social expectations and further glorify the school's high reputation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ARMY PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE REFLECTS `TENSE' CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Army announced a major personnel
reshuffle on Saturday, which military sources said reflects to some
extent the tension and uncertainty in the current relations across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The army reshuffled all three offshore defense commands --
Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu -- as well as the Hualien-Taitung defense
command in eastern Taiwan and the Eighth Army command in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Military authorities said the personnel reshuffle was mainly made
necessary by the retirement of former Political Warfare Department
Director Tsao Wen-sheng, who is now a strategy adviser to the
president, and the departure of former Combined Service Force
Commander-in-Chief Yang Teh-chih to become chairman of the Vocational
Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen in the new government.</P>
      <P>However, other army sources said the reshuffle reflects the
current state of the cross-strait situation, citing the fact that all
three of the offshore defense commands underwent personnel
reshuffles, a practice rarely seen in the past.</P>
      <P>According to a press release issued by the Army General
Headquarters (AGH), Hsueh Shih-min, the incumbent commander of the
Matsu Defense Command, will be promoted to the post of top commander
of the Kinmen Defense Command, while the position made vacant by
Hsueh's departure will be filled by Lu Hua-ning, current commander of
the Penghu Defense Command. Lai Kuang-tan, director of the AGH's
Operations Department and an expert in anti-landing combat strategy,
will succeed Lu as head of the Penghu Defense Command.</P>
      <P>Military sources said all the new chiefs of the three offshore
defense commands are known for their steady, composed and
sophisticated personal characters and their rich experience in
defense operations on Taiwan's outlying islands, which with the
exception of Penghu lie closer to mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A recent report prepared by the National Security Bureau for the
Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee described as "tense" the
cross-strait situation around the time of President Chen shui-bian's
May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen also said on May 31 at
his first press conference since assuming office that the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) on the other side of the Taiwan Strait has
continued its pressure on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, mainland China reshuffled personnel at its Nanjin and
Jinan military zones, both of which are in coastal areas close to
Taiwan, earlier this year. In that reshuffle, generals with practical
combat experience were named as the top commanders of the two
military regions.</P>
      <P>Military experts said that although there is little likelihood of
an eruption of military conflict in the Taiwan Strait for the moment,
cross-strait tension still runs high. Moreover, they added, the PLA
has maintained its hard-line rhetoric and stance toward Taiwan since
Chen's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Against this background, military observers said the General
Staff Headquarters and the Army General Headquarters have been very
prudent in preparing for the latest personnel reshuffle and that the
president has fully respected the joint decision of the two
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the observers said the offshore defense commands'
personnel reshuffle has also taken into account the need for
preparations for the future opening of direct "mini three links" --
trade, shipping and mail -- between Taiwan's outlying islands and
mainland China's coastal cities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM NEW 'STRAIGHT' ARCTIC AIR ROUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's airlines are unlikely to benefit
from a newly-proposed North Pole air route, which will shorten flight
times between cities in the Western and Eastern Hemispheres from
three to five hours, because of the island's political situation,
sources from China Airlines (CAL) said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cathay Pacific Airways is currently conducting test flights from
Hong Kong to Toronto via the North Pole, a "strait line" route and
the shortest possible path, which will use less fuel and shorten
flight times for the carrier and its passengers. The new route would
be about three hours shorter than current flight paths, which stop
over in Anchorage, Alaska.</P>
      <P>However, the Arctic "straight line" route is not likely to
benefit Taiwan's carriers, CAL officials said, citing the fact that
Taiwan does not maintain no air pacts with Russia or mainland China.
The new route passes over both of the geographically big countries.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is unlikely to formally sign any air pact with Russia or
mainland China in the near future, making it almost impossible for
the island's carriers to join their counterparts in the rest of the
world in taking advantage of the shorter route, CAL officials said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Sunday urged
graduates of Taipei's Tsai Hsin Elementary, Junior and Senior High

      <P>"Life is like a stage play," Chen said, adding that everyone
plays an irreplaceable role, even comic characters or supporting
actors with no spoken lines.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that comic characters not only bring laughter to
others, but also convey many hidden messages about life. He added
that sometimes such a character's performance may draw even more
applause than that of the main actor or actress.</P>
      <P>Chen said, "There is no role too big -- or too small." He went on
to say that some roles call for no spoken lines at all, but so long
as the characters focus on their parts in the play, even silent
players can be "best supporting actors."</P>
      <P>When the curtain falls, the audience will tally up the score,
Chen said, encouraging each student to discover and clarify his or
her role and become responsible actors on the stage of life.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time that Chen spoke at a high school
graduation ceremony in Taipei since his May 20 inauguration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO OPPOSITION PARTIES NOT RULING OUT POSSIBILITY OF COOPERATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ranking officials from two major opposition
parties said on Sunday that they are not ruling out cooperating with
each other in the next elections.</P>
      <P>John Chang, former secretary general of the Kuomintang (KMT),
said that next year's legislative election is expected to be a tough
contest and that the KMT will have to think about how to develop
mutually beneficial relations with the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks on the second-day of the extraordinary
session of the KMT's 15th National Congress at Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Hall.</P>
      <P>But he said that it is still too early to talk about substantial
plans on cooperation, and added that any inter-party cooperation will
depend on further developments.</P>
      <P>The political map in Taiwan has been re-drawn since the March 18
presidential election, which saw the KMT losing to the Democratic
Progressive Party after more than five decades in power, and the
emergence of the People First Party (PFP), formed by supporters of
James Soong, a former KMT heavyweight who finished second in the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary General Chung Jung-chi said that for now, his party
will cooperate with others as long as they have the same stance as
the PFP on certain issues.</P>
      <P>Chung, speaking on the sideline of
a Buddhist youth association
on Sunday, noted that political parties should compete with each
other in a positive way. "It would be impractical if the PFP shuts
the door now (to inter-party cooperation)," he added.</P>
      <P>Chung said that PFP's willingness to cooperate with other
political parties extends to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), if the DPP presents policies that are in the public's
interest.</P>
      <P>But he cautioned that as there is still some time before the
mayoral, magistrate and legislative elections scheduled at the end of
2001, it is still too early to talk about cooperation and strategic
alliances.</P>
      <P>Chung stressed that the PFP will have a presence in all major
elections, including Taipei's mayoral election -- despite popular
incumbent Ma Ying-jeou's statement that he will seek reelection.</P>
      <P>Chung noted that PFP Chairman James Soong garnered 36.8 percent
of the vote in the March election, second only Chen Shui-bian's 39.3=20
percent. He added that the PFP stands a good chance to win the
mayoral election if it nominates a candidate with qualifications
similar to Soong.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the PFP will consider cooperation with other
political parties in individual elections, but added that the
situation is not yet clear and it is still too early to talk about
such cooperation.</P>

as of the highest importance. A gentleman who has valor, but is
without a knowledge and love of what is right, is likely to commit a
crime. A common man who has courage, but is without the knowledge and
love of what is right, is likely to become a robber."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN ECONOMIC RECOVERY SEEN AS FRAGILE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economic recovery in Asian countries
is looking fragile after a year and a half, with the exceptions of
Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore, according to a new
survey in the Australian Financial Review on Monday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted economists as revealing that among 11 Asian
countries, excluding Japan, seven were today as inclined, or even
more inclined, to channel good money into bad investments, a practice
that triggered the financial crisis in Thailand in 1997 that then
spread to other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted economic analysts from Goldman Sachs, UBS
Warburg, Korea Exchange Bank, the World Bank Milken Institute in
California, and the Asian Development Bank Institute in Japan as
concluding that these countries still retain the characteristics that
resulted in the poor investments of the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The remaining four higher-income economies -- Taiwan, Hong Kong,
South Korea and Singapore -- are exceptions because they can change
or adjust their strategies to improve the health of their economic
structures, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Although East Asia, excluding Japan, is again the fastest-growing
area in the world, expanding annually by 6 percent, the economists
said they believe the growth is very fragile.</P>
      <P>"The crisis has left two legacies: heavy debt and greater
household insurity. It has also left the region more vulnerable to
external shocks," the World Bank said in its assessment.</P>
      <P>Experts believe that reforms in East Asia have been inadequate,
and this in turn challenges the prospects for continued growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EAST ASIA SEEN MAINTAINING HI-TECH PRODUCTION DOMINANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>East Asia, including Taiwan, Singapore
and South Korea, will remain the world's important maker of
high-technology products, according to a leading expert.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review on Monday quoted Professor
Sanjaya Lall of Oxford University as saying the region will retain
its position because it does the two things critical to success -- it
develops human capital and it uses foreign multinationals' advanced
technologies.</P>
      <P>He added that India would not be able to displace East Asia and
that Latin America and Africa were falling behind in this area.</P>
      <P>"World trade is increasingly driven by technological intensity.
Five years ago, 10 percent of world trade was in high-tech products
and today it is 24 percent," he said.</P>
      <P>Lall pointed out that countries, aside from developing their
indigenous capabilities, also need to use foreign technology and
know-how to remain successful.</P>
      <P>He cited Taiwan and South Korea as examples as both are starting
to open up to foreign multinationals to take advantage of these
companies' high technology in order to maintain their market
dominance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PALACE MUSEUM WILLING TO PROMOTE EXHIBITION OF TREASURES ON MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Palace Museum (NPM) Director Tu
Cheng-sheng said on Monday that the museum will not oppose lending
its invaluable collection of Chinese objets d'art for exhibition in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"So long as we can ensure the return and impeccability of our
priceless art treasures, we'll be pleased to see the exhibition of
our art collection on the mainland," Tu said during a report on NPM
operations at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Education and
Cultural Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Tu said the proposed mainland presentation of the NPM exhibits
can serve as a new ROC government's goodwill gesture to the mainland
as well as help promote mutual understanding and trust between the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tu said the proposal is still on the drawing
board. "As the plan is related to the government's overall policy
goal, the museum cannot unilaterally make a final decision," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tu's report, Legislator Lin Cho-shui said he
personally supports cross-strait reconciliation and that
cross-strait exchanges of exhibitions of their cherished objets
d'art are necessary in forging rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Lin also reminded Tu that he need not worry about Beijing's
possible refusal to return the NPM exhibits on the excuse that the
NPM collection was moved from the mainland to Taiwan after the
Chinese communists took control of the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said if Beijing were to do so, it would mean that Beijing no
longer recognized Taiwan's links to Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>In his report, Tu also cited several problems facing the museum.
He said the NPM's current organizational law must be reviewed and
revised.</P>
      <P>"The museum is now subject to the jurisdiction of the Cabinet.
However, the museum is more like a research and educational
institute. We hope its organizational mechanism can be adjusted to
meet the practical demand and situation," Tu said.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Tu said he hopes the NPM can establish a mechanism
to facilitate its research work and minimize administrative
interferences.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the new mechanism will also be conductive
to fulfill and even strengthen the museum's educational functions,"
Tu said, adding that the museum should also be allowed to recruit
more professional personnel to promote exchanges of exhibitions with
foreign museums and handle increased exhibition of NPM treasures in
other major cities around the island.</P>
      <P>Tu also called for immediate improvement of traffic conditions
in the museum's vicinity. The museum is located in suburban Taipei,
but public transportation services to the museum have been limited.
As a result, visitors often have to drive their own cars to the
museum, resulting in serious traffic congestion in the nearby
region on holidays.</P>
      <P>"If traffic problems cannot be resolved, the museum will be
unable to present world-class art exhibitions even it has one of the
world's largest collection of exquisite Chinese objets d'art," Tu
said.</P>
      <P>Tu, the first native Taiwanese to head the NPM and an expert in
history of Taiwan, strongly denied a report that he has initiated a
change to the NPM's title.</P>
      <P>"The report was sheer speculation," Tu said, adding that
opposition lawmakers need not worry about his ethnic and
academic backgrounds would affect NPM's policy or operations.</P>
      <P>Tu, an academician of Academia Sinica, the Republic of
China's highest research body, further said he will improve
the way the museum organizes its exhibitions to meet domestic
demands and expectations.</P>
      <P>He also promised to look into certain alleged NPM-related
mismanagement of artwork procurement or other irregularities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMAN SEEKING JUSTICE IN BEIJING AFTER BEING CONNED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Liu Cheng-ching and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese businessmen filed a complaint
with Beijing authorities on Monday seeking justice and compensation
after he was conned by officials of the Xiamen local government.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-huo, formerly a deputy of the Republic of China's
National Assembly and now a businessman who has invested in mainland
China's real estate industry since 1996, said he submitted a written
report Monday to Beijing's intermediary body with Taiwan, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
complaining about how he was conned and browbeaten by Xiamen
officials.</P>
      <P>Chen meanwhile appealed for help from the State Council's Taiwan
Affairs Office in his efforts in seeking justice.</P>
      <P>He said he signed a formal contract with a development group run
by Xiamen officials in early 1996 to jointly develop a twin, 12-story
residential building in Xiamen, a port city in the southern province
of Fujian.</P>
      <P>During and after the development process, Chen said, the Xiamen
officials changed the original design plans after strong sales in
order to build two 18-story buildings without even informing him. He
added that the Xiamen officials then tampered with the sales records
and provided him with fake transaction papers.</P>
      <P>After he found that he had been bamboozled, Chen complained to
the Xiamen officials and was told that if he wanted to survive the
development project, he should foot further "due" bills, including a
foreign exchange difference of 3.5 million renminbi suffered by the
mainland authorities because of the Asian economic crisis and a
refund of 580,000 renminbi after the joint-venture "harvested an
unknown additional amount of profit" after the government amended a
natural gas utilization regulation, which raised relevant utility
fees.</P>
      <P>An indignant Chen approached the official Xiamen Credit
Investigation Bureau to tell the agency the truth. Unfortunately, he
said, he later found out that officials there were of the same
feather. Before long, he received threats from gangland figures and
was told to shut up or else.</P>
      <P>Chen said he may end up like Lin Ti-chuan, a councilwoman from
Kaohsiung City who went to northern mainland China several years ago
and was kidnapped and murdered. It remains unclear whether Lin's case
was ever clearly solved and her kidnappers and murderers actually
dealt with.</P>
      <P>Chen said all he wants is that his being cheated and maltreated
be brought to the attention of the central government, particularly
after the Beijing authorities made public measures to "protect" the
interests of Taiwanese business people and investors.</P>

interpellation at the Legislative Yuan beginning July 4, according to
Chung.</P>
      <P>Later in the morning, Tang went to the Legislative Yuan to meet
with Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-ping. Tang expressed appreciation
to Wang and his colleagues for allowing him extra time to
rehabilitate by postponing the interpellation schedule.</P>
      <P>Tang also expressed concerns that the Legislative Yuan, where the
Kuomintang (KMT) remains a majority, should soon come up with
measures to offset the impact of the sudden reduction in weekly
working hours.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan last Friday passed overwhelmingly a new,
shortened workweek program, allowing Taiwan's employees to work just
84 hours every two weeks instead of the current 96 hours. The program
is expected to be brought into force on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Tang stressed the importance of measures to help employers and
employees adjust to the new program, which is poised to deal a heavy
blow to Taiwan's industrial sector, particularly traditional
manufacturing and some high-technology industries involving assembly
and manual work.</P>
      <P>Tang, 68, underwent surgery to remove a tumor form his chest at
Veterans General Hospital (VGH) on April 16. He left the hospital on
April 29, but was readmitted on May 2 after catching a cold. Since
then, doctors have asked him to remain hospitalized for rest and
treatment because of a post-surgery infection.</P>
      <P>The premier, who temporarily left the hospital on May 20 to
attend the inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian and the new
government, said that VGH physicians have told him that he will be
healthy enough to undergo interpellation at the Legislative Yuan
between July 4 and Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>Although giving him the green light to be discharged from
hospital, the VGH authorities suggested that the premier work no more
than six hours a day as he has still not fully recovered from the
operation.</P>
      <P>VGH doctors said that Tang has recovered by 80 percent to 90
percent and that they will give him another thorough examination at
the end of June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO REAFFIRM GOODWILL TOWARD BEIJING IN PRESS CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will reaffirm
goodwill and sincerity to mainland China in his first
post-inauguration press conference on Tuesday, Presidential Office
sources said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In his 25-minute speech to be delivered in the press conference,
the sources said, President Chen will also again urge mainland China
to resume dialogue and consultation with Taiwan based on existing
foundations.</P>
      <P>The news conference is scheduled to start at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday
on the lawn in front of the Taipei Guest House, a government estate.
This will be the first time that the Republic of China's head of
state has given an open-air press conference.</P>
      <P>Presidential aides said Chen will speak on his major policy
goals, basic governing principles and his feelings about his one
month on new job in a natural, impromptu style. "There will be
no prepared text for the president's speech," said a close aide.</P>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait relations will certainly be high on the
agenda of Chen's speech. Sources said in preparation for Tuesday's
press conference, the Presidential Office, the National Security
Council and the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, have extensively discussed
issues related to cross-strait ties, including the proposed opening
of direct "three links" or "mini three links" with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Sources said Chen will uphold the context outlined in his May 20
inaugural speech on cross-strait engagement and will reiterate the
ROC's sincerity to promote friendly exchanges with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Other topics to be addressed in Chen's Tuesday speech are
expected to include defense and diplomatic affairs, financial
sources for various welfare service programs, the impact of
shortened workweek on local industries, interaction among the
Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the legislature, and the fate
of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung
reportedly has twice invited officials of various government
departments to discuss relevant issues with a view to helping
President Chen better understand progress in various administrative
plans.</P>
      <P>Following his speech, Chen will field questions from local and
foreign journalists for 30 minutes and a half-hour tea party will be
held after the press conference.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Government Information Office (GIO) will host a
live broadcast of Chen's press conference and has invited news media
throughout the world to view live on the World Wide Web the
president's first formal press conference since taking office.</P>
      <P>On its foreign-language website, the GIO will feature a special
real-time audio-video broadcast of the entire event beginning at
10:30 a.m. Taipei time on June 20.</P>
      <P>President Chen will be speaking in Chinese, but a simultaneous
Chinese-to-English translation will be provided.</P>
      <P>The live coverage will also include reporting and commentary by a
native English speaking anchor. The GIO has set up links to all its
overseas websites, giving viewers across the globe instant access to
the event as it happens, GIO officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP HEAVYWEIGHT FAVORS A LIEN-SOONG MEETING FOR RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former Kuomintang heavyweight on Monday
offered his blessing to the just concluded extraordinary meeting of
the Kuomintang National Congress which passed a reform package.</P>
      <P>David J. C. Chung, secretary-general of the newly formed People
First Party (PFP), also said that although he would personally like
to see a meeting between former Vice President Lien Chan, who was
overwhelmingly elected as KMT chairman over the weekend, and PFP
Chairman James Soong for reconciliation, it would be best if the
meeting takes place naturally.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Chung said he
sincerely hopes the KMT can accomplish the reforms aimed at reviving
the party after its humiliating defeat in the March 18 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>But Chung, former deputy secretary general of the KMT, also
cautioned Lien, who was elected as the party chairman by garnering
94.83 percent of the vote on Saturday, against being too complacent,
considering the fact that he obtained nearly 97 percent of vote
during last year's KMT presidential candidate nomination.</P>
      <P>Chung said the KMT has to reflect on "why is there is such a big
gap between the party's will and the people's will," a fact
demonstrated by Lien's third place finish in the presidential
election.</P>
      <P>On the future of Soong and the PFP party, Chung said that Soong
indeed has galvanized majority support in the party, but added that
Soong has expressed the hope that he is not the only one with a halo
in the party, which was formed after the March 18 election in
response to calls by Soong's supporters.</P>
      <P>He said that Soong will continue to reciprocate the support he
has received at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Chung said that the PFP has not formally discussed cooperation
with the KMT, saying that it will have to look at timing and other
factors when considering such a possibility. He also said that the
PFP will respect other political parties, but at the same time will
try to solicit support in its bid to win elections, especially the
mayoral, magistrate, and legislative elections at the end of next
year.</P>
      <P>Turning to the topic of the performance of President Chen
Shui-bian and the new administration, Chung said it is not fair to
make any criticisms at this point as the new administration has
barely ruled for a single month.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that there are many new faces serving in major
Cabinet posts and that there have been some missteps due to a lack of
enough communication.</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT was rejected by voters because of the
serious problem of "black gold politics," or the illegal connection
between government and organized crime. But despite Chen's campaign
promise to root out "black gold politics" and the general public's
high expectations, Chung said that he has seen no such determination
on the part of Chen judging from some of the senior presidential and
national policy advisers he selected.</P>
      <P>But to be fair, Chung said the public should still applaud the
Chen administration for its efforts and creativity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER CEPD HEAD TOPS KMT CENTRAL STANDING COMMITTEE ELECTION VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, the Republic of China's former
top economic planner, garnered the most votes in an election on
Monday for the 31-member Kuomintang Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Chiang, former chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD), garnered 160 ballots -- the highest number of
votes cast for a single member -- to top the hotly contested
election.</P>
      <P>Some 236 KMT Central Committee members elected the central
standing committee members from among their own ranks in the fourth
Central Committee session of the KMT's 15th national congress, with
each member entitled to select a maximum of 31 names.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the results of the election, KMT Chairman Lien Chan
expressed satisfaction and noted that 11 women made it onto the list,
which he said showed their "high competitive spirit."</P>
      <P>Some 12 legislators and 11 former Cabinet-level officials also
made it onto the list that will make up the party's policy-making
arm.</P>
      <P>With 18 seats won by newcomers and 13 incumbent members retaining
their seats, the election is significant in that it shows a passing
of the baton to the younger generation, analysts said.</P>
      <P>Chiang's vote tally was followed by Acting President of the
National Assembly Chen Chin-Jang (139), Legislator Huang Chao-shun
(135), former Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang (129),
Legislator Chen Chien-chih (121), and former Minister Without
Portfolio Huang Ta-chou (120).</P>
      <P>Popular Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou ranked seventh with 112 votes,
although some KMT central committee members who support former KMT
Chairman Lee Teng-hui had said before the election that they would
boycott Ma to show their dissatisfaction over his handling of the
street protests following the KMT's humiliating defeat in the March
18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma was followed by former Finance Minister Paul Chiu (111), while
legislators Lu Hsiu-yen (106) and Ting Shou-chung (105) rounded out
the list of the top 10 members.</P>
      <P>Former director-general of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting &amp; Statistics Wei Duan was last on the 31-member list with
78 votes, while local business tycoon Tony Ching-Jing Sheen missed
out on inclusion by a single vote and former Kaohsiung Mayor Wu
Den-yih ranked 38th with 67 votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER MEETS VISITING SINGAPOREAN DEPUTY PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen held a
low-profile, closed-door meeting with visiting Singaporean Deputy
Prime Minister Tony Tan Keng Yam, who concurrently serves as defense
minister, on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu said he had exchanged views with Tan on issues related to
bilateral cooperation between the Republic of China and Singapore.
However, Wu would not reveal the content of their talks, saying he
couldn't disclose any details because of a bilateral accord.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to questioning by legislators at
a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Wu said this was not Tan's first visit to Taiwan, and added that
he himself has no plan to visit Singapore in the near future.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ROC is still helping train Singaporean troops,
Wu said the two countries have maintained cooperation in this field.</P>
      <P>Wu, a former navy commander-in-chief, said he hopes to see
closer ROC-Singaporean cooperation in troops training. Nevertheless,
Wu said he doesn't believe this will help confidence-building between
the armed forces on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The minister pointed out that the establishment of a
cross-strait military mutual trust mechanism is basically a
political problem.</P>
      <P>"Only after a cross-strait political trust mechanism is forged
can confidence-building on military affairs be considered," Wu
noted.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) confirmed that Singaporean
Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Tan paid a courtesy call
on Wu on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Tan and Wu exchanged views on matters related
to the long-standing "Starlight" cooperative project between the two
countries. "Both of them agreed that the two sides should further
cooperation in this category," said an MND official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Singapore has forged military cooperative ties with the ROC since
it declared independence from Malaysia in 1965. The ROC has sent
military experts to serve as strategy advisers to the Southeast Asian
city state. Hsia Ying-chou, current president of the ROC's National
Defense University, had helped Singapore build up its air force. In
addition, the ROC army has helped train Singaporean troops on a
long-term basis.</P>
      <P>During his current visit, military sources said, Tan will discuss
bilateral military cooperation with the ROC's first non-Kuomintang
government, which was inaugurated on May 20. In addition, military
sources said, Tan may assist in mediating confidence-building
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to help defuse
cross-strait tension and maintain peace in the entire Asia-Pacific
region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA TO CONDUCT JOINT REVIEW OF WORK-WEEK PROGRAM, FOREIGN LABOR POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will
examine the newly promulgated shortened work-week program and
tightened foreign labor policy simultaneously, as the two concerns
are inextricably linked, Taiwan's top labor official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu reiterated that the shortened work-week
initiated by the opposition Kuomintang in the legislature and passed
overwhelmingly last Friday, will undoubtedly deal an immediate and
major blow to the country's industrial sector. The new work-week
mandates that workers must work a maximum of 84 hours in every
two-week period.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that a continuous reduction of new foreign
laborers into the local workforce is the set policy of the
government, but added that whether the tightened policy will be put
into force on July 1 as originally planned will require a further
assessment.</P>
      <P>On the shortened work-week, Chen said that the new program is not
expected to exert more than a slight impact on the country's
high-technology industry, but will definitely deal a heavy blow to
traditional manufacturing industries and some high-tech industries
that involve assembly and manual work.</P>
      <P>Chen said that both the legislature and the administration should
try hard and move fast to come up with measures to offset this
impact.</P>
      <P>She expressed worry that Taiwan's industrial sector will face a
rough road once the new shortened work-week goes into effect,
pointing out that it took 10 years for industrially strong Japan to
make the transition from a 48-hour to a 44-hour work-week, and adding
that Taiwan's present economic stability is comparable to Japan's of
a decade ago.</P>
      <P>On the stricter foreign labor policy, Chen said the qualification
threshold for Taiwan's industrial or business companies wishing to
employ foreign laborers will be raised from the current NT$200
million (US$6.49 million) to NT$500 million (US$16.23 million) in
capitalization, in an effort to further curb the importation of
laborers from abroad.</P>
      <P>Government screening on the introduction of foreign nationals to
work in private homes as domestic helpers or care-givers will also be
further tightened so as to reach the goal of capping the number of
new foreign laborer arrivals at less than 15,000 a year, she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, it was learned that labor brokerage agents in Taiwan
are planning to stage a demonstration on June 28 to publicize the
plight they will find themselves in as a result of the tightened
restrictions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING STEPPING UP DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR ARMS: JAPANESE DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo, June 19 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese daily reported on Monday that the
latest report by "US governmental institutions" indicates that
mainland China is secretly continuing to step up its development of
nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shimbun said that the report on the mainland's nuclear
arms and its management of military equipment was compiled by two
institutions under the Pentagon.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, the report noted that mainland China has
augmented its military-use nuclear power and is increasing the number
of missiles targeting Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The missiles aimed at Taiwan are said to have ranges of less than
600 km, while those targeting Japan have ranges between 1,000 km and
3,000 km, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The paper said Beijing has targeted Japan because: Japan provides
bases through which US forces can interfere in the Taiwan issue;
because Japan might develop nuclear arms; to counter any US-Japan
containment of mainland China; and because of the proposed
establishment of a theater missile defense system.</P>
      <P>The report notes that mainland China now has between six and 24
inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) with 400-450 nuclear
warheads, according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>It added that with last year's test-firing of its Dongfeng 31
ICBM, mainland China plans to deploy Dongfeng 41 ICBMs that could
target any location in the United States by 2010.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MATHEMATICIAN HONORED BY US FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mathematician Horng-Tzer Yau has been
honored with a prestigious award from the US-based John D. and
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Republic of China National
Science Council (NSC) announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>The honor bestowed on Yau, who is an adviser to the NSC's
National Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), provides a
much-needed shot-in-the-arm to basic scientific research in Taiwan,
the NSC said.</P>
      <P>The foundation announced its 2000 list of 25 new fellows in June,
and Yau was the sole winner in the mathematics category. He will be
eligible to receive a prize of US$500,000 spread over the next five
years.</P>
      <P>The foundation said Yau won the fellowship because he "applies
profound mathematical insights and analysis to the explanation of
important physical processes.</P>
      <P>"Although the problems that Yau works on are rooted in physical
phenomena, he has made important contributions to fundamental
mathematics in several areas: probability theory, non-linear partial
differential equations, spectral theory, and dynamical systems
theory," the foundation added.</P>
      <P>The foundation, set up in 1981, has so far named 588 fellows,
with each winner chosen by professionals in their respective fields
in a secret and anonymous process. The screening process can
sometimes take years.</P>
      <P>Yau, 40, who has a B.S. from National Taiwan University and a
Ph.D. from Princeton University, is a professor of mathematics at the
Courant Institute of Mathematical Science, New York University.</P>
      <P>He was invited back to Taiwan to serve as NCTS adviser three
years ago, and has since devoted himself to the upgrading of the
nation's basic scientific research.</P>
      <P>He was also commissioned by the NSC to serve as a guest professor
at NCTS and National Chiao Tung University.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA in which he gave his views on upgrading
the research in basic science in Taiwan, he noted that the education
system in Taiwan does not encourage students to think independently,</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NSC said it has decided to throw a party on
Wednesday for Yau, who is the only person from Taiwan to have
received the fellowship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT HANDSHAKE, RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Tuesday
he hopes the top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can hold
a summit meeting without imposing any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call at his first post-inauguration press
conference.</P>
      <P>As the president of the Republic of China, Chen said he will
abide by the provision of the constitution to safeguard the
country's sovereignty, dignity, security and well-being.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chen said, he is hopeful that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait can jointly cultivate an environment conducive
for bilateral engagement under the principles of democracy and
parity.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Chen said, mainland China can respect the free choice
of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and jointly deal
with the question of a future "one China."</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that the two sides can keep their
differences while seeking a consensus and maximum mutual benefits.
"I'm confident our two sides can jointly deal with cross-strait
issues based on existing foundations," he said, adding that the
existing foundations refer to conclusions and consensus reached in
talks, contacts and negotiations between their two
formally authorized intermediary bodies in the past.</P>
      <P>Touching on Beijing's claim that both sides reached a consensus
on its cherished "one China" principle during a 1992 meeting between
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), Chen said
the two sides did discuss the "one China" issue, but didn't agree on
the "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>From Taiwan's view, Chen said, if there was a 1992 consensus, it
meant that the two sides "agreed to disagree" on the "one China"
definition.</P>
      <P>Chen further said so long as the two sides have sincerity and
goodwill and get down to talks, they will be able to find out
mutually acceptable "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>Noting that this is an era of reconciliation, Chen said he hopes
the top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can draw
inspiration from the just-concluded Korean summit and pool their
wisdom and ingenuity to jointly "re-write and create history."</P>
      <P>Chen said he would sincerely invite mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to sit down to talks without setting any premises or
restrictions on time, place or form of the meeting. "Let us jointly
create the 'moment of historic handshake' and accomplish the 'mission
impossible' with wisdom and creativity," he urged.</P>
      <P>Turning to domestic issues, Chen also called for reconciliation
of major local political parties. The president congratulated his two
main rivals in the March 18 presidential election Lien Chan and
James Soong for their elections as chairmen of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party, respectively.</P>
      <P>Chen, a stalwart of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said
after the DPP formally endorses Frank Hsieh as its new chairman, he
will invite Lien, Soong and Hsieh to the Presidential Office for
reconciliation and discussion on major domestic affairs and
cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT GIVES 'BEST WISHES' TO BEIJING'S OLYMPIAD BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Tuesday
he hopes to see Beijing succeed in its bid to win the right to host
the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>"We wish Beijing a success in its Olympiad bid and will not rule
out the possibility of supporting its bid in the future," Chen said
at his first press conference since his May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chen said the inspiration from the just-concluded summit
meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea was that nothing
is impossible in the world.</P>
      <P>The president further said if Beijing manages to win the right to
host the 2008 Olympic Games, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
can also discuss the feasibility of letting Taiwan host
certain Olympic sports contests.</P>
      <P>"This proposal seems to be very sensitive and unrealistic at the
moment, but the event is still eight years away. Nothing is
impossible during this era of reconciliation. So long as both sides
of the Taiwan Strait have sincerity, we will certainly be able to
mend differences and reconcile," Chen said optimistically.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States should play a more active role
in helping resolve cross-strait issues, Chen said he certainly hopes
the United States can work even harder to help the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait break their current impasse.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the United States pledged in its 1982 "six
guarantees" to the Republic of China government that it will not
pressure Taiwan to negotiate with the mainland nor act as a
"mediator" in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"I think this US stance remains unchanged. Nevertheless,
US President Bill Clinton has repeatedly said in his talks about
cross-strait relations that any solution to cross-strait issues must
be achieved by peaceful means and has the assent of the people of
Taiwan," Chen said, adding that Clinton's call complies with his
consistent view that Taiwan's future must respect the choice of the
people of Taiwan out of their free will.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he thinks that the United States can play an
even more active role in cross-strait relations since maintaining
lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait is not only in Taiwan's interest
but also in the US interest.</P>
      <P>As for the "one China" definition, Chen said the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait should jointly find out a mutually acceptable
conclusion. Chen said he thinks that "Agree to disagree" may be the
best consensus for the issue at the moment.</P>
      <P>The president also said the planned supraparty task
force on cross-strait issues, scheduled to be formed at the end
of this month, will basically an advisory body.</P>
      <P>The panel, to be headed by Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh, will forge domestic consensus on sensitive cross-strait
issues and provide counseling services to relevant government
agencies, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the task force will in no way replace the
existing government agencies handling cross-strait policy,
such as the National Unification Council and the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said the interparty task force will also not
replace the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), which
is authorized by the ROC government to handle cross-strait
negotiations and exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"The SEF will remain our sole formally authorized intermediary
body to handle exchanges with the mainland and SEF Chairman Koo
Chen-fu will continue to be our top negotiator with the mainland,"
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED NOT TO PRETEND ALL IS QUIET IN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid current tensions between Taiwan and
mainland China, the government has the responsibility to inform the
public about the situation regarding security in the Taiwan Strait,
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien called on the ruling government of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) not to pretend that "everything is quiet" in
the strait, adding that it would be better to give the people a
thorough understanding of the real situation in the region.</P>
      <P>The future of cross-strait ties seem to remain uncertain, Lien
said, adding that tensions between Taiwan and mainland China have
effectively escalated. Although many foreign friends of the Republic
of China have warned the government of the seriousness of the
situation, some people have still failed to act with caution, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of whether those people were truly unaware of the
situation or just chose to ignore current developments, the
government bears the responsibility to let the people understand the
real situation across the strait," Lien said. He also urged leaders
on both sides to deal with the problems with far-sightedness and
wisdom.</P>
      <P>Lien, who was overwhelmingly elected by over 2,000 party
delegates as chairman of the KMT on Sunday, made the remarks in an
interview with a local radio station.</P>
      <P>After ruling Taiwan for more than 50 years, the KMT lost its grip
on executive power to the DPP in the March 18 presidential vote, with
Lien finishing a distant third in the race.</P>
      <P>Admitting that many local opinion leaders and business executives
have suggested that he visit mainalnd China, and that mainland
authorities have publicly encouraged such a visit, Lien made it clear
that he currently has no plans to travel to the mainland, due to the
delicate situation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, Lien also stressed that he is willing to pay a visit to
the mainland "some day in the future," as long as such a trip would
help boost safety, security, peace, and prosperity for Taiwan's 23
million people.</P>
      <P>As to the question of party-to-party exchanges with mainland
China, Lien said the KMT, as a major political party -- and the
oldest in the Republic of China -- is committed to contributing its
experience and viewpoints to the nation in any capacity, as long as
such cooperation helps bolster a "win-win" situation across the
strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN EXTENDS ANOTHER OLIVE BRANCH TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
extended another olive branch to mainland China in an effort to bring
about a breakthrough in stalled cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen, speaking at his first presidential press conference exactly
one month after his inauguration, invited Mainland China President
Jiang Zemin to meet with him at any time or place, without setting
any preconditions.</P>
      <P>Taking a cue from last week's historic summit meeting between the
rulers of the two Koreas, Chen said he believed that leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait could "rewrite and create history," by
exercising wisdom and creativity.</P>
      <P>He urged Jiang to forego any preconditions to talks, and start
from a "historic handshake," so that the two sides can sit down and
reconcile their differences.</P>
      <P>He said that a photograph of President Kim Dae Jung of South
Korea and Kim Jong Il of North Korea stepping forward to shake each
other's hands on June 13 is now hanging in his study, adding that the
picture has been an inspiration to him.</P>
      <P>"If the two Koreans can, why can't we?" he asked, adding that
leaders across the Taiwan Strait possess similar wisdom and
creativity, and could also rewrite history. He added that he was
sincere in extending an invitation to Jiang for such a "historical
handshake."</P>
      <P>He also said that not setting any preconditions to talks would be
in tune with public expectations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
as long as leaders aim to make the utmost contribution to their
people.</P>
      <P>Stressing that "we are now in an era of reconciliation," he said
that he will promote goodwill, mutual cooperation and permanent
peace for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as both sides of the strait can display
goodwill and sincerity in talks, he believed that they could come
up with a definition of "one China" that would be acceptable to both
sides.</P>
      <P>He noted that as long as the two sides are allowed to maintain
their different points of view while seeking a consensus, he is
"confident that we can jointly deal with the question of a future
'one China' based on the existing foundation," by which he meant
conclusions and agreements reached in past negotiations between the
two officially-authorized intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's claim that both sides in 1992 reached a consensus on
its cherished "one China" principle, Chen said that Taipei's Straits
Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait did discuss the "one China" issue, but didn't agree
on its definition.</P>
      <P>If there was any agreement, that would be "to agree to disagree"
on the issue, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that throughout the period since the March 18
presidential election to the present, he has conveyed goodwill and
sincerity, including in his May 20 inaugural address. He said his
gestures were part of an attempt to make a "historic stride" in
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen urged Beijing leaders to respect Taiwan's freedom to choose,
adding that the two sides should pool their wisdom and creativity to
create conditions conducive to cross-strait cooperation under the
principle of equality and democracy.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possible future path of cross-strait relations,
Chen said that he had no preset stance, but that a "confederation"
between the two sides is one option for possible consideration.</P>
      <P>Chen added that settling the issue is not up to him or any
one political party, but rather the 23 million people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that there was no need to have preconditions for talks,
citing the Korean summit as an example since the two sides were
able to sit down together despite starkly different views on the
unification of the Korean peninsula.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations were strained after former President Lee
Teng-hui spoke of a "special state-to-state" basis for talks in July
1999. The election of Chen, who is a member of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, has further chilled cross-strait ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JOINT OPERATIONS CRUCIAL FOR WINNING A WAR, SAYS TOP GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gen. Tang Yao-ming, Republic of China (ROC)
chief of the General Staff, on Tuesday stressed the importance of
joint operations in all sections of the armed forces in order to
upgrade the military's overall combat capabilities.</P>
      <P>In order to efficiently defend ROC territory and sovereignty and
win a possible war across the Taiwan Strait, Tang said the armed
forces must not move too slowly in joint operations development and
training, as well as combat strategy research.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks in his keynote address to a symposium
hosted by the Ministry of National Defense (MND) on guidelines and
strategies of joint operations, which were first introduced by the
MND on July 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's symposium is the third of its kind recently, as part of
MND efforts to pool wisdom and opinions of military experts and
strategists from the civilian sector -- including academics and
lawmakers -- on the development of joint military operations. The
MND's two previous symposiums were held in central and southern
Taiwan in early June.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang noted that the number of ROC men and women in
uniform has been gradually decreased to 380,000 recently, under the
military's "slim and mean" plan.</P>
      <P>Under the framework of the National Defense Law and the MND
Organization Law, the military will continue to strive toward further
downsizing in its rank and file, upgrading combat capabilities, and
improving the military's mobilization readiness, Tang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO ISRAELI DEFENSE FIRMS IMPOSE OWN BAN ON SALES TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While US and Israeli government
officials continue to wrestle over controversial Israeli arms sales
to Communist China, at least two major Israeli defense firms are
imposing their own bans on future dealings with Beijing, according to
a report in the latest issue of Defense News.</P>
      <P>The weekly newspaper reported that executives from Israel's
Rafael Armament Development Authority and Elbit Systems Ltd. say they
will not sell arms to China as a matter of corporate policy. US sales
represent a significant and expanding portion business base for both
Israeli companies.</P>
      <P>"We are not selling to China. We don't see the political or
technological advantage of doing business there," Elbit President
Joseph Ackerman told Defense News. He noted that the US market
comprises 25 percent of Elbit's business and he expects to expand the
company's business base in the United States through additional joint
ventures and teaming arrangements.</P>
      <P>Rafael was more direct in linking its self-imposed ban on sales
to China with Washington's repeated appeals to Israel to halt the
sale of sensitive, potentially destabilizing weaponry to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Referring to the ongoing diplomatic quarrel over Israel Aircraft
Industries' sale of Phalcon early warning aircraft to China, Rafael
President Giora Shalgi said that "we need to learn lessons from this
current controversy and draw our own conclusions. For us, the bottom
line is that the US market is critically important."</P>
      <P>Shalgi noted that US legislators and government officials often
are concerned about Israeli exports to so-called sensitive states
because of competitive, rather than political reasons. "But when it
reaches the highest political levels and the United States insists it
is a matter for their national security, then we need to behave
differently," Shalgi told Defense News.</P>
      <P>However, the weekly newspaper said, US and Israeli officials were
quick to point out that Rafael remains an arm of Israel's Ministry of
Defense, and therefore could be directed to override corporate policy
if the ministry considered exports sufficiently important for Israeli
national security.</P>
      <P>Further, US officials remain concerned about the sale of Israel's
Python-4 and other Rafael missiles to China, while Rafael officials
declined to provide details regarding previous missile deals with
Beijing. As for future dealings, however, Rafael officials said they
will adhere to their corporate policy restricting such sales to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>But other Israeli industry executives told Defense News that
Rafael's deferential attitude toward Washington sets a dangerous
precedent by effectively accepting a US veto over Israeli military
exports. They argued that Rafael's policy with regard to China could
boomerang in the not-too-distant future, when the US government may
want to limit sales to other countries it deems sensitive, such as
India or countries in Latin America.</P>
      <P>A US official said Washington has no intention of imposing a veto
over Israeli exports. However, he said the US government expects
Israel to notify and coordinate sensitive sales based on a voluntary
formula determined through the 1996 Wassenaar Agreement covering
transfers of conventional weaponry and dual-use technologies among
supplier countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SURVEY FINDS YOUNG IMMIGRANTS FACE RACISM IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June 19 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Young immigrants in Canada face racism and
bigotry in schools and communities that are often unprepared to deal
with the challenges that this growing segment of the population
poses, a new study released Monday suggests.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Council on Social Development study indicates that
the majority of youths surveyed found it tough to feel totally
accepted because of their accents and looks. They also found going to
school a traumatic experience.</P>
      <P>The problem is that young immigrants continue to be taunted and
ostracized by their fellow students for being different, according to
the findings of the survey, which looked at focus groups comprised of
50 individuals.</P>
      <P>"The trials and tribulations of high school were magnified for
immigrant youth," said Jean Kunz, one of the researchers. "Most of
them said they had experienced ostracism and bullying at school. Most
of the focus group participants also reported experiencing racism and
bigotry, especially those who were members of visible-minority
groups," he added.</P>
      <P>Even more significant were reports that students felt teachers
could also be racist, becoming part of the problem rather than the
solution, the study says.</P>
      <P>Universities and colleges must also prepare future teachers to be
sensitive to the diverse needs of students of different backgrounds,
Kunz added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEN ALSO EXPERIENCE MORNING SICKNESS, SAY RESEARCHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 19 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The answer to the question: Does becoming a
father affect a man's hormones? is apparently yes, according to
Canadian researchers who claim children give their dads something
even before they are born -- morning sickness.</P>
      <P>Over the centuries, some men have claimed that they experience
"sympathy pains" when their wives get pregnant.</P>
      <P>Now endocrinologists are studying whether fathers-to-be undergo
physical changes before little junior arrives.</P>
      <P>"We are for the first time asking men: Does becoming a father
affect your hormones?" said Dr. Katherine Wynne-Edwards of Queen's
University.</P>
      <P>Besides affirmative answers, she tried to collect physical
evidence. She took saliva samples from men in the months leading up
to and after their children were born.</P>
      <P>The findings revealed a significant increase in an estrogen-like
hormone, as well as a decrease in testosterone.</P>
      <P>According to her research, the physical changes were significant
enough to cause morning sickness, weight gain, joint pain, bloating,
and even cravings for different food.</P>
      <P>The research is expected to be discussed by experts from around
the world at the 82nd annual meeting of the Endocrine Society, which
gets under way in Toronto on June 21.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NOT EXPECTED TO ATTACK TAIWAN WITH NUCLEAR ARMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is not expected to use
nuclear weapons to attack Taiwan, Defense Minister Wu shih-wen said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks in response to an interpellation by
opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Lee Ching-hua who
asked Wu about media reports that mainland China has deployed a
large number of missiles targeting Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the missiles deployed by the People's Liberation Army
in southeastern China, which lies opposite Taiwan, are mainly
Dongfeng 11 short-range and Dongfeng 15 medium-range ballistic
missiles.</P>
      <P>"Although these two kinds of missiles can carry nuclear
warheads, mainland China is not likely to use them to attack Taiwan
as the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait share common
ancestral and cultural links," Wu said, adding that using nuclear
arms to hit Taiwan also seriously violates mainland China's strategic
thinking.</P>
      <P>Asked how many mainland missiles have been deployed
against Taiwan and whether Taiwan's missiles can hit mainland
China's Shanghai and Hong Kong, Wu said he couldn't answer the
questions because they are related to Taiwan's combat strategy.</P>
      <P>Liu Tai-ying, former chairman of the Kuomintang's Business
Management Committee, once said Taiwan's missiles can reach Shanghai
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee asked Wu whether Liu's saying is true. "You
should ask Liu to answer this question," Wu replied.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said President Chen Shui-bian's remarks on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations at Tuesday's press conference were
mainly aimed at helping defuse tension in the region.</P>
      <P>As for whether Chen's goodwill message could help reach that
goal, Wu said it will depend on mainland China's reaction.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference since his May 20 inauguration,
President Chen held out an olive branch to Beijing, inviting
mainland President Jiang Zemin to hold a historic summit for
reconciliation and promising that Taiwan will not rule out the
possibility of supporting Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympic
Games.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US REITIRATES SUPPORT FOR RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian's call for a summit meeting with his
Communist Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, the United States
reiterated Tuesday its strong support for a resumption of
cross-strait dialogue, but said it is up to Beijing and Taipei to
decide the basis for the talks.</P>
      <P>White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a routine press briefing
that "we have long supported a resumption of cross-strait dialogue.
And that is something that we view as the mechanism for the two sides
to resolve their differences."</P>
      <P>But the press secretary said he does not know whether the summit
proposal will influence the Senate's vote on the legislation that
would grant China permanent normal trade relations status. "I think
at this point, there is solid support for the vote in the Senate;
it's just a matter of when it will get scheduled."</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher also emphasized that
"we strongly support a resumption of the cross-strait dialogue. We
are committed to promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the
region. It is up to Beijing and Taipei to determine the basis for the
dialogue and the modalities for the dialogue. Our abiding interest is
in the peaceful resolution of the differences between the two sides."</P>
      <P>When asked whether Washington was advised in advance that
President Chen was going to make this summit proposal, Boucher said
that "I don't have anything that would indicate that. I'd just say
that we have consistently encouraged the idea of resumption of a
cross-strait dialogue."</P>
      <P>On whether Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will encourage
such a summit when she goes to Beijing, the spokesman replied, "she
will certainly discuss cross-strait developments, and also reiterate
our view that both sides should resume direct dialogue."</P>

    <HEADLINE>POVERTY DRIVES PEOPLE OF FUJIAN PROVINCE TO SEEK BETTER LIFE OVERSEAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  20  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Poverty and the lack of freedom are the
main reasons forcing people in China's coastal Fujian province to
seek a better life abroad, according to a Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
report Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>During the report, three of the migrants from China who came to
Canada on leaky, rusting boats last summer spoke publicly of their
experiences for the first time. They are among a small group of the
600 mainlanders on the four ships who have been successful in
claiming refugee status. Almost all of the migrants have been or will
be sent back to China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CBC News, the three women, sitting with an
interpreter, asked that their faces be shielded because they fear
reprisals from the people smugglers who brought them to Canada's
shores.</P>
      <P>When asked why they left China, all three spoke of the desperate
poverty in Fujian province. "I heard Canada is a good country, a
democratic country. I thought about a better life."</P>
      <P>"I also brought my children with me. I don't care about myself, I
care about my children. I want them to have a good life in the
future," said another.</P>
      <P>Escaping poverty, however, no matter how dire, is still not
enough of a reason to get refugee status in Canada. The three women
interviewed were allowed to stay because of the repression they faced
due to China's one child policy.</P>
      <P>One woman told the refugee board how she was forced to have an
abortion. Eight months pregnant, she was given an injection and saw
the baby die. She was eventually sterilized against her will.</P>
      <P>A refugee board member concluded that "the past persecution of
this claimant was so atrocious and appalling that it would be
unreasonable to expect her to return to China."</P>
      <P>The refugees said they had no idea that the smuggling ships were
so dangerous and that they would be detained in Canada for months.
But they said life in Fujian province is so harsh that they doubt
there's anything the Chinese or Canadian governments could do to
dissuade others from embarking on the same desperate journey.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOCOG RECEIVES BAILOUT FUNDS FROM NSW GOV'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Faced with fewer sponsors due to a series
of scandals and lackluster ticket sales, Olympic organizers received
a new infusion of cash when the government of New South Wales
allocated nearly US$90 million to help bail them out of their budget
disaster.</P>
      <P>After a year of budget cuts and revenue black holes, the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) has to be propped
up by NSW taxpayers only 86 days before the opening ceremony of the
world's biggest sports event.</P>
      <P>The bailout comes only four weeks after NSW Treasurer Michael
Egan pledged that "every single last cent" of the Games was paid for.</P>
      <P>Olympics Minister Michael Knight sought the payout amid fears
that the quality of the 2000 Olympic Games would be eroded if further
spending cuts were enforced.</P>
      <P>Egan told reporters on Tuesday that "clearly the Olympics has
cost the taxpayers of NSW money, I have never denied that."</P>
      <P>The bailout money, taken from the NSW government's budget surplus
for 1999-2000, leaves the SOCOG with an emergency fund of about US$44
million to cover any further blowouts.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of the Olympics is now nearing US$3.8 billion,
including federal government contributions and private sector
construction costs.</P>
      <P>The SOCOG has been hit by a series of financial shortages in the
past two years as several major sponsors, including Reebok, withdrew
their financial support following public anger over several scandals
involving the organizing committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAWMAKERS RESUME MAINLAND TRAVEL PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After many twists and turns, the
Legislative Yuan caucus of the newly formed opposition People First
Party (PFP) finally decided on Wednesday to resume its plan to
organize a delegation to visit mainland China in mid-July.</P>
      <P>The PFP parliamentary caucus said the delegation, to be composed
of only PFP lawmakers, will mainly meet with Taiwan businesspeople
to understand their problems and solicit their suggestions on
improvement of services for them.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the caucus said the delegation has no plans to
meet with mainland politicians nor will it act as a go-between to
convey any messages between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The delegation will adopt a low-profile approach toward its
planned mainland visit," the spokesman said, adding that PFP
heavyweights, such as chairman James Soong, vice chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung and secretary-general Chung Jung-chi, will not join the
delegation on its mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Following the inauguration of the ROC's first non-Kuomintang
government, legislative caucuses of major domestic political parties
have been active in planning mainland visits in attempts to help
defuse tension in the Taiwan Strait and push for resumption of
semi-official cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>In addition to the PFP, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) Mainstream Alliance, the KMT's e-Generation Alliance
and the pro-unification New Party have all planned to organize trips
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing has said it will reject visits by delegations
organized by either the DPP legislative caucus or its subgroups
because of the DPP's pro-independence stance. Beijing already turned
down the KMT e-Generation Alliance's visit plan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's discriminatory attitude against some Taiwan political
parties or groups have made the PFP to take a second thought on its
mainland travel plan for fears of being labeled as Beijing's
mouthpiece in Taiwan. As a result, the PFP legislative caucus
last week announced cancellation of its mainland travel plan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some PFP legislators doubted the party's wisdom in
canceling the mainland travel plan. They said since major local
political groups have been endeavoring to help promote cross-strait
exchanges, the PFP need not impose self-restraint. Moreover, they
said, the PFP's travel plan is mainly aimed at strengthening
services to Taiwan businesspeople in mainland China and has nothing
to do with cross-strait politics.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the PFP legislative caucus made an
about-face on Wednesday and decided to uphold its original mainland
travel plan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Liu Sung-fan, also a former
Legislative Yuan speaker, who just returned from an undisclosed
visit to mainland China, denied that his mainland trip was designed
to pave the way for PFP Chairman James Soong, a former Taiwan
governor and KMT power broker, to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>In fact, Liu said he personally opposes any proposal that Soong
make a visit to the mainland in the near future. "My opinion is that
if Soong will continue his political career, he should not visit the
mainland at the moment," he added.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was ousted from the KMT earlier this year for his
decision to run for the presidency as an independent, lost the March
18 presidential election to DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian with a
narrow margin. Soong garnered 36.8 percent of the vote, higher than
KMT candidate Lien Chan's 23 percent.</P>
      <P>While Beijing rejects visits by DPP-organized delegations, it
still opens its doors to selected DPP politicians for visits in
their private capacity.</P>
      <P>For instance, DPP Legislator Lee Ying-yuan, a member of the
party's Mainstream Alliance subgroup, is scheduled to visit the
mainland later this month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Elmer Feng, New Party legislative whip, will travel
to the mainland later this week to arrange for a visit by a
delegation organized by the tiny right-wing opposition party's
legislative caucus, scheduled for early July. Feng claimed that
the New Party has become an important "window" for cross-strait
contact as Beijing still declines to resume dialogue between the
two semi-official intermediary bodies --Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN'S SUGGESTIONS FRIENDLY, BUT NOT FEASIBLE: KMT AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's remarks on
Taiwan-mainland ties were full of good will, but chances are slim
that they can be carried out, a Kuomintang official commented on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Research
Department, said the prospects outlined by Chen on the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations may raise the public's expectations for
an improvement in Taiwan's dealings with mainland China, but that
they represented a far cry from reality.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Chen's major aim is to garner international
publicity through his remarks. "Such an act will only try the
patience of the people of Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a June 20 news conference to mark his first month in
office following inauguration as the Republic of China's 10th
president, Chen said on Tuesday that he is willing to meet with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin for a "historical handshake,"
in any location or time, and without any preconditions. Chen had
cited the recent Korean summit as an example for Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Turning to the so-called "one China" principle, Chen denied that
Taiwan and mainland China had ever agreed upon the definition of the
term. If any consensus really exists between the two sides, it was to
"agree to disagree" about "one China," which leaves unfinished the
task of working out a single definition that would be acceptable to
both sides, the president said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that South and North Korea had as early as 1972 signed
a joint statement agreeing to eventually achieve a peaceful
unification, Chang said that Chen's suggestion that the two Koreas be
used as a model was inappropriate.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the basic stance of the two Koreas is to
"achieve equality through unification and to push for unification
based on equality." Despite the fact that Chen has soft-pedaled his
position toward mainland China, the president has so far failed to
pursue "China's unification," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China still refuses to recognize Taiwan as an
equal government, Chang said it is true that past bilateral talks
between the two semi-official cross-strait intermediary bodies --
Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- were held on an equal
footing.</P>
      <P>With Chen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
serving as Taiwan's new leader, the chances of resuming bilateral
unofficial talks -- let alone a cross-strait summit -- seem remote,
because Beijing fears that Chen may try to promote "peaceful Taiwan
independence," the KMT official analyzed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang contended that Chen's stated ambition to
discuss the "one China" issue with mainland China will mark a setback
in bilateral ties, and that the topic is effectively the hardest
issue to solve between the two sides.</P>
      <P>As to Chen's failure to make a concrete statement about the
establishment of the direct trade, transport and postal links between
Taiwan and mainland China, Chang asserted that Chen's ambiguity on
the issue is due to his understanding that there will be no such
links without prior negotiations, and that he knows negotiations on
the issue will take time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party has postponed its
planned visit to promote friendship in mainland China from late June
to early July, party spokesman Elmer Feng said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As mainland China needs more time to assess remarks on
cross-Taiwan Strait ties made by President Chen Shui-bian at a
Tuesday news conference marking his month-long inauguration as the

    <HEADLINE>MOST ASIAN COUNTRIES LACKING IN PROPER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, June 21(CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The regional economic crisis has revealed
many of Asia's weak points, and none more so than the poor quality of
corporate governance, both in the public and private sectors, endemic
in most Asian countries, according to a report.</P>
      <P>The report was released by the Hong Kong-based Political and
Economic Risk Consultancy, and is based on the findings of a survey
the company conducted in May.</P>
      <P>During the survey, the company asked foreign expatriates working
in the Asian region to rate the quality of corporate governance in
the countries in which they reside.</P>
      <P>Included in the report's definition of "governance" were whether
or not nations were willing to make concrete steps to reduce
corruption and improve corporate governance. For example, the report
noted the importance of appointing independent outside directors, as
well as the employment of professional disinterested auditors and the
application of international accounting standards.</P>
      <P>On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being the best grade
possible and ten the worst, only three systems in Asia got a higher
rating than five. Singapore was ranked highest at two points, with
Hong Kong and Japan rated at 3.59 and four points, respectively.
Expatriate perceptions for the rest of Asia were quite negative. For
example, mainland China received 8.22 points.</P>
      <P>The report said that most Asian countries fall short of the
requirements of good corporate governance.</P>
      <P>The report also noted that in most cases, listed companies are
still dominated by family owners that often disregard the views and
interests of non-family shareholders. In other counties, major listed
companies are either partially-owned by the government directly, or
by friends and relatives of people holding political power who then
use their relationships to their own advantage.</P>
      <P>In the same survey, the foreign business executives also
lambasted the poor quality of most Asian stock markets. Only three
stock market regulatory authorities in Asia were rated better than
five points. Japan was the most highly-rated at 2.33 points, followed
by Hong Kong and Singapore, at 3.43 and 4.71 points, respectively.</P>
      <P>The report said that since this is a structural rather than a
cyclical issue, it is likely to remain a nagging problem even though
most Asian economies seem to be recovering from the financial crisis.</P>
      <P>"Since our survey was made after most economies were on the road
to recovery, the implication is that the corporate and financial
sector reforms that have been implemented to date have not been
sufficient to really impress foreigners working in these systems,"
the report commented.</P>
      <P>"That could have important implications for both the volume and
type of foreign investment that flows into Asia in the near future,"

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE PREMIER'S REMARKS REFLECT UNFAMILIARITY WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's
recent remarks that Taiwan's democratic elections were a joke simply
reflect his scant knowledge of the island's democratic experience, a
senior mainland affairs official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland, was responding to Zhu's criticism at a public hearing on
last week's summit meeting between North and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was not particularly surprised by Zhu's criticism,
made in a recent interview with a Belgian newspaper, because Zhu has
never visited Taiwan and is a stranger to democratic political
operations.</P>
      <P>Noting that Zhu is unfamiliar with Taiwan's democratic
development, Chen said if Zhu were to have visited Taiwan, he would
have been able to see for himself the merits of Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that although mainland China has held grassroots
elections in recent years, those elections take place under a
one-party, authoritarian system with no competition from opposition
political parties.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chen said, Taiwan's multi-party democratic elections
have managed to accomplish the first-ever democratic transition of
power between different political parties in a Chinese society.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the election of Chen Shui-bian, a stalwart
of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), as the Republic of China's
new president on March 18, which marked an end to the Kuomintang's
55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said all the people of Taiwan are proud of this democratic
achievement.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that Zhu will one day personally experience
the merits of party competition and peaceful transfer of executive
power among different political parties through open, fair and
democratic elections," Chen said, adding: "By then, I think that Zhu
would be able to review democratic development with a sober, proud
attitude and he would no longer ridicule Taiwan's democratic
achievement."</P>
      <P>Chen also urged mainland China to make a positive response to
President Chen's call for a summit meeting between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait to mend their differences.</P>
      <P>President Chen said on Tuesday in his first press conference
since taking office on May 20 that he would be willing to meet
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin anywhere, under any protocol,
to resolve the cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>"If North and South Korea could hold a summit without any
preconditions or premises, why can't the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait? We are hopeful that the Beijing leaders will not continue to
snub President Chen's olive branch," Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS HEAD WILL VISIT TAIWAN `SOONER OR LATER': BEIJING VICE PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Daohan, chairman of Beijing's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will make
a long-awaited trip to Taiwan "sooner or later," mainland Chinese
vice premier Qian Qichen was quoted as saying on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Qian, who is in charge of Beijing's policy toward Taiwan, told a
group of Taiwan business leaders in Beijing that a meeting between
Wang and his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Koo Chen-fu, will still be subject to the cross-strait
situation.</P>
      <P>A meeting between Wang and Koo in Taiwan has long been deemed a
symbol of reconciliation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Wang was initially scheduled to visit Taiwan in the fall of 1999, but
the trip was put on hold indefinitely after then-Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui asserted the island's statehood earlier that
year.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-ho, board chairman of the ROC Council for Industrial and
Commercial Development (CICD), said Qian acknowledged the
contribution made by CICD members to the trade between Taiwan and
mainland China, and touted the developing potential of western China
to his Taiwan guests.</P>
      <P>Tsai Cheng-yuan, a deputy director-general of the Kuomintang's
Cultural Affairs Department who met with Qian along with the CICD
delegation, said the mainland Chinese vice premier was trying to
reach out to Taiwan businessmen by sidestepping the thorny political
issues at the roots of the Taipei-Beijing dispute.</P>
      <P>Citing the idea of setting up direct trade, transportation and
postal links between Taiwan and mainland China as an example, Tsai
said Qian did not press hard on the issue during the meeting, saying
only that the so-called "three direct links" will be realized "when
the time is ripe."</P>
      <P>Before receiving the CIDC delegation, Qian also met with
representatives from Taiwan's Association of Young Business-founders.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-huang, president of the association, told reporters
from Taiwan who accompanied the CICD delegation to Beijing that they
urged Qian to better protect Taiwan businessmen in mainland China and
offer better incentives to woo Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Later, ARATS Vice Chairman Sun Yafu hosted a luncheon during
which he pitched for Beijing's long-standing policies of "one
country, two systems" as a model for Beijing rule of Taiwan, and
mainland President Jiang Zemin's "eight points for dealing with
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Although there have been twists and turns in bilateral ties, Sun
said, complementary commercial ties have taken shape between Taiwan
and mainland China in the last decade.</P>
      <P>Asserting that the principle of "one China" -- that there is only
one China, of which Taiwan is a part -- must be the cornerstone of
ties between Taiwan and mainland China, Sun claimed that Beijing will
work with the Taiwan people who support this principle to carry out
the reunification of China.</P>
      <P>The CICD, a group consisting of second-generation Taiwan
businessmen, regularly visit mainland China to inspect mainland
China's investment environment. Its 36-member delegation arrived in
Beijing on Tuesday for a four-day visit, the seventh of its kind.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONFIDENCE, PATIENCE KEY TO IMPROVED CROSS-STRAIT TIES: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan  County,  southern  Taiwan,  June  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen
Shui-bian said on Wednesday he believes that improving the current
deadlocked relations across the Taiwan Strait need patience and
confidence.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in speeches delivered at the graduation
ceremonies at two of his alma maters -- Lungtien Elementary School
and Matou Junior High School -- in the southern Taiwan county of
Tainan.</P>
      <P>Chen, the son of a Tainan County tenant farmer, received heroic
welcomes at both schools. A diligent, intelligent student, Chen left
outstanding academic records during his elementary and junior high
school years.</P>
      <P>In his speeches to graduating students at both schools, Chen
encouraged his young alumni to face the challenges of life with
confidence and patience.</P>
      <P>"I have encountered many setbacks in my life and political
career, but I have never been daunted by any hardship or ordeal. I
firmly believe that so long as we have self-confidence and patience,
and work diligently, we will be able to overcome difficulties and
realize our life goals," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say he believes that these key elements
to achieve success in personal life are also critical principles to
resolve public issues.</P>
      <P>"For instance, I'm convinced that if Taiwan remains confident and
patient in dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait issues, relations with
mainland China will gradually improve and peace in the region can
also be maintained," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen, who took office on May 20, held a press conference on
Tuesday to mark his first month in his new job in which he recounted
his hectic new lifestyle. Over the past month, he has traveled
extensively around the island and even to Taiwan's outlying islands
to "reach out to the people." He also attended graduation ceremonies
at many local schools. Wednesday's ceremonies marked an end to his
"commencement" tour.</P>
      <P>Starting next week, Chen will launch an islandwide grassroots
"reaching-out" tour, with oyster farms in Chiayi County in southern
Taiwan as the first stop, according to presidential aides.</P>
      <P>In order to forge a national consensus on thorny cross-strait
issues and major domestic affairs, they went on, the president is
also planning to meet with the leaders of the major political parties
and might even call a national development conference to chart
various reform programs.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's export orders have been booming
since the beginning of this year, with export orders in May hitting a
new high of US$13.36 billion, according to statistics released on
Wednesday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Export orders in the first five months of this year totaled

last year, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Export orders for information and communication products in May
amounted to US$2.438 billion, up 36.58 percent from the year-earlier
level. Export orders for these products in the first five months of

      <P>Export orders for electronics products in May stood at US$2.788

      <P>The MOEA attributed May's booming export orders mainly to a
stronger global economy and rising demand for technology products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders will probably reach the US$14

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said on Wednesday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should sit
down to resume negotiations before the opening of direct trade,
postal and communication links.</P>
      <P>He stressed that this policy should not be affected by a
projected pilgrimage to Fujian Province by local worshippers of
Matsu, the Chinese goddess of the Sea.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while meeting with council and
assembly speakers from Taichung City and Taichung, Nantou, Changhua
and Yunlin counties.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he himself is also a Matsu worshipper, but pointed
out that national security is important and that Beijing should not
be provided with an excuse to divide the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two groups of Matsu worshippers were originally scheduled to make
pilgrimages to Fujian in mid-July, but Beijing recently announced a
four-point principle governing the pilgrimages, stating that the
trips must be made within the "one China principle" and must be a
direct voyage between Taiwan's offshore islands and Fujian.</P>
      <P>As the Taipei government's assessment on the feasibility of
opening direct links and direct religious voyages will not be
finished within the next six months, Beijing's four-point principle
has become a hot potato for the Taiwan side.</P>
      <P>Because of this, Chaotien Temple in Peikang on Wednesday
announced its decision to cancel the pilgrimage this year, while
Chenlan Temple in Tachia said that its plan to visit Fujian between
July 16 and July 21 will go ahead, but that the pilgrims will go by
air via Hong Kong, not by sea.</P>
      <P>During the meeting at the Presidential Office, Chen also heard
suggestions from the speakers on the progress of post-earthquake
reconstruction plans and various local development projects.</P>
      <P>Nantou Assembly Speaker Cheng Wen-tung suggested that the
government should not levy taxes in his county for five years because
Nantou was among the hardest-hit areas in last September's
devastating temblor which claimed 2,400 lives.</P>

      <P>Hu said that Lee urged the new KMT leadership to make more
intimate contact with the people and to search for more talent for
the party, so as to win more support from the people.</P>
      <P>Lee also asked them to pay more attention to the welfare and
interests of women, minority groups and aborigines, and raised the
need for the new government to resolve the pressing difficulties
faced by traditional industries, such as the textile industry.</P>
      <P>Lee resigned his post as KMT chairman after the party's loss in

    <TEXT>
      <P>"One China" is a concept that needs to be
clarified through consultations between Taiwan and mainland China,
and Beijing should not paint itself into a corner by sticking to its
own interpretation, Premier Tang Fei said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Robert A. Manning, a researcher at the New
York-based Council on Foreign Relations, the former air force general
told his visitor that President Chen Shui-bian's mainland China
policy is quite flexible and that Beijing should capitalize on this
and engage in constructive dialogue with Taiwan rather than
squandering it by holding on to its rigid "one China principle."</P>
      <P>Tang, who served as Minister of National Defense before being
appointed premier, admitted that Taiwan is not Beijing's match in
either the quantity or the quality of its military.</P>
      <P>Beijing is superior to Taiwan in its space technology, nuclear
power and missile technology, although Beijing might not use it
against the island, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>He attributed the mistrust between Beijing and Taipei to
Beijing's concerns about Taiwan's shift toward independence and the
Taiwan people's reluctance to accept Beijing's dictatorship, saying
that a mind-set favorable to dialogue must be adopted before any
meaningful dialogue can take place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE WASTE HUGE AMOUNT OF WATER AS THEY FACE DROUGHT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People in mainland China waste a huge
amount of water despite the fact they are facing a serious drought in
Shandong, Hebei, Tibet, and other provinces, The Australian reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report from Beijing said pools of water lie all over the
capital of China -- on the streets, in the parks, and outside
restaurants and cafes.</P>
      <P>Water trucks tour the streets of big cities all over the country,
pouring water on to the roads for no clearly discernible reason, the
daily reported. Women wearing face masks wander through department
stores sprinkling water on the floors so the feet of shoppers won't
create dust.</P>
      <P>In public lavatories, taps are turned on full and water gushes
down the drain while women check their make-up and fix their combs
beneath the profligate stream, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Xinhua News Agency as reporting that 3.2 million
people in eastern Shandong province are plagued by water shortages
caused by a drought that has lasted 22 months.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 crows blackened the sky of Hebei province
because they were driven in search of food because of drought. On the
Tibetan plateau, farmers are worried that a lack of water will kill
their herds, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Since 1950, mainland China is estimated to have lost more than 10
billion kilograms of grain per year because of drought and more than
30 cities throughout the country regularly report that the ground is
sinking, cracking, and caving in because the underground water
resources are being over-used, the daily reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 82% BACK CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan people back the
convention of a summit meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, but less than half of them think it can become a reality,
according to the results of an opinion poll released on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 759 randomly selected adult residents,
conducted on Wednesday evening by the mass-circulation United Daily
News (UDN), found that 82 percent of the respondents threw support
behind President Chen's proposal that the top leaders on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait meet for a historic handshake and
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>President Chen, inspired by last week's high-profile
North-South Korean summit, said at a press conference on
Tuesday he is willing to meet mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin anywhere under any protocol with a view to ending cross-strait
hostility. UDN poll results show that only 4 percent of those
interviewed gave a thumbs-down to Chen's proposal.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, only 37 percent said they believe that a
cross-strait summit is likely to take place during President Chen's
four-year tenure; 36 percent said they don't think Chen can
realize his "dream" over the next four years; 26 percent said they
have no opinion about the issue.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that President Chen's approval rating
surged 4 percent to reach 79 percent after Tuesday's press
conference which marked his first month on his new job. A mere 6
percent said they were dissatisfied with Chen's performance over the
past month; 15 percent declined to answer the question.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 69 percent said they think that President
Chen has been friendly toward mainland China since he took office on
May 20, while only 3 percent said they feel that Chen is hostile
toward the Beijing government.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 44 percent said they feel that mainland China
remains hostile toward Taiwan since Chen's inauguration, and only 18
percent said they think otherwise.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 53 percent said they support President Chen's
proposal that Taipei assist Beijing in winning its bid to host the
2008 Olympic Games; 21 percent said they oppose the proposal; and 27
percent said they have no opinion about the idea.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that 33 percent of the respondents are
aware of the full content of Chen's talks during his first
post-inauguration press conference, and 87 percent of them said they
were satisfied with Chen's remarks while 7 percent gave a negative
evaluation.</P>
      <P>Asked what impressed them most in Chen's press conference
speech, 62 percent cited Chen's call for a cross-strait summit and
reconciliation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER DPP PARTY CHAIRMAN WARNS OF PITFALLS FACING COALITION GOV'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's coalition government will be hard
pressed to eradicate corruption even with the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) at the helm because it is still a minority party in the
legislature, according to former DPP Chairman Shih Min-teh.</P>
      <P>Shih said in a radio interview on Wednesday that the new DPP
administration could certainly fill its ranks with honest politicians
and call itself "a government of the entire people and a ruling
coalition without corruption." However, he went on to say that the
DPP's minority status in the nation's lawmaking body will make Taiwan
a place ruled by both "the pure and the corrupted."</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers take up less than 30 percent of congressional
seats. The KMT retains 51 percent, while the newly formed People
First Party (PFP) takes 9 percent, and the New Party (NP) controls 4
percent.</P>
      <P>Shih predicted that the existing legislative structure, carried
over from the previous Kuomintang (KMT) administration, will force
the DPP government to compromise with the lawmakers during
September's budget review. He added that "black gold politics,"
referring to the illegal connections between politicians and
organized crime and large financial interests, is here to stay.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that the DPP will have "no choice but to surrender in
the end" when all of its bills and budgets are slashed. He added that
if the opposition parties let the March 18 presidential election
bygones be bygones and decide to work together, then the DPP is
"doomed."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that currently debated issues such as direct
trips to mainland China for religious purposes, the number of work
hours per week, and the controversies surrounding the construction of
a fourth nuclear power plant are "only the beginning." He added that
the budget issue will "completely crumble" the new government.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's invitation to the chairmen of the
three major political parties for a meeting is only a "political
show" that will not necessarily resolve any problems, Shih said. It
all comes back to the need for a sound national system, he added.</P>
      <P>Regarding Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, Shih noted
that Lee may be well respected by the people, but his political
abilities should be left as an open question because he is a Nobel
laureate in chemistry, not a politician. Lee is in the process of
setting up an interparty task force to focus on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Shih said that he disagrees with Lee's recent remark that Chen's
election promises don't necessarily have to be carried out if they
are unfeasible. Shih noted that if political views don't have to be
realized, then any politician can talk through his hat.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  22  (CNA)
(By K.J. Lo and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Navy opened its
only two Dutch-made submarines, acquired in the late 1980s, to the
mass media on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Twenty journalists boarded the Sworddragon-class Sub "Sea Tiger,"
one of the two 66.92-meter submarines owned by the ROC Navy modeled
after the Netherlands' Zwaardvis-class submarine, for an undersea
ride.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time ever that the ROC Navy has given media
access to the two Dutch-made submarines since the vessels were
delivered to Taiwan in 1986 and 1987 respectively.</P>
      <P>"Sea Tiger" and "Sea Dragon" represent two of the four submarines
that the ROC Navy currently possesses. The two others, commissioned
in the early 70s as "Sea Lion" and "Sea Jaguar," are US-made
Guppy-class diesel-electric subs that are now restricted to use for
training purposes.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy has wanted to acquire at least 10 more submarines to
meet it basic coastal defense requirements and ensure naval security
but has failed in its attempts since 1987 due primarily to political
reasons. Most submarine-producing countries are reluctant to sell the
hardware to Taiwan for fear of offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Zwaardvis-class "Sea Dragon" and "Sea Tiger" are currently
the backbone of the ROC Navy's underwater defense force responsible
for anti-submarine and coastal surveillance missions.</P>
      <P>The "Sea Dragon" and "Sea Tiger" each stands 66.92 meters long
and 8.4 meters wide and are equipped with six 21-inch torpedo
launchers and advanced navigation and combat systems. Each submarine
has the capacity to carry 11 officers and 66 soldiers.</P>
      <P>Each submarine is equipped with three 4,050 horsepower
Brons/Stork-Werkspoor 120RUB215 diesel engines, two 922KW Holec
generators, and 196 batteries in two settings. With a single-shaft, a
five-leave propeller, the vessels have a maximum surface horsepower
of 1,400 and a maximum underwater horsepower of 5,100.</P>
      <P>The subs are capable of traveling at a maximum speed of 12 knots
on the water's surface and at a speed of 20 knots underwater. They
have a maximum diving capacity of 240 meters and a maximum mileage of
12,000 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>The underwater media event was hosted by Admiral Fei Hung-po of
the Navy Fleet Command. All the 20 journalists participating received
high-pressure tests before boarding the vessel to ensure that they

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY ASKED TO HELP CONSUME OVER-PRODUCED BANANAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Armed Forces were asked on Thursday
to consume more bananas to help digest the produce which has been
over-stocked since May this year, sources from the Legislative Yuan
said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hsien-jen, a member of the Legislature Committee
of Defense Affairs, appealed to the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) to purchase more bananas and encourage the men and women in
uniform to eat "as many as they could" so as to help banana farmers
survive their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Ying, director of the MND General Welfare Department, who
was accompanied by Vice Defense Minister Fang Shou-lu at the
Legislature interpellation session, said the armed forces have
already "eaten many bananas" and will continue to consume more.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said the General Welfare Department has always been
supportive of the government's agricultural and economic policies.
The military's consumption patterns have constantly changed to help
the private sector whenever it needed it, he added.</P>
      <P>To help consume the back stocks of bananas islandwide, Hsueh said
the military purchased over 60,000 kg in April, increasing its
purchases of bananas to 138,000 kg in early June.</P>
      <P>The MND formally notified all military units on Wednesday to
further increase banana purchases, Hsueh added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's banana growers have been caught in an unprecedented
dilemma recently as they face cut-throat competition in Japan and
disastrously low prices at home because of over-production.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-produced bananas have faced fierce competition in Japan
since May this year, when the Philippines began dumping its bananas
in that market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan varieties, which used to be the Japanese consumers'
bananas of choice because of their sweetness, are now exported to
Japan at a unit price of 1,400 yen per carton, a price even lower
than the production cost of about 1,750 yen.</P>
      <P>Lower-than-reasonable export prices have driven banana growers to
shun the Japanese market -- a situation that has pushed down
wholesale and retail prices in domestic markets as a result of local
over-supply.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BALL IS IN BEIJING'S COURT: TAIWAN NEGOTIATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Huang Kuei-mei and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan negotiator with mainland China
said here on Thursday that Beijing is obliged to realize the proposal
of holding a summit meeting between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, deputy secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the remarks in an interview
with Sankei Shimbun, an influential Japanese business daily.</P>
      <P>SEF, headed by veteran business tycoon Koo Chen-fu, is an
intermediary body authorized by the Republic of China government to
handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Yen, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday for a visit, said the most
important reason behind ROC President Chen Shui-bian's call for a
cross-strait summit lies in Chen's wish to defuse misunderstanding
and normalize bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Chen, inspired by last week's historic North-South Korean
summit, said in his first post-inauguration press conference on
Tuesday that he is willing to meet mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin anywhere under any protocol for talks on bilateral issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is wide open to cross-strait engagement, Yen
said the ball is now in Beijing's court. "We are hopeful that
Beijing can make a goodwill response to Chen's olive branch to help
realize the goal of cross-strait reconciliation," he added.</P>
      <P>Asked about the long-stalled quasi-official dialogue between SEF
and its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait, Yen said as Beijing is scheduled to review its
policy toward Taiwan and work out new strategy in August,
cross-strait dialogue is expected to resume this autumn at the
earliest.</P>
      <P>Yen said he is optimistic about the prospects for resumption
of cross-strait dialogue because the two sides must discuss some
practical trade and economic issues following their entry to the
World Trade Organization later this year.</P>
      <P>Yen, also director of the China Affairs Department of the ROC's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also said Taiwan hopes the
United States can play the role of "facilitator" to help push for
early resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese National Federation of Industries
(CNFI) delegation will begin an eight-day survey of mainland China's
investment environment on Sunday.</P>
      <P>CNFI Chairman Lin Kuen-chung will lead the delegation, whose

labor-intensive industries and small- and medium-sized businesses in
Taiwan as the primary reason for their interest in mainland China's
current state of investments and industry operations.</P>
      <P>According to CNFI, the trip was planned before the Legislative
Yuan recently passed a controversial bill shortening work week hours
to 84 hours per two-week period. Local industries are widely known to
be resentful of the bill, and many business leaders have urged the
government to keep their interests in mind, adding that an exodus of
industries to more ideal investment environments would otherwise

      <P>A delegation of mainland Chinese tourism
industry professionals arrived in Taiwan on Wednesday to begin a
10-day survey of the local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Led by Qiu Yanming, deputy director of the Tourism Bureau of
Guanxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the delegation is scheduled to study

      <P>Regarding a local ban on mainland Chinese tourists visiting
Taiwan, Qiu said that he feels "very positive" about recent efforts

cross-strait contacts between people from both sides.</P>
      <P>According to Qiu, a total of 1.6 million Taiwan tourists have

    <HEADLINE>AIT OFFICIAL POSITIVE ON NEW ROC GOVERNMENT'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern Taiwan, June 22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stephen Dunn, director of
the Kaohsiung Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT),
on Thursday gave a thumbs-up to the new ROC government's performance
over the past month.</P>
      <P>Dunn, the head of the US representative office in the southern
Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung, offered his praise during visits to
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) offices in Chiayi
City and Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>This was Dunn's first visits to the DPP's offices in the Chiayi
area since DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian's stunning victory in the
March 18 presidential election, which marked an end to the
Kuomintang's 55-year rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dunn said his Chiayi trip was mainly aimed at acquiring
first-hand information about the DPP's development plan after its
grip on power and possible post-election changes in Chiayi's
political map.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on Chen's administration, Dunn said the
Republic of China's first non-KMT government has performed well since
its inauguration on May 20, and that the US government is generally
satisfied with the new ROC government's performance.</P>
      <P>Dunn also lauded President Chen's handling of relations across
the Taiwan Strait over the past month as very reasonable and
prudent. "I think we should give Chen more time to adapt himself to
cross-strait issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Dunn said he believes that if the new ROC government can
completely eradicate "black gold" politics, which refers to
connections between organized crime and the government, Taiwan will
fare even better.</P>
      <P>AIT is a semi-official organization authorized by the US
government to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of
official ties.</P>
      <P>Following the DPP's election victory, the "political ecology" in
the Chiayi area has changed significantly. The local political
arena has been dominated by several large local factions. In the
past, the KMT controlled all local "political resources."
In the March 18 presidential election, Chen managed to emerged
as the top vote-getter in Chiayi County. Since the end of the
presidential election, the number of DPP members in the county has
increased from 3,000 to more than 7,000, according to party sources.

preparing a report on a national computer lottery, widely expected to
be introduced at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai Ming-teh, deputy director of the Bank of

      <P>A senior official at the MOF said that his ministry had indeed

      <P>According to the MOF, the computerized lottery was originally to

    <HEADLINE>ROC DELEGATION TO ATTEND WORLD FORUM ON DEMOCRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China delegation to
attend the first World Forum on Democracy will leave for Poland on
Friday, the Government Information Office (GIO) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>GIO Deputy Director-General Frederic P.N. Chang said at a press
conference that organizers of the world forum has invited four ROC
representatives to attend the meeting on behalf of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those invited were two former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairmen Shih Ming-teh and Hsu Hsin-liang, as well as writer Po Yang
and Chang King-yuh, a former GIO chief and chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), Chang said.</P>
      <P>Po Yang, a former political prisoner whose real name is Kuo
Yi-tung, however, has politely rejected the invitation on health
reasons. Po Yang, now in his 70s, said he is not suitable for long
flight because of his age.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Po Yang, who currently heads a human rights
educational fund, has produced a documentary detailing human rights
development in Taiwan for distribution to delegates from other
countries as a gift.</P>
      <P>The documentary, titled "Mothers Don't Cry Any More," will also
be shown at seminars to be hosted by the ROC delegation during the
world forum.</P>
      <P>The forum, to be held in Warsaw from June 25-27, is jointly
organized by the noted US human rights promotional group Freedom
House and Poland's Stefan Batory Foundation.</P>
      <P>Organizers have invited those who have contributed to the
development of democracy and human rights from various countries
around the world to attend the forum to discuss effective ways to
further promote global democratization.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh, who was jailed for a
total of about a quarter of a century during Taiwan's martial law
era for his pro-democracy stand, said in the past Taiwan was a
target of concern or criticism of world human rights organizations
and activists.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays, Taiwan has emerged as a mature democracy and greatly
improved its human rights conditions. We must now begin to show
concern about human rights issues in other countries and help them
improve the situation," said Shih, an incumbent lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights concern is based on humanitarianism,
Shih said it should not be used as a tool or "card" for diplomatic
purposes.</P>
      <P>Another former DPP chairman Hsu Hsin-liang said Poland and
Taiwan share similar political development experience. "Both of them
have evolved from a long-term one-party autocracy to a democracy. We
should be grateful for contribution made by our democracy activists
like Po Yang and Shih. Without their efforts and sacrifice, we can't
enjoy democratic lifestyles now," he noted.</P>
      <P>This was Hsu's first public appearance since he lost his
presidential bid in the March 18 election.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who quit the DPP last year to run for the presidency as an
independent, said he has accepted the new ROC government's offer
to serve as a senior adviser to the president.</P>
      <P>"I must accept the offer to show my support for the new
government now that I have been defeated in the presidential race,"
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He further said the new government, also the ROC's first DPP-led
administration, faces two arduous tasks -- breaking the logjam
in relations across the Taiwan Strait and establishing a
workable, efficient constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Hsu said cross-strait tension has not eased following the
inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's standard-bearer
in the presidential election. "For the common benefits of all of the
23 million Taiwan residents, President Chen must tackle cross-strait
issues in a sober, prudent manner," he urged.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsu said, the new government, which was
inaugurated on May 20, should make efforts to develop a sound,
healthy, workable and efficient constitutional system to ensure
smooth operation of the administration in the next four years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Ching-kuo, the Republic of China member
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that he
voted in 1993 for Beijing to host the 2000 Olympics.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local radio station, Wu, who was widely
believed to have cast the pivotal vote against Beijing in Monte Carlo
that led to Beijing's losing to Sydney, said he did not follow the
Taipei authorities' instruction to vote against Beijing in the secret
ballot.</P>
      <P>In the IOC meeting in Monte Carlo, Sydney was chosen to host the
2000 Olympics over Beijing with a two-vote margin. If Beijing had
managed to get just one more vote from a pro-Sydney members, it would
have tied with Sydney and led to a runoff vote.</P>
      <P>Wu said in Thursday's interview that he has come under heavy fire
for the mistaken perception of him as the man who blocked Beijing's
bid, but said he was reluctant to set the record straight publicly
because of the Taipei authorities' secret order and the IOC rules
that its members are not allowed to accept instructions on voting
from any government or other group or individual.</P>
      <P>Wu said it was Kenya and Uganda IOC members who reneged on
earlier promises to vote for Beijing, because Sydney offered aid to
their national Olympic committees. He did not offer any evidence or
proof to back his claim.</P>
      <P>He further claimed that in fact, He Zhenliang, who was President
of Beijing's Chinese Olympic Committee at the time, wrote him a
letter after the Monte Carlo meeting to thank him for his support.</P>
      <P>He also said he backs a proposal put forward by President Chen
Shui-bian to bid to co-host the 2008 Olympics with Beijing, and added
that he would like to travel to Beijing to discuss the matter with
sports officials there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, MACEDONIA SIGN ACCORD ON US$10 MILLION DEVELOPMENT FUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Lu Yi-ching and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Macedonia signed
an agreement on Thursday for the establishment of a special fund to
help boost the Balkan state's economic development.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by visiting ROC Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao and Macedonia's Development Minister Trajko Slaveski on
behalf their governments.</P>
      <P>Under the accord, the ROC will contribute US$2.5 million
annually to the fund over the next four years to help finance
Macedonia's infrastructure construction projects related to people's
daily lives. The Macedonian government will also invest a certain
amount of money to the fund annually based on its financial
capabilities.</P>
      <P>The two countries will set up a five-member management board to
administer the fund, with Tien serving as board chairman. Taiwan and
Macedonia will each name two board members to assist in screening
long-term investment projects.</P>
      <P>The fund's bank account will be set up in Taipei and the ROC
will deposit the first installment of the promised money on Aug. 1.
According to the accord, only the interest income from the fund will
be used to finance Macedonia's various development plans.</P>
      <P>Macedonian officials said Macedonia will first use the fund to
improve its tap water supply system, environmental protection
programs and small- and medium-sized enterprises development plans.</P>
      <P>Tien arrived in Skopje on Wednesday for a three-day visit.
Macedonia is the first country he visited since taking office on
May 20.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his arrival, Tien and Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov gave a joint press conference in which they
reaffirmed the two countries' determination to further strengthen
cooperation based on the current basis.</P>
      <P>Tien said despite rumors that diplomatic relations between
Macedonia and the ROC may change, the two countries will continue
economic and political cooperation.</P>
      <P>Tien stressed that ROC-Macedonian diplomatic ties are based on
their mutual respect of human rights and the fact that they are both
democratic countries.</P>
      <P>Macedonia established diplomatic relations with Taiwan in January
1999, prompting mainland China to immediately cut off diplomatic
ties with Skopje and close its embassy here.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province, enforces a
diplomatic embargo against the ROC and refuses to maintain
diplomatic ties with countries that recognize Taipei.</P>
      <P>Tien said on Wednesday that Taiwan was prepared to share with
Macedonia some of its economic experience and, in the future, share
some of its fruits of economic development with its friends.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his hope that Macedonia will continue
supporting the ROC's bid to join major international organizations
and activities.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions on relations with Beijing, Tien said: "Our
president during his inauguration speech has already indicated that
the Republic of China will not declare independence, unless we are
under threat from external forces."</P>
      <P>The minister went on: "President Chen also made it clear
that he has no plan to abolish the National Unification Council
under the Presidential Office and the National Unification
Guidelines."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tien said, President Chen indicated that on the
basis of the current foundations of cross-Taiwan Strait relations he
hopes that the leaders of both sides will be able to jointly deal
with the issue of a future "one China."</P>
      <P>In short, Tien said: "We believe that President Chen has made
major concessions in order to promote efforts of reconciliation and
peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>After the press conference, Tien presided over a ceremony in
which he, on behalf of the ROC government, donated US$4 million
worth of information technology products, including 28 personal
computers, five notebook computers and laser printers, to Macedonia.</P>
      <P>The ROC has only two diplomatic allies in Europe. Following his
Macedonia visit, Tien will travel to the Vatican City, the ROC's
other European ally, for a three-day visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELIGIOUS ACTIVITY SHOULD NOT JEOPARDIZE NATIONAL SECURITY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said on Thursday that religious activity should not be conducted
without taking national security into account.</P>
      <P>Receiving a group of local Taoists, Chen said the government
fully respects religious beliefs, but does not wish to see religion
being used by Beijing as a means of alienating religious followers
from the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>With regard to demands by local followers of Chinese folk goddess
Matsu for permission to make direct cross-Taiwan Strait pilgrimages
to Matsu's "home town" of Meizhou, Fujian Province, Chen said he does
not believe that Matsu -- who is enshrined as a guardian of fishermen
-- "would dictate to her followers the specific day on which to make
a trip to mainland China without considering national security."</P>
      <P>Matsu's followers at the Chenglan Temple in Taichung County had
earlier announced that the goddess had instructed them to travel
directly to Meizhou by sea on July 16, a move that would challenge
the government's ban on direct shipping links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government should not limit pilgrimages, but
adding that security should take precedence over religious activity,
Chen said he hoped the public will rally behind the government's
policy where national security is at stake.</P>
      <P>Although the government has promised to give favorable
consideration to direct pilgrimages to mainland China, it will
require Beijing's cooperation to thrash out the details for such
links, just as the "three direct links" -- postal, trade and
transportation -- between Taiwan and mainland China cannot be
implemented unilaterally, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Before direct shipping is approved, Chen said pilgrimages to the
mainland should be made via a third country or area, the same travel
rules that apply to ordinary visitors to the mainland from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to turn the screw on Taipei to open direct
pilgrimages to the mainland, Beijing required Taiwan pilgrims either
to sail Taiwan-registered boats directly to Meizhou or travel as
ordinary visitors.</P>
      <P>Caught on the horns of the dilemma, the Chenglan followers have
given up their plan to sail directly to Meizhou, and will instead
travel by air via Hong Kong.</P>

(SEF) Yen Wan-chin and National Security Council Adviser Yeh
Kuo-hsin.</P>
      <P>It arrived in Tokyo on June 20, the day of Chen's first
post-inauguration press conference, in which he made a goodwill
proposal to Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the meeting on Thursday, Tseng said Chen's new administration
has demonstrated bona fide sincerity to Beijing and that it is now
time to see how mainland China responds.</P>
      <P>However, he added that the "one China" principle espoused by
Beijing means the People's Republic of China, which will not be
accepted by Taipei.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said he welcomed the recent Korean summit and that he
was optimistic about the effects the Korean leaders' talks will have
on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The SEF's Yen indicated that the smooth development of economic
and trade relations is the first step in normalizing cross-strait
links and that politics should not interfere with economic affairs.
He added that economic affairs should be resolved through economic
means and that if Beijing defuses its hostility toward Taiwan, Taipei
would be more willing to open the "three direct links" -- trade,
postal and transport -- with mainland China.</P>
      <P>As for a proposal that the Democratic Progressive Party should
repeal its pro-independence plank, Yen said the president has already
declared that he will not participate in DPP affairs, so the issue is
not his problem, nor is it a problem for the new government.</P>
      <P>He said that instead, it is the problem of a political
organization, and added that according to the DPP charter, the plank
can be revised with the consent of two-thirds of the party's members.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who withdraws himself from
the world for no other reason than to show his personal purity of
motive, is one who breaks up one of the greatest ties in the
foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the other hand, who
enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to be
right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is
well aware of that."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MISSING ARMY PRIVATE FOUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ROC Army private stationed in Kinmen who
went missing Monday was found by military police on Friday morning,
ending what might turn out to be another wrestling episode between
the military and families of servicemen.</P>
      <P>Private Wu Tsung-lin, who was found lingering within an empty
house in a residential complex located in a Kinmen suburb, said he
left his post because he didn't know how to deal with the pressure.</P>
      <P>After dispatching some 3,500 men over the past four days to
search for Wu without finding a trace of his whereabouts, the Kinmen
Defense Command launched Operation Thunder early Friday morning. Soon
after the blanket search operation of all areas in Kinmen was begun,
Wu was found at around 9:10 a.m.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was serving as a supply aide in a transportation
battalion, is now in military police custody. He will face a military
trial for overstaying his leave or worse, for desertion, the defense
command sources said.</P>
      <P>Wu told his inquirers that he went on an errand Monday morning
but afterwards did not feel like returning to the office. He then
headed to a karaoke parlor to pass some time before hiding with some
food supplies in the empty house by the beach .</P>
      <P>Wu, 20, from a farming family in Yunlin County, left Taiwan for
Kinmen in mid-April to begin a nearly three-year term of military
service. His family had not heard from him since then, said his
father. Feeling worried, his parents called his unit in early June.
Wu talked with them over the telephone, but "sounded weird," the
father said. That was the last time they heard from him.</P>
      <P>Wu's mother and older sister flew to Kinmen on June 20 after they
were told that Wu was declared missing. The relatives returned to
Taiwan the next day without receiving any news about Wu's
whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Back in there hometown, Wu's family took his picture to a Yunlin
temple to pray for his safe return and simultaneously appealed to
Yunlin-based Legislator Hou Hui-shien for help.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S BEHAVIOUR TOWARD US SAID NOT RESULT OF FACTIONALISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Policymakers in Washington share a
misguided and even dangerous assumption that Beijing's behavior
toward Washington is driven by factional politics within the
Communist Chinese leadership, according to an analysis published in
the latest issue of Foreign Affairs bimonthly.</P>
      <P>Paul Heer, a visiting fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
wrote that Chinese leaders today, in fact, are all moderates, and
they are all hardliners. On domestic economic policy, they are all
reformers in the sense that they are all openly committed to the
reform program Deng Xiaoping launched more than 20 years ago. At the
same time, they are hardliners in the sense that they retain a
commitment to socialism and to Communist Party rule.</P>
      <P>On foreign policy, he pointed out, the common denominator is a
genuine commitment to Chinese nationalism. Public and private
statements by President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji show that
even they are hardliners in that they are unwilling to compromise on
core sovereignty issues, especially Taiwan. And they are
fundamentally suspicious of US intentions, suspecting that Washington
wants to contain China internationally and see the demise of the
Communist Party.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Heer said, leaders in Beijing recognize the
global importance, in military and economic terms, of the United
States and the benefits of good relations with Washington -- and thus
remain, in another sense, moderates.</P>
      <P>"It is, consequently, a mistake to ascribe nationalistic,
uncompromising, or suspicious statements or actions by Beijing to an
intractable minority within the Chinese leadership. Perhaps more
important, it is misguided to presume that the occasional, harshly
nationalist rhetoric of Jiang and Zhu and other supposed moderates is
the product of political pressure and not genuine," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Heer emphasized that "the view on sovereignty issues in Beijing
generally characterized as hardline is in fact mainstream. Suspicion
and resentment of the United States is not a source of division
within the Chinese leadership -- it is one of the common
denominators."</P>
      <P>The statements and writings of a wide variety of Communist
Chinese officials suggest that, although Beijing leaders may argue
about how best to respond to the challenge of Washington, they all
agree on the nature of that challenge: that the United States is
trying to Westernize and divide China through a process of "peaceful
evolution" -- policies aimed at undermining the Communist Party's
authority -- and support for Taiwan's separatist agenda, he wrote.</P>
      <P>Consequently, Heer said, "neither a strengthening of supposed
moderates nor a change in leadership will make Beijing more
compromising to US interests. Even a change in the nature of the
regime would not necessarily produce such a result. A democratic and
capitalist China would remain strongly nationalistic, retain mixed
feelings about the United States, and insist on doing things its own
way."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARTH COULD BE HIT BY ANY OF 900 `NEARBY' ASTEROIDS: STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  22  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new study has portrayed the paths of
asteroids in the inner solar system as a vast Los Angeles-style
traffic system crisscrossed with superhighways with planet Earth
located in the middle of the network.</P>
      <P>The study estimated that an armada of asteroids, 900 strong, all
a kilometer in diameter or larger, present a potential hazard to life
on Earth. Some pass within a few moon distances of Earth every year.</P>
      <P>"Sometime in the future, one of these objects could conceivably
run into Earth," warned astronomy researcher William Bottke of
Cornell University.</P>
      <P>"One kilometer in size is thought to be a magic number, because
it has been estimated that these asteroids are capable of wreaking
global devastation if they hit the Earth," he added.</P>
      <P>Bottke is the lead researcher of a US-French team that discovered
the spatial and size distribution of a large group of asteroids
called NEAs (near-Earth asteroids), a vast system of orbiting rocks
in inner space, ranging in size from mere specks to more than 64
kilometers (40 miles) in diameter.</P>
      <P>The astronomers believe the results of their observational and
computer-based study will better quantify the likelihood of future
catastrophic collisions with Earth.</P>
      <P>The team's report appears in the June 23 edition of the journal
Science.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government welcomes
US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's appeal to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin for early resumption of peaceful dialogue
across the Taiwan Strait, a mainland affairs official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said Albright made a fervent pitch
to Jiang during their meeting in Beijing on Thursday to resume
dialogue with Taiwan without intimidation in an effort to defuse
cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>"We welcome Albright's call for an early resumption of
cross-strait dialogue without any precondition," said Chen Ming-tung,
vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Albright was quoted as having told Jiang that the recent election
of a new president in Taiwan provided a fresh opportunity for new
progress in cross-strait relations and certainly more will be gained
through flexibility and appeals to shared interests than could
possibly be achieved through efforts of intimidate.</P>
      <P>Albright reportedly also urged Jiang to "seize the moment" and
take advantage of the apparent new atmosphere in Taipei where new ROC
President Chen Shui-bian has suggested a cross-strait leadership
meeting similar to the recent North-South Korean summit.</P>
      <P>Responding to Albright's pitch, Chen said the ROC government
shares similar views with the US secretary of state. "We hope that
the top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can draw
inspiration from the spirit of their North and South Korean
counterparts and get down to talks for mending their disputes."</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the ROC also looks forward to seeing
an early resumption of systematic dialogue between the two
quasi-official intermediary bodies -- Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"We believe that resumption of SEF-ARATS talks will help pave
the way for a cross-strait summit," Chen said, adding that he sees no
contradiction between promoting resumption of SEF-ARATS dialogue and
holding of a cross-strait summit.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Jiang continued to
snub Albright's suggestion and insisted as a precondition for
resumption of cross-strait dialogue that Taiwan's president first
acknowledge Beijing's cherished "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's recalcitrant attitude, Chen said he
thinks that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should take the North
and South Korean leaders as an example and refrain from setting any
preconditions or premises for cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We are willing to discuss any cross-strait issue with Beijing,"
Chen said, adding that national unification is an "effective option"
for the new ROC government in dealing with cross-strait relations
and also a "direction" of its efforts in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was not particularly surprised by Beijing leaders'
claim that they do not understand President Chen's personal
character and basic stance. The 49-year-old, lawyer-turned-politician
is the ROC's first president from the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>"A lack of mutual understanding signifies the need for top
leaders on both sides to talk and communicate," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>As for the new ROC government's attitude toward the so-called
"one China" principle, Chen said President Chen already clearly
stated in his May 20 inaugural speech and June 20 press conference
that he hopes top leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait can
sit down to talk and jointly deal with the question of a future "one
China."</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of President Chen's proposal
mentioned in his June 20 press conference that Taipei and Beijing
co-host the 2008 Olympic Games, Chen said it's premature to talk
about an event that is still eight years away.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said the two sides can get down to talk right
now on how to make "mission impossible" become a possibility or a
reality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CABINET TO STUDY CROSS-STRAIT MILITARY MUTUAL-TRUST MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Executive Yuan, or
Cabinet, is planning to set up a task force to study the feasibility
of establishing a cross-Taiwan Strait military mutual-trust
mechanism, a Cabinet official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-shan, director of the Executive Yuan's Third Department,
which deals with all administrative work related to the military,
said the Cabinet will pool the wisdom and expertise from the Ministry
of National Defense (MND), the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
other Cabinet sections on efforts to assess whether or not the task
force should be established and how to effect it.</P>
      <P>Lin said, however, that the Executive Yuan will wait until after
a July MND symposium that will first assess the feasibility of such a
task force being established under the MND.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan
hosted by People First Party Legislator Chin Huei-chu.</P>
      <P>At the hearing, Vice Defense Minister Sun Tao-yu said the MND
will not be hasty in setting up a cross-strait military mutual-trust
mechanism, adding that until the political standoff across the strait
is eased, the establishment of any such group will only lead Taiwan
into greater risk.</P>
      <P>Yang Chih-heng, deputy director of the Strategic and
International Studies Division under the Taiwan Research Institute,
who also spoke at the hearing, said such a mechanism would need to be
controlled by a higher level in the administrative hierarchy. He also
said it should be done through non-military agencies such as the
National Security Council, in order to secure more objective and
impartial studies and assessments on related issues.</P>
      <P>Su Chin-chiang, director of Nanhua University's Peace and
Strategy Research Center, said that whether the mechanism is
established under the MND or the Executive Yuan, the cross-strait
military mutual-trust group would have a positive strategic
significance which would help give Taiwan more room to maneuver in
cross-strait negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA TO PUSH FOR PRESIDENT CHEN'S PRESENCE AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Friday it will make a pitch for ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's participation in this year's informal leadership meeting
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director of the MOFA's International
Organizations Affairs Department, said President Chen has publicly
expressed his desire to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the annual APEC summit is the most suitable and
natural setting for a Chen-Jiang meeting," Hsia said, adding that
the MOFA will do its best to clear the way for Chen to attend the
2000 APEC leadership meeting scheduled for November in Brunei.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsia admitted that it is no easy task to arrange a
Chen-Jiang meeting under the APEC framework.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui had been barred from attending the APEC summit
in person since the annual event began in 1993. In the past, Lee had
to appoint a proxy to attend the annual APEC summit on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Under the current international climate, Hsia said, great
obstacles still stand in President Chen's way to the APEC summit.
"But anyway, the MOFA will make continued efforts to realize this
goal," he added.</P>
      <P>Taking a cue from last week's high-profile North-South
Korean summit, President Chen told a Tuesday press conference, which
marked his first month on his new job, that he is willing to meet
his mainland counterpart anywhere under any protocol.</P>
      <P>Hsia said he believes that so long as mainland China does not
set any preconditions or premises, there will be many opportunities
or occasions for top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
meet.</P>
      <P>APEC, a 21-member regional economic cooperation forum dedicated
to promoting free trade and investment, is one of the few
international organizations where both Taiwan and mainland China are
full members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST TAIWAN CITIZENS FAVOR `KOREAN FORMULA' TO SOLVE IMPASSE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Taiwan citizens think that the "Korean
formula" that helped thaw Seoul-Pyongyang relations can be borrowed
to ease the cross-Taiwan Strait impasse, according to the results of
a recent public opinion poll.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the Kuomintang's Policy Research
Committee, found that 70.07 percent of the respondents hope that the
"Korean formula" of reconciliation can be applied to cross-strait
relations, while nearly 50 percent think that Beijing should bear the
full responsibility for causing the cross-strait standoff and
aggravation of relations.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 17.15 percent of the respondents think
Taiwan should be blamed for the political deadlock across the Taiwan
Strait and 8.12 percent think the United States should take the
blame.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results of the poll, which focused mainly on the
impact of the Korean summit on cross-strait relations, KMT Policy
Research Committee Deputy Executive Director Hung Chao-nan said
neither the mainland nor Taiwan is blameless in aggravating
cross-strait tension, and added that both sides should use more
wisdom and tolerance to ease the deadlock.</P>
      <P>On the prospects of developing cross-strait relations in the
future, the poll found that 9.49 percent of the respondents feel the
chances of conflict developing are bigger than the likelihood of
peace, while 27.19 percent said they were unable to decide one way or
the other. Some 59.12 percent said the chances of a peaceful
resolution are bigger than the likelihood of war.</P>
      <P>When asked about the chances of the United States actually
"participating in military operations" should the Chinese communists
attack Taiwan, 67.33 percent of the respondents said US participation
would be "very likely," or "probable," while some 25.09 percent said
it would be "unlikely."</P>
      <P>The results show that most of those polled believe that the
United States will not sit idly by on the cross-strait conflict, Hung
noted, pointing out that deeper studies by the government will be
needed to decide whether this is a good or bad sign.</P>
      <P>From the poll results, Hung said, it can be seen that the
respondents understand that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait lack
benign interaction, and that while Taiwan presently does not expect a
leadership summit across the strait any time soon, it is keenly hoped
that cross-strait dialogue will be resumed, the earlier the better.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll was conducted between June 17 and 18 among
adults islandwide. The committee acquired 1,096 valid responses with
an error margin of under 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT AD HOC GROUP TO CALL MEETING NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A supra-party task force on Taiwan-mainland
China relations to be led by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
is expected to call its first meeting next week, sources said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Lee, as a "relevant figure," will be
able to take part in meetings of the National Security Council (NSC)
and pass on the findings of the informal ad hoc group to President
Chen Shui-bian so that they can be taken into consideration when
forming national policy.</P>
      <P>As Chen has high expectations that the task force will be
effective in forging national consensus on major cross-Taiwan strait
issues, its lineup, status and role will have a great impact on the
government mechanism in charge of drawing up Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The planned unofficial ad hoc group, to be composed of 20 members
from various political camps, will act as an advisory body that will
provide Chen with consultation on major cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Once the task force is set up, the National Unification Council
(NUC) may also convene a meeting in August at the earliest, at a time
when the Beijing leadership has its annual policy-making meeting at
Beidaihe during which it is expected to draw up an official response
to Chen's stance toward mainland China, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The convening of an NUC meeting by that time will be a major
benchmark that will indicate the development of cross-strait ties,
they added.</P>
      <P>When Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, won Taiwan's March 18 presidential election,
Beijing said that it would "listen to Chen's words and watch his
deeds" before deciding how to respond to him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said in the eastern city of Hualien that he will

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS, EMPLOYERS MAKE OPPOSING APPEALS ON FOREIGN LABOR POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators and senior business executives
made completely opposing appeals to the government on Friday
concerning its policy regarding foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>While lawmakers demanded that the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) uphold a promise to cut the annual quota for foreign
laborers by 15,000 from next year, many senior business executives
urged the government to allow them to hire even more foreign laborers
to help tide them over the difficulties that will be caused by the
shortened workweek scheduled for implementation from the beginning of
2001.</P>
      <P>Legislators Cheng Lung-shui of the tiny right-wing opposition
New Party (NP), Chou Ching-yu of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and Kuo Su-chun of the powerful opposition
Kuomintang held a joint news conference to remind the CLA to uphold
its "trimming the quota of foreign laborers" promise.</P>
      <P>Chou said CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu, also a DPP stalwart, promised
in a May 24 report to the Legislative Yuan's Health, Environment and
Welfare Services Committee that the labor council will push for an
annual reduction of the foreign workers quota by 15,000.</P>
      <P>However, Chou said since the legislature passed a KMT-initiated
bill on a much-shortened workweek system earlier this month, Chen
has softened her stance by saying last week that the "foreign labor
quota reduction" policy is still pending evaluation.</P>
      <P>Chou said Taiwan now boasts Asia's highest wage levels for
foreign laborers, doubling that offered in Singapore. As the
domestic unemployment rate has continued rising, Chou said, lowering
the number of foreign laborers has become an urgent problem.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, NP Legislator Cheng Lung-shui
said the government's current foreign labor policy has been "abused"
by local employers as an excuse to cut production costs at the
expense of local blue-collar workers' job opportunities.</P>
      <P>Cheng initiated a draft bill on Friday, demanding the Cabinet to
trim the quota of foreign laborers by 15,000 annually from 2001 until
the ratio of foreign labor in Taiwan's job market drops to 1.6
percent.</P>
      <P>Cheng said many of his legislative colleagues have endorsed the
draft bill which he said will be referred to the legislature for
discussion next week.</P>
      <P>Government tallies show that Taiwan had 294,000 legal foreign
workers at the end of last year, and that in May this year, about
120,000 grassroots laborers were out of work.</P>
      <P>According to statistical officials, the unemployment rate among
grassroots blue-collar workers was 1.2 times higher that Taiwan's
average jobless rate. They said the import of foreign laborers
apparently has affected local blue-collar workers' job openings.</P>
      <P>The CLA becomes hesitant to gradually reduce the quota of foreign
workers after the legislature overturned a Cabinet plan to shorten
the weekly work time from current 48 hours to 44 hours starting next
year.</P>
      <P>Led by the KMT, Taiwan's ruling party until May 20 which still
controls majority seats in the Legislative Yuan, the legislature
has passed a bill which trims biweekly work time to 84 hours from
2001. The KMT-initiated version also stipulates that the weekly
workweek should not exceed 44 hours under the new system.</P>
      <P>The passage of the KMT-proposed bill has triggered strong
backlash from local employers, particularly those in battered
traditional labor-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>Owners of many small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have
complained that the shortened work hours would further blunt their
competitiveness or even threaten their very survival due to largely
increased labor costs. They urged the government to take effective
measures to offset the adverse impact to be caused by the new
workweek system, including halting the planned cut in the number of
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>At a senior business executives meeting called by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs on Friday, they unanimously urged the government
to increase the import quota of foreign laborers to help them cope
with the problems that will arise from shortened workweek.</P>
      <P>At present, only manufacturing and construction industries can
hire foreign laborers. At Friday's meeting, many service industry
operators also urged the government to allow them to employ foreign
workers to cut labor costs and to slash national holidays to 10 days
from current 19 days.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, who chaired the meeting, said
representatives of employers and the employees should sit down to
talk and mend their differences.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BACKING BEIJING'S OLYMPIAD BID TO HELP MAINTAIN PEACE: IOC MEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An International Olympic Committee (IOC)
member said on Friday he believes that Taipei's support for
Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games will help maintain
peace in the Taiwan Strait for at least 10 years.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-kuo, the Republic of China's only IOC member, made the
remarks at a public hearing on the proposal that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait co-host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is also the sole Chinese IOC member, praised President
Chen Shui-bian's announcement in his June 20 press conference that
Taiwan would support Beijing's Olympiad bid.</P>
      <P>"It's a wise decision which signifies Presdient Chen's goodwill
and sincerity toward improving relations with Beijing," Wu said,
adding that if Beijing manages to win the bid, the possibility of
eruption of a cross-strait conflict in the next 10 years will be
slim.</P>
      <P>Wu recalled that he already told IOC Chairman Juan Antonio
Samaranch during a meeting in April that Taipei may throw support
behind Beijing's 2008 Olympiad bid. "Samaranch praised it as an
'excellent idea,'" he added.</P>
      <P>In line with the IOC rules, Wu said, Taipei must in the first
stage unconditionally backs Beijing's Olympiad bid. Once Beijing
wins the bid, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can then discuss the
possibility of letting Taipei host some sports competitions.</P>
      <P>A total of 10 cities around the world have applied to host the
2008 Olympic Games, and the IOC is scheduled to select three to five
cities in August for a second-stage screening. A final vote on the
host city will be held next year. According to Wu, Beijing stands a
good chance to win this time.</P>
      <P>Seven years ago, Beijing lost to Sydney to host the 2000 Olympic
Games with a two-vote margin. Wu said he voted for Beijing out of
his free will in the 1993 vote for the host city of the upcoming
sports extravaganza.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu I-hsiung, chairman of the
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS), said the
council will form a sports policy advisory task force to study how
to implement President Chen's proposal of supporting Beijing's
Olympiad bid.</P>
      <P>The task force will comprise officials from the NCPFS, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Mainland Affairs Council and
other relevant government agencies, Hsu said, adding that if all
goes well, the panel may hold its first meeting next week to
discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said he is willing to meet with mainland China's Olympic
Committee Chairman and Director of the State Administration of
Physical Culture and Sports Yuan Weimin to exchange views on the
issue under current government regulations if the Chinese Taipei
Olympic Committee would invite Yuan to visit Taiwan before August.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports from Beijing said mainland China's sports
officials welcome Taiwan's willingness to support Beijing's Olympiad
bid without any conditions.</P>
      <P>As for whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can co-host
the event or form a joint team to take part in future Olympic
Games, the mainland officials said it is premature to talk about
those issues as it remains uncertain whether Beijing can win its
bid.</P>

      <P>Newly-elected Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
called on several KMT elder statesmen on Friday in a bid to reinforce
his leadership with the endorsements of the prominent former party
officials.</P>
      <P>Lien had on Thursday met with former KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui,
who was also the nation's president. Lien was Lee's political protege
and served under him as the nation's vice president.</P>
      <P>Lien on Friday called on former Vice President Hsieh Tung-min,
former Economics Minister Lee Kuo-ting, former KMT Vice Chairman Chiu
Chuang-huan and former Premier Sun Yun-hsuan.</P>
      <P>In the meeting with Chiu, Lien declined to answer questions about
the possibility of cooperating with former KMT Secretary-General
James Soong, who was expelled by the KMT for running against Lien in
the presidential race earlier this year.</P>
      <P>He called on Sun in the evening and apologized to the former
premier for his loss in the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Sun interrupted Lien's apology, and encouraged him to give
badly-needed strong leadership to the KMT, and to guide the party to

      <P>They also talked about Sun's recent trip to his ancestral

      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao met with
Macedonian Prime Minister Ljubco Georgievski on Friday. The two
agreed to strengthen exchanges of ranking officials as a way to
further enhance substantive ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Georgievski told reporters following their 20-minute meeting that
he is highly supportive of increased exchanges of ranking government
officials to boost two-way activities in all fields, and also voiced
the hope that bilateral economic cooperation ventures will be carried
out as projected.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the ROC foreign minister would be
able to call on Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski as hoped for,
Georgievski declined to comment, saying that he has no knowledge
about the matter.</P>
      <P>Tien, accompanied by ROC envoy to Macedonia Peter Cheng, paid the
visit to Georgievski after touring the National Martyr's Shrine of
this Balkan state.</P>
      <P>Georgievski also said that he does not know when Cheng will be
able to submit his credentials to Trajkovski, and Tien was also
reserved in his comments on the matter.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Skopje set up formal diplomatic ties in January 1999,
making Macedonia the Republic of China's second diplomatic stronghold
in Europe, in addition to the Vatican. But Cheng has not been able to
present his credentials to the Macedonian president because of
internal political struggles in this former-Yugoslavian country.</P>
      <P>Tien arrived in Skopje on Wednesday for a three-day visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>G8 MINISTERIAL MEETING NOT TO TOUCH ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ministerial-level meeting of the Group
of Eight (G8) powerful nations slated for mid-July will not touch on
issues regarding the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
English-language Japan Times reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting Japanese government officials, the newspaper said the
upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of the world's seven major
industrial powers as well as Russia will not involve discussion of
cross-strait issues in order to maintain the relatively placid
atmosphere between the two sides that exists at present.</P>
      <P>The officials were cited as saying that the G8 member states
originally thought that they might have to discuss the cross-strait
crisis along with other major regional issues in the ministerial
meeting slated for July 12-13, which will pave the way for a G8
summit in Okinawa scheduled for July 21 to 23.</P>
      <P>But as both Taiwan and mainland China have exercised restraint,
their bilateral relations appear to be moving toward peace, an
official with the Japanese Foreign Ministry reportedly said. The
official reportedly stressed that member nations of the G8 Group will
continue to closely monitor developments in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have been in limbo since Chen Shui-bian of
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was elected as
Taiwan's new president on March 18.</P>
      <P>Taipei has called on the G8 Group to include a statement in their
summit declaring that Beijing should forswear military threats
against Taiwan, while mainland China has repeatedly warned the eight
member countries not to meddle in its "internal affairs," the report
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The language training center operated by
the British representative office in Taipei is not a diplomatic
agency and should be subject to domestic rules regarding taxes and
education, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday.</P>
      <P>In response to appeals from the British Trade and Cultural Office
(BTCO) in Taipei that its language training center should be exempted
from local rules on language schools and travel agencies, the
ministry said that a language training unit is not a necessary part
of a diplomatic mission, and therefore is not exempt from domestic
rules.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that with all due respect to BTCO's
diplomatic privileges, language training center is not covered by
diplomatic immunity, and any foreign embassies or representative
offices should follow Taiwan's rules in operating teaching
facilities.</P>
      <P>The ministry also said that it formerly had no knowledge of
BTCO's language training center; and after learning about it, asked
BTCO to stop recruiting new students for the school and cease
organizing trips for Taiwan students to schools in Britain.</P>
      <P>Local English language training schools, or English cram schools,

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS EXPRESS CONCERN ABOUT SHARP FALL OF BANANA PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on
Friday offered to buy 60,000 kilograms of Taiwan-produced bananas to
distribute to legislators in an effort to prop up the fruit's
domestic price, which has dropped sharply as a result of oversupply.</P>
      <P>The drastic fall in the price of Taiwan-produced bananas has
caused many legislators to express concern. Some lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday asked the new
administration to strictly control banana production in the future in
order to prevent the situation from recurring.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator He Chia-jung said at a press conference on Friday
at the Legislative Yuan that agricultural authorities should
encourage the public to eat more bananas as well as buy them at
guaranteed minimum prices, and process the fruit to reduce domestic
banana growers' losses.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-chuan, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture, said banana prices have rallied gradually, adding that
because the Farmers Association in Taiwan Province and the Farmers
Association in Taipei City have offered to buy a total of 900,000
cartons of bananas, the situation is expected to improve soon.</P>
      <P>Since Japan raised tariffs on Taiwan bananas from May this year,
Taiwan-produced bananas have met with fierce competition from cheaper
bananas from the Philippines. Taiwan's banana industry has also been
hit by raised standards for imported fruits in Japan, which have
caused customs authorities there to reject a large amount of the
product.</P>
      <P>After being returned from Japan, the rejected bananas have only
aggravated the domestic glut, resulting in a sharp fall of wholesale
and retail prices in domestic markets, with the wholesale price
dropping to NT$0.5 per kg at its lowest.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE MILITARY GAINING ON TAIWAN: US REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese military superiority
over Taiwan is expected to widen in the next two decades, said a
report released by the US Department of Defense on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report to the US Congress said disrupting or
reversing the trend depends very much on whether or not Taiwan can
acquire advanced equipment and weaponry, as well as its ability to
integrate its existing weapons systems and improve the quality of its
personnel training.</P>
      <P>Beijing's submarines are a major threat to Taiwan, which the
island should counter by upgrading its anti-submarine technology, the
report suggested.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's navy could hardly break a mainland maritime
blockade with the resources currently at its disposal, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Without the intervention of a third party, Taiwan's aged fleet of
World War II vessels wouldn't stand a chance against Beijing's
superior navy both on and under the sea, said the Pentagon report.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon predicted that Taiwan will be able to hold its own
in a possible war with Beijing for the next five years, given
Beijing's limitations in integrating its newly-acquired weaponry.</P>
      <P>Noting that air superiority is vital to any military attack
against Taiwan, the report said Beijing's current numerical
superiority in aircraft will continue to be balanced by the superior
technology of Taiwan's jet fighters at least until 2005.</P>
      <P>In order to stymie a military attack by mainland China, Taiwan
should maintain a superior military by continuously acquiring modern
weaponry, technology and equipment, and effectively integrating these
systems and improving the quality of its personnel, the report
suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDITORIAL ON ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN RECEIVES ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) on Tuesday
submitted for the congressional record a newspaper editorial that
called on Congress to press the administration to provide Taiwan with
the defensive weapons it requires to deter a Communist Chinese
invasion.</P>
      <P>The editorial, published in the Augusta Chronicle on June 12,
said the Clinton administration did "next to nothing" after the story
broke in the Taiwan press on May 25 that the Chinese military started
live-fire artillery exercises for six days near the closest outpost
of the Republic of China, which recently inaugurated a new president.</P>
      <P>That same week, an unnamed top Clinton official with the National
Security Council even said it was a mistake for the United States to
issue a visa to former president Lee Teng-hui so he could attend a
reunion at his US alma mater, according to the newspaper report.</P>
      <P>"Just before that insulting declaration, the Clinton
administration decided against selling four Aegis destroyers to
Taiwan," said the report.</P>
      <P>According to a recent classified Pentagon report leaked to The
Washington Post, Taiwan is far more vulnerable to invasion from the
Communist regime than was previously known. The level of Taiwan's
military technology has fallen behind Beijing's, particularly in the
area of defending against air and missile attacks.</P>
      <P>Since the May 20 inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian and his
appointment of a hardline anti-Communist from the previous ruling
party as defense minister, the editorial continued, the mainland
Chinese military has been saber rattling even more frequently. Yet
President Bill Clinton is still reluctant to sell military equipment
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This reluctance and the administration's pro-Beijing slant "is
thankfully drawing the attention of Congress, which is naturally
concerned that the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act is being ignored. That
legislation requires that all arms-sale decisions must be based
solely on Taiwan's defense needs," said the paper.</P>
      <P>In light of the Pentagon report and current mainland Chinese
military provocations, the editorial added, those needs have never
been greater. A bipartisan block in Congress has drawn up new
legislation, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. Among other things,
this legislation would order the executive branch to explain whenever
it rejects, postpones, or changes a military request from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The editorial emphasized that "this bill was introduced because
key lawmakers of both parties value the island as a loyal ally and
key trading partner. Taiwan deserves entry into the World Trade
Organization, as does China, especially since Taiwan is free, open,
and democratic."</P>
      <P>"How can Americans who live in a country that is a
self-proclaimed leader of free world ever abandon a free country to
dictatorship? At the very least, the people's representatives in the
legislative branch of our government can hold the executive branch to
account when it comes to defensive armaments in Taiwan," concluded
the editorial.</P>

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian has
already offered quite a few olive branches to Communist China, the
next move "can only come from mainland China," a major Canadian
newspaper said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>An editorial published by the National Post pointed out that one
week after the historic meeting between the leaders of South and
North Korea, Chen proposed a similar summit between his country and
China.</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, wasted no time in snubbing Taiwan and repeating
its demand that Chen unambiguously accept that Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China, noted the editorial.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Chen has held out an olive branch to the
Communists on several occasions, calling for open trade ties and
other direct links with the mainland. He has also said Taiwan might
support Beijing's bid to host the 2008 Olympics and even to co-host
some sporting events.</P>
      <P>"Yet Beijing continues to insist that Taiwan must first submit to
the mainland's terms. What the Communists fail to understand is that
the Taiwanese are prepared to accept a prolonged stalemate, and even
isolation, if the only alternative means they must give up their
hard-won political and economic freedoms to appease Beijing," said
the editorial.</P>
      <P>It noted that Taipei already governs itself independently --
without ever having had to declare its independence -- and is both
prosperous and democratic.</P>
      <P>Beijing "should accept President Chen's invitation and talk with
Taiwan," it concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WAGES FOR DISABLED WORKERS FALL BELOW OFFICIALLY-SANCTIONED LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One-third of local physically or mentally
disabled workers fail to earn the government-sanctioned minimum
monthly wage, according to a long-term study of 204 handicapped
people's career lives released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chiang, an associate professor at National Kaohsiung
Normal University, unveiled the study result at a seminar on
promotion of job openings for the disabled amid calls by some
industry and business executives for cancellation of current
government requirement of minimum wage at NT$14,000 (US$454.55) per
month on grounds that local workers' monthly pays have far exceeded
the minimum level.</P>
      <P>In fact, Chen said, wages for many handicapped workers still fall
below the officially-sanctioned level.</P>
      <P>According to her long-term track of the career records of 204
selected disabled workers, 33.4 percent of them failed to earn
NT$14,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The study also shows that monthly earnings of another 33.3
percent range between NT$14,000 and NT$18,000; and 22.5 percent of
those studied have been unable to secure stable income.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang's study, the top three jobs for the disabled
are factory assembly line work (25 percent), cleaning work (23.1
percent) and convenience store work (13.5 percent).</P>
      <P>The study found that nearly all of those who suffer medium- or
severe-grade physical or mental disabilities have taken either
"non-skilled or semi-skilled" jobs.</P>
      <P>Major reasons cited by those surveyed for their departure from
their jobs were a lack of interest in their work (30.8 percent),
factory closures, removal or layoffs (18.8 percent), and emotional
or spiritual problems (10.9 percent.)</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu Hsiang-liang, a special
education professor at National Changhua Normal University, said his
study shows that a quarter of disabled people cannot land jobs even
after they have received vocational training.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu's research, all government-run vocational
training centers for the disabled have many "return" students who
already completed training courses but still failed to secure
suitable jobs. Some of them said they have chosen to return to the
training centers simply because government subsidies for trainees are
even higher than what they could earn on the job market.</P>
      <P>Hsu also singled out several defects in the government's current
vocational training programs for the handicapped, including failure
to accurately evaluate each student's vocational potential; gaps
between existing vocational skill training programs and demands of
local industries; limited capacity of nearly all vocational training
centers; inadequate training facilities; shortages of competent

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO PUSH FOR EXPANSION OF OFFSHORE TRANSSHIPMENT CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Before the opening of direct transport
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Republic of China
government will push for the expansion of the existing offshore
transshipment center, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said.</P>
      <P>Minister Yeh Chu-lan is expected to put the idea forward when she
reports to Premier Tang Fei next week on the ministry's operations.</P>
      <P>In May 1995, the government announced the regulations regarding
the offshore transshipment center. According to the rules, foreign
ships or foreign-registered Taiwanese ships are allowed to ship
cargoes from or to a third country between appointed ports in Taiwan
and mainland China under the condition that the goods not pass
through Taiwan customs or enter Taiwan's territory.</P>
      <P>The port appointed by Taiwan was Kaohsiung, while the mainland
appointed Xiamen and Fuzhou for offshore transshipment purposes.
Cargo shipped in this manner has increased every year, with the total
amount of cargo shipped reaching 360,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent
units) last year and expected to reach 500,000 TEUs this year.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that before the opening of cross-strait direct
transport, the offshore transport center will expand to other export
processing zones and to sea-air transport networks.</P>
      <P>The ministry is mulling over whether to open the ports of Keelung
and Taichung for such a purpose and to request that the mainland open
the ports of Guangzhou, Talian, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin as
well.</P>
      <P>The ministry will stress that direct cross-strait transport will
only be possible after national security has been safeguarded as the
problems related to direct cross-strait transport will involve
quarantine and customs clearance and will have to wait to be solved
through consultations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER CLARIFIES `MONEY DIPLOMACY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Skopje,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Lu Yi-ching and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China, as a developed
nation, has the responsibility of contributing to the international
community by providing loans or technical assistance to other less
fortunate countries, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao said
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Tien, who arrived in Skopje on Wednesday for a three-day visit,
made the remarks while answering questions on the so-called "money
diplomacy" and issues related to bilateral ROC-Macedonia ties during
an interview with the British Broadcasting Company.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the term "money diplomacy" as being created by a
"certain country" seeking to smash the ROC's efforts at building
formal diplomatic links with other countries, Tien said it is very
normal that the ROC, as a developed country, extends its concern to
the international community.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC's financial and technical assistance is
delivered mainly to countries with which it has formal diplomatic
ties, Tien said the ROC's foreign assistance policy is quite
transparent.</P>
      <P>Turning to the purpose of his current visit to Macedonia, Tien
said his trip to this Balkan state is aimed at explaining the
continuity of the new ROC government's foreign policy to the
Macedonian government.</P>
      <P>As Macedonia is the first foreign country which he has visited
since the May 20 inauguration of the new ROC government, Tien said it
is a clear indication that the present administration of President
Chen Shui-bian views its ties with Macedonia as very important.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside widespread rumors that diplomatic relations
between the two countries are "at stake," Tien claimed that there is
no such "crisis" in their bilateral ties because both the ROC and
Macedonia are free and democratic countries which share the same
values and aspirations for democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Tien went on to say that he hopes his current visit to Macedonia
will help clarify the groundless speculation regarding the
relationship between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC and Macedonia set up formal diplomatic ties in January
1999, making this former-Yugoslavia republic Taipei's second
diplomatic stronghold in Europe after Vatican.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MERCURY-LACED SLUDGE SENT BACK TO FPG'S PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mercury-contaminated industrial waste
created by the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) and initially sent to
Cambodia in 1998 has been shipped back to company's plant in an
overnight operation that lasted for nearly 10 hours.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien carefully sealed the sludge,
which was put into 325 containers at a pier in Kaohsiung Harbor prior
to the transshipment operation on Friday night. The containers were
then put in container trailers for shipment to the FPG's plant in
Jenwu, Kaohsiung. The FPG mobilized 60 trailers for the operation.</P>
      <P>The last of the sludge containers arrived at Jenwu at about 5:20
a.m. on Saturday to the great relief of the government and local
environmental officials who were monitoring the whole process.</P>
      <P>Environmental officials from Kaohsiung County are now
commissioning experts to review the FPG's plan to burn the toxic
waste under a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The FPG has imported a vacuum heat processor from the United
States and will assemble it by July 3. When its "burn-on-trial-basis"
plan passes, it will begin burning the sludge on a trial basis. If
the results of the trial are approved by government experts, the FPG
will then begin to handle all the sludge.</P>
      <P>The sludge, produced by the Jenwu plant, was first shipped to the
southern coastal town of Sihanoukville, Cambodia in late 1998,
causing panic among the local people and great deal concern among
environmentalists.</P>
      <P>The outcry forced the FPG to later apologize to Cambodia and ship
the industrial toxic waste back to Kaohsiung Harbor in April, 1999.
The sludge was allowed to be stored at the Kaohsiung pier on the
condition that it would later be shipped to a third destination.</P>
      <P>But as the FPG's consultations with other nations concerning
storage of the sludge were unsuccessful, the FPG applied to send the
waste back to the original plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CONCERNED ABOUT PENTAGON REPORT: MND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government is very
concerned about a US Pentagon report on Beijing's military power and
strategy released on Friday, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MND, however, refrained from making any comments on the
latest Pentagon assessment on mainland China's military build-up
required by the US Congress.</P>
      <P>"The ROC is not in a position to comment on the report because
it is the US government's internal evaluation," said an MND official
who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official further said the MND attaches great importance to
the Pentagon report and will carefully study it after obtaining a
full original copy.</P>
      <P>"We'll then re-evaluate and forecast the possible development in
the Taiwan Strait and adjust our defense policy as well as military
build-up and deployment plans to cope with the new situation," the
official said.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon report, the mainland Chinese military
is increasing the number of short-range missiles aimed at Taiwan as
it focuses military preparations on a possible clash with Taiwan
involving the United States.</P>
      <P>The report neither predicts a mainland attempt to win control of
Taiwan by force nor dismisses the possibility. But it says mainland
China's army is buying the kinds of weapons that could be used in a
pre-emptive strike. These include cruise missiles and ballistic
missiles of longer ranges and greater accuracy.</P>
      <P>"The warning time for missile launches most likely will decrease
as (mainland) China expands its missile force opposite Taiwan," the
Pentagon report said.</P>
      <P>The report further says mainland China is strengthening its
military on a broad front but, despite having a far larger armed
force, would still face "significant shortcomings" in a conflict with
Taiwan, even a decade from now.</P>
      <P>Over the coming five years, the report says, the 2.4
million-strong mainland Chinese army will have "only a limited
capability" to conduct offensive operations against Taiwan in a way
that effectively combines air, sea and land forces, adding that
mainland China's naval, air and ground troops are not fully
integrated into a cohesive combat force.</P>
      <P>In the longer term -- in the 2010-to-2020 period, the report
says, mainland China could gain a greater edge over Taiwan in both
the quality and quantity of its military forces. At that point, the
report notes, Taiwan's success in deterring Beijing's aggression will
depend on its ability to acquire and operate modern arms and
technology.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Pentagon report, a senior military officer,
who demanded anonymity, said the ROC has long singled out 2005 as a
critical period for military balance between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We have long planned to realize the goal of building up a
new-generation, high-tech defense force, completing sweeping military
organizational and administrative reforms and cultivating competent
military personnel before 2005," the officer said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Premier Tang Fei, a
four-star-general-turned-politician, already drafted a
forward-looking military development plan during his stint as
defense minister.</P>
      <P>"The plan was based on the prediction that if mainland China
maintains its current pace in military build-up while Taiwan drags
its foot on military modernization and defense technology
development, then mainland China would gradually win supremacy in
the Taiwan Strait from 2005," the officer noted.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA during his stint as defense minister,
Tang said cross-strait military balance is a dynamic development. If
Taiwan fails to upgrade defense capabilities, overhaul military
structure and step up personnel training, Tang warned, mainland China
would gain military supremacy even before 2005.</P>
      <P>Tang also stressed the importance of military "software"
upgrading, namely upgrading troop training and overall defense system
and mechanism. "For instance, establishing an efficient command,
control, communications , intelligence, surveillance and search
mechanism is far more important than acquiring advanced hardware," he
noted.</P>
      <P>He further said Taiwan must seek continued progress in defense
capabilities in order to maintain military balance in the Taiwan
Strait and to ensure parity in cross-strait exchanges and
negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN SHOULD MAINTAIN STRATEGIC STATUS IN CROSS-STRAIT INTERACTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  June 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The frontline island of Kinmen should take
advantage of the planned opening of direct "mini three links" to
establish an environment conducive to its sustainable development, a
senior economic planning official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), made the call at a seminar
on Kinmen's capability to cope with the planned opening of direct
"mini three links" between Kinmen and mainland China's southeastern
coastal cities.</P>
      <P>Ho led a delegation of officials from the CEPD, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and other
relevant government agencies to this frontline island early in
the morning to meet with Kinmen County government officials and
elected representatives on the island's development prospects.</P>
      <P>Ho said the planned opening of direct "mini three links" on an
experimental basis in line with the newly passed Offshore Islands
Development Act is mainly aimed at offering more development
opportunities for Taiwan's outlying islands, such as Kinmen, Matsu
and Penghu. Both Kinmen and Matsu are Taiwan's defense outposts and
lie closer to southeastern mainland coast than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ho pointed out that the Kinmen County Government should not
regard the planned opening of direct "mini three links" between the
island and mainland China's coastal cities as an ultimate policy
goal, but should rather treat it as one of the strategies to help
boost the island's overall development and to maintain its strategic
status in cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>Ho said the new ROC government will honor its promise to
complete a comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility of opening
direct trade, postal and transportation links between Taiwan's
outlying islands and mainland China's coastal cities, commonly known
as "mini three links," within three months and to finalize a
blueprint for implementing the new "open doors" policy in another
three months.</P>
      <P>In the process, Ho said, the Cabinet's inter-ministerial
planning task force will maintain close contact with Kinmen
authorities to ensure that its proposals meet local demands.</P>
      <P>Ho suggested that the Kinmen County Government prepare a
priority list of software and hardware construction projects needed
for implementing the "mini three links" policy.</P>
      <P>According to a list drafted by the Kinmen County Government, a
number of infrastructure construction projects must be launched in
preparation for the opening of direct "mini three links" with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Those projects include improving Kinmen's airport facilities,
expanding existing ports, building a new commercial port, adjusting
the island's urban development plan, easing restrictions on
construction in some military regions, expanding power generation
capacity, building new oil storage tanks, establishing firefighting,
medical service, anti-crime, as well as fauna and flora quarantine
and inspection systems.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai said the county
government will form a special task force, composed of officials,
scholars and industry executives, to work out a detailed list of
needed infrastructure construction projects. "We will come up with a
comprehensive report on various development projects in
one-and-a-half months," he added.</P>

      <P>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC) Vice Chairman J. C. Chen, along with a legislative delegation
led by Legislative Yuan Vice President Yao Eng-chi, flew into San
Francisco on Friday for a visit to local Chinese communities.</P>
      <P>Speaking upon arrival at the airport, Chen said he had brought a
letter from OCAC chairwoman Chang Fu-mei and would deliver it to the
Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in San Francisco,
inviting local Chinese community leaders to visit Taiwan and asking
for their forgiveness for some remarks made by Chang early last
month.</P>
      <P>Chang, the new OCAC chairwoman in the Democratic Progressive
Party-led government inaugurated on May 20, said in early May that
traditional overseas Chinese communities rank third on her list when
she works out plans for offering assistance to Chinese people living
abroad.</P>
      <P>Chang's comments stirred up strong protests and grave concerns
among century-old Chinese communities in San Francisco over the new
ROC government's approach to cross-Taiwan Strait issues. In a protest
against Chang's remarks, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent
Association recently turned down the OCAC's invitation to visit
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is scheduled to meet with local Chinese community
leaders on Saturday, said he will personally deliver Chang's letter
to those representatives and expressed his hope that all
misunderstandings would be cleared up.</P>
      <P>While condemning the OCAC chairwoman's "inappropriate" and
"misguided" remarks that classified overseas Chinese people into
various categories, Yao said that Chang should be forgiven now that
she has apologized for the improper comments.</P>

      <P>Macedonia is a very important diplomatic
partner of the Republic of China, and Macedonian Prime Minister
Ljubco Georgievski backs Taipei's efforts to join world bodies, ROC
Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Georgievski's support for the ROC to take part in international
organizations will have a far-reaching impact on bilateral ties
between Taipei and Skopje, Tien said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that his current visit to Macedonia is not just a
superficial trip, Tien said the ROC's formal diplomatic relationship
with Macedonia carries a great deal of strategic importance that will
help the ROC explore its relations with other countries in the
Balkans.</P>
      <P>The ROC government will therefore undoubtedly do its best to
protect its ties with Macedonia and become familiar with the major
political figures in the country, Tien commented.</P>
      <P>Tien said he has met with all the pro-ROC Macedonian officials
during this trip and has discussed issues of mutual concern with
them. He said he hopes that his talks with these Macedonian officials
will help them understand the benefits of maintaining diplomatic
links with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister, however, did not disclose whether he had
been able to meet Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski, saying only
that he had met with those whom he had wished to meet. He also failed
to confirm media reports on whether he had been able to deliver a
letter from President Chen Shui-bian to his Macedonian counterpart.</P>
      <P>ROC envoy Peter Cheng has so far not been able to submit his

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK SHOULD DICTATE STRAIT ISSUES: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The global strategic framework should
dictate how Taiwan Strait issues are considered and resolved,
according to Chiou I-Jen, Deputy Secretary General of the ROC
National Security Council.</P>
      <P>Chiou told industry leaders, officials, and scholars at a local
summit on the outlook of cross-strait relations on Sunday that
relations between Beijing and Taipei clearly influence the entire
world.</P>
      <P>Chiou noted that Chien Fu, president of the Control Yuan, the
highest watchdog body in this country, once declared during his term
as foreign minister that "the relations between Taiwan and mainland
China should dictate Taiwan's relations with other foreign
countries."</P>
      <P>However, Chiou went on to say that Taiwan's domestic and
diplomatic situations are different now, and that it should turn to
the global strategic framework for guidelines to resolve cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>Chiou cited military, foreign affairs, economic, social, and
political reasons to back up his claim.</P>
      <P>Militarily, Chiou said that Beijing's arms build-up is clearly
aimed at the United States, because Beijing's military preparations
have surpassed what is required to settle the "Taiwan issue."</P>
      <P>Chiou noted that Beijing regards the United States as a strategic
target and a major factor in the resolution of the Taiwan issue. He
said that this shows Beijing looks at cross-strait issues from the
broader perspective of the global strategic framework.</P>
      <P>In foreign affairs, Chiou said that Beijing's diplomatic
breakthroughs have not been entirely aimed at limiting Taiwan's space
in the international community. For example, he said that mainland
China's efforts to develop better relations with Russia was meant to
counter the strength of the United States -- not Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiou claimed that Beijing's proactive involvement in the
historic summit between the two Korean leaders suggests a different
kind of strategic thinking from the past, because unification of the
Koreas could prompt US forces to withdraw from the Korean Peninsula.
He added that US forces may even withdraw from the Ryukyus as well,
decreasing the need for a theater missile defense system in the
region.</P>
      <P>From the economic and social perspectives, Chiou said that
allowing mainland China to join the World Trade Organization (WTO)
and the US government decision to grant permanent normal trade
relations (PNTR) status to the mainland are both ways to bring
Beijing into the international norm.</P>
      <P>The possibility of mainland China peacefully embracing democracy
can be realized only through its participation in the globalization
of trade, which is good for both Beijing and cross-strait relations,
Chiou added.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that mainland China is inconsistent in its definition
of the "one China principle," citing that the mainland stresses the
possibility of equality when negotiating with Taiwan, but then
insists on one China being the "People's Republic of China" on the
international stage. Taiwan cannot begin a new round of negotiations
with mainland China until Beijing's definition of "one China" is
clear, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiou summed up by noting that if cross-strait negotiations
cannot rely on "package deals," then a breakthrough must come from a
single issue, which he said should be trade. However, he repeated
that the breakthrough can only happen when cross-strait issues are
considered under the global strategic framework.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG RETURNS FROM US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the newly-formed
People First Party (PFP), said on Sunday that he would not rule out
the possibility of meeting with President Chen Shui-bian and leaders
of other political parties to exchange views on matters of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks upon his arrival at CKS International
Airport from the United States early Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday's proposal by President Chen Shui-bian to invite the
leaders of major political parties to the Presidential Office for
consultation, Soong said he would meet with President Chen as long as
it helps solve the major problems of the nation.</P>
      <P>But as the president has had a hectic schedule since his
inauguration on May 20, Soong said he is not certain that Chen will
have time for such a meeting.</P>
      <P>Soong also said that many PFP members used to be members of the
Kuomintang (KMT), but left the KMT because past leaders of the
centenarian party had turned their backs on the will of the people.
If the KMT can utilize new thinking and a new approach, he is not
ruling out the possibility of a meeting with KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
he added.</P>
      <P>Soong was a KMT heavyweight before splitting from the party to
run on his own in the March 18 presidential election, which saw the
end of the KMT's 50-year rule over Taiwan and the election of the
Democratic Progressive Party. Soong finished with 36.8 percent of the
vote, second to Chen Shui-bian's tally of 39.3 percent, but far ahead
of Lien's 23.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Soong and his supporters formed the PFP only after the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong also criticized the six constitutional reforms that have
been implemented over the years, which he said were orchestrated by
only a few people. He said that the constitution has to be amended to
strengthen the division of political party operations from those of
the central government.</P>
      <P>The PFP will "stick to its ideals," Soong stressed, adding that
the PFP will present the best available candidates in the major
legislative elections next year. He said that he has no plans to run
in the election himself.</P>
      <P>Soong said that because he had been overseas for some time, he
will need to learn more about the current domestic situation. "Many
things are not my own decision now," he said, adding that he will
have to consult with other officials within his party on various
issues.</P>
      <P>The PFP caucus in the Legislative Yuan is planning to invite
Soong to attend a caucus meeting on Tuesday. Observers have noted
that there are divisions within the party itself over whether Soong
should meet with Lien, or cooperate with the KMT in elections.</P>
      <P>Soong, who departed for the US on May 18, said the trip was to
receive an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Maryland
and that he had used the chance to meet with overseas Chinese, US
officials and scholars to exchange views on current events in Taiwan
and cross-strait relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NP LEGISLATOR WILL LEAVE FOR MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta of the New Party
will leave for the mainland on Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that she has long been concerned with the interests of
Taiwan businessmen in the mainland, and decided to accept
the invitation from Taiwan firms operating in Shenzhen and Tongguan
of Guangdong province to attend a meeting there.</P>
      <P>Company officials had also asked her to invite other legislators,
Hsieh said. She therefore invited Hsu Jung-shu and Chou Ching-yu of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, but she is not sure if they
will be able to make the trip.</P>
      <P>She said that her main concern during the trip will be the
interests of Taiwan firms with mainland operations, and that she will
stay only around Shenzhen and Tongguan.</P>
      <P>Although she has not prepared to meet with high-ranking officials
from the mainland, she expects high-ranking officials will attend the
meeting, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a delegation of NP legislators is scheduled to visit
the mainland next month to promote a reconciliation between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Elmer Feng, NP legislative whip, said that the delegation
originally planned to visit the mainland in late June, but delayed
the trip till July 9 because mainland China needed more time to sort
out its response to the goodwill gestures of President Chen Shui-bian
in his recent press conference.</P>
      <P>Feng said that the delegation had therefore delayed its trip
until July 9, and that he will first go to the mainland to hammer out
a schedule for the trip.</P>
      <P>High-ranking cross-strait exchanges were disrupted after former
President Lee Teng-hui's July 1999 statement on "special
state-to-state" cross-strait relations. Bilateral relations were
further chilled by the March 18 election of President Chen of the
pro-Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG CITY MAYOR ELECTED DPP CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh was
elected as chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a press conference at the DPP headquarters in Taipei, DPP
outgoing chairman Lin Yi-hsiung announced Hsieh's victory.</P>
      <P>Lin praised Hsieh's performance during career as a public
servant, and urged party members to rally behind Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Since Hsieh was the only candidate in the race and there is no
minimum requirement for votes under the party's "first past the post"
election system, his victory was assured before the vote actually
took place. Under the party's election rules, the candidate with the
most votes wins the election, regardless of the percentage of votes
that he or she garners.</P>
      <P>As a result, not very many of the party's 143,000 members
bothered to show up at the 50 ballot booths around the island.
Today's turnout was about 16,000, or 11 percent of the party's
143,000 members. Hsieh garnered 98 percent of Sunday's votes.</P>
      <P>Even President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu --
both DPP members -- were absent from the voting, not to mention other
prominent party officials.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed understanding for Chen's absence, noting that
Chen has publicly declared that he will not engage in party business,
in order to keep his distance from party politics after his victory
in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He took pains to quell speculation that Chen didn't favor his
candidacy, saying that Chen's endorsement for his bid is quiet but
certain.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun is one of the few DPP heavyweights to
cast a vote in Taipei on Sunday. He played down the significance of
Taipei's turnout of less than 5 percent, saying that Hsieh is the
perfect choice for the job. He added that the Kaohsiung mayor's
unmatched qualifications for party leadership can partly explain the
absence of other contestants in the race and the low turnout in the
vote.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed confidence in his leadership despite the low
turnout in the election, saying that he would lead the party behind
President Chen's administration. He expressed his hope that the
popularity of Chen's administration will rub off on the party in
turn, and broaden the DPP's grassroots power base.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PREMIER URGES OPEN THINKING TO RESOLVE STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Sunday said
that Taiwan Strait issues should be viewed from an international
perspective and that cross-strait relations should be handled through
an open approach that does not limit possible developments.</P>
      <P>Yu told industry leaders, government officials, and scholars at a
local summit on cross-strait relations that Beijing's "zero sum"
approach can not win the approval of the public in Taiwan, and the
most important factor in the development of cross-strait relations is
the support of the people.</P>
      <P>Yu said that cross-strait relations should be resolved through
new thinking and a practical attitude in the face of the situation
facing Taiwan after the inauguration of a new administration.</P>
      <P>Yu urged leaders from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to look at
cross-strait affairs from an international perspective. He said that
the gradual acceptance of the concept of a global village makes it
necessary for any country's relations with another country to be
developed under an equal and mutually beneficial foundation.</P>
      <P>Yu went on to say that freedom, democracy, human rights, peace,
and environmental protection are not contained by national
boundaries, but rather are universal values. He added that it would
be impractical and against global trends if the leaders from both
sides of the strait ignore the importance of peace, the development
of democracy, the differences in their political systems, and the
protection of human rights.</P>
      <P>Before the two Germanies were unified, 122 countries recognized
both countries, Yu said. The fact that over a hundred countries
currently recognize both North and South Korea has not adversely
affected the two nations' pursuit of unification, he added, again
urging leaders to think and act under the mainstream framework of
international politics.</P>
      <P>Yu also advocated an open approach to cross-strait relations
where the leaders should avoid being trapped by predetermined
conditions. The only way to breakthrough the impasse is to adopt an
open attitude, he said.</P>
      <P>Yu added that from now on, Taiwan will not shun any positive
trend in cross-strait relations, will not eschew any manner of
bilateral contacts, will not insist on any prerequisites or
preconditions to a cross-strait dialogue, and will not limit itself
to any single framework.</P>
      <P>Yu said that this open approach shows the greatest flexibility in
the development of cross-strait relations and leaves the most room
for future bilateral interactions. He added that the people of the
Republic of China will judge and decide.</P>
      <P>Yu said that economic cooperation can open up possibilities for
cross-strait relations, and noted that economic exchanges have
already yielded fruitful results, despite the fact that many
political differences still cannot be resolved on the current stage.</P>
      <P>Yu summed up by saying that as long as both sides have the
sincerity to work together under a mutually beneficial foundation,
they will join the rule-setting World Trade Organization (WTO), and
create even more opportunities and interactions to help ease or
dilute their political entanglements and confrontations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEW WITH LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Legislative Yuan
President Wang Chin-pyng talked about the management of legislative
affairs in the ROC's parliament, where the Kuomintang (KMT) continues
to maintain a majority, in an interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was recently appointed as one of the five KMT vice
chairmen, also voiced his views on future cooperation between the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP), which is headed by former KMT
Secretary-General James Soong. The following is the full text of the
interview:</P>
      <P>Q 1: Congratulations on your election as a KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>A: I assumed the post thanks to KMT Chairman Lien Chan's support.
This also reflects the increase in the KMT Legislative Yuan caucus'
influence on party policy-making as more legislators have joined the
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Q 2: There is a worry that the newly-formed DPP government will
turn out to be a weak government as the KMT maintains a majority in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A: The DPP has won the presidency, but it controls less than
one-third of the seats in the Legislative Yuan, with two-thirds of
the seats in the hands of the KMT, the PFP, the New Party and
non-partisans. As a result, the power of the Executive Yuan (Cabinet)
is weakened.</P>
      <P>But the Cabinet will not become weak if it works well with the
DPP caucus in the parliament to handle relevant matters soundly
because the parliament has established the principle of handling
important matters through negotiations between the ruling and
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>In other words, all bills, procedural matters, and important
issues will be decided through negotiations chaired by the
Legislative Yuan president before they are submitted to the plenary
session for deliberation. Over more than the past year, this method
has greatly increased the passage rate of bills.</P>
      <P>The only case so far that has indicated that the Cabinet's power
is weak and has demonstrated that the DPP is a minority ruling party
was the parliament's passage of a KMT-engineered bill on June 16 over
an amendment to the Labor Standards Law. This reversed a DPP-led
Cabinet bill on cutting the working hours per week for the private
sector.</P>
      <P>It was not the KMT that had no intention of negotiating with the
DPP over the bill, but in fact the Cabinet which seemed to be unaware
of the established procedural interaction between the Executive Yuan
and Legislative Yuan. It therefore announced beforehand that the
Cabinet version would be the final version without negotiating with
the opposition or submitting a revision before the plenary session.
As a result, the KMT bill was passed with almost no opposition.</P>
      <P>Q: What will be the future mechanism for negotiations between the
minority ruling government and the majority opposition?</P>
      <P>A: The government must coordinate with the DPP's legislative
members during the policy-making process and should communicate with
the opposition parties to exchange views after bills are sent to the
parliament.</P>
      <P>The government should act to seek support through negotiations
with the opposition. The DPP caucus should also ask the president or
vice president of the Legislative Yuan to call for negotiations with
the opposition.</P>
      <P>Negotiations are the best method for the Cabinet and the minority
DPP in the Legislative Yuan because they are participated in by an
equal number of representatives from each party, usually two to
three. During the negotiations, the views of the minor parties are
respected and they can influence the final outcome. This is the most
precious merit of the present mechanism of negotiations between the
ruling and opposition parties. (More)</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEW WITH LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: Will deliberations on the government budget be conducted using
this formula?</P>
      <P>A: When the KMT was the ruling party and had a majority in the
Legislative Yuan in the past, it respected the opposition parties.
Now the DPP is a minority ruling party and therefore should further
respect the opposition and cooperate with it.</P>
      <P>In the past, no matter how the committees made cuts in the
budget, the Legislative Yuan president would always call a meeting of
the caucuses of all the parties to review the whole budget situation
before the plenary session, so as to negotiate the amount to be
slashed and to decide the items to be affected. That proved to be an
effective way to complete deliberations on the budget and also the
way that was most advantageous to the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Like the past practice, the ruling and opposition parties may
conduct negotiations this year to decide the total amount to be cut
from the budget proposal.</P>
      <P>Then the caucuses of all the parties will conduct further
negotiations under the chairmanship of the Legislative Yuan president
to decide the details of budget cuts or increases for the various
ministries and agencies.</P>
      <P>Such a traditional practice of budget deliberations is the most
favorable way for the Cabinet. Otherwise, it will be a disastrous
situation for various ministries and agencies.</P>
      <P>Q: Some fear that under the present situation, the parliament
will be influenced by both clean and unclean forces, and there is a
move to push for the formation of a supra-party majority alliance in
the parliament.</P>
      <P>A: Is it possible to push for such a move? President Chen
Shui-bian of the DPP knows well that it is impossible. Such a move
would only bring about a greater boycott.</P>
      <P>So far, the only case that led to some calls for a boycott was
the bill on cutting working hours, but even the DPP admitted that it
was the government's fault for failing to respect legislative power.</P>
      <P>All other matters have been handled smoothly, such as the issue
of Premier Tang Fei's health, the postponement of the interpellation
session, and the matter of direct cross-Taiwan Strait trade, postal,
and communication links. In fact, there is no need to form a
so-called majority alliance. (More)</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEW WITH LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT (3)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  25  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: How do you draw a neutral distinction between being a vice
chairman of the Kuomintang and the Legislative Yuan's president?</P>
      <P>A: Although I am a vice chairman of the Kuomintang and have taken
part in the party's policy-making for some time, the borderline is
quite clear: I am the Legislative Yuan's president for the nation and
for all its people, not just for the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>As a parliament president, I do not allow my status to be limited
to only a KMT leader. In order to get the job done smoothly in the
Legislative Yuan, I must play the role of coordinator, because no
matter who is in charge of ruling the country, we must operate
through coordination between ruling and opposition parties to work
toward the direction which best serves and benefits the nation.</P>
      <P>Q. Concerning President Chen Shui-bian's promised "3-3-3" welfare
project, will there be any changes due to the current political
situation in the Legislative Yuan?</P>
      <P>A: The contents of the "3-3-3" project still remain to be decided
by both the ruling and opposition parties themselves. However,
because of the fierce inter-party competition for scarce national
finance resources, we should consider whether it is really necessary
to carry out the project at all. I believe this is the basic issue
that we should discuss now, to find out whether it is necessary or
justified.</P>
      <P>As for interaction between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative
Yuan, due to lack of experience on the part of both the Executive
Yuan and the Democratic Progressive Party as a new ruling party, as
well as the health condition of Premier Tang Fei, I consider this to
be a period of adaptation and searching for new approaches.</P>
      <P>A few days before, I communicated with Premier Tang. They now
know where the problem lies, and I believe they are sparing no
efforts to improve themselves.</P>
      <P>Q: Under the present national framework and political
environment, how would you characterize the interaction between the
president and the Legislative Yuan?</P>
      <P>A: President Chen has described the present political system as
"a dual-leadership system, with control exercised by the president
and the premier, but somewhat leaning toward the presidential
system." I believe there are still many people in the legislature
with different views on the issue.</P>
      <P>Under our current system, the premier is named by the president
but is under the supervision of the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the
president is also indirectly supervised by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Legislative Yuan may propose to remove the
president or vice president from their offices. On the other hand,
the president may dissolve the Legislative Yuan under certain
conditions. Therefore, the relations between the president and the
Legislative Yuan can be described as indirect and mutually
supervisory.</P>
      <P>The only direct interaction between the two sides is the
president's state of the nation report, but whether to listen to the
report or not is still the decision of the Legislative Yuan. Recently
a member of the Legislative Yuan had considered a proposal to remove
the vice president from her office, proving that the legislature is
in a stronger position in interacting with the president. (More)</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERVIEW WITH LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT (4)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  25  (CNA)
(By Fang Hsu, Ben Wu &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: As a vice chairman of the Kuomintang, what do you expect of
the party's reforms and future development?</P>
      <P>A: The extraordinary session of the KMT's 15th National Congress
passed a party reform package, including changes to the KMT's
organizational structure and operations as well as measures to
improve its image among voters. Therefore, quick action must be taken
to deal with the KMT's assets in a transparent, efficient and
trustworthy manner. In that way, I believe the party structure will
be changed for the better, which will also improve its image in
society.</P>
      <P>Of course, the most important thing is to understand popular
opinion and to maintain contact with the people. The establishment of
a think tank, improving methods by which the party conducts public
opinion surveys, and the use of more experienced professionals will
allow the KMT to best realize and serve the needs of the people, and
to enjoy a dominant position in the formulation of public policy.</P>
      <P>I have stressed earlier that the KMT should be dominant in policy
formulation and should take the initiative in making laws. Otherwise,
the KMT's superior numbers in the legislature will be wasted.</P>
      <P>Q: How do you assess the possibility of cooperation between the
KMT and the newly-formed People First Party (PFP)?</P>
      <P>A: Cooperation between the KMT and PFP is quite natural and an
inevitable trend for the future, but when will be the right time for
cooperation still remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>Naturally, this is my personal feeling. But after all, many PFP
members used to be members of the KMT, and some level of friendship
must still exist. Both the KMT and PFP are opposition parties now,
and they must work together in order to survive.</P>
      <P>Q: How do you assess the voice of some party members that expect
party chairman Lien Chan to run for legislator?</P>
      <P>A: I think it would be proper for Lien Chan to run for a seat in
the legislature that is reserved for a national constituency.</P>
      <P>I don't think it would be proper for Lien to run in regional
elections. After all, the party chairman is a former vice president
and an important political figure who may run in the next
presidential election. Therefore, if Lien enters the local elections,
it would be far from ideal for him to win by a slim margin. On the
other hand, too many votes for him would affect the chances of other
KMT candidates in the same constituency.</P>
      <P>But developments will depend upon his own wishes and his personal
assessments. If he wishes to come to the Legislative Yuan, it is
suitable, and I look forward to his success.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALK OF COOPERATION BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITION PARTIES SURFACES AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of cooperation between the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the newly-formed People First Party (PFP) has
again surfaced in Taipei amid the return PFP Chairman James Soong
from the United States on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng predicted on Sunday that
the two parties will join hands in county and city elections next
year.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is one of five KMT vice chairmen, said in an interview
with CNA that the two parties have no choice but to work together
because maintaining their division would mean defeat for both of
them, as in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The traditional support base of the KMT was split between KMT
candidate Lien Chan and PFP head James Soong in the presidential
election. As a result, President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic
Progressive Party won the election with 39 percent of the vote, with
Lien and Soong splitting a combined tally of almost 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP is a splinter party of the KMT and there are
common views among senior officials of both parties, Wang asserted
that political reality will force the two parties to collaborate.</P>
      <P>Although there are voices among KMT rank-and-file opposed to
cooperating with Soong, the interests of the party should take
precedence over personal feuds and will leave the KMT with no other
option, the KMT official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Soong have played down
the prospects of cooperation between their parties.</P>
      <P>In a courtesy meeting with KMT elder statesman Chiu Chuan-huan on
Friday, Lien was evasive on the question of whether he and Soong
could heal the rift between them and work together again.</P>
      <P>Soong, a former KMT secretary general, was kicked out by the
party because of his bid for president without party approval.
Election rhetoric between the two former comrades was even more
bitter than their competition with the DPP's Chen, with both Lien and
Soong reserving their strongest attacks for each other.</P>
      <P>Soong's answer to the same question was more subtle. Speaking
with reporters at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, where he
arrived earlier Sunday morning, the PFP chairman said that the issue
is up to the PFP members to decide, and not just himself.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi has said the PFP will await
developments before deciding whether it will be able to work with the
KMT in next year's election.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a KMT heavyweight, greeted the
question cautiously, saying that it is too early to predict that the
two parties will be able to unite in any election or present an
united front on political issues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULES ON MAINLAND VISITS NEED TO BE REVIEWED: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Existing regulations governing visits to
mainland China by former Republic of China officials who were in
charge of affairs related to intelligence or national security need
to be reviewed, said Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chair Tsai
Ing-wen on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said there is certainly a "gap" between the regulations and
actual execution which has led to irregularities and improper
behavior.</P>
      <P>She added that the MAC, the highest government agency responsible
for formulating mainland China policy and related policies, will work
to "seal the gap up."</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in response to reports regarding a visit to
mainland China by Maj. Gen. Pan Shi-hsien, director of the Personnel
Department of National Security Bureau (NSB), who retired recently.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Pan retired from the NSB post on June 1
and went to Guangdong Province in mainland China with his wife on
June 4.</P>
      <P>His visit apparently violated amended laws promulgated in March
governing Taiwanese residents' visits to the mainland and related
affairs, said Kuomintang Legislator Chen Jung-sheng, who disclosed
Pan's mainland visit at the Legislative session last Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the newly promulgated laws, retired and former
intelligence officials and those who were in charge of affairs
related to national security are prohibited from traveling to
mainland China in the first three years after their retirement or
leave. If there is a precise need for them to go to the mainland
during the first three years of retirement, they have to file for
formal approval from their former authorities.</P>
      <P>The laws also state that once the intelligence or national
security official retires, the Bureau of Entry and Exit must be
notified of the official's retirement within two weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Pan left Taiwan for Guangdong before
the Bureau of Entry and Exit received notification about his
retirement from the NSB. Pan was probably allowed to exit the country
to Hong Kong in his capacity as an ordinary tourist.</P>
      <P>NSB Director Ting Yu-chou said he feels regret over the incident
and, as Pan's former boss, urged Pan to return to Taiwan as quickly
as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia was among the top six countries
within the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development in terms
of economic growth in the 1990s, according to Federal Treasurer Peter
Costello.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday quoted Costello as saying
that Australia, the United States, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands,
and Norway performed much better than other OECD countries.</P>
      <P>"The (OECD) report's preliminary findings ... note that while
some features of a new economy are evident, old economy relationships
remain important in shaping growth everywhere," he told the Sydney
Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>Costello, who is in Paris to chair the OECD ministerial council
meeting, said "identifying the keys to strong growth, the OECD report
endorses the priority the Australian government has given to pursuing
sound macro-economic policies and a comprehensive structural reform
agenda."</P>
      <P>He said the OECD noted that countries which improved growth over
the 1990s not only pursued sound structural policies, but generally
experienced buoyant cyclical conditions, low inflation and improving
public budgets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ONE-THIRD OF MANUFACTURERS FEEL GOOD ABOUT PROSPECTS: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly one-third of Taiwan's manufacturers
expect that the economy will take a turn for the better over the next
six months, while about half of them believe the economy will remain
at the present level, the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>In its monthly report on the country's business trend in May, the
private economics think-tank's latest survey of manufacturers
islandwide showed that 32.2 percent of the respondents expect the
economy to take a turn for the better and 50 percent expect the
economy to at least remain at the present level, while only 17
percent foresee a possible slowdown over the next six months.</P>
      <P>The survey found that precision instrument manufacturing,
property insurance, and transportation and warehousing experienced
better business in May and expect business to continue to boom over
the next half year.</P>
      <P>Industries whose business remained the same in May but which
expect turnover to increase over the next six months include food
processing, synthetic fiber, weaving and fabric, garments, basic
steel processing, telecommunications materials, import-export trade,
retailing, wholesaling, restaurants and travel, and life insurance,
the TIER survey found.</P>
      <P>However, the TIER researchers said, in a similar survey of local
manufacturers conducted in April, 35.4 percent of respondents said
they expected the economy to improve, compared with 32.2 percent in
May. The number of respondents who think the economy's performance
will remain unchanged was 51 percent in April, compared with 50
percent in May.</P>
      <P>The number of respondents who feel the economy will take a turn
for the worse over the next six months was 17.7 percent in May, while
only 13.6 percent in April, according to the TIER.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TIER researchers said, the Central Bank of China (CBC)
is presently under clear pressure from home and abroad to hike
interest levels.</P>
      <P>Pressed by rising interests rates in international markets and
increasingly higher commodity prices at home, the CBC is widely
expected to have no choice but to raise interests rates in the months
ahead. But the increases are not expected to be too sharp, the
researchers estimated.</P>
      <P>TIER said neither higher interest rates nor the Taiwan currency's
exchange rate would adversely affect the local economy or two-way
trade in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>What the think-tank said it is really worried about is that the
recently-passed shortened workweek and rising domestic oil prices
will have an affect on manufacturers' costs and a consequential
impact on overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the researchers noted that the mainland Chinese summit
meeting scheduled to be held in Beidaihe in August will probably
trigger some changes in cross-strait relations and eventually affect
Taiwan's political and economic situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HIGHLIGHTS OF INTERPARTY TASK FORCE RULES UNVEILED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office unveiled key
points concerning the formation of an interparty committee on the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general to the President, told a
routine press conference that the new interparty committee will
pattern after the existing National Unification Council (NUC) and
enjoys a similar status.</P>
      <P>"The interparty committee will mainly act as an advisory task
force," Chang explained, adding: "Hopefully, the task force will help
President Chen Shui-bian integrate public opinion, forge national
consensus and formulate policy on the development of cross-strait
relations and safeguarding Taiwan Strait peace, as well as help
promote harmony among major ethnic groups."</P>
      <P>Chang said the Presidential Office has worked out regulations
governing the formation of the interparty committee, adding that Lee
Yuan-tseh, president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic
body, will serve as the group's convener.</P>
      <P>Chang said the convener can take part in meetings of the
National Security Council.</P>
      <P>Except for its convener, the interparty committee will comprise
21 to 29 members, including 11 to 13 representatives of major
domestic political parties, four to six academic representatives,
two to four industry representatives and three to five social
celebrities.</P>
      <P>According to the panel's organizational rules, its convener is
obliged to come up with a roster for President Chen to make formal
appointment. All members are expected to serve a two-year tenure.</P>
      <P>Lee, a co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for chemistry, is
scheduled to unveil the committee's roster and operational formula
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the organizational rules, the committee will meet once
every three months, but it can also hold extraordinary meetings if
the convener thinks that extra meetings are needed. The committee can
also hold extra meetings at the request of half of all members.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the inauguration of the new interparty committee
will mark the demise of the NUC, Chang said President Chen already
vowed in his May 20 inaugural speech that so long as Beijing has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, there will not be the issue
of abolishing the NUC and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>As for when the NUC will hold a plenary session again, Chang
said he hopes local society will give more time for the new
government, which was inaugurated slightly more than a month ago,
to make all necessary preparations.</P>
      <P>The NUC was inaugurated on Sept. 12, 1990 by then President Lee
Teng-hui to promote "phased" development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations in line with the National Unification Guidelines, also
unveiled during Lee's tenure.</P>
      <P>Chang said former President Lee formed the NUC in accordance
with the organizational law of the Presidential Office. "President
Chen follows the same example in setting up the interparty committee
on cross-strait affairs," he noted.</P>
      <P>Asked how the new government will respond if the new interparty
committee's suggestions contradict with the existing unification
guidelines, Chang said since the committee is basically an advisory
group, President Chen can make a final decision on whether the
committee's policy recommendations will be adopted or not.</P>

(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue to improve exchanges
with Japan through "multiple channels," Lo Fu-chen, Taipei's top
representative in Japan, said in Tokyo on Monday.</P>
      <P>Seeking "multiple-channel exchanges" and promoting substantive
relations with Japan are the primary goals of his mission in the East
Asian country, said Lo, who assumed his post in Tokyo nearly one
month ago.</P>
      <P>Commenting on results of Sunday's election of the 480-member
Lower House, Lo said the election reflects a passing of the torch
between generations in Japan's politics, as many old timers were
ousted while new faces emerged.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that the "single-seat small constituency" election
formula in Japan provides political novices with a fast track to the
stage of politics, a method that better reflects the people's will.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lo gave a thumbs-up to the supra-party Japan-ROC
Parliamentarian's Council for its invaluable and long-lasting
contributions to cementing bilateral relations between Japan and the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that Taiwan also greatly appreciates the Democratic
Party of Japan, which won a sizable 95 seats in Sunday's election,
for establishing the Japan-Taiwan Parliamentarian's Council right
after President's Chen Shui-bian's inauguration on May 20, to better
bolster bilateral relations between Japan and Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT NOT LIKELY TO IMPLEMENT NATIONAL  PENSION NEXT YEAR: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said on Monday that the
government has no policy on implementing the national pension scheme
next year, and the chances of carrying out such a scheme in 2001 are
slim.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks on the sidelines of a ceremony to
award medals in honor of people who have contributed to the anti-drug
campaign.</P>
      <P>Tang urged the public to pay attention to the issue of care for
the elderly in Taiwan, noting that because of advances in medical
care, the average life span of Taiwanese citizens has lately been
increasing every year.</P>
      <P>He said that by 2020, 20 percent of Taiwan's population will be
over 65, and by 2025, it is estimated that one in every 3.8 people in
the work force will have to support someone over the age of 65.</P>
      <P>He said that there are currently more than 1.6 million people
over 65 in Taiwan, half of whom are supported by their children. But
he added that there are problems resulting from a changing society,
noting that around 600 elderly citizens commit suicide each year.</P>
      <P>Tang said that the Executive Yuan pays great attention to the
issue of care for the elderly, pointing out that it proposed the
welfare subsidy in order to provide elderly citizens with a minimum
source of income so that they do not have to depend entirely on their
children.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya said that
although she is not sure when the government will begin
implementation of the national pension plan, she is confident that it
will be "a fulfillment of the expectation of the nation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INDUSTRY DELEGATION CALLS ON MAINLAND PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a visiting delegation of
Taipei industry officials said here on Monday that he will convey to
mainland China President Jiang Zemin the hope of Taiwan businesses
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can have "three direct links"
soon.</P>
      <P>K.C. Lin, chairman of the Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI), made the remarks prior to his meeting with Jiang
in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that after both sides of the Taiwan Strait join the
World Trade Organization, they will face steep competition in the
world. If there is no direct cross-strait trade, postal and transport
links, Taiwan businesses will run into difficulties that will be
detrimental to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He stressed that people on both sides of the Taiwan strait are
Chinese, adding that President Chen Shui-bian has consistently
displayed the sincerity needed to solve cross-strait problems since
his inauguration on May 20. Lin expressed confidence that both sides
can resume high-level talks soon.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that he would inform Jiang of the difficulties and
problems faced by Taiwan businessmen operating in the mainland, and
added that he would convey their wish to be able to invest in the
mainland without fearing for their lives and property.</P>
      <P>He will also make suggestions to the new Republic of China
government on cross-strait trade exchanges after he returns to
Taiwan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that cross-strait talks should be handled by the
respective governments, and that from the CNFI's point of view, its
responsibility will be to handle cross-strait trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>But he also said that for the sake of protecting Taiwanese
investors doing business in the mainland, the CNFI hopes that the
respective governments will resume talks as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He also said cross-strait relations will enter a new stage in the
next decade, and that the changes will depend on politics.
Nevertheless, he said that the CNFI is confident that trade across
the strait will only increase.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Beijing Mayor Liu Qi gave an introduction of the
investment environment in Beijing during his meeting with the CNFI
delegation Monday morning.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that his city excels in its biochemical and medical
technology. He said that Taiwanese businesses are welcome to invest
in Beijing's high-tech industries and that the city is willing to
provide additional incentives to investors.</P>
      <P>The CNFI delegation left Taiwan for the mainland on Sunday for an
eight-day visit. In addition to meeting with ranking mainalnd Chinese
officials in charge of Taiwan affairs, the delegates will also hold

    <HEADLINE>MILITARY POLLS FIND SERVICEMEN VERY WILLING TO ACCEPT NEW GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's military servicemen
are very willing to accept the country's new government, Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while fielding questions at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, opposition New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao
asked how the ROC's military servicemen reacted after Chen Shui-bian,
a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), won the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>In response, Wu said, the military conducted five to six
internal surveys between March 18 and May 20 with a view to
understanding armed forces' attitude toward Chen's administration.</P>
      <P>"The results of the series of poll show that nearly all officers
and men display a high degree of willingness to accept our new
government," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The minister also for the first time expressed the military's
anti-independence stance, saying the military firmly upholds the
country's constitution.</P>
      <P>According to the constitution, Wu said, the armed forces must
serve and safeguard the Republic of China. Moreover, he said, the
existing National Security Law also stipulates that all ROC
nationals are banned from forming groups or holding rallies to
promote secession of one part of the country from the rest.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the DPP should revise its pro-independence party
charter to make it easier for the ROC's servicemen to pledge loyalty
to the new president, also the top leader of the armed forces, Wu
said although the military should try to understand political
operations, it should not get involved in politics.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed whether the DPP would amend its party charter or not
is none of the military's business, adding that even if the DPP
does not revise its charter, the military servicemen will not suffer
"any spiritual disorder" or confusion simply because of the
inauguration of a DPP president.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said that judging from Chen's words and deeds since
winning the presidency, the president truly respects the ROC and
will defend the ROC's sovereignty, dignity and security.</P>
      <P>Chen said in his May 20 inaugural speech that so long as Beijing
has no intention to use force against Taiwan, his administration
will abide by a "five noes" policy which refers to no
declaration of Taiwan independence, no changes to the ROC's national
title, no inclusion of the "state-to-state" theory in the
conclusion, no holding of a plebiscite on Taiwan's future and no
abolishment of the existing National Unification Council and
National Unification Guidelines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER FAVORS TEMPORARY HALT TO FOREIGN LABOR FREEZE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
on Monday that he favors a temporary halt to a freeze on foreign
labor as a complementary measure to ease the impact of a shortened
workweek.</P>
      <P>In face of strong pressure from the Legislative Yuan, which has
already approved a mandatory 84-hour two-week work scheme, Lin said
he supports a plan to temporarily stop the freeze on hiring foreign
workers and adjust days off for national holidays as part of
government efforts to reduce the impact of a shortened workweek on
local industries.</P>
      <P>As a shorter workweek will noticeably increase production costs
for Taiwan's small businesses and traditional industries, Lin said
the above-mentioned two ideas are feasible ways to make up for the
shortened work scheme, especially when most of Taiwan's major rival
countries still maintain a 44-hour workweek.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, local labor-intensive sectors will be forced to shut
down or relocate overseas as a result of rising production costs, he
noted, adding that under the current circumstances, the government
will not consider lifting the minimum wage for workers to help ease
the burden for business owners.</P>
      <P>In a written report to the Legislative Yuan, the economic affairs
minister pointed out that the new 84-hour two-week work scheme, if
implemented in the beginning of next year, will add seven days off
for workers, bringing the total days off up to 110 days annually.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the new work scheme will add some NT$689
million in personnel management fees for the 12 state-run enterprises
and increase wage costs in the private sector 12 to 18 percent. This
will further squeeze profit margins for private-sector firms,
possibly forcing them to relocate to other countries, at a time when
Taiwan is to open up to foreign competition following its imminent
admission to the World Trade Organization, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawmaker Cheng Lung-shui of the opposition New Party
has also submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan demanding that
the government, starting early next year, reduce the number of
foreign workers in Taiwan by 15,000 each year until the ratio of
foreigners in the local labor market reaches 1.6 percent.</P>
      <P>A shortened workweek coupled with a cap of 1.6 percent on foreign
labor would mean that the number of foreign laborers in Taiwan must
be reduced from the current level of 290,000 to 160,000, Lin
elaborated, warning that labor-intensive private firms may not be
able to take the blow.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual
leader of Tibet, said that he plans to visit Taiwan again this year.
He made the remark during a fund-raising luncheon in Los Angeles on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech on "love , mercy and responsibility," the
Nobel Peace Prize laureate spoke highly of Taiwan's democracy, noting
that the March 18 presidential election will have far-reaching
effects.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said that the world has witnessed the remarkable
achievements of Taiwan in its economy, education and democracy, while
preserving and maintaining many aspects of traditional culture that
have been destroyed in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama refuted the claim that many so-called western
values can not be applied to oriental societies, saying that
democracy in Taiwan will serve as the best example.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama also said that the urgent task for Tibet is to
prevent its culture, natural environment and mental values from
continuing to be destroyed by the mainland.</P>
      <P>He also said that if Beijing is willing to help Tibet to improve
its material civilization and help solve its urgent problems, then
Tibet is willing to remain within the People's Republic of China. But
he added that Tibet would also need some level of real autonomy
within the framework.</P>
      <P>More than 700 officials from Taiwanese groups in southern
California took part in the luncheon, which raised US$300,000 for a
Tibet fund.</P>

      <P>A fleeing suspect assaulted and injured an
officer of the Kinmen General Coast Patrol Team on Monday during an
early morning operation to enforce the ban on illegal "small sum"
trading between mainland Chinese fishermen and Kinmen residents.</P>
      <P>Captain Wang Yu-chung suffered a fracture to his left shoulder
blade. Chuang Shui-sheng, 38, was detained for questioning and
charged with assault and interfering with official law enforcement
duties. Team members Chen Hung-wen and Chang Hung-chi also were
assaulted but suffered no major injuries.</P>
      <P>Wang and Captain Huang Teh-nan were on a routine patrol in the
Northern Kinmen coastal area when they discovered some 60 Kinmen
residents trading with fishermen from more than 10 beached mainland
Chinese fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>When Wang and Huang led their team to move in on the illegal
activity with the intention of investigating and seizing any
contraband goods, Chuang attacked Wang with a bamboo bench and
allegedly attempted to ram the patrol officers with a car.</P>
      <P>Huang fired a warning shot into the air with his 65K2 rifle and
brought the scene under temporary control. However, onlooking
residents shouted that patrol officers were firing at people and
began to verbally assault the team.</P>
      <P>Deputy team leader Jen Chien-hua arrived at the scene with 20
support personnel to re-establish order. The team transported Wang to
Kinmen County Hospital and arrested Chuang.</P>
      <P>Jen said that Huang's decision to fire a warning shot was an
effort to regain control of the situation, in which the team's safety
was threatened. He added that Huang followed regulations in firing
the shot, and the timing was not inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The bullets inside Huang's rifle were blanks, so Huang did not
fire at people, Jen said.</P>
      <P>Sources said that illegal "small sum" trading activities between

    <HEADLINE>'SECURITY NET' IS AIMED AT GAINING BALANCE WITH MAINLAND CHINA: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The idea of a "safety net" proposed by
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen is aimed at
working out a mechanism to obtain an economic balance with mainland
China, said MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Tsai hopes to achieve a policy that is
balanced and coordinated with the "no haste, be patient" policy on
Taiwan investment in the mainland and a bold "go west" proposal. Chen
said that balance could be achieved by setting up such a management
mechanism to deal with cross-strait trade after Taiwan and mainland
China join the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The reserved "no haste, be patient" policy governing Taiwan
investment in the mainland was imposed by the former Kuomintang
government in 1996 to limit political risks for Taiwan businesses
wishing to invest there.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied media reports that the MAC, in conjunction with
the Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, will stop using the "go haste, be patient" policy
within three months as part of the present government's efforts to
eliminate negative factors in Taiwan's economic exchanges with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China, said he has no knowledge of the source
of the reports, adding that no such issue was discussed in an MAC
meeting earlier the same day, as had been reported.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan needs a comprehensive economic
development strategy to boost the country's economic structure and
safeguard its security which should go beyond the options provided by
the "no haste" or "go west" policies.</P>
      <P>If a comprehensive "security net" which "does not block the
possibility of interaction and can protect our national security" can
be established in five years, Taiwan people would become "very
happy," Tsai was reported as saying in a seminar on Sunday.</P>

has decided to review within three months the government's
long-standing policy of curtailing trade with mainland China -- the
so-called "no haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a report in Monday's edition of local
evening newspaper, the China Times Express, that the MAC will revise
the current restrictions on trade with and investment in mainland
China and replace it with a policy called "stay rooted in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen said the MAC has no plans to revise the current policy, and
added that there would be no point in merely substituting one term

    <HEADLINE>`I HAVE NOT ADVOCATED INDEPENDENCE,' SAYS FORMER ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Huang Kuei-mei and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said in a recent interview that his opposition to the
Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification formula
should not be interpreted as "support for Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>In an interview with Japanese non-fiction writer Takashi Kakuma,
Lee said he opposed the "one country, two systems" scheme mainly
because mainland China is still not a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Once mainland China becomes a free, democratic country like
Taiwan, Lee said he would be very pleased to see Taipei and Beijing
discuss the "unification" issue.</P>
      <P>The interview was published in the latest issue of Japanese
weekly "Post" which hit newsstands on Monday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on mainland China's continued acceleration of naval
and missile deployment, Lee described himself as a peace-loving man.
"I have consistently thought that Taiwan and mainland China should
co-exist peacefully," he added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the former head of state said that if Taiwan is
invaded, he will never lose his determination to resist aggression.
"I believe that many Taiwan people share my point of view," he noted,
adding that if mainland China really attacks Taiwan, it will
certainly encounter a "destructive strike."</P>
      <P>Touching on an incident during his first public appearance after
stepping down when he was splashed with red ink by a retired military
prosecutor, Lee said there are still a few people in Taiwan who
identify themselves as "mainland Chinese" and who deem the
Kuomintang's defeat in the March 18 presidential election as the
"demise" of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"I think it's a flawed concept," Lee said. The retired military
prosecutor, Shih Li-hsing, blamed Lee, also a former KMT chairman,
for the party's embarrassing loss of its 55-year grip on power on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although he was born in Taiwan, his ancestors came
from mainland China 300 years ago. "I think all the residents of the
island of Taiwan are Taiwanese and that all residents are equal."</P>
      <P>He explained that the main reason behind his snub of Beijing's
"one country, two systems" proposal is that mainland China is still a
repressive regime.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is very pragmatic in handling relations with
mainland China, Lee said that Taiwan, while recognizing the existence
of the PRC, has never denied the existence of the ROC. Lee said he
hopes the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can co-exist under the
current situation and gradually pursue future unification.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that maintaining Taiwan's survival, security
and sustainable development is the most important task for the ROC's
new government at the moment.</P>
      <P>Lee also said he advocates the concept of "new Taiwan persons"
which refer to all residents of Taiwan, regardless of their ethnic
origin.</P>
      <P>He lauded his successor, President Chen Shui-bian, as a
representative of "new Taiwan persons" who, while recognizing the
existence of the Beijing government, always stand ready to defend
Taiwan's survival, freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>The Japanese weekly also carried a five-page color photographic
report on Lee's family life. In addition to introducing Lee's
extensive library, the report also featured his collection of 60-plus
golf clubs. According to the weekly, Lee's retirement centers around
reading, preaching the Christian faith and playing golf.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese police arrested more
than 1,200 members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual group in
recent days, a human rights group said here Monday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and 
Democracy said they were arrested between June 18 and 25 when they
practiced Falun Gong in groups or when they staged demonstrations in
protest against government crackdown on the group in the provinces of
Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Guangdong, Shandong, Sichuan,
and Hunan and the capital city of Beijing.</P>
      <P>The information center said the arrests indicate that more
members of the spiritual group have gathered together to practice
Falun Gong and stage public protests in recent weeks. Police have
been making great efforts to prevent members of the group from
getting together.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of them were arrested on Tiananmen Square in
Beijing, and in public parks in Harbin, Guangzhou, and other major
cities in China, the information center said.</P>
      <P>At least 22 Falun Gong mmembers have died in police custody since
the government began to crack down on the group as an "evil cult" in
last July.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
told visiting environmental experts on Monday that environmental
protection -- just like pollution -- has no boundaries and is even
more of an universal value than freedom, democracy, and human rights.</P>
      <P>Chen received the foreign guests just before Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh gave a speech on the issue of "finite earth
and infinite exploitation" at a monthly Presidential Office assembly.
Chen said that the crisis brought about by the depletion of the ozone
layer and the greenhouse effect deserves study and attention.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that a recent suggestion to establish a
ministry of environment and energy is "a good direction" for the
government to follow as part of its re-engineering efforts. He added
that projects on environmental protection, energy, and desalination
on Taiwan's outlying islands to counter a lack of fresh water
resources there will be "very helpful" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that there is only one earth, so the
environment must be cherished, and added that this generation has no
right to destroy the natural ecology. He urged the protection and
nurturing of the environment while pursuing economic growth.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated an earlier call to build Taiwan into a "green
silicon island" that is not only an innovator in the world's
information applications and a leader in digital economy, but also a
"wise island" that continues to base its developments on the
humanities, the "green revolution," and eternal growth.</P>
      <P>The visiting environmental experts included Wim Van Vierssen,

    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong said on Monday that the PFP will not join the supra-party task
force on the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations if the task
force is formed "only for show."</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks at his first press conference since
returning from a month-long visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Soong said that it is normal in democratic nations for political
party leaders to meet on major national affairs and that he is
duty-bound to attend such talks.</P>
      <P>However, he added that if the new government fails to stand by
its policy, the supra-party task force will be a mere formality and
the PFP will not be a part of such a group.</P>
      <P>Soong cited the National Unification Council (NUC) as an example
of a "show" organization, pointing out that it was set up during the
tenure of former President Lee Teng-hui, who also made the "special
state-to-state relationship" statement that caused heightened tension
between Taipei and Beijing and led to the suspension of cross-strait
talks.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office on Monday unveiled key points concerning
the establishment of a supra-party task force on the development of
ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The task force will comprise between 21 and 29 members, including
between 11 and 13 representatives of major political parties.</P>
      <P>Asked if there is a possibility of his cooperating with
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, Soong replied that he did not intend
to give others an impression of machiavellian trickery, or to bargain

that he and Lien will respect one another.</P>
      <P>Soong also congratulated Lien and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh on
their respective elections as party chairman of the KMT and the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between the Republic of
China and the Vatican are firm and solid, visiting ROC Foreign
Minister Tien Hung-mao said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Tien made the statement after paying separate visits to Holy See
Secretary of State Cardinal Angelo Sodano and Foreign Minister
Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran.</P>
      <P>Tien, who arrived here from Macedonia on Sunday for a three-day
visit, was accompanied by ROC Ambassador to Vatican City Raymond Tai
during his meetings with the two senior Holy See officials.</P>
      <P>Tien said his meetings with both Sodano and Tauran proceeded in
an amicable atmosphere. "All of us see firm relations between the ROC
and the Holy See," he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tien said, Tauran especially expressed his hope that
the ROC will not be affected by rumors or false reports about
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Tauran has assured me that if the Vatican were to adjust its
ties with the ROC, it would certainly inform us of its decision in
advance," Tien said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the Vatican's relations with mainland China, Tien
said the two sides remain far divided on certain key issues and that
their differences are not expected to be mended in the near future.</P>
      <P>During his meetings with the two senior Vatican officials, Tien
said he briefed them on the peaceful democratic transition of power
in Taiwan and the new ROC government's foreign policy and direction.</P>
      <P>"I told them that our new government will strengthen the
protection of human rights and will promote exchanges and cooperation
with international organizations, as well as extensively taking part
in humanitarian relief and charity activities," Tien expounded,
adding he had also asked the Vatican to assist the ROC in realizing
these goals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tien said he had briefed his hosts on the new ROC
government's policy toward mainland China. "I told them that
reconciliation is the basic tone of our mainland policy and that we
hope to co-exist with the mainland under a peaceful framework."</P>
      <P>The Vatican is the second leg of Tien's current overseas trip,
also his first since taking office on May 20. Before coming to the
Vatican, he already visited Macedonia. Macedonia and the Holy See

    <HEADLINE>CBC RAISES INTEREST RATES BY 0.125% TO HELD OFF INFLATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In order to preempt the threat of inflation
and to maintain the stability of Taiwan's financial market, the
Central Bank of China decided to raise its two vital interest rates
by 0.125 percent from Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said after a meeting of the CBC
directors and supervisors that the bank's rediscount interest rate
and its interest rate on secured loans will be raised by 0.125
percent each, from 4.625 percent and 5 percent to 4.75 percent and
5.125 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>He said the hikes, the second this year, were necessary because
of the widening gap between local interest rates and those in Europe
and North America, which resulted in an increase in May's domestic
consumer price growth, and signs in the leading index of core
consumer prices that inflation is looming.</P>
      <P>However, Perng said the CBC will fully accommodate local banks'
need to extend credit to industry by continuing to keep the money
supplies within its target range of 6 percent to 11 percent through
open market intervention.</P>
      <P>The CBC foresees rosy prospects for the island's economy this
year, estimating a growth of 6.7 percent, given the tame
international price of raw materials and booming internal and
external demand, said Perng</P>
      <P>Immediately after the announcement, the average overnight rate
charged by local banks on loans between themselves increased by
by 0.25 percent to 4.785 percent.</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
on Monday with a delegation from Taiwan's Chinese National Federation
of Industries (CNFI) in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Delegation member Chen Wu-hsiung said in a telephone interview
that Jiang stated that mainland China insists on a "peaceful
unification" with Taiwan and does not wish to see a war break out
across the Taiwan Strait, but reiterated that Beijing will not

independence.</P>
      <P>Jiang was quoted as expressing his hope that Taiwan's industrial
sector will be able to play a more important role in the development
of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>He also indicated his hope that Taiwan investors will show
interest in the development of western China.</P>
      <P>CNFI President Lin Kun-chung, leader of the mission, told Jiang
that the current visit was purely designed to inspect the mainland's
economic and trade situation and see the areas in which Taiwan
businessmen can render their assistance.</P>
      <P>He also said that the CNFI has decided to organize groups to
visit coastal and inland areas of the mainland each year to assess
the investment environment in various mainland locations.</P>
      <P>The meeting lasted one hour and 20 minutes and took place in a
cordial atmosphere, and little time was spent on political issues.</P>
      <P>The 30-member mission arrived in Beijing on Sunday but only 14

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong on Monday criticized the new Republic of China
government's policy toward mainland China as "very flexible but
lacking a vision."</P>
      <P>Soong, who just returned from a one-and-half-month-long visit to
the United States, said he is pleased to see President Chen
Shui-bian refrain from making any hardline rhetoric to provoke
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong said Chen has yet to work out feasible
concrete measures to break the current cross-strait logjam, adding
that Chen's administration should forsake several "negative
elements" in the old government's thinking or policy toward mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Soong, a former Taiwan governor and Kuomintang power broker,
left the KMT to run for the presidency as an independent. He lost to
Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), in the March 18 presidential election with a narrow
margin. Shortly after his defeat, he founded the PFP to continue his
political career.</P>
      <P>Soong said during his stay in the United States, he met with
many US officials, scholars and experts. "Many of them worry about
the prospects for cross-strait relations," he warned, adding that
the United States now thinks that a crisis is more likely to
erupt between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait than between
North and South Korea or between India and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new ROC government cannot afford to make any
big blunder in handling cross-strait relations, Soong said the new
government should use new thinking to achieve a breakthrough in the
long-deadlocked cross-strait ties. "People's well-being and national
security should always be top concern in formulating mainland
policy," he urged.</P>
      <P>Soong said he currently has no plan to visit mainland China.
Nevertheless, he said he would be pleased to see more local people
and PFP lawmakers to visit the mainland to help boost mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>Touching on the PFP's future development plans, Soong said the
party has no intention to give the priority to wooing KMT
legislators to join the PFP's legislative caucus. Nearly all
current PFP lawmakers were previously KMT members.</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP's current priority is to work out the party's
overall development plan, build up a nationwide service network and
draft comprehensive platform.</P>

      <P>Lin Kun-chung, president of Taiwan's Chinese National Federation

Beijing send Wang, chairman of Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, on a visit to Taiwan as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Jiang reportedly replied that "he will have such a chance."</P>
      <P>Wang was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan last fall at the
invitation of his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>But Beijing postponed the trip indefinitely after then-President

      <P>Lin's delegation arrived in Beijing on Monday for an eight-day
trip to inspect the mainland's economic development.</P>
      <P>He said that during the meeting with Jiang, both sides were very

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal by President Chen Shui-bian's
administration to set up a supra-party panel to advise the
government on policy toward mainland China came under fire on Monday
from the opposition and scholars.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng cold-shouldered the
idea as unnecessary because there is already a National Unification
Council (NUC) under the president to provide consultation on mainland
China policy.</P>
      <P>Lin said he saw no point in setting up another panel to play the
same role as the NUC.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was reportedly earmarked to be a member of the
supra-party panel, also said he had not been asked to serve on the
proposed panel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Chi, the head of the Mainland Affairs Council under
former President Lee Teng-hui, said that Chen was "barking up the
wrong tree" by setting up the panel.</P>
      <P>The former mainland policy architect attributed the Chen
administration's lack of leadership in its engagement with Beijing to
the absence of consensus among his Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>"Chen's party should first struggle to present a united front on
this issue before seek other parties' support for it," said Su.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the legal basis of forming a non-governmental
panel with the power to dictate policy to the administration.</P>
      <P>Chen Pi-chao, a former NUC executive secretary, also criticized
the new administration for lacking vision in terms of its approach
toward Beijing, despite its adequate flexibility.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Chen's idea of co-hosting the 2008 Olympic Games
with Beijing as an ill-conceived proposal, and asked what good it
would do for Taiwan to host the Olympics "as part of mainland
China's territory."</P>
      <P>He added that he suspected Chen's proposed non-governmental panel
to be the president's way of trying to evade the legislature's

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT LEAVES FOR BRITAIN FOR 6-DAY VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui and his wife left for Britain on Tuesday for a six-day
private visit.</P>
      <P>Lee's entourage included Lin Pi-chao, a former deputy
secretary-general to the President, and 10-plus security personnel
and Lee's close aides.</P>
      <P>Sources said Lin's British friends and the new ROC government
have assisted in arranging Lee's first overseas trip since stepping
down from the presidency on May 20.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lee will be granted honorary membership of the
Schumpeter Joseph A academic forum in Manchester in northwestern
England and will deliver a speech there on June 29 on Taiwan's
political and economic development after World War II.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife will also attend their granddaughter's
commencement from a British senior high school.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee will meet Chinese community leaders, visit
prestigious British think tanks and tour cultural relics and
tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Although Lee does not hold any public office now, mainland China
still spares no effort to block his overseas visit as part of its
diplomatic embargo against Taiwan. Against this background, Lee
adopted a low-profile approach toward his Britain visit to avoid
bringing troubles to the British government.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to return to Taipei on July 2. It remains
unclear whether Lee will travel to other countries after his Britain
visit.</P>
      <P>During his 12-year stint as the ROC president, Lee pushed for
Taiwan's democratization and endeavored to upgrade Taiwan's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Lee visited many countries during his presidential tenure,
including several countries which recognize Beijing. His landmark
visit to the United States in 1995 angered Beijing as mainland
leaders viewed the trip as a veiled move to promote Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Beijing then launched saber-rattling against Taiwan. It even
lobbed missiles and conducted live-fire war games at Taiwan's
doorsteps in the run-up to Taiwan's first-ever direct presidential
election in 1996 with an aim to sway Taiwan voters from Lee.
Undaunted by Beijing's intimidation, Lee won a landslide in the
vote.</P>
      <P>Tension in the Taiwan Strait escalated again after Lee defined
relations across the Taiwan Strait as a "special
state-to-state relationship" last July. In retaliation,
Beijing announced indefinite postponement of its top
negotiator with Taiwan Wang Daohan's planned visit to
Taiwan, originally scheduled for last autumn, and suspended
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lee stepped down from the chairmanship of the
Kuomintang after the party suffered an embarrassing defeat in the
March 18 presidential election, which marked an end to the
KMT's 55-year grip on power in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party legislator also pointed out that
unlike what the media had reported, the Rodhams' trip to Taipei was
"not a secret trip but a private business trip."</P>
      <P>He deplored that the media had cited him as the source of their

    <HEADLINE>AMERICAN LEGION URGES SENATE TO VOTE AGAINST PNTR FOR CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 26 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Legion on Monday urged all
Americans to tell their senators to vote against the legislation that
would grant Communist China permanent normal trade relations status
unless Beijing recognizes Taiwan's right to determine its own future
and abandons policies aimed at military dominance in Asia.</P>
      <P>Al Lance, national commander of the 2.8-million member American
Legion, the largest veterans organization in the United States,
called the PNTR bill "wrong -- an abandonment of principles, and
shortsighted submission to avarice."</P>
      <P>This free trade pact with Communist China, he pointed out, "sells
our national security short. That is why the American Legion is
lobbying the Senate to reject this proposal. Certain of our elected
officials have apparently forgotten that China continues to
antagonize Taiwan, has stolen US nuclear and military secrets and
attempted to influence US elections by making allegedly illegal
campaign contributions."</P>
      <P>Those congressmen, who called the PNTR bill "landmark trade
legislation, also have conveniently forgotten that the Chinese
government tramples on the human rights of its own people and refuses
to cooperate in accounting for missing American servicemen from the
Korean and Vietnam Wars, and from the Cold War era," said Lance.</P>
      <P>"I realize President Clinton is looking to bolster his legacy,
but this is not the way to do it," he added.</P>
      <P>The Senate's plans for a closed debate stand in stark contrast to
the American Legion's National Executive Committee's action on the
PNTR bill. After extended discussions, the NEC unanimously passed a
resolution that details the Legion's opposition to the PNTR
legislation as it now stands.</P>
      <P>Lance emphasized that "the American Legion believes China should
be required to comply with four conditions before such favored trade
status is awarded." These include recognizing Taiwan's right to
self-determination, extending full cooperation on accounting for
missing American serviceman, abandoning policies aimed at military
dominance in Asia, and encouraging human rights and religious freedom
among the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>To do otherwise, Lance said, "is merely gambling, perhaps with
the lives of American troops, that China will comply with the four
fundamentals listed above and will not finance an arms buildup with
the economic benefits of membership in the World Trade Organization.
The American Legion and other responsible organizations strongly
discourage such a foolhardy wagering."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROTESTS AGAINST CHINESE CRACKDOWN ON INTERNET USERS URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Human Rights Watch on Monday called on
foreign companies involved in developing the Internet in Communist
China to strongly protest the detention of Huang Qi, who has been
held since June 3 for maintaining a website exposing human rights
abuses on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Because Huang Qi has not yet been put on trial, the human rights
organization pointed out that "foreign companies have a rare
opportunity to help bring about his release."</P>
      <P>"The Internet is supposed to help bring freedom to China," said
Mike Jendrzejczyk, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch's
Asia Division, adding that "that's more likely to happen if foreign
companies object to the punishment of Internet users trying to
advance freedom."</P>
      <P>The New York-based organization emphasized that China's attempts
to control access to the Internet through politically-motivated
regulations and detentions "blatantly violates users' free expression
rights."</P>
      <P>Beijing has blocked the websites of foreign newspapers and
dissident websites based abroad. Companies that fail to screen
messages and to prevent users from posting certain kinds of
information on the web could also be blocked. Internet users in
mainland China, including companies intending to use the Internet,
are required by law to register with the police.</P>
      <P>While Internet and mobile technology are merging, foreign
telecommunications and software companies are investing heavily in
the development of mainland China's Internet.</P>
      <P>"Internet companies are helping to provide Chinese people with an
important new means of communication, enhancing their access to the
free flow of information, and this is to be welcomed. But they should
not turn a blind eye to users who are being censored, harassed, and
arrested," said Jendrzejczyk.</P>
      <P>On June 3, Human Rights Watch said, Chengdu police detained Huang
Qi and his wife, Zeng Li. She was released after three days, but said
police told her that Huang was being charged with subversion, a
charge which could result in life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Huang's website (www.6-4tianwang.com), which grew out of an
electronic billboard for missing persons, existed for one year. The
website developed into a discussion forum where people reported human
rights abuses neglected or ignored by the official Communist Chinese
press. On the eve of the 11th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen
Square crackdown, users posted increasingly critical messages,
including an account by a mother who accused police of having beaten
her son to death during the crackdown.</P>
      <P>Visitors to Huang Qi's web page were able to follow the
developments leading to his arrest as they took place. At 5:05 p.m.
on June 3, Huang posted a message saying: "Good-bye everyone. The
Public Security Department summoned me for interrogation."</P>
      <P>Two minutes later, he reported: "Four people of the Chengdu
Public Security (Bureau) came to summon me for interrogation. I told
them to produce a written summons. I estimate that they will bring it
in ten minutes."</P>
      <P>At 5:15 p.m., Huang posted his last message: "The road is still
long. Thank you everybody. Thanks to all who have made an effort on
behalf of democracy in China. They have come. Good-bye."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PORTS STEP UP HI-TECH OPERATIONS TO NAB ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ports around the world are stepping up
high-tech anti-smuggling operations to deal with the growing problem
of human smuggling, reported The Business Times today.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Dover port tragedy, where 58 Chinese mainland
migrants died in a sealed container, the British government has
pledged two million British pounds (US$3.05 million) to tackle the
problem, with security organizations MI5 and MI6 taking the lead. A
one and half British pound x-ray scanner is to be purchased for the
Dover port, which has seen its share of illegal entries rise by more
than 25 per cent over the last year.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the French port of Calais is currently studying the
use of drive-through X-ray units - similar to those used on the
US-Mexican border - that can scan a single truck in less than 20
seconds.</P>
      <P>Calais, along with Hong Kong, is already using carbon-dioxide
detectors which can detect the carbon dioxide exhaled by people
within a container within a few seconds.</P>
      <P>Currently, law enforcement officials from Belgium, Holland,
France, Germany, and Britain are attending an emergency Europol
meeting in the Hague aimed at strengthening their intelligence
gathering and cooperation in tackling the problem of human smuggling.</P>
      <P>Human smuggling is now the fastest growing criminal business in
the world, according to the head of the UN Office for Drug Control
and Crime Prevention, undersecretary-general Pino Arlacchi.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG TO INVITE MAYORS OF MAINLAND COASTAL CITIES TO VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Hall announced on
Tuesday it will formally invite mayors of major mainland Chinese
coastal cities to visit the southern Taiwan port city to help forge
rapprochement across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Frank Hsieh said if the plan can be
realized, it will mark a breakthrough to the long-deadlocked
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who was elected chairman of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Sunday, said the city
government also plans to invite mainland China's top negotiator
with Taiwan Wang Daohan to visit Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Wang, president of the Beijing's quasi-official Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), originally planned to
visit Taiwan last autumn to reciprocate a 1998 landmark visit to
mainland China by his Taiwan counterpart Koo Chen-fu. However,
Beijing announced an indefinite postponement of Wang's visit after
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship" last July. Beijing interpreted
the definition as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, said he thinks
that Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest commercial port and second largest
city after Taipei, can be an ideal venue for new rounds of Koo-Wang
talks.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on his plan to host visits by mayors of major
mainland port cities, Hsieh said he is hopeful that inter-city
exchanges can help break the current cross-strait logjam.</P>
      <P>Among major mainland coastal cities, Hsieh said he most likes to
invite Xiamen city mayor to visit Kaohsiung because the two port
cities play important roles in the current cross-strait
transshipment business.</P>
      <P>Taiwan still bans direct cross-strait transportation links, but
has allowed Kaohsiung Harbor to handle direct offshore cross-strait
transshipment services since May 1995.</P>
      <P>According to the rules, foreign vessels or foreign-registered
Taiwanese freighters are allowed to ship cargoes from or to a third
country between appointed ports in Taiwan and mainland China under
the condition that the merchandise not pass through Taiwan customs
or enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The port appointed by Taiwan for such offshore cross-strait
transshipment services is Kaohsiung, while mainland China appointed
Xiamen and Fuzhou in its southeastern Fujian province, which lies
opposite Taiwan, to handle similar services.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he hopes that Xiamen mayor and top administrators of
other mainland port cities can make official visits to Kaohsiung in
the near future to help pave the way for mainland China to open even
more ports for offshore cross-strait transshipment services to meet
the demand of Taiwan investors on the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, cross-strait inter-city exchanges can take place
before mainland China holds a high-level military meeting at
Bedaihe, a summer resort on the outskirts of Beijing, in late July,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, known for his resourcefulness and eloquence, further said
he looks forward to visiting the mainland before assuming the DPP
chairmanship on July 22.</P>
      <P>Beijing leaders have refused contact with the DPP due to the
party's pro-independence stance. However, the party has soft-pedaled
its pro-independence stand since Chen Shui-bian, a DPP stalwart, won
the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Hsieh's plans to invite mayors of major mainland
port cities to visit Kaohsiung, Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general
to the President, said the Presidential Office will be pleased to
see mainland China make a positive response to Hsieh's goodwill
gesture and sincere invitation.</P>
      <P>Chang said the new ROC government welcomes increased cross-strait
engagement on a parity, dignity and reciprocal basis to help defuse
cross-strait tension.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmakers on Tuesday suggested that the government appoint former
President Lee Teng-hui as a special peace envoy to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a national affairs forum in the Legislative Yuan,
Legislator Parris Chang proposed that the current DPP-led government
assign Lee to serve as a peace envoy between Taiwan and the mainland
because of his deep understanding of the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the view that Lee is a "trouble maker," Chang said
that Lee had made many outstanding contributions to Taiwan's
democratization that have resulted in the former president being
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times.</P>
      <P>Lee can also represent the new government in introducing Taiwan's
democratic achievements to the international community, he suggested,
noting that Lee has been allowed to visit Britain.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife, Lee departed for Britain on Tuesday for
a week-long private visit.</P>
      <P>Chang said he hopes that Lee would be able to visit more foreign
countries on the same basis.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chang's remarks, lawmaker Wang Hsing-nan contended that
President Chang Shui-bian should appoint Lee as a special envoy to
negotiate with mainland China on behalf of the government to resolve
bilateral disputes resulting from the long-time separation of the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Cheng Chao-ming said that Beijing should drop its "one

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei may consider lifting the ban on new
hires of Filipino workers at an earlier date if Manila takes concrete
measures to ease the worries of local employers, said an ROC official
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>C. J. Kuo, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA), told visiting Philippine Labor Affairs Minister
Bienvenido Laguesma that a lift on the ban "is not impossible" as
long as the Philippine government is able to put forward a solution
within a month, although the ROC government has not yet decided to
lift its ban any earlier than the original three months.</P>
      <P>But Kuo said he hopes that the three-month freeze on Filipino
workers will not be extended after the period expires, and added that
he is optimistic about that feasibility.</P>
      <P>The CLA vice chairman also thanked Laguesma for the contributions
of Philippine workers to Taiwan society, while Laguesma promised to
find solutions to the problems with Filipino workers here, which
prompted the ROC government to temporarily freeze new hires of
laborers from that country.</P>
      <P>The CLA decided to impose a three-month ban on the importation of
Philippine workers less than one month ago, after numerous cases of
runaway Philippine workers and labor disputes with local employers
were reported to police.</P>

      <P>Around 18,000 foreign domestic helpers in
Taiwan have still not been registered in the national health
insurance plan, the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) said
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>BNHI officials noted that there are more than 80,000 foreign
domestic helpers in Taiwan, and they should all be included in the
national health insurance plan.</P>
      <P>But there are around 18,000 foreign domestic workers who are
still not included in the plan, either because the employers do not
know the rules or the brokerage agencies have deliberately overlooked
the regulations and failed to notify the employers.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the basic wage of foreign domestic
helpers is NT$15,840 (US$514.3). According to the regulations, the
monthly health insurance premium should be split between an employer
and foreign domestic helper at NT$759 and NT$210, respectively.</P>
      <P>The officials said that any employer who fails to register his or

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND DISSIDENT URGES ROC TO EVADE 'ONE CHINA' PRINCIPLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Warsaw, June 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exiled prominent mainland Chinese dissident
Wei Jingsheng said on Tuesday that the Republic of China's new
government should evade Beijing's cherished "one China" principle,
which downgrades the ROC to a local-level government under the PRC.</P>
      <P>Wei, who is currently in Warsaw to the attend the first World
Forum on Democracy, offered the suggestion in an interview with CNA.
The US-based mainland dissident attracted much media attention upon
his appearance at the forum.</P>
      <P>Wei held a closed-door meeting with US Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Monday evening. According to Wei, their talks
focused on mainland China's current human rights conditions and
his views on Taiwan's present political situation. Albright
delivered a keynote speech at the democracy forum earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's "one China" definition does not carry any
legal significance, Wei said "one China" can have many definitions.
He further said Beijing is indulging in a wordplay by pressuring
Taipei to accept its "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>"It's an unfair and flawed strategy to force Taiwan to accept
Beijing's 'one China' principle as a precondition for resumption of
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue," Wei remarked, adding that
Beijing intends to hold Taiwan responsible for the failure to resume
cross-strait dialogue by insisting on such a tactic. "Against this
backdrop, Taiwan should reject negotiations with the mainland," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's political situation following the democratic
transition of power from the Kuomintang to the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on May 20, Wei said it seems to
him that the KMT is still overshadowed by its embarrassing election
defeat while the DPP is indulging itself in its "election jubilee."</P>
      <P>Wei reminded the DPP-led new ROC government that it should brace
up to cope with the many challenges that lie ahead. He said the new
ROC government should first work out new foreign policy and
new defense policy.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, Wei said, the new ROC government should
help the international community gain a better understanding of the
substance of cross-Taiwan Strait issues in order to win support and
pressure Beijing to resume dialogue with Taiwan in a pragmatic and
realistic manner.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wei said, Taiwan should increase exchanges with
non-governmental international organizations to help upgrade Taiwan's
international profile.</P>
      <P>Wei further said the KMT and the DPP should cooperate to
safeguard Taiwan's security and democratic lifestyle, adding he
believes that no democrats around the world would like to see
democratic Taiwan be swallowed by communist China.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan on Tuesday adopted a
special resolution requiring the government to reduce the number of
foreign laborers in Taiwan starting next year.</P>
      <P>In compliance with the terms of the resolution, which was raised
by a group of 46 lawmakers, the government must, from the start of
next year, begin to reduce the number of foreign workers by 15,000
annually until the ratio of foreign laborers in the local labor
market drops from the current 2.87 percent to 1.6 percent.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Cheng Lung-shui said Taiwan's jobless rate
has continually risen from 2 percent in 1991, when the government
decided to allow the importation of foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Tai Chen-yao also stressed
that he supports the passage of the resolution to help protect the
interests of local workers, including aborigines, women and elderly
job seekers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Vice Chairman C. J. Kuo
said the government will first lower the number of foreign family
nursemaids, as well as foreign workers in domestic major construction
projects and the high-technology sector, in a bid to ease the impact
of the recently-enacted shortened workweek on labor-intensive
traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Kuo pointed out that the government will increase hires of
aboriginal workers in public construction projects, adding that
aborigines used to form the bulk of laborers in the local
construction industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, the CLA will also provide subsidies to jobless and
elderly Taiwan workers and take measures to help them find work in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui and his wife departed for London on Tuesday for a six-day
private visit, his first overseas trip since leaving office on May
20.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lee will be granted honorary membership in the
Joseph A. Schumpeter Academic Forum in Manchester, which is in
northwestern England. He will deliver a speech at the private
foundation on June 29 on Taiwan's political and economic development
since World War II.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife will also attend the commencement ceremony of
their granddaughter, Lee Kun-yi, at a British senior high school near
Birmingham in central England.</P>
      <P>Reportedly, Lee also may meet with Chinese community leaders,
exchange opinions with prestigious British think tanks and political
scholars, tour Oxford and Cambridge Universities, and visit tourist
attractions such as Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-hua, the ROC representative to Britain, would not
comment on the significance of Lee's visit. In a telephone interview
with the Central News Agency, Cheng also said that he cannot predict
mainland China's possible reaction to Lee's trip.</P>
      <P>Although Lee does not currently hold any public office, mainland
China continues to spare no effort to block any overseas visits by
Lee as part of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan. Lee has
maintained a low profile regarding his visit to Britain, his first
trip abroad in over two years.</P>
      <P>Lee is the most prominent ROC political figure to visit Britain
in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Lee's visit has been arranged "for some
time," and Lee received his entry visa in Taipei with the assistance
of the new ROC government and the British Trade and Cultural Office,
the de facto British embassy in Taipei due to a lack of formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee's entourage includes Lin Bih-jaw, a former deputy
secretary-general to the president, security personnel, and Lee's
close aides. Lin received his doctoral degree from Wales University
and his master's from Manchester University.</P>
      <P>Lee left Taiwan on an EVA Airways flight bound for London via
Bangkok, Thailand. He is scheduled to return to Taipei on July 2. It
remains unclear whether Lee will travel to other countries after his
visit to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>During his presidential tenure, Lee visited several countries,
some of which recognize Beijing. His landmark visit to the United
States in 1995 angered Beijing, as mainland leaders viewed the trip
as a veiled move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Beijing lobbed missiles and conducted live-fire war games at
Taiwan's doorstep in the run-up to Taiwan's first-ever direct
presidential election in 1996, aiming to sway Taiwan voters away from
Lee. Undaunted by Beijing's intimidation, Taiwan voters re-elected
Lee by a landslide.</P>
      <P>Tension in the Taiwan Strait escalated again after Lee defined
relations across the Taiwan Strait as a "special state-to-state
relationship" last July. In retaliation, Beijing announced the
indefinite postponement of a scheduled visit by Wang Daohan, its top
negotiator with Taiwan, and suspended cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lee stepped down from his post as Kuomintang chairman after the
party suffered an embarrassing defeat in the March 18 presidential
election, which marked the end to the KMT's 55-year grip on power in
Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Penghu,  Taiwan,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Britain's MaiDor international
investment group is to build a five-star tourist hotel in Taiwan's
offshore island county of Penghu, the Penghu County Government
announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first foreign investment project on Penghu (also
known as the Pescadores), an archipelago of 64 islets situated in the
Taiwan Strait midway between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>MaiDor's subsidiary, Amazing Co., will invest about NT$2.2
billion (US$32.47 million) in the construction of a world-class
tourist hotel in Makung, Penghu County's largest city.</P>
      <P>Amazing Co. already signed a land purchase contract with
representatives of landlords in May last year. The piece of land to
accommodate the new hotel originally belonged to several landlords.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the Penghu County Government signed a land deal
authorization contract with Amazing Co. to finalize the company's
land acquisition plan.</P>
      <P>The authorization contract was inked by Penghu County Magistrate
Lai Feng-wei and MaiDor Group Chairman Ian Irvine at the county
government's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Lai said the MaiDor investment project marks a milestone in
Penghu's development because it will help bring the island county's
rich tourist resources into the international limelight for the first
time.</P>
      <P>"We believe the project will also help attract other foreign and
domestic business groups to invest in Penghu," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Irvine, a Scotsman, said he was
very happy when he unexpectedly sighted thistles, Scotland's national
flower, in Penghu.</P>
      <P>Irvine said he is convinced that while MaiDor is the first
company to launch a massive investment project in Penghu, it will not
be the last.</P>
      <P>"We stand a chance of developing Penghu into a world-class
vacation resort. Nevertheless, we will need the assistance of the
Penghu County Government and all of its residents," Irvine said,
adding that he believes June 27, 2000 will be remembered in the
future as the beginning of Penghu's globalization.</P>
      <P>MeiDor Group's Asia region chief, Tim Potter, and Amazing senior
executives, as well as Penghu County Council Speaker Su Kun-hsiung
and many other local political heavyweights, were also present at the
signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Penghu is Taiwan's only county that is an archipelago. Only 20 of
the islands are inhabited. Penghu proper, Yuweng and Paisha are the
main islands. They are connected by two causeways and the Cross-sea
Bridge which is the longest inter-island bridge in the Far East.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
on Tuesday suggested the coining of a new term to replace Beijing's
"one China" policy, or the establishment of an "Asia Pacific league,"
to prevent Taiwan from being swallowed up by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the prospects of national policy, Lu
said that a term such as "one Chunghwa" -- which can be loosely
translated as "one Chinese race" -- could allow the 23 million people
of Taiwan to break free from the "politically binding spell" of "one
China."</P>
      <P>She added that "one Chunghwa" is only an example she brought up
as food for thought, because "spending all day going in circles under
the spell of `one China' is wasting too much time."</P>
      <P>New thinking, such as the formulation of an "Asia Pacific league"
with mainland China, would be mutually beneficial and would begin a
new era, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu concluded that the common challenge for the people of Taiwan
is to find ways to increase the number of the country's diplomatic
allies from the current 29 countries and to foray further onto the
international stage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
began a nationwide grassroots "reach-out" tour on Tuesday, with a
sandbar off the coast of Chiayi County in southern Taiwan as his
first stop.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chiayi County Magistrate Lee Ya-ching and several
other local political heavyweights, Chen arrived at the Waishan
Tingchou sandbar via an air force helicopter early in the morning,
becoming the first Republic of China ever to land on the sandbar that
forms a natural barrier to help protect the Yunlin-Chiayi coastline
in southwestern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sandbar is Chiayi County's aquaculture industry stronghold
and the surrounding area is rich in maritime resources. However, the
sandbar is shrinking continuously due to natural weather changes and
human pollution, and the feature which boasted an area of more than
3,000 hectares during its heyday has now shrunk to only about 300
hectares.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Lee presented Chen with a plan to
fortify the sandbar and prevent it from completely disappearing in
the near future.</P>
      <P>Chen said the central government will form a special task force
to study the problem and assess whether the county
government-proposed development plan is feasible.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage then traveled to Putai, a Chiayi County
fishing port which boasts a booming oyster cultivation industry.</P>
      <P>They also toured several other coastal cities in the county,
including a bitter gourd farm in Putzu township, before returning to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first non-Kuomintang head of state, who won just
39.3 percent of the vote in the March 18 presidential election, has
vowed to make extensive grassroots community tours during his
four-year tenure with an aim of exploring public opinion and

      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh on
Tuesday announced the names of the five-member selection panel of a
new supra-party task force that will advise Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian on policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>The panel, which will be responsible for selecting members of the
task force, includes Academia Sinica Vice President Yang Kuo-shu,
Chung Hua Institute for Economic Research President Mai Chao-cheng,
Attorney Lai Hao-min, Vice Chairman of I-Mei Foods Kao Chih-shang,
and Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee, who serves as convenor of the supra-party committee, said
despite its unofficial nature, the task force will be supervised by
the people and society. He explained his statement by pointing out
that Chen, to whom the committee will offer consultations on
formulating policies on cross-strait relations and other issues, is
supervised by the people and society.</P>
      <P>Upon announcing the five-member selection panel, Lee said the
panel will finalize its selection of between 21 and 29 task force
members within two weeks.</P>
      <P>Lee said the members will include between 11 and 13
representatives of major domestic political parties, four to six
academic representatives, two to four industry representatives and
between three and five local celebrities. Recommendations from all
walks of life will be welcomed over the next two weeks to help the
five-member panel finalize its selection, he added.</P>
      <P>He added that although the selection panel is obliged to come up
with a roster, it will be Chen who makes the formal appointments. All
members will be expected to serve a two-year tenure.</P>
      <P>The supra-party committee is expected to convene its inaugural
conference in mid-July, slightly behind the originally scheduled
timetable, as it will take longer than previously estimated for the
panel to select the members, he said.</P>
      <P>The committee will meet once every three months, but can also
hold extraordinary meetings if the convenor thinks that extra
meetings are needed. The committee can also hold extra meetings at
the request of at least half of the members.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Chairwoman Tsai said Beijing "worries too much" by
saying through the Hong Kong-based Wen Wei Po daily newspaper that it
will not recognize the proposed supra-party committee.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that Taiwan is a multi-faceted society with many

quite high, according to CEPD official Hu Chung-yin, who said he
believed the economic development is slowing down rather than
reversing.</P>
      <P>In step with the leading index, the CEPD said that a survey
conducted in May shows that fewer firms feel optimistic about the
economic prospects for the next three months, with only 21 percent of
the firms polled expressing optimism compared to 30 percent one month
earlier.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the number of those who said they expect an
economic downturn increased from 11 percent in April to 17 percent in
May, according to the CEPD survey.</P>
      <P>The remaining 62 percent said they expect the economy to remain
unchanged, compared to 59 percent who thought so in April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND EXPLAINS NEW DEFENSE STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China military has decided
to adopt a more active defense strategy since last year's Hankuan No.
15 combined services military exercise, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the statement in an attempt to clarify
speculation that President Chen Shui-bian's "launching a decisive
offshore strike against invasion" concept runs counter to the ROC
military's traditional defense strategy.</P>
      <P>Chen mentioned the "offshore defense" concept while making his
first-ever military review as the supreme leader of the ROC's armed
forces at the Chinese Military Academy in southern Taiwan earlier
this month.</P>
      <P>The MND said the ultimate goal of the "offshore defense" strategy
is to avoid bringing war to a country's own territory. "This is a
common military goal pursued by nearly all countries around the
world," said an MND official.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the ROC military's current combat guidelines
are centered around "foiling invading troops at sea or thwarting them
on beachheads."</P>
      <P>In the future, the official said, the military will establish a
strong deterrent force to effectively dissuade enemy troops
(referring mainly to mainland Chinese armed forces) from launching an
attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is an active defense strategy with a view to discouraging
enemy forces from leaving the other side of the Taiwan Strait or
foiling them once they cross over the center line of the strait," the
official said, adding that this is also the gist of the "offshore
defense" strategy.</P>

set up a task force on mainland China policy and cross-strait affairs
in the parliament to deal with the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The decision was reached by the caucuses of the ruling and

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT BUYS BANANAS TO DRAW ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
bought 36,000 kg of bananas to treat all legislators on Tuesday, an
act aimed at calling government and public attention to the plight of
Taiwan's banana farmers.</P>
      <P>Domestic banana prices have plummeted recently and banana farmers
have been strongly affected. Apart from dishing out the bananas, Wang
also led legislators in a rallying cry of "help banana planters by
eating bananas."</P>
      <P>In response to a question as to how eating bananas can help
farmers, Wang said that although it only helps a little, it is still
of some help. In addition, eating bananas aids digestion, he added.</P>
      <P>People First Party Legislator Chou Hsi-wei (Taipei County)
attributed the banana problem to the production and marketing system.
Banana prices differ from region to region, and while prices may
remain relatively stable in some parts of the island, prices in some
banana-producing areas cannot even meet production costs.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has to urge the government and
the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) to come up with
feasible policy and take responsibility for the problem.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Cheng Long-shuei (legislator-at-large)
echoed Chou, saying that production and marketing is not balanced,
and that the COA has to come up with concrete policy to solve the
problem.</P>
      <P>However, Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Cheng Pao-ching
(Taoyuan County) rebutted their ideas, pointing out that the
imbalance between production and marketing has long existed, and
adding that in a free economy, if there is no serious defect, the
government should not intervene in the market mechanism.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT ACCEPTS `ONE CHINA, RESPECTIVE INTERPRETATIONS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said on Tuesday for the first time that his government is willing to
accept a 1992 consensus reached with Beijing on "one China,
respective interpretations."</P>
      <P>Accepting the previous consensus that each side of the Taiwan
Strait can adhere to its own interpretations of the meaning of "one
China," he chided mainland China for its current insistence on its
cherished "one China" principle, which downgrades the Republic of
China to a local-level government under the People's Republic of
China -- something that is unacceptable to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Receiving US-based Asia Foundation Chairman William Fuller at the
Presidential Office, Chen also said that Taiwan hopes to resume
negotiations with mainland China soon and to "seek common ground
while preserving our differences."</P>
      <P>Chen said that Beijing's insistence on its own interpretation of
"one China" is the reason that negotiations cannot be resumed at
present, a situation which he described as "regrettable."</P>
      <P>He added that negotiations can also help both sides to discover a
mutually acceptable interpretation of "one China."</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated what he said in his first post-inauguration press
conference on June 20 -- that he is willing to sit down anywhere and
shake hands with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and discuss
any topic without any predetermined stance.</P>
      <P>The foremost job of the new government is to improve cross-strait
relations and ensure eternal peace in the Taiwan Strait, he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan is a democratic, pluralistic society where
different opinions abound. However, he cited an 80 percent public
approval rate for his May 20 inauguration speech and his June 20
press conference as proof that his thinking in regard to cross-strait
affairs follows mainstream opinion and consensus in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OFFICIAL REFUTES BEIJING PROTEST OVER EX-PRESIDENT'S BRITISH VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin said on Tuesday that Beijing should not
politicize former President Lee Teng-hui's visit to Britain, as it is
a purely private visit by a private individual.</P>
      <P>Noting that the former president has every right to travel, Lin
said Beijing's protest over Lee's visit is "just too much."</P>
      <P>Lin, who has just returned from the United States where he was
introducing Taiwan's mainland China policies under the leadership of
President Chen Shui-bian, made the remarks in response to a protest
from mainland China's Foreign Ministry over Lee's visit that labeled
the visit an activity designed to create "two Chinas" in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that the people of Taiwan are greatly disappointed
by confirmation from representatives of Taiwan's industrial
federation who recently visited the mainland and met with
high-ranking officials that Beijing has been suppressing Taiwanese
businessmen who maintain operations in the mainland since President
Chen's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said most American opinion leaders have high
regard for President Chen and attach great importance to the
cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>After talking with think-tank scholars, China hands, retired
officials and the media in the United States, Lin said he had an
impression that the Americans also agree that Beijing should give
Taiwan a goodwill response with regard to the cross-strait impasse
rather than expecting Taiwan to shoulder the responsibility.</P>
      <P>Lin also conveyed messages to Beijing via the United States,
including Taipei's hope that Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait Chairman Wang Daohan will visit Taiwan soon, that
mainland China will take back the 1,400-odd illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants currently languishing in Taiwan's three detention centers,
and that the PLA's constant live-fire war games on Taiwan's doorstep
have seriously hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>On the much-discussed but never agreed upon "one China" issue,
Lin suggested that negotiators from both sides of the strait should
"meet and talk" to work out consensus rather than exchanging empty
rhetoric.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several domestic medical institutions are
preparing to embark on a program that will see humans receiving
ostrich cornea transplants, a local ostrich expert said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony at National Chungshing University to mark
the establishment of an ostrich-breeders association, Feng Cheng-wan,
secretary-general of the Republic of China Chicken Breeding
Association said that because the structure of the ostrich cornea is
almost the same as that of humans, foreign medical institutions have
started experimental programs to transplant ostrich corneas into
humans.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan's Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and some
other medical institutions have already contacted domestic ostrich
farmers to seek the possibility of cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) gave a greenlight
to ostrich breeding and the import of eggs in 1998, and at present,
there are over 10,000 ostriches on the island in 100 ostrich farms.</P>
      <P>Feng, who is also an expert in ostrich breeding, said that the
ostrich is a high economic-value animal prized for its feathers, meat
and skin, all of which can be utilized by humans.</P>
      <P>A kilogram of top-grade ostrich meat sells for about NT$1,000,
while a kilo of regular-grade ostrich meat costs around NT$500.
Ostrich feathers can be used to produce static electricity-free
brushes and ostrich hides can be used to make handbags and shoes,
Feng said.</P>

is never presumptuous and never regards anything as beneath his
notice or as unworthy of serious and careful attention -- that is
what is meant by being dignified without being supercilious."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER RETURNS FROM EUROPE VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao
returned to Taipei on Wednesday after wrapping up his first overseas
visit since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tien, a political scientist-turned-politician, visited the
Republic of China's only two diplomatic allies in Europe -- Macedonia
and the Vatican -- during his trip.</P>
      <P>Tien said he made extensive contacts with senior officials of
the two countries during his visit. "I have made friends with many
of them and I believe this will be helpful to the development of our
relations with these two countries," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the ROC's ties with the Holy See, Tien said
relations between the two countries are firm and solid. During his
talks with his Vatican counterpart, Tien said Archbishop
Jean-Louis Tauran assured him that if Taipei-Vatican diplomatic ties
will have any changes, the Holy See will certainly inform the ROC in
advance.</P>
      <P>The Vatican reportedly has been negotiating with mainland China
for establishing formal ties. However, their talks have been
hindered by some serious problems, including Beijing's
insistence on its rights to ordain Catholic clergy and its
resistance to offer its people religious freedom.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the southeastern Balkan state of Macedonia,
Tien held an undisclosed meeting with Macedonian President Boris
Trajkovski. Tien said the meeting was kept secret mainly because of
Macedonia's domestic political situation.</P>
      <P>Tien also signed an agreement with Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov on the establishment of a US$10 million fund to
help Macedonia develop its battered economy.</P>
      <P>Turning to former ROC President Lee Teng-hui's ongoing visit to
Britain, Tien said Lee's itinerary was arranged by the Taiwan
Research Institute, a private think tank of which Lee is an honorary
chairman.</P>
      <P>Tien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only provided Lee
with necessary assistance and convenience based on protocol for
a retired head of state.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken minister denied a newspaper report that he was
instrumental in arranging Lee's Britain visit. "I can't take the
credit for what I did not do," he said.</P>
      <P>As for Beijing's furious response to Lee's Britain visit, Tien
said since Lee no longer holds any public office, he has rights to
go abroad as an ordinary ROC citizen. Lee, an outspoken critic of
communist China, left for London on Tuesday for his first
post-retirement overseas trip. During his six-day visit, Lee will
attend his granddaughter's graduation from a British senior high
school, receive an honorary membership of the Schumpeter Joseph A
forum, attend a seminar and meet with British academics and
politicians. Lee is scheduled to return on July 2.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S GENE RESEARCH CENTER TO BE ESTABLISHED IN ONE YEAR: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Just as scientists from around the world
have finished the first big step toward mapping the human genetic
code, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh announced on Wednesday
that Taiwan will establish its own genetic research center within one
year.</P>
      <P>Noting that if the Republic of China begins to lag further behind
other advanced countries in genetic research, it risks falling into
the ranks of the second-class countries, Lee said that Academia
Sinica, the top research institute in Taiwan, is actively preparing
for the establishment of a gene center.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although Taiwan is fast catching up in genetic
research, particularly in rice genome sequence studies, with some
foreign institutes having tried to recruit researchers from the
island, Taiwan must keep progressing in genetic research and related
sciences, which will be the signature industry in the new century.</P>
      <P>Lee, the 1986 Nobel laureate in chemistry who in 1994 assumed the
helm of Academia Sinica, said his institute will sign an agreement
for research cooperation with Scripps Institute in San Diego,
California in three months. Related costs, expected to be at least
NT$15 million (US$0.49 million), however, may have to come from
private sector donations as the government's finances are strained,
he noted.</P>
      <P>The topic of establishing a world-class genetic research center
in Taiwan was first sounded in late May when the 2000 International
Symposium on the Future of Biodiversity was held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the opening of the symposium, Lee said that as
biodiversity and genetic research are inextricably linked, it is
Taiwan's responsibility as a member of the international community to
develop itself into a genetic research hub so as to provide efficient
protection to the island's diverse and abundant biological resources.</P>
      <P>Dr. Peter H. Raven, a top science adviser to US President Bill
Clinton taking part in the two-day symposium, said Taiwan is indeed a
"formosa" -- Portuguese for beautiful island -- because about
one-quarter of the species found on and around the island are
exclusively endemic to Taiwan, while the remaining three-quarters
have unique genetic characteristics.</P>
      <P>Raven said the island of Taiwan, which is a closed biological
system with rich and diverse biological resources that rival those of
Europe, shows promising signs of becoming a global example of
biodiversity protection.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also commenting on the genetic research center plan,
Academia Sinica Vice President Chen Chang-chien said that in addition
to rice and mice genome sequence studies, the Academia Sinica may
expand its research in this area to papaya, sweet beans, and
bacterium in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Third World Sinology Conference is
scheduled to kick off Friday at the Academia Sinica with the
participation of more than 250 scholars of sinology from around the
world, sources from the Academia Sinica said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>During the conference, the third of its kind, being held 14 years
after the second, 46 workshops and panels will be held for the
sinologists to exchange views on new trends, concepts, and theories
on sinology which have been developed over the past decade, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>The sinologists, including 125 from Taiwan, 18 from mainland
China, and 108 from overseas, will split into seven groups for
discussions on 15 subjects each during the three days of the
conference.</P>
      <P>They are also expected to bring up topics such as the digitalized
preservation of, and search for, Chinese literature and language
archives to be debated during the conference.</P>
      <P>Prof. Yu Ying-sheh from Princeton University and Prof. William
Skinner from the University of California will each give a keynote
speech to the conference on Friday and Saturday respectively.</P>
      <P>Also, for the first time, nearly 400 domestic educators and
researchers will be invited to attend the conference as observers in
an effort to upgrade the local level of sinology research and
studies, the sources noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO FRAMEWORK CAN SERVE TO HANDLE CROSS-STRAIT TRADE: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait trade issues can be
handled under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
once both Taiwan and mainland China are admitted, Economic Affairs
Vice Minister Lin Yi-fu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin told CNA that it will be "normal" to deal with cross-strait
trade practices through the WTO mechanism once both sides are members
of the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after local media reported that mainland Chinese
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Shi Guangsheng
claimed that mainland China, in compliance with WTO regulations, will
file a complaint with the WTO for arbitration should Taiwan remain
reluctant to establish direct trade, transport and postal links with
the mainland after both sides are allowed to enter the organization.</P>
      <P>Responding to a statement by Shi that mainland China is fully
prepared to set up such links across the strait while Taiwan is
unwilling to do so, Lin said the issue will also require approval
from the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>After both sides enter the WTO, Taiwan will be willing to see
mainland China handle cross-strait trade practices under the WTO
framework, by which time the ROC government will have worked out a
comprehensive package to tackle the issue, Lin added.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wu Ching-kuo, the Republic of China's
International Olympic Committee (IOC) representative left Taipei for
mainland China on Wednesday to meet mainland sports officials on
matters concerning the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Wu, who voted in 1993 for Beijing to host the 2000 Olympics
against the wishes of the ROC government, said he will first meet
with He Zhenliang, former President of Beijing's Chinese Olympic
Committee, in the scenic southern city of Gueilin for "a chat between
old friends."</P>
      <P>Wu said he will then travel to Beijing on July 3 for a meeting
with Yuan Weimin, president of the All-China Sports Federation and
Chinese Olympic Committee to discuss the feasibility of Taipei
co-sponsoring the 2008 Olympics with Beijing and to see the progress
of Beijing's preparations to bid for the right to host the Games.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was widely believed to have cast the pivotal vote against
Beijing in Monte Carlo that led to Beijing's losing its 2000 Olympic
to Sydney, said in a recent interview with a local radio station that
he did not follow the Taipei authorities' instruction to vote against
Beijing in the secret ballot.</P>
      <P>He said in the interview that he has come under heavy fire for
the mistaken perception that it was his vote that blocked Beijing's
bid, but said he was reluctant to admit publicly that he had ignored
the Taipei authorities' secret order, even though the order showed a
blatant disregard for the IOC rule that its members are not allowed
to accept instructions on voting from any government or other group
or individual.</P>
      <P>Wu further claimed that in fact, He Zhenliang, who was president
of the Chinese Olympic Committee at the time, wrote him a letter
after the Monte Carlo meeting to thank him for his support.</P>
      <P>He said he fully backs a proposal put forward by President Chen
Shui-bian in his first press conference after his inauguration that
Beijing should consider allowing a portion of the Olympic events to
be held in Taiwan in 2008.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, although IOC Chairman Juan Antonio Samaranch has
explicitly supported the idea of Beijing hosting the 2008 Olympics
and there is a precedent of some Olympic events being held in cities
other than the host city, it remains to be seen whether the IOC
authorities or Beijing would agree to the proposal that Taipei and
Beijing co-sponsor some of the 2008 Olympic events.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MULLING WAYS TO PROMOTE TAIWAN BANANAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, said on Wednesday that the KMT Central Standing Committee
will form a task force to hammer out a policy to promote the export
of Taiwan bananas.</P>
      <P>Lien made the statement at a regular meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee, the first following last week's election of the
party's new central standing committee.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng promised at the meeting that he
will solicit the assistance of a Japanese parliamentary group to cut
Japanese tariffs on Taiwan bananas to 12.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Ling Hsiang-nung, former Chairman of the Council of Agriculture,
presented a report at the meeting on the price collapse of bananas
following a slowdown in exports, and offered his suggestions for
alleviating the problem.</P>
      <P>Ling noted that due to weather conditions, this year's banana
harvest was later but more plentiful than usual. However, Japan, the
main importer of Taiwan bananas, scrapped its premium tariff on
Taiwan bananas on the grounds that Taiwan's economic development has
reached the level of developed nations. This meant that the tariff
jumped to 27 percent, making Taiwan bananas much less competitive.</P>
      <P>He suggested that KMT-run enterprises could help distribute
bananas and that Hong Kong could be targeted as another potential
market.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that high-ranking KMT officials,
especially KMT Central Standing Committee member P.K. Chiang, could
try to contact Japan to increase the quota for Taiwan bananas, adding
that it should be considered as an urgent matter for the KMT to use
its clout to win back the support of banana farmers.</P>
      <P>He also proposed that Wang Jing-pyng, KMT vice chairman and
president of the Legislative Yuan, use his communication channel with
the Japanese Diet to solicit the cutting of tariffs. Wang
responded by promising to solicit the support of the Japan-ROC
Parliamentarians Council to cut the tariff on Taiwan bananas to 12.5
percent.</P>
      <P>He also urged the KMT to appeal to the public to consume more
bananas to help bolster prices, and, noting that in addition to
bananas, bumper crops of papaya, mango and lichi have also resulted
in low prices, suggested that the KMT sponsor promotions for these
fruits also.</P>
      <P>The KMT Central Standing Committee also sponsored a banana
promotion activity to underscore its concern for the plight of banana
farmers.</P>
      <P>Lin said in the promotion that Taiwan's location in a subtropical
region ensures that its bananas are especially delicious, and noted
that they sell in Japan for up to three times the price of Philippine
bananas.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, June 27 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of students from National Taiwan
University (NTU) won second prize on Tuesday in the First IEEE
Computer Society International Design Competition.</P>
      <P>The NTU team, composed of five students from the school's
Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, won the
award with a "Family Health Guard" program.</P>
      <P>The team received US$18,000 in prize money, US$10,000 of which
will be shared among the team members while the remainder will be
presented to NTU's Department of Computer Science and Information
Engineering to set up an educational fund to promote the application
of computer technology in cultural or humanistic fields.</P>
      <P>The contest, sponsored by the 54-year-old IEEE Computer Society,
was held in Arlington, Virginia from June 26-27.</P>
      <P>A total of 180 universities from around the world sent teams to
compete in the competition, and after several heats, 10 teams were
left to compete in the final.</P>
      <P>In the final, the NTU team first explained the details of its
"Family Health Guard" program and the team members then fielded
impromptu questions from an 11-member international panel of judges.</P>
      <P>According to the competition rules, the theme of the competition
focused on health and medical services. Computer equipment used in
the contest by each team was not permitted to exceed a value of
US$200, and the ranking was mainly based on the ingenuity and quality
of design of the entries.</P>
      <P>A Canadian team took first prize, while a team from Poland came
third.</P>
      <P>During the award-presentation ceremony, however, members of the
Boston University team expressed doubt about the impartiality of the
panel of judges, claiming that the NTU team should have won because
its program was the most sophisticated and the most likely to be
upgraded for other functions.</P>
      <P>Professor Feipei Lai, mentor of the NTU team, told CNA that he
was also surprised by the Canadian team's victory because its program
was "not very innovative." Nevertheless, Lai said he was still very
happy to see the NTU team emerge as the first runner-up.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that a Taiwan university team has managed
to win a prize in an international computer design competition.</P>
      <P>"The competition indicates that the world has entered a post-PC
(personal computer) era and that Taiwan has 3C (computer,
communications and consumer electronics) integration capability," Lai
added.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an
inspection tour of the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) on Wednesday
as part of his efforts to get familiar with the Republic of China's
overall defense affairs.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen, Chief of the
General Staff Tang Yao-ming and other senior military officers,
President Chen arrived at the intelligence bureau early in the
morning.</P>
      <P>MIB Director Hsu Chu-sheng briefed Chen on the bureau's main
functions and mainland China's current situation.</P>
      <P>The president's undisclosed visit to the bureau drew much
attention as it came at a time when Pan Hsi-hsien, a former personnel
department director of the National Security Bureau (NSB), the ROC's
top intelligence agency, is now making a controversial visit to
mainland China. Pan just retired from his NSB post, and under current
government rules, senior government officials are banned from
visiting the mainland within specified periods of time after
retirement.</P>
      <P>Following his MIB visit, Chen went to the Navy General
Headquarters (NGH) in suburban Taipei to continue his "military
units" inapection tour.</P>
      <P>In addition to listening to Navy Commander-in-Chief Lee Chieh's
briefing on the NGH work plans, Chen also inspected the NGH's
command-control-communications-intelligence system, also known as
the Tacheng system.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is known for his good rapport with ordinary people,
then lunched together with all NGH staff members at the
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Sources said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) and the
General Staff Headquarters (GSH) have arranged a series of military
units inspection tours for Chen with a view to consolidating his
position as the ROC armed forces' supreme leader.</P>
      <P>Over the next three months, President Chen will make extensive
visits to headquarters of various military branches and combat units
to help the president's gain a better understanding of progress in
the country's military build-up plans and combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to inspect the Army General Headquarters in
Taoyuan, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei, on July 4, and the Air
Force General Headquarters in downtown Taipei in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Chen presided a military review in his capacity as the ROC armed
forces' top leader for the first time at the Chinese Military
Academy in southern Taiwan on June 16. During the review, cadets
from major military academies pledged loyalty to their supreme
leader.</P>
      <P>The president is scheduled to chair a commissioning ceremony for
an IDF (indigenous defense fighters) jet fighter wing at a southern
Taiwan air force base in Tainan.</P>
      <P>On July 27, Chen will preside over the commissioning ceremony
for the Anchorage-class "Hsuhai" dock landing ship, which the Navy
recently leased from the United States.</P>
      <P>In mid-August, Chen will oversee a computer-simulated drill,
code-named the Hankuan No. 16 combined services military exercise, at
the maximum-security Hengshan Command Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen will review a retired servicemen mobilization
drill in late August.</P>
      <P>The MND and the GSH will also arrange detailed defense reports
at the Presidential Office's monthly closed-door military conference.
On Monday, Chen presided over such a meeting at the
Presidential Office in his capacity as the ROC's top military
leader for the first time.</P>
      <P>Military brass said all the programs are aimed at helping Chen
become familiar with the ROC military's defense capability and
military strength on either side of the Taiwan Strait in order to
help him cope with a possible surprise attack from outside or
contingencies within the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OPPOSITION WELCOMES PRESIDENT'S RETURN TO 1992 CONSENSUS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition New Party (NP) and the
People First Party (PFP) on Wednesday welcomed President Chen
Shui-bian's claim that he will embrace the "one China" consensus
agreed upon by Taiwan and mainland China in 1992.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference held in the Legislative Yuan, NP
legislative caucus leader Elmer Feng hailed Chen's flip-flop from a
Taiwan independence advocate before the March 18 presidential
election to his current stance which recognizes the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Feng said the NP gave high marks to Chen's return to the 1992
"one China, separate interpretations" consensus reached by the former
Kuomintang (KMT) government with mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, he suggested that Chen further clarify the term to "one
China principle, separate interpretations as to its meaning" in order
to avoid the dispute provoked by the "special state-to-state
relationship" theory. That proposed change, he said, would be
acceptable to both Taiwan and mainland China and would also be in
line with the spirit of the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>If Chen is hesitant about doing so, or should mainland China be
skeptical of Chen's attitude, the NP stalwart said that he would be
willing to travel to mainland China to help boost conciliation
between the two sides through face-to-face communication with
mainland officials.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislative Caucus Whip Chiu Chuang-liang also said he was
happy to hear Chen's remarks on "one China."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he voiced suspicion about the formation of a
supra-party task force to provide the president with advise on
cross-strait ties, saying it is worth pondering whether the
establishment of such an ad hoc group is contradictory to the
existing National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>Chiu vowed that PFP lawmakers will continue to monitor government
operations and that no PFP legislators will take part in the
supra-party cross-strait task force.</P>
      <P>The remarks were prompted by a discussion on Tuesday between Chen
and William Fuller, chairman of the US think tank Asia Foundation, in
which the president said for the first time that Taiwan would accept
the "one China, separate interpretations" consensus agreed upon in
1992 by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
mainland Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>But Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), also told Fuller that the people of Taiwan
cannot accept Beijing's rhetoric that the so-called "one China"
refers to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He also accused mainland China of withdrawing from the 1992
consensus by reaffirming that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Research
Department, said Chen had no choice but to make such an about-face to
the position upheld earlier by the KMT if he hoped to see the
resumption of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Because of Chen's previous ambiguous attitude toward "one China"
and a lack of lateral thinking to tackle cross-strait issues, Chang
predicted that the prospects of any reopening of two-way negotiations
are slim and that the Chinese communists will continue to watch
Chen's deeds to judge whether Taiwan's new president really
identifies himself as a "Chinese."</P>
      <P>Although he admitted that cross-strait tensions have temporarily
eased at present, Chang warned that a cloud of uncertainty still
casts a shadow over Taiwan-mainland ties.</P>

      <P>Meanwhile, ARATS Vice Chairman Tang Shu-bei reiterated that
Taiwan and mainland China can discuss any issue, as long as the
discussions take place under the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech at the opening of a Guangdong-Taiwan trade
exchange fair held in the mainland city of Dongwan, the mainland's
No. 2 negotiator with Taiwan called on Taiwan businessmen to seize
the opportunities presented at a time when both Taiwan and mainland
China are set to enter the World Trade Organization. He also urged
them to further bolster trade and commercial relations between Taiwan
and Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 businessmen from mainland China, Hong Kong and
Macau, as well as over 1,000 businessmen from Taiwan, took part in
the event, which was also attended by DPP lawmaker Chou Ching-yu,
KMT lawmaker Liao Feng-te and NP lawmaker Hsieh Chi-ta.</P>
      <P>Tang said that the large number of Taiwan businessmen at the
gathering was seen as an indication that complementary economic
cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China will be a mainstream
trend across the strait, and added that he hoped to see an
improvement in cross-strait political relations at a time when
bilateral economic links have become closer and more plentiful.</P>
      <P>At the same time, mainland Chinese experts commented that Chen
has become more pragmatic with his remarks on the consensus of "one
China, separate interpretations." But they pointed out that the
statement alone is not enough to indicate that Taiwan's head of state
is likely to make a major change in his policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Fan Xizhou, head of the Institute of Taiwan Studies
under Ximan University, Chen's remarks sounded very vague and seemed
to be more an attempt to gauge opinion than a policy statement. He
claimed that the remarks should not be viewed as a change in Chen's
stance toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>He backed his claim by referring to the supra-party task force to
be led by Academia Sinica Lee Yuan-tseh, saying that the lineup of
the advisory body and its functions mark a noticeable departure from
Chen's words.</P>
      <P>Fan suggested that Chen indicate a clear and overall recognition
of past two-way exchanges, including the 1992 "one China" consensus,
and make clear his willingness to follow the policy outlined by the
National Unification Guidelines if he truly wants to clarify his
position toward the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LUNG, LIVER CANCERS TOP CANCER DEATHS IN TAIWAN LAST YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)
(By  Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lung and liver cancers topped the list of
fatal malignant tumors last year, the Department of Health (DOH) said
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DOH made the revelation in a report that also stated that
deaths caused by malignant tumors last year stood at 29,784,
accounting for 23.8 percent of all deaths in Taiwan in the period.</P>
      <P>Among them, breast and colon cancer deaths in women grew by 7
percent over the previous year, according to the report. Among the
island's men, meanwhile, oral cancer deaths increased by nearly 10
percent, showing the health dangers posed by chewing betel nuts,
smoking and drinking, the report said.</P>
      <P>DOH officials noted that liver and lung cancers have always been
the top two causes of cancer death in Taiwan, with liver cancer
fatalities topping lung cancer deaths every year except 1994.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that although liver cancer ranked second last
year in terms of cancer fatalities, liver disease is still more
threatening to society than lung cancer, as it tends to strike
middle-aged people who are still breadwinners, while lung cancer
deaths most often occur in older people.</P>
      <P>Sheu Jin-chuan, executive director of Taiwan's Liver Disease
Prevention Foundation, said that liver cancer is often described as
"the silent killer," as victims can often live normally for many
years without knowing that they have the deadly disease.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that at least 3 million people in Taiwan are
unknowing carriers of hepatitis B or C, both of which very often lead
to liver cancer if left untreated.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian's father died of liver
disease, Sheu urged the government to take the lead in promoting
liver disease screening and hepatitis immunization for people over
the age of 20, in order to cut the number of deaths from liver
disease.</P>
      <P>In 1999, lung cancer was the top fatal cancer in Taiwan,
accounting for 27.07 percent of cancer deaths, followed by liver
cancer, which accounted for 26.18 percent.</P>
      <P>Rounding out the top 10 cancer deaths were colon cancer, stomach
cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, oral cancer, prostate cancer,
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer.</P>

      <P>A new version of the NT$1,000 bill will be

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said that the new version of the NT$1,000 note will

the indigenous landscape and wildlife preservation.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the new NT$1,000 bill will have many

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  28  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prime Minister John Howard said his
government will boost spending on defense in the face of instability
on the Korean Peninsula, in the Taiwan Strait, and in South Asia.</P>
      <P>The Australian government is expected to spend between US$50 and
US$70 billion over the next 20 years to replace all of the country's
71 F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters, its P-3C transport aircraft,
amphibious support ships, six guided missile frigates, and its
wheeled vehicles and small arms.</P>
      <P>Howard on Tuesday told Parliament that after last year's
successful peacekeeping mission in East Timor, the public interest in
defense is at its highest level in more than two decades.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the Australian community would back bigger
defense budgets and mentioned that the introduction of a 10 percent
goods and services tax would allow higher spending on Australian
defense.</P>
      <P>"I don't think those reforms are going to damage our capacity to
spend more on essential public provisions, of which defense is
obviously one. I simply make the point that defense has to assume a
larger place in our spending and our national priorities," he said.</P>
      <P>Potential flash points in the Taiwan Strait, on the Korean
Peninsula, and in South Asia, along with the current political chaos
in Fiji and the Solomon Islands and the instability in Papua New
Guinea and Indonesia, are expected to prompt Canberra to spend more
on defense.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is set to release about 1700
boat people from detention centers after they are classified as
genuine refugees, said Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the release is unprecedented since the Australian
government set an annual intake quota of 12,000 immigrants on a
humanitarian basis several decades ago.</P>
      <P>The 1700 to be released account for more than 50 percent of the
3100 boat people still being held at various detention centers around
Australia since the middle of 1999.</P>
      <P>At the height of the influx of illegal migrants into Australia,
the number of detainees stood at around 4,000.</P>
      <P>Ruddock said the 1700 boat people would be released gradually
over the next six weeks beginning next Monday, adding that they will
be resettled to Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia,
Canberra, Northern Territory, and Tasmania.</P>
      <P>About 400 of the remaining 1,400 detainees will be deported
because they were unable to prove they are in genuine danger of
persecution in their home country or they failed health or character
assessments. The fate of the remaining detainees is still up in the

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is speeding up plans to
open its stock markets to foreign investors with an approach similar
to that carried out by Taiwan and India when they made a similar
move, reported The Australian Financial Review on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, the daily reported that new rules
being prepared by the China Securities Regulatory Commission will
allow foreign investors to buy Chinese shares through a qualified
foreign institutional investor scheme.</P>
      <P>During the first phase of the opening of its stock market to
foreign investment, Taiwan also allowed foreign investors to buy
stocks through qualified institutional investors in order to regulate
the local market and prevent volatility due to large-scale
speculation as a result of a possible large-scale influx of foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its stock market successfully with that
step-by-step approach and has so far limited speculation, analysts
said.</P>
      <P>India also took a similar path when opening its stock market to
foreign investors.</P>
      <P>The daily reported foreign investors would be allowed access to
more than 900 A-class listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
exchanges, which together have a market capitalization of US$240
billion.</P>
      <P>The daily reported this massive influx of overseas capital into
the equity markets might be overshadowed by record levels of foreign
direct investment in local firms as a result of China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley
Witter in Hong Kong, as saying that he "wouldn't be surprised if
foreign direct investment easily surpassed the US$42 billion record
hit in 1997."</P>
      <P>"With China now beginning to implement a broad range of
market-opening reforms negotiated as part of its WTO deal, foreign
investors simply do not want to miss gaining a toehold in a market
containing 20 percent of the world's population," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER SPEAKER OF CHIAYI COUNTY COUNCIL SENTENCED TO JAIL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former speaker of Chiayi County Council
was sentence to separate jail terms of two years and four months on
Wednesday for rigging an election of a local farmers association and
obtaining fraudulent loans from that association.</P>
      <P>However, to the great surprise of the prosecutor, a three-judge
panel in Chiayi District Court acquitted Hsiao of the more serious
charges of racketeering and extortion.</P>
      <P>The court sentenced Hsiao six months imprisonment for rigging the
election of the Taipao City Farmers' Association in Chiayi County by
offering bribes. Additionally, it sentenced him to two years
imprisonment for getting loans from the same association through
phantom members.</P>
      <P>According to the court's verdict, Hsiao should serve only two
years and four months.</P>
      <P>A total of 49 representatives and staff of the Taipao City
Farmers' Association were convicted as Hsiao's accomplices in the
case, and were given jail terms varying from three months to six
months, and can be converted into fines.</P>
      <P>The court's verdict capped a trial of nearly seven months
duration. Hsiao, who was detained during the trial, was ordered to
remain in custody because of the risk of his fleeing.</P>
      <P>The former council speaker was originally accused of being
engaged in organized crime, including kidnapping for ransom and
acting as a bookie for professional baseball games. But he went into
hiding on Dec. 20, 1996, before police could arrest him.</P>
      <P>Displaying blatant contempt for the law, he subsequently
reappeared in Chiayi Council to preside over an extraordinary session
during which the council members were entitled to immunity from
prosecution. He then vanished into thin air after the 12-day session.</P>
      <P>He successful eluded arrest some four times, including a
large-scale manhunt led by Prosecutor General Lu Ren-fa. He was the
first council speaker in Taiwan to be described by law enforcement
authorities as "cruel and dangerous" in their "wanted" posters.</P>
      <P>He surrendered to prosecutors on September 17, 1999, and was
spared the humiliation of being sent to the maximum security prison
on Green Island, a common place of detainment for other leading
mobsters.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was absent from Wednesday's sentencing session. Both he and
the prosecutor can appeal the sentence within ten days.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Wednesday
that the Republic of China and the United States share common
interests in safeguarding Taiwan's security and maintaining
peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with visiting American Legion
President Alan G. Lance, who arrived in Taipei earlier this week at
the head of a delegation of senior executives of the noted US
veterans organization.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen expressed his gratitude for Lance's
loud support for the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA), which is
still pending approval of US Congress.</P>
      <P>"No matter whether the bill can pass Congress or not, I believe
that all the concern and support expressed in the process of
congressional discussion will be the best guarantee to our national
security," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that improving relations across the Taiwan Strait is his
administration's moral obligation, Chen said he has been handling
cross-strait issues with great prudence.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that mending cross-strait difference and
maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait are common expecations of all
of civilian Taiwan residents, military servicemen and their
families," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his admiration for the extensive care
offered by the US government to its retired soldiers, adding that
the new ROC government will continue improving vocational assistance
and welfare services for military retirees.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he hopes the traditional cordial ties between
Taiwan and the American Legion can be further strengthened in the
future.</P>
      <P>In response, Lance lauded Chen for his efforts to promote
cross-strait dialogue. "We hope peaceful cross-strait dialogue can
be resumed in the near future through concerted efforts from various

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's acceptance of the "one China, respective interpretations"
consensus with Beijing marks a positive step toward the resumption of
cross-strait interactions, said a US think tank expert on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Edwin J. Feulner Jr., chairman of The Heritage Foundation, a
conservative Washington-based think tank that retains friendly ties
with Taiwan, told ROC Deputy Foreign Minister David Lee during a
courtesy call that he hopes mainland Chinese leaders can sense Chen's
good will.</P>
      <P>However, Feulner added that cross-strait issues can only be
resolved by Taipei and Beijing without the interference of a third
party, no matter how much the international community hopes that the
two sides will soon resume talks.</P>
      <P>Chen said on Tuesday that his government is willing to accept a
1992 consensus with Beijing that each side of the Taiwan Strait can
adhere to its own interpretation of the meaning of "one China."</P>
      <P>Chen also chided Beijing for its current insistence on the "one
China" principle, which downgrades the Republic of China to a
local-level government under the People's Republic of China. Chen
said that the people of Taiwan would never accept such an
arrangement.</P>
      <P>Feulner, who witnessed the historic summit between the two Korean
leaders on June 13, said that he hopes the summit will serve as a
good example for Taiwan and mainland China and that it will encourage
both sides to resume a constructive dialogue.</P>
      <P>Feulner added that during a meeting with senior government
officials in Beijing, he had urged the mainland's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to reciprocate a 1998
visit by Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF). ARATS and SEF
are semi-official agencies that serve as channels of communication
between Taipei and Beijing in the absence of formal ties.</P>
      <P>Feulner concluded that a resumption of cross-strait interaction
must be based on a foundation of mutual good will. Closer relations
and more binding mutual interests from years of trade and cultural
exchanges between the two sides should allow for more discussions and
interactions, he added.</P>

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after receiving Senegal Ambassador Ahmed

      <P>The ambassador noted that Senegal's major fishing base at Dakar

      <P>Association Secretary General Fu Hsin-fu said that most of
Taiwan's large deep-water fishing ships have used Cape Town, South
Africa, as their supply base. But he noted that Dakar has several
advantages, including its proximity to rich fishing grounds, cheaper
oil prices , and secure social order. He added that the port will be
very accommodating to the needs of Taiwan fishing vessels.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 20 Taiwan large deep-sea fishing vessels
stop regularly in Dakar for repairs and supply.</P>
      <P>Kane said that as Senegal steps up its campaign to boost

deep-sea fishing vessels to call in Dakar for refueling, purchasing
fish bait, and recruiting local workers to serve as crew members.</P>
      <P>There are around 200 Taiwan large deep-sea tuna ships operating

    <HEADLINE>INTELLIGENCE STAFF URGED TO HELP BOOST MAINLAND'S DEMOCRATIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
encouraged the Republic of china's intelligence staff to help push
for mainland China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call during an inspection tour of the Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB).</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that mainland China's military
build-up and its resistance to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan are the biggest threat to the ROC's national security and
sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MIB is the ROC's sole officially authorized
agency to operate mainland China-related intelligence work, Chen
said he hopes that the MIB can learn from the prevailing world
trend of promoting peaceful evolution in repressive countries.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the MIB staff take advantage of
pro-democracy force within mainland China to spread democratic ideas
and advocate democratic political reforms.</P>
      <P>"I believe that pushing for mainland China's democratization and
denouncement of one-party dictatorship and military expansionism is
the most effective way to narrow the ideological gap between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen also promised to promote the legislation of an intelligence
staff protection law as soon as possible to better protect their
rights and interests.</P>
      <P>The MIB was the first stop of Chen's new military units
inspection tour designed by the Ministry of National Defense and the
General Staff Headquarters with a view to helping Chen become
familiar with the country's overall defense affairs and
consolidating his position as the ROC armed force's top leader.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen made a similar inspection tour of the
Navy General Headquarters in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China has apparently changed its naval force
development goal from "offshore defense" to building up a deep-sea
naval fleet.</P>
      <P>Noting that the adjustment in Beijing's naval force build-up
strategy is mainly aimed at beefing up its capability to take Taiwan
by force and developing itself into a naval power, Chen urged all
ROC naval officers to brace up to cope with the new challenges ahead.</P>
      <P>"In addition to completing renovation of our naval fleet as
scheduled, we should also work out medium- and long-range naval
force development plans," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE FROM MAINLAND CHINA IMPOSSIBLE: DALAI LAMA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is impossible for Taiwan to be
fully independent from mainland China, the Dalai Lama said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's close cultural and economic affinity with
mainland China, it is unimaginable that the island could be separated
from mainland China and become fully independent, the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader said.</P>
      <P>Noting that he had visited Taiwan in 1997 and was favorably
impressed by its well-entrenched democracy, booming economy and
highly-developed education system, the Dalai Lama urged Taiwan to
"look before you leap" and define the meaning of "one China" before
resuming a dialogue with Beijing.</P>
      <P>He also called on leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
cast aside their personal feelings and deal with each other sensibly.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama expressed interest in visiting the island this
year and said that he looks forward to meeting with President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan religious leader is presiding over a three-day
meeting to promote Buddhism in Los Angeles from June 28-30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS AGREE TO ENFORCE FIVE-DAY WORK WEEK FROM 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition caucuses in the
Legislative Yuan (parliament) on Wednesday agreed that a five-day
workweek system be enforced from Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>At present, the five-day workweek is implemented only for the
second and fourth weeks of each month.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers decided to amend the Public Employee Service Law to
introduce the new system, under which annual holidays for public
servants will be increased to 115-116 days.</P>
      <P>The second and third readings of the amendment to the law will
take place on June 30.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Premier Tang Fei instructed the Central
Personnel Administration to work out complementary measures to comply
with the implementation of the five-day workweek next year.</P>
      <P>The government was originally scheduled to enforce the new system
from 2002, but lawmakers recently decided to implement it one year
ahead of schedule following their success in cutting the weekly
working hours for private sector employees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN SCIENTISTS MAKE BREAKTHROUGH IN ORGAN TRANSPLANT RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 27 (CNA)
(By N. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of Canadian scientists may be on the
verge of a breakthrough that could eliminate the body's urge to
reject organ transplants.</P>
      <P>Their findings, which will be published in the July issue of the
US monthly journal Nature Medicine, could also eventually help
scientists cure auto immune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis, said Dr. Gary Levy, director of the multi-organ transplant
program at Toronto General Hospital.</P>
      <P>Finding a way to stop the body's rejection of transplanted organs
has been regarded as the holy grail of transplantation research. The
body's immune system detects and attacks any foreign tissue, so
people who have received a donor organ have to take powerful and
costly drugs to suppress that immune reaction for the rest of their
lives.</P>
      <P>Suppressing the immune system leaves patients far more
susceptible to viruses, bacteria or whatever ailment is making the
rounds.</P>
      <P>The Toronto team, led by Dr. Li Zhang, has identified a
particular type of white blood cell that can regulate the killer
white blood cells which attack and destroy foreign tissue. The newly
identified T-cells were found in the spleens of mice, which were the
subject of her research.</P>
      <P>These newly identified T-cells trick killer T-cells into
attacking them rather than the transplanted tissue. In the process,
the killer T-cells are destroyed, leaving the transplanted organ
unaffected and the body's ability to protect itself against other
threats intact.</P>
      <P>Using their findings, the team has been able to successfully
transplant skin -- the toughest organ to transplant -- in mice.</P>
      <P>"There is a great potential for using this method in transplant
patients in future," said Zhang, a senior scientist at Toronto
General Hospital Research Institute. She is also an assistant
professor in the department of laboratory medicine and pathobiology
at the University of Toronto.</P>
      <P>Kevin Young, a Ph.D. student working on Zhang's team, cautioned
that while the findings are promising, it is too soon to say whether
this process will work in humans.</P>
      <P>"What we've discovered works in mice, but we have to try it with
different organs in mice, and then there's been no work done in
humans," he noted.</P>
      <P>Still, Levy predicted applications leading from Zhang's research
could be ready for use within a few years. He also said the findings
could help unlock the secret to turning off auto immune diseases --
conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or lupus where the body
attacks itself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT MEET WITH MARGARET THATCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui met with Lady Margaret Thatcher, former prime minister of
the United Kingdom, on Wednesday to exchange views on world affairs.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Lady Thatcher Foundation in downtown
London said that the two former leaders have known each other for
some time. They reminisced about their past experiences, and also
discussed current world events, the official added.</P>
      <P>Thatcher visited Taiwan in 1992 and 1996, after stepping down as
British prime minister in 1990.</P>
      <P>However, the spokesman insisted that the two did not discuss
Taiwan politics in the wake of March 18 presidential election during
their 40-minute meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife Tseng Wen-hui, their granddaughter Lee Kun-yi,
former Deputy Secretary General to the President Lin Bih-jaw, and the
ROC's Representative to Britain Cheng Wen-hua, arrived at the
foundation at around 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>Lee had kept a low profile throughout his visit to the
foundation. He only smiled before and after his meeting with
Thatcher, and did not make any remarks to the press.</P>
      <P>After the visit, the Lees drove past Buckingham Palace and
Westminster Abbey for a visit to the British Parliament, where they
had lunch with British legislators.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to visit the British Museum in the afternoon,
and tour Oxford and Cambridge Universities on Thursday, if his
schedule permits.</P>
      <P>Lee departed for London on Tuesday for a six-day private visit,
his first overseas trip after leaving office on May 20.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Lee will be granted a honorary membership in
the Joseph A. Schumpeter Academic Forum in Manchester, which is in
northwestern England. He will deliver a speech at the private
foundation on June 29 on Taiwan's political and economic development
since World War II.</P>
      <P>He and his wife will also attend the commencement ceremony of
their granddaughter Lee Kun-yi at a British senior high school near
Birmingham in central England.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO MAJOR OPPOSITION SPURN SPECIAL PANEL ON CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang, the major Republic of China
opposition party, joined forces with another opposition party on
Wednesday in declining to take part in a panel designed to build a
consensus on policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said on Wednesday that the
so-called supra-party panel aimed at advising the president on
mainalnd China policy is a non-government organization without any
legal basis, and would usurp the authority of the government's
National Unification Council.</P>
      <P>He said that the KMT has neither been consulted about the new
panel's functions nor been invited to take part in it. Lin said that
the party's opinion is that would be better to work out the
government's policy by authorized government agencies.</P>
      <P>Asked if that means the KMT will not join the panel chaired by
Lee Yuan-tseh, president of the Academia Sinica, Lin said, "You can
interpret it in that way."</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after the People's First Party (PFP),
another opposition party, ruled out the possibility of joining a
non-government panel that has no legal authority to turn out a
binding decision.</P>
      <P>Branding the controversial claims by former president Lee
Teng-hui for a "special state-to-state" basis for cross-strait
relations as the brainchild of non-government organizations, PFP head
James Soong said that the new panel could degenerate into an
opportunity for political horse-trading rather than a forum for
policy discussion.</P>
      <P>Soong added that his party will not extend any legitimacy to the
panel by joining it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF: ROC PRESIDENT'S STAND TOWARD PRC IS CONSISTENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai
Eng-wen said on Wednesday that President Chen Shui-bian's basic
stance toward mainland China has been consistent and remains
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Tsai called a press conference to clarify speculation that Chen
might have softened his stand on the development of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen told an American visitor on Tuesday that Taipei is ready to
accept a 1992 consensus allowing each side of the Taiwan Strait for
"respective interpretations" on "one China."</P>
      <P>His statement received favorable comments from the Kuomintang and
the People First Party, but drew criticism from Chen's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Chen's statement on Tuesday was consistent with
remarks he made on the issue on May 20 and June 20. The MAC head
pointed out that Beijing's goal of downgrading Taiwan to the level of
a local province belonging to the People's Republic of China is
unacceptable to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman-elect Frank Hsieh said on Wednesday that
Chen's statement is not contradictory to the DPP's policy on mainland
China affairs, although it is still some distance away.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as Chen does not actually retreat from the
party's policy, the DPP welcomes him to adjust his stance on the
issue. Hsieh added that Chen's statement might be interpreted as a
goodwill gesture toward Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER MAY MAKE GOODWILL JOURNEY TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has tentatively agreed to a
possible visit by Taiwan's Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
to promote "Track II" interaction across the Taiwan Strait, an
opposition lawmaker said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Horng-chi of the Kuomintang, the Republic of
China's ruling party until May 20, said he broached the idea to a
well-placed mainland official during his just-concluded visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"I told the mainland official that Taiwan's Legislative Yuan can
now serve as an effective channel for unofficial 'Track II'
cross-strait dialogue," Chen said, adding that the mainland official
gave a warm response to his proposal.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT lost to the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in the March 18 presidential election, it
still enjoys a comfortable majority in the Legislative Yuan,
Taiwan's parliament. The KMT favors an eventual unification of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait under freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen said interaction between the two officially authorized
intermediary bodies -- Taipei's Straits exchange Foundation (SEF) and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
-- has long been stalled.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that the Legislative Yuan can now serve as a
conduit for cross-strait communications," Chen said, adding that
Beijing authorities have shown keen interest in the Taiwan
legislature's possible role in future cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had suggested that Legislative Yuan Presdient Wang,
also a KMT vice chairman, make a goodwill journey to mainland China
as a representative of the Taiwan public to help break the current
cross-strait logjam.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the well-placed mainland official gave a
thumbs-up to the proposal, describing the idea as "feasible."</P>
      <P>Chen, however, would not identify the mainland official with a
view to avoiding any unnecessary troubles.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's recommendation, Wang said whether he would
represent the legislature to make a visit to the mainland cannot be
mulled until after the chamber's planned mainland policy task force
is formally inaugurated.</P>
      <P>"If the proposed task force agrees to Chen's proposal, I will
make a decision on whether to make a journey to the mainland,"
Wang said, adding that in making a final decision, he will take
into account the state of cross-strait relations at the time.</P>
      <P>ARATS President Wang Daohan, also mainland China's top
negotiator with Taiwan, originally planned to visit Taiwan last
autumn to reciprocate a landmark visit to the mainland in October
1998 by his Taiwan counterpart, SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing announced an indefinite postponement of Wang's
visit after former ROC President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state relationship" last July as
mainland leaders interpreted the definition as a move to promote
Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SENATE CALLS ON CHINA TO RELEASE UIGHUR BUSINESSWOMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US House of Representatives
International Relations Committee on Wednesday marked up Senate
Concurrent Resolution 81, urging Communist China to immediately
release Rabiya Kadeer, a prominent ethnic Uighur businesswoman, and
to allow her, her secretary, and her son to leave mainland China.</P>
      <P>The resolution can now move forward and be scheduled to be voted
on by the full House of Representatives. The Senate passed the
resolution on May 2.</P>
      <P>Rabiya Kadeer, her secretary, and her son were arrested last
August outside a hotel in the city of Urumqi as she was attempting to
meet a group of US congressional staff staying there. Her husband
Sidik Rouzi, who has lived in the United States since 1996 and works
for Radio Free Asia, has been critical of Communist China's policies
toward the Uighurs in Xinjiang, pointed out the resolution.</P>
      <P>The Uighur businesswoman was sentenced on March 10 to eight years
in prison for the crime of "illegally giving state information across
the border." Reports indicate that her son was sent to a labor camp
last November for two years without trial for "supporting Uighur
separatism," and her secretary was recently sentenced to three years
in a labor camp. Reports also indicate that Kadeer's health may be at
risk.</P>
      <P>Since Communist China has signed the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, which forbids arbitrary arrest and
detention, the resolution said, the US Congress calls on the
government of the People's Republic of China to immediately release
Kadeer, her secretary, and her son, and to permit them to move to the
United States, if they so desire.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DONATE TIGERS TO AUSTRALIAN ZOO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is set to donate at
least 10 tigers to Australia for the first time in a bid to write off
its image as a place where the widespread killing of animals occurs.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Thursday, Dr. Kurtis Pei,
associate professor of the Department of Wildlife Conservation at the
National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, said the Mogo
Zoological Garden in Canberra had asked for more than 20 tigers from
his school so that it could help protect the animals on the one hand
and attract more people to see them on the other hand.</P>
      <P>But the university presently only has a total of 31 tigers under
its care and can only afford to donate 10 tigers to the Australian
zoo, Pei said.</P>
      <P>"This will be the biggest donation from Taiwan to a foreign
country since we started our animal conservation and management
program in Pingtung," Pei said.</P>
      <P>In 1993, the university installed facilities to reproduce,
protect, and breed animals, including orangutans, gibbons, and
tigers, in order to showcase Taiwan efforts at caring for the
island's animals. The university now has more than 420 animals under
its care.</P>
      <P>Pei on Wednesday went to see the facilities and holding grounds
of the Mogo Zoo in Canberra.</P>
      <P>Pingtung University, aside from breeding animals, has provided
temporary loans of its animals, to other countries for educational
purposes.</P>
      <P>So far it has loaned out tigers, gibbons, and orangutans to
Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. And it will also
loan animals to Britain, Australia, and New Zealand in the coming
weeks and months, Pei said.</P>
      <P>"I hope this donation will be a good start for the long-term
cooperation between Taiwan and Australia in conserving, breeding and
reproducing animals," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MILITARY TO HOLD 'HANKUANG NO. 16' EXERCISE IN MID-AUGUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China military is
scheduled to conduct a combined services exercise in northern Taiwan
in mid-August, Vice Chief of the General Staff Wang Han-ning said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the report during a closed-door meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Wang was quoted as having told lawmakers that the planned
combined services drill, code-named Hankuang (Chinese Glory) No. 16
military exercise, is a routine annual event.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers quoted Wang as saying at the meeting that this year's
Hankuang series of exercise will focus on correcting defects exposed
in the 1999 drill.</P>
      <P>According to legislators, Wang said the Hankuang No. 16 exercise
will place emphasis on minimizing malfunction of any weaponry system,
improving communications among various participating military units
and practicing electronic warfare, anti-guided missile and other
moder combat skills and tactics.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will personally review and
oversee the combined services maneuvering in his capacity as the
ROC armed forces' top leader. The drill will be conducted in the
Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli area in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang also said the routine exercise is not expected to have any
adverse impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait, adding that
the disclosure of information about the drill is part of the
Taiwan's efforts to foster a good atmosphere for cross-strait
interaction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said a series of civil air drills, code-named
Wan-An No. 23 exercise, will be held in various parts of the
island between July and August.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, some lawmakers expressed doubts about
President Chen's "offshore defense" concept.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said the "offshore defense" strategy is an
active defense strategy aimed at avoiding bringing war to a country's
own territory.</P>
      <P>President Chen mentioned the "offshore defense" concept while
making his first-ever military review as the supreme leader of the
ROC's armed forces at the Chinese Military Academy in southern Taiwan
on June 16.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the "offshore defense" strategy is a common
military goal pursued by nearly all countries around the world.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, a Ministry of National Defense also pointed out that
the ROC military's current combat guidelines are centered around
"foiling invading troops at sea or thwarting them on beachheads."</P>
      <P>In the future, the official said, the military will establish a
strong deterrent force to effectively dissuade enemy troops
(referring mainly to mainland Chinese armed forces) from launching an
attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is an active defense strategy with a view to discouraging
enemy forces from leaving the other side of the Taiwan Strait or
foiling them once they cross over the center line of the strait," the
official said, adding that this is also the gist of the "offshore
defense" strategy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS EUROPE VISIT 'VERY FRUITFUL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said on
Thursday that his just-concluded visits to the Republic of China's
only two diplomatic allies in Europe -- Macedonia and the Vatican --
were very fruitful.</P>
      <P>Tien said he met with many people whom he desired to see. "I'm
satisfied with the results of my first overseas trip since taking
office," the scholar-turned-minister said, adding that the results
were even beyond his original expectations.</P>
      <P>During his 10-day, two-leg visit, Tien met with senior
Macedonian and Vatican officials for extensive talks on matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that cementing ties with Macedonia is very
important. "Our relationship with Macedonia can serve as a showcase
to other neighboring Balkan countries," Tien noted, adding that it
can also help upgrade the ROC's international image.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations with the Vatican, Tien said the ROC
should make every possible efforts to maintain close ties with
the Holy See.</P>
      <P>Noting that the world has more than 1 billion Catholics,
Tien said the Vatican has enormous influence not only on European
countries but also on many Central and South American nations.</P>
      <P>The Vatican is known to have been negotiating with mainland
China for establishing diplomatic ties. Tien said although the
Beijing-Vatican talks have been hindered by their great differences
about religious freedom and rights to ordain Catholic clergy, the
ROC should keep wary of mainland China's possible sabotage of
Taipei-Vatican ties.</P>
      <P>During his talks with his Vatican counterpart, Tien
said Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran assured him that if
Taipei-Diplomatic ties will have any adjustments, the Holy See will
certainly inform the ROC in advance.</P>
      <P>While in Macedonia, Tien held an undisclosed meeting with
Macedonian President Boris Trajkovski. Tien said the meeting was kept
secret mainly because of Macedonia's domestic political situation.</P>
      <P>Tien also signed an agreement with Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov on the establishment of a US$10 million fund to
help Macedonia develop its battered economy.</P>
      <P>As for former ROC President Lee Teng-hui's current visit
to Britain, Tien said he was not particularly surprised by Beijing's
outrageous reaction to Lee's first post-retirement overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Tien said British authorities' handling of Lee's visit and
Beijing's strong protests are "satisfactory." The minister also
stressed that Lee's itinerary was arranged by the Taiwan Research
Institute, a private think tank of which Lee is an honorary chairman.
According to Tien, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has only provided
Lee with necessary assistance and convenience.</P>
      <P>Britain recognizes Beijing, but maintains close substantive ties
with the ROC. "We hope countries that maintain diplomatic ties with
mainland China can resist its pressure and continue forging close
cooperative relations with us," he added.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his wife and several close aides, Lee left for
London on Tuesday for a six-day private visit, his first overseas
visit since stepping down from the presidency on May 20.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wei Chi-lin, secretary general of the
Executive Yuan, said Thursday that the current poor performance of
Taiwan's stock market is only temporary, because the economic
fundamentals are pretty good.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after top officials of the Ministry of
Finance, the Central Bank of China, and the Ministry of Economic
Affairs met in an emergency meeting on the stock market situations.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchanges
has dropped about 20 percent in the past two months to close at
8,120.89 Thursday.</P>
      <P>He told the press that the officials who attended the meeting
were optimistic about the stock market and that they attributed the
market slump to investors' lack of confidence.</P>
      <P>Wei said the market performance will soon return to normal,
because the fundamentals of the economy are good.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the economy grew 7.93 percent in the first
quarter of this year, the best performance in nine years. The
economy is expected to grow 6.73 per cent this year.</P>
      <P>Wei also pointed out that the business revenues of listed

a year earlier.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics released by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the investment made by the private sector in the first three
months of this year was 15 percent more than a year earlier, he said.
Total private sector investment is expected to grow 13 percent in
2000, he added.</P>
      <P>Exports from Taiwan in the first five months of this year hiked
22 percent over the same period of last year, Wei said, adding that

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian made an
inspection tour of Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung on
Thursday as part of his nationwide grassroots "reach-out" travel
program.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan and
several other local political heavyweights, Chen first arrived on
the county's offshore township of Hsiaoliuchiou by a ferry boat early
in the morning.</P>
      <P>This was Chen's second visit to the small isle off the southern
Taiwan coast in three months to show his concern about local
residents' living conditions.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that Hsiaoliuchiou is a "jewel on the
sea," not an isolated isle. "You are not alone. I'm always with
you," he added emotionally.</P>
      <P>Chen attended a special sailboat worshiping rite at the
Taoist Sanlung Temple in Hsiaoliuchiou to pray for the nation's
well-being. He said his administration is a government for all people
and will take care of the benefits of all ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has
set aside budget in its budget plan for the coming fiscal year for
purchasing a second ferry boat for Hsiaoliuchiou residents. At
present, the offshore fishing township has only a ferry boat for
links with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen also promised to urge relevant government agencies to
improve drinking water supply for Hsiaoliuchiou residents.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen toured eel cultivation ranches and dairy
farms in Pingtung County's Hsinyuan and Wantan villages before
returning to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen, who assumed office on May 20, began his nationwide
grassroots "reach-out" tour on Tuesday, with a sandbar off the coast
of Chiayi County in southwestern Taiwan as his first stop.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP VICE CHIEF `OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED': ACADEMIA SINICA PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
highest academic body, said on Thursday that People First Party (PFP)
Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung should feel ashamed of his "improper
remarks" about the institute.</P>
      <P>Chang, a noted cardiologist who had just returned from a six-week
visit to the United States, told a news conference that some US-based
Academia Sinica academicians have alleged that Academia Sinica's
research level fails even to meet the standard of a second-class
American university.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chang's remarks, Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh said it was wrong for Chang to recount such criticism,
since he has "never set foot in the institute."</P>
      <P>Lee, a Taiwan-born co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for
chemistry, said the US-based Science Magazine published two in-depth
reports in recent issues on Academia Sinica's overall development,
based on interviews with him and some researchers.</P>
      <P>"I advise Chang to read these articles first before making any
criticism of Academia Sinica," said Taiwan's foremost scholar.
"Science Magazine has given a positive evaluation of the institute's
progress in recent years."</P>
      <P>Lee, who ended an enviable research career in the United States
and returned to Taiwan to assume his current post about six years
ago, said Academia Sinica's research in dynamic chemistry has reached
the highest international level.</P>
      <P>"Its research in astronomy has drawn world attention and its
Institute of Molecular Biology's outstanding research results in life
sciences have attracted many foreign universities to send executives
to Taiwan with a view to recruiting the institute's research fellows
to join their faculty rosters," Lee went on.</P>
      <P>He stressed that while Academia Sinica probably has not yet
achieved the level of the world's top-rate universities, it truly has
made remarkable progress in the past five or six years.</P>
      <P>Touching on Chang's criticism of the slow progress in Taiwan's
educational reform, Lee, a member of a Cabinet-level educational
reform advisory panel, said all 30 of its panelists have worked very
hard over the past couple of years.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, all the panelists, including himself, have
often traveled around the island to promote educational reform. "In
fact, we have made significant progress in educational reform,
particularly in elementary education," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former Chang Gung University president, served as
independent presidential candidate James Soong's running mate in the
March 18 election. The Soong-Chang team lost to the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) candidates, Chen Shui-bian and
Annette Lu, by a narrow margin. Encouraged by their supporters, Soong
and Chang then formed the PFP in late March.</P>
      <P>Chang said that during his just-concluded US visit, he met with
many academics, including some Academia Sinica members. "I was
surprised to find that many of those scholars were more critical of
Lee than of Chen," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee threw his support behind Chen in the final stage of the hotly
contested election, and his endorsement was widely believed to have
helped Chen to win the presidency. Both Soong and Chang left for the
United States on the eve of Chen's May 20 inauguration.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should return to the path
set under the Guidelines for National Unification by the Kuomintang
(KMT) if it is unable to break the current impasse with mainland
China, a KMT official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Should the present government led by the pro-unification
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) be unable to find a way to deal
with the "one China, separate interpretations" consensus agreed upon
by the former KMT government with mainland China in 1992, President
Chen Shui-bian should consider adopting the policy set under the
Guidelines for National Unification, according to Chang Jong-kung,
director of the KMT's Mainland Research Department.</P>
      <P>Chang also criticized Chen for lacking a consistent policy toward
mainland China, claiming that this uncertainty will not help
stabilize the situation across the Taiwan Strait and benefit the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Much to the surprise of observers, Chen told visiting Asia
Foundation Chairman William Fuller on Tuesday that he would embrace
the 1992 "one China, separate interpretations" consensus.</P>
      <P>But Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called an
emergency news conference later that day in which she pointed out
that Taiwan and mainland China have never reached any consensus on
the "one China" principle, and stressed that the people of Taiwan
cannot accept Beijing's position that "there is only one China, and
`one China' refers to the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the now-ruling DPP government's refusal to
accept the "one China, separate interpretations" as a basis for
negotiations and its attempts to discuss the meaning of "one China"
with the mainland will directly touch on the hardest and most
sensitive issue for both sides, provoking further cross-strait
tension.</P>
      <P>The KMT official suggested that Chen follow in the footsteps of
the KMT, temporarily put aside the discussion of the "one China"
dispute, and immediately reopen talks on technical issues with
mainland China as a means of helping forge peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US states of Delaware, Maryland and
Kansas are to open representative offices in Taiwan, the American
State Offices Association (ASOA) announced on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The three states will jointly announce the grand opening of their
representative offices at a news conference on Monday at the Taipei
World Trade Center, the ASOA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>In addition to bringing the total number of US state
representative offices in Taiwan to 22, the opening of the three
offices also represents a giant step toward a closer trade
relationship between Taiwan and the United States, according to the
ASOA.</P>
      <P>Two-way Taiwan-US trade reached US$50 billion in 1999, with the
United States being Taiwan's largest trade partner and Taiwan the US'
seventh-largest trade partner. Taiwan is also the fifth-biggest
market for US agricultural products.</P>

      <P>The government should return to the path
set under the Guidelines for National Unification by the Kuomintang
(KMT) if it is unable to break the current impasse with mainland
China, a KMT official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Should the present government led by the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) be unable to find a way to deal
with the "one China, separate interpretations" consensus agreed upon
by the former KMT government with mainland China in 1992, President
Chen Shui-bian should consider adopting the policy set under the
Guidelines for National Unification, according to Chang Jong-kung,
director of the KMT's Mainland Research Department.
 Chang also criticized Chen for lacking a consistent policy toward
mainland China, claiming that this uncertainty will not help
stabilize the situation across the Taiwan Strait and benefit the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Much to the surprise of observers, Chen told visiting Asia
Foundation Chairman William Fuller on Tuesday that he would embrace
the 1992 "one China, separate interpretations" consensus.</P>
      <P>But Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen called an
emergency news conference later that day in which she pointed out
that Taiwan and mainland China have never reached any consensus on
the "one China" principle, and stressed that the people of Taiwan
cannot accept Beijing's position that "there is only one China, and
`one China' refers to the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the now-ruling DPP government's refusal to
accept the "one China, separate interpretations" as a basis for
negotiations and its attempts to discuss the meaning of "one China"
with the mainland will directly touch on the hardest and most
sensitive issue for both sides, provoking further cross-strait
tension.</P>
      <P>The KMT official suggested that Chen follow in the footsteps of
the KMT, temporarily put aside the discussion of the "one China"
dispute, and immediately reopen talks on technical issues with
mainland China as a means of helping forge peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO IMPLEMENT NATIONAL PENSION SYSTEM NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition caucuses in the
Republic of China Legislative Yuan decided on Thursday to introduce a
national pension system from Jan. 1 next year.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan agreed to accept the proposal by the
lawmakers, and consequently withdrew its own draft of a "provisional
statute for welfare allowances for the elderly" from the legislature.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian promised during his election campaign
that if he won the election, he would provide NT$3,000 (US$97) per
month for every man and woman aged 65 or over from July 1.</P>
      <P>However, the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party opposed
the provisional statue, and decided to submit their own proposals
regarding welfare allowances.</P>
      <P>Anticipating a heated clash on the issue in Friday's legislative
session, the legislators from both the ruling and opposition parties
put their heads together to find a better solution.</P>
      <P>They agreed that if the Cabinet would withdraw its provisional
statute, the bills submitted by other parties would also be
withdrawn, and the lawmakers would push for implementation of a
national pension system from Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said that it will be possible for the government
to enforce the national pension system from Jan. 1, and he instructed
related agencies to resolve two problems -- the source of funding and
the model to be applied to the new system.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party stressed that the
cancellation of the NT$3,000 welfare allowance for the aged should
not be interpreted as a breach of Chen's election promise, and
claimed that the national pension system, once implemented, will
actually provide more benefits for the aged.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is required to present the draft of the
national pension system to the legislature by Sept. 15. Council for
Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Po-chih estimated
that NT$20-30 billion will be enough to cover the national pension
system for the first year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE-AMERICAN ACCUSED OF EXTORTION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese-American who was convicted in the
United States of illegally donating campaign funds to US President
Bill Clinton was charged with extortion in Taiwan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Charlie Trie, 52, was booked by the Criminal Investigation Bureau
after being accused by the local Hui Hsing Century Foundation of
trying to obtain money by intimidation.</P>
      <P>Trie was caught on Wednesday night by police at a restaurant in
the Taipei suburb of Peitou where he was reportedly to have received
NT$5 million (US$166,000) from the Hui Hsing Foundation.</P>
      <P>Also arrested were four of his accomplices, including a man named
Lin Hsing-pang who publicly charged foundation head Lin Cheng-tsai
with cheating his actress wife out of money and having an affair with
her.</P>
      <P>The foundation claimed that Trie and his accomplices threatened
to go public with the foundation's dirty laundry, including Lin's
alleged antics with women, unless they were paid NT$8 million, a
figure that was later cut to NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>Trie denied the charge, saying that the money was the
foundation's "compensation" for the death of his wife.</P>
      <P>He claimed that his wife, who died in September 1998, joined the
foundation as a voluntary worker earlier that year after being
convinced by Lin that practicing what he preached could cure her of
her colon cancer.</P>
      <P>Trie, who arrived in Taiwan in May, said he demanded damages from
the foundation for his mental suffering caused by the death of his
wife, and that Lin agreed to pay him NT$5 million.</P>
      <P>Trie is no stranger to falling foul of the law. The Taiwan
immigrant struck up an acquaintance with US President Bill Clinton
while operating a restaurant in Little Rock, Arkansas in the 1960s,
and became one of Clinton's avid supporters. He later solicited
campaign funds among Asian-Americans to help finance Clinton's
numerous campaigns for public office.</P>
      <P>Although Trie's business never made much of a profit, he was able
to funnel US$220,000 to the Democratic National Committee between
1994 and 1996, and delivered nearly US$800,000 to a legal defense
fund for Clinton when the president and his wife were being
investigated for their controversial business venture in Whitewater,
Arkansas.</P>
      <P>He fled to Asia for more than a year when his role as a conduit
for illegal political contributions to Clinton came under scrutiny,
eventually surrendered, and was sentenced in the United States to
community service.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S SNAFU DRAWS FIRE FROM OPPOSITION LEADER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's latest statement
on Taiwan's stance toward mainland China and the immediate denial by
his chief mainland policy adviser drew fire from opposition People's
First Party (PFP) official Chang Chao-hsiung on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who was PFP Chairman James Soong's vice presidential
running mate in the March 18 election and had just returned from a
trip to the United States, aired his concerns over Chen's rapidly
changing stance on mainland China, saying it cast doubt on the
president's seriousness.</P>
      <P>Chen told a group of US visitors on Tuesday that he would agree
on the principle of "one China, with separate interpretations," but
just a day later, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
said Chen's administration has never accepted the policy.</P>
      <P>Chang described Chen as a political chameleon who shifts his
political position so rapidly that no one can understand what he
really thinks.</P>
      <P>Judging from Chen's statement, he went on, a proposed supra-party
panel designed to build consensus among various political parties is
nothing but a rubber-stamp which will implement Chen's ideas rather
than advise him on policy.</P>
      <P>Claiming that statesmen tend to stick to their vision while
politicians chase votes without respect to their stances, Chang said
Chen should prove that he is a statesman rather than a politician.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES DPP ADMINISTRATION'S MAINLAND CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan on Thursday
criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration's
mainland China policy for being "inconsistent and worrisome."</P>
      <P>Lien likened the government's mainland policy to "issuing an
order in the morning and rescinding it in the evening."</P>
      <P>He told visiting delegates of the US National Foreign Policy
Committee that the DPP government's rapid sway from one policy to
another not only makes attaining public consensus difficult, but also
sets back cross-strait relations because the inconsistency makes it
unlikely that Taipei will be able to rebuild communication channels
with Beijing based on a foundation of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>The issues facing both sides of the strait today cannot be
resolved by "merely saying words that are delightful to the ear,"
Lien added as he urged the government to make substantial adjustments
in both concept and stance to resolve the crisis.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the KMT followed the "comprehensive designs" set
forth in the National Unification Guidelines to come up with its
"clear concept" on cross-strait policy, which is "one China, but not
yet."</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT does not identify with nor accept Beijing's
"one China" principle, which states that Taiwan is a part of mainland
China, and said: "The `one China' that we insist on refers to the
Republic of China, and Taiwan is definitely not a part of the
People's Republic of China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SIGNS THAT MURDER-SUICIDE CASE CAME FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sources at Taipei's representative
office in Seattle said that the Chinese resident physician at the
University of Washington Medical Center who killed his supervisor
before committing suicide probably did not come from Taiwan as
university authorities and police have been unable to prove this to
be the case.</P>
      <P>Instead, Jian Chen, a resident physician who fatally shot Dr.
Rodger Haggitt, director of the UW Medical Center's Pathology
Division, because he was about to lose his job, probably came from
mainland China, the sources said.</P>
      <P>They said campus police have been unable to find any documents or
items that would indicate Chen came from Taiwan. Instead, all they
have found is a single telephone number with a mainland China area
code.</P>
      <P>According to the university, Chen, in his 30s, graduated from
Shanghai Medical University. He had studied at Mississippi University
before entering the Medical Center of the University of Washington.
Chen apparently had no relatives living in the Seattle area.</P>
      <P>The police believe that Chen, who apparently had been
experiencing language difficulties and other personal problems, was
angry with Haggitt, his supervisor, because he was not going to renew
Chen's contract. For a resident, this would mean an end to their
professional training and would harm their prospects for employment
in the future.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Seattle
contacted university authorities in order to find out how they should
contact Chen's family, but were told that so far there were no signs
indicating that Chen came from Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The US Department of State on Thursday
declined to explain whether ROC President Chen Shui-bian's recent
statement would help improve prospects for resumption of dialogue
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The State Department instead reiterated the Clinton
administration's strong support for early resumption of cross-strait
dialogue and its commitment to promoting peace, stability and
prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The United States strongly supports resumption of cross-strait
dialogue and is committed to promoting peace, stability and
prosperity of the region," said a State Department official, who
preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official went on to say that it's up to Taipei and Beijing to
determine the basis for dialogue and the modalities for dialogue.</P>
      <P>"Our abiding interest is peaceful resolution of differences
between the two sides," the US official said, adding: "To that end,
we welcome steps that foster dialogue, reduce tensions, emphasize
peaceful resolution and promote mutual understanding."</P>
      <P>The official further said the Clinton administration urges both
sides of the Taiwan Strait to refrain from actions or statements
that increase tensions or make dialogue more difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>President Chen said in Taipei on Tuesday that his administration
is willing to accept a 1992 consensus reached with Beijing on "one
China, respective interpretations," but Beijing disagrees with that.</P>
      <P>Chen, the Republic of China's first president from the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, made the statement
while receiving visiting US-based Asia Foundation Chairman William
Fuller at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen's statement drew different interpretations, and some news
media claimed that it marked a major concession from Chen with an
aim of facilitating resumption of long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Chen himself and the ROC's mainland policy planner, Mainland
Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, however, have stressed that
the spirit and content of Chen's Tuesday statement were consistent

    <HEADLINE>FORMER VICE PRESIDENT LEADS KMT THINK-TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, who
was also the former vice president of the Republic of China, was
elected on Friday as the chairman of the newly-established KMT
think-tank, the National Policy Research Foundation.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of the
think-tank, Lien said the Kuomintang is the sole financier of the
foundation, and the party hierarchy will be responsible for choosing
the 23-member board of directors.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the foundation, Lien appointed former Vice Premier
Liu Chao-hsiuan and former Council for Economic Planning and
Development Chairman Chiang Pin-kun as two vice chairmen of the
think-tank.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Research Foundation, a non-profit
organization, was first established by the Lien Chen-tung Cultural
and Educational Foundation in 1984, with part of its NT$11 million
fund coming from industrial business sector donations, according to
Lien.</P>
      <P>Recently, the Lien family transferred control of the National
Policy Research Foundation to the Kuomintang. The KMT then enlarged
the foundation's fund to NT$1 billion and made it a signature
foundation of the party.</P>
      <P>Board directors of the foundation are expected to be mostly
ex-Cabinet officials of the former Kuomintang-controlled government
under the premiership of Vincent Siew, according to think-tank
sources.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lien said the immediate goal of the think-tank
will be to study current political and economic circumstances at home
and abroad in order to provide advice to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and President Chen Shui-bian's administration.</P>
      <P>The think-tank's mid-range goal, said Lien, will be to help KMT
members win mayoral races in Taipei and Kaohsiung, city council
seats, as well as national-level legislative elections beginning in
2001.</P>
      <P>As for its long-term goal, the think-tank will provide the
government with plans and research results so as to help secure
sustainable development and long-lasting prosperity for the nation,
Lien added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Elisa Moscoso
Rodriguez is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on Saturday for a
five-day state visit, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
announced on Friday.</P>
      <P>Moscoso will be the first foreign head of state to visit the
Republic of China since the inauguration of President Chen
Shui-bian's administration was inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yung-liang, deputy director of the MOFA's Central and South
American Affairs Department, said Moscoso's visit is of great
significance. "We believe that her visit will help cement the
longstanding diplomatic relations between our two countries," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Moscoso assumed office on Sept. 12, 1999 as Panama's first
popularly elected female head of state. She will be accompanied by
Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman and other senior Panamanian
officials, particularly those in economic and financial fields, on
her ROC visit.</P>
      <P>During her stay, Moscoso will meet with President Chen, Premier
Tang Fei, Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao and other high-ranking ROC
officials for exchanges of views on matters of mutual concern,
including measures to further boost bilateral cooperation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on press reports that the ROC will offer a US$30
million loan to Panama during Moscoso's state visit, Kuo said
Moscoso's administration has devoted much energy to infrastructure
construction and living quality upgrading projects.</P>
      <P>As for the reported US$30 million lending program, Kuo said the
plan is still on the drawing board and has not yet entered an

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL WARMING MAY OPEN NORTHWEST PASSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  29  (CNA)
(By N. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to the effects of global warming,
Arctic icecaps are expected to have melted enough within a few
decades to open the Northwest Passage for at least part of the year,
cutting the voyage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a
third.</P>
      <P>Right now, the fastest route between Europe and the Far East is
via the Panama Canal, about 12,600 nautical miles. A gateway through
the Canadian Arctic would cut the trip to about 7,900 nautical miles.</P>
      <P>Temperatures continue to rise in the polar regions of the
northern hemisphere where the thickness of the permanent ice cap has
already diminished by 40 percent, according to a Canadian news
report.</P>
      <P>Scientists are predicting that, within the next few decades,
ships will be able to traverse the cold waters in the north
unassisted for one to three months a year. There likely will also be
a couple extra months when ships can make the trip escorted by an
icebreaker, the report said.</P>
      <P>But some experts say the fabled Northwest Passage will remain a
fantasy. They say the effects of global warming are exaggerated and
things have to really heat up before the passageway receives any sort
of large-scale consideration.</P>
      <P>If the Northwest Passage becomes a dream-come-true for ship
captains, icebergs would still continue to be a real threat. Even
small icebergs that only rise a few feet above the water's surface
can sink a ship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA RUNNING OUT OF CASH TO PAY UNEMPLOYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is running out of cash
needed to pay the unemployed as its state firms continue to lay off
more workers due to reforms being implemented to make the enterprises
more efficient and profitable, reported The Australian Financial
Review on Friday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, the daily reported many state firms
in mainland China are now finding difficulties paying the welfare
benefits they are responsible for providing to redundant workers. The
Ministry of Labor and Social Security this week conceded that delayed
payments now totaled more than 1.45 billion yuan.</P>
      <P>The ministry also stated that mainland China still has a long way
to go in upgrading its social welfare system, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Mainland China last month was forced to seek a US$500 million
loan from the Asian Development Bank to help establish a new national
fund to recapitalize the country's social welfare system, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>Between January and April this year, China's state firms laid off
about 6 million workers, bringing the total number of people laid off
to 25 million since Premier Zhu Rongji announced sweeping reforms to
over 320,000 state firms across mainland China over two years ago,

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERTS OPPOSE SALE OF AEGIS-EQUIPPED SHIPS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an apparent blow to Taiwan's hopes
of acquiring advanced US-made warships, a group of US experts have
concluded that the transfer of sea-based Theater Missile Defense
platforms is "unwise at this time".</P>
      <P>The group of 14 prominent experts said they believe that the
sale of lower-tier TMD systems "clearly falls within the guidelines
of the Taiwan Relations Act", the basis for US military assistance to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The experts, however, argued in a new report that sea-based TMD
for Taiwan "makes less political and military sense than the
procurement of land-based systems".</P>
      <P>In a Henry L. Stimson Center working group report, the experts
noted that the Republic of China Navy is "not prepared to introduce
the sophisticated Aegis-equipped destroyers into its fleet".</P>
      <P>This type of vessel has the potential to become a platform for a
sea-based TMD, which is still under development. The Clinton
administration turned down Taiwan's request for such vessels in
April.</P>
      <P>Also, the report said the experts "recognized that Aegis-equipped
ships operated by the US Navy--working in conjunction with other US
military assets--would have far more utility (in protecting Taiwan)
than Aegis-equipped ships operated by the ROC Navy."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is interested in upgrading the units of its Modified Air
Defense System, a Patriot Advanced Capability 2 derivative, to a
fully capable PAC-3 system. The experts recommended that the United
States support such requests from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing the likely averse reaction from Beijing, they also
cautioned against inter-operability between TMD systems under the
respective control of the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Other recommendations made in the report were that the US
continue utilizing the existing arms sales process to evaluate TMD
transfers to Taiwan on a case-by-case basis, that Beijing and Taipei
pursue confidence-building measures to defuse cross-strait tensions,
that the US refrain from participating in military exercises with
Taiwan, and that the next US administration issue a white paper
connecting all the key elements of US policy toward Beijing and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The working group report, called Theater Missile Defenses in the
Asia-Pacific Region, also discussed possible TMD transfers to Japan
and South Korea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIALS SENT TO CAMBODIA TO HELP FAMILY OF DEAD ROC MERCHANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said on
Friday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has dispatched
officials to Cambodia to help investigate the death of Taiwanese
merchant Lee Chih-shin.</P>
      <P>Tien said the Republic of China maintains no liaison or
representative offices in certain countries, and he called on
Taiwanese citizens and businessmen to be extra careful when traveling
to those countries, particularly nations that are politically and
socially unstable -- such as Cambodia.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Henry Chen, Wang Ping, a trade
official with MOFA's representative office in Vietnam, and Wu
Kuang-tin, a secretary with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission
(OCAC), were on their way to Phnom Penh via Vietnam on Friday to
assist Lee's family.</P>
      <P>Sources from Cambodia reported that Lee, president of the
Taiwanese Business Association in Cambodia and owner of a
construction company, was shot dead on Thursday in front of his Phnom
Penh residence while sitting in the back of his car.</P>
      <P>Another man in the car, identified as Liu Hsin-yi, also from
Taiwan, who runs a concrete and gravel processing company, was shot
in the left arm but survived the short-range shots described by
police as a contract killing.</P>
      <P>Witnesses said Lee and Liu were assaulted by two unidentified
gunmen who wore military uniform. The Taiwanese business circle in
Phnom Penh believes that Lee, a warm-hearted man who liked to be "big
brother" to his fellow countrymen, was killed over a business
disagreement between Liu and Cambodian businessmen.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was in his 40s, arrived in Cambodia some four years ago.
Although having been involved in many trades, including the travel,
farming and construction businesses, Lee did not have much money,
probably because of his "chivalrous nature," according to his
friends.</P>
      <P>Wu will accompany Lee's wife, who lives in their hometown in
Tainan County, to Phnom Penh and provide her with assistance in
filing a lawsuit and handling her husband's remains.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the assassination, Vice Economic Affairs Minister
Lin Yi-fu said the incident will undoubtedly hinder Cambodia in its
efforts to woo Taiwanese capital and investors. Taiwan is currently
Cambodia's third-largest source of foreign investment, primarily in
the garment sector.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese businessmen who still have manufacturing
operations in Cambodia has fallen to some 1,000 from around 4,000
four years ago, mainly as a result of Cambodia's political and social
instability.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Republic of China Representative to the
United States Chen Chien-jen will leave for Washington, D.C. next
Wednesday to assume his new post.</P>
      <P>Chen, a seasoned career diplomat, said at a swearing-in ceremony
that he will do his utmost to strengthen substantive ROC-US relations
based on the current foundation.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, he will also continue improving and
expanding services to ROC nationals residing in the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen has previously served as deputy representative to the United
States, director-general of the Government Information Office and
foreign minister.</P>
      <P>His swearing-in ceremony was presided over by Foreign Minister
Tien Hung-mao, who succeeded Chen as the ROC's diplomatic chief on
May 20.</P>
      <P>Tien praised Chen as an outstanding diplomat and said he hopes
Chen's new job will go smoothly.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, Tien said it is still uncertain whether
President Chen Shui-bian will make his first post-inauguration
overseas visit in August, and that the trip is still in the planning
stages.</P>
      <P>Previous reports had said Chen might attend the Aug. 16
presidential inauguration of the Dominican Republic, an ROC
diplomatic ally.</P>
      <P>The topic has drawn increasing attention after Tien made
"fruitful" visits to the ROC's only two European allies -- Macedonia
and the Vatican -- earlier this month, and former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui arrived in Britain on Wednesday for a visit, despite furious
protests from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that the timing of a country's head of state's
overseas visits needs prudent consideration.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yung-liang, deputy director of the Central and South American
Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a routine
news conference on Friday that the ROC will certainly send a special
delegation to attend the Dominican Republic's presidential

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Friday
that he has been consistent in seeking improved relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The president said that his basic tone remains unchanged from
what he said in his inaugural speech on May 20, when he said that
through building upon the existing foundation and constructing
conditions for cooperation through goodwill, the leaders across the
Taiwan Strait can jointly handle the problem of a future "one China."</P>
      <P>Chen said his remarks on cross-strait relations have been
consistent in spirit and content, whether on June 20, when he
expressed hope that he could shake hands with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and sit down to talk with him as did the two
Korean leaders earlier in June, or on June 27, when he said that he
accepted the consensus reached in cross-strait talks in 1992 on
"one China, different interpretations."</P>
      <P>Chen made his latest remarks as he received an 11-member
delegation led by William Flynn, chairman of the National Committee
on American Foreign Policy (NCAFP), a US think tank.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that since 1997, the NCAFP has held round table
meetings and has conducted study and research on issues related to
cross-strait relations, which has contributed greatly to a stable and
secure Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was positive about the "track II" dialogue
channel -- unofficial Taipei-Washington-Beijing dialogue channels to
reduce cross-strait tensions -- adding that he welcomes any
activities or proposals that help improve cross-strait relations and
contribute to the regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Dr. Donald Zagoria, a delegation member, lauded Chen's wisdom in
dealing with cross-strait relations since his inauguration, but he
also asked Chen to elaborate on his remarks on Tuesday regarding "one
China, respectively interpretations."</P>
      <P>Chen said that as a democratic and pluralistic society, Taiwan
has various different views on the handling, interpretation and
future direction of cross-strait relations, which is the reason why
he asked Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh to head a
supra-party ad hoc team to forge national consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>He said that the ultimate resolution of the cross-strait problem
will have to be decided by the Taiwan people, and noted that US
President Bill Clinton said that any solution should be acceptable to
the Taiwan people following a mainland Chinese white paper in
February warning Taiwan not to postpone unification talks
indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Taiwan people cannot accept that "`one China'
means "the People's of Republic of China," and that they cannot
identify with the idea that "Taiwan is a part of the PRC."</P>
      <P>Saying that the Taiwan people insist on upholding the
sovereignty, dignity and safety of the Republic of China, Chen said
the true voice of the Taiwan people must be heard by the United
States and the international community.</P>
      <P>He said that the mainland has insisted on Taiwan accepting its
"one China" principle, and that it believes both sides reached
consensus on that principle in 1992, which he said is far from truth.</P>
      <P>He said that if the Taiwan people were to accept such a
principle, then the "principle would turn into a conclusion," and
added that "we will not fall into such a framework or pitfall."</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan were to become a part of the People's
Republic of China, then the two sides would have no need for
dialogue. As the president of a free and democratic ROC, Chen said he
will follow the will of the people and safeguard the sovereignty and
dignity of the nation.</P>
      <P>The US delegation arrived in Taipei on Wednesday and was
scheduled to leave on Saturday. During its stay in Taiwan, the
delegation also met with Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Premier Tang Fei
and Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>

up his mind to stay in politics for "four more years."</P>
      <P>Chang is a noted surgeon who was serving as president of the

      <P>The Soong-Chang ticket finished second in the election, garnering
36.8 percent of the vote behind President Chen Shui-bian's 39.1
percent.</P>
      <P>The PFP was formed after the election at the urging of Soong's
supporters.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that while he will not run for public office, he
will go around the nation to campaign for others as a way to
reciprocate the support he received during the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Saying that the reason he decided against staying in politics is
because "there are patients in Chang Gung who are waiting for me to
perform surgery," he added that he will report to Y.C. Wang, head of
the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) -- Chang Gung Memorial Hospital is
an affiliate of FPG -- to inform him about his decision.</P>
      <P>Speaking of reasons behind his election defeat, Chang said that
Soong's handling of a financial scandal was flawed, which dealt a
blow to the campaign, but he also criticized the "demonization"
campaign against Soong.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said on Friday
that the Republic of China's armed forces provided a good model by
maintaining strict political neutrality around the time of the March
18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the military's adherence to a neutral stance during
the hotly contested presidential race as he presided over a promotion
ceremony for senior officers at the Armed Forces Officer's Club in
downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first head of state from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said the military deserves praise
for abiding by the Constitution and upholding constitutional
democracy during the presidential race.</P>
      <P>"The military's performance helped maintain domestic stability
during the island's first democratic transition of power between
different political parties," Chen said, adding that it also
signifies the military's achievements in "democratization and
nationalization."</P>
      <P>Article 138 of the ROC Constitution stipulates that the armed
forces shall be above personal, regional or party affiliations, shall
be loyal to the state, and shall protect the people.</P>
      <P>Chen's stunning victory in the March 18 presidential election
marked an end to the Kuomintang's 55-year grip on power in Taiwan.
Shortly after the end of the voting, Chief of the General Staff Tang
Yao-ming, on behalf of all branches of the armed forces, pledged
loyalty to the ROC's new president.</P>
      <P>At Friday's ceremony, a total of 61 military officers in land,
sea and air forces were promoted to the rank of either major-general,
lieutenant-general, rear-admiral or vice admiral. The promotions
were to take effect from Saturday.</P>

      <P>A senior Republic of China official said on
Friday that the United States recognizes ROC President Chen
Shui-bian's "soft but firm" approach in dealing with issues related
to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
made the remarks at a press conference after his return from an
11-day visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Lin said the United States has become more attentive to Taiwan's
public opinion and attaches even greater importance to Taiwan's
strategic, political and economic status following the island's first
democratic transition of power between different political parties in
May.</P>
      <P>Lin, an expert on mainland China's military development, headed a
delegation of government officials, academics and representatives of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on its visit to the
United States from June 13-23.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Lin said, the delegation attended more than 20
seminars, met with 45 influential US scholars and experts, visited 10
universities and think tanks, five newspapers, and held talks with 13
media executives.</P>
      <P>Lin said that since Chen delivered his inaugural speech on May 20
and held his first post-inauguration press conference on June 20,
"various US quarters 100 percent" recognized his "prudent, soft yet
firm" approach in handling cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"Even some Americans who used to be critical of Taiwan gave a
thumbs-up to Chen's performance, and, as a result, the atmosphere
throughout the visit was good and amicable," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Lin recalled, many of the people he met with
repeatedly mentioned US President Bill Clinton's statements that any
resolution of cross-strait issues must respect the opinion of the
people of Taiwan and must have their assent.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the United States now attaches greater
importance to our public opinion, our strategic position and our
political and economic clout, particularly our achievements in
political democratization," Lin added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin went on, many other major countries, including
Japan and Britain, are also paying increasing attention to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting an unidentified Englishman, Lin said the British
government will become even more attentive to Taiwan and that its
interest in Taiwan is also rising steadily, citing as evidence former
ROC President Lee Teng-hui's current visit to Britain.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of Beijing's hegemonic attitude toward
Taiwan and its diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, left for London on
Tuesday for his first post-retirement overseas visit. Although Lee
stepped down from the presidency on May 20 and does not now hold any
public office, Beijing has lodged strong protests to the British
government over its granting of a visa to Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC GOVERNMENT URGED TO TAKE PART IN MORE NGO ACTIVITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June 29 (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting former Taiwan official suggested
on Thursday that the new Republic of China government play a
more active role in activities sponsored by international
non-government organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>Tsai Cheng-wen, a minister-without-portfolio during the
Kuomintang government era, made the call at a seminar being held in
Paris on the possible impact of the ROC's recent transition of power
from the KMT to the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP).</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that although Taiwan's peaceful democratic
transition of power has drawn global attention, its diplomatic
plight is not expected to improve at least in the foreseeable future
due to Beijing's rigid diplomatic embargo against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai said unless Beijing softens its diplomatic isolation
strategy against Taiwan, new ROC President Chen Shui-bian's
administration faces a diplomatic situation similar to that in the
period of KMT rule.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's democratization alone cannot fundamentally change the
general international situation," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said after both sides of the Taiwan Strait
are admitted into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the near
future, Taiwan will have a better chance of forging economic and
trade ties with more countries around the world under the WTO
framework.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tsai said he believes that there is still ample room
for the ROC to expand its role in NGO activities. According to Tsai,
the world currently has more than 20,000 international and regional
non-government organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>At the moment, Tsai said, Taiwan has taken part in less than
1,000 NGOs. "The new ROC government should devote more efforts to
NGO activities to break the Beijing-imposed diplomatic isolation,"
he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TANG FEI INSPECTS POST-QUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROGRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Wen-Hung Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei on Friday inspected the
progress of post-quake reconstruction in Taichung and Nantou counties
for the first time since taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tang, who spent a large portion of his first weeks in office
recovering from surgery in a hospital until his release on June 18,
arrived at the seat of the provincial government in Nantou County --
where the post-disaster reconstruction committee meets -- to listen
to reports on the progress of reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>Tang told local county magistrates and legislators that he could
not immediately come up with solutions to all reconstruction
problems, bit that his committee will handle them in order of
priority and try to complete all reconstruction work within four
years.</P>
      <P>The preliminary allotment of the Executive Yuan's 2001 fiscal
budget did not leave room for the reconstruction plans, Tang said,
adding that the government will have to raise the necessary funds
through other means.</P>
      <P>Tang said that the government will begin raising the money by
practicing thrift in government expenditures. Failing that, the money
could come from special budgets or business tax increases, he added.</P>
      <P>He later visited areas in Taichung and Nantou County to observe
actual work in progress and to speak with people living in the
disaster areas. The two central Taiwan counties were hardest hit by
last year's Sept. 21 earthquake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter
scale and killed 2,400 people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) on Friday questioned Premier Tang Fei's absence from an
emergency financial meeting held by President Chen Shui-bian on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmakers said that Tang's absence begged the question of
whether Tang is being treated as a figurehead, and whether a serious
rift has opened up between Chen and Tang.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chin Hui-chu said that unless a rift really exists,
Tang would not have spoken of quitting his post after less than two
months in office.</P>
      <P>Chin was referring to an announcement by Tang on Thursday that he
will tender his resignation at the end of August -- after just three
months in office -- if the public continues to believe he is not fit
for the job.</P>
      <P>Questions have been asked about Tang's ability to promote his
policies after the Cabinet's versions of a reduced work-week bill and
a pension bill were voted out in the Legislative Yuan, where the
opposition Kuomintang holds a majority.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, Presidential Office secretary-general and
spokesman, said on Friday that the president looks highly upon Tang's
sense of duty and determination to promote government policies.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to give Tang and his Cabinet more support and
encouragement, and to give the new government some time. He assured
the public that the results of the new government's policies will
withstand the test of time.</P>
      <P>PFP legislator Lee Ching-hua, on the other hand, urged Chen to
give Tang some time and space to lead his Cabinet instead of taking
national defense, foreign policy, cross-strait relations, and finance
into his own hands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'A-BIAN' ELECTION SUPPORTERS PROTEST HIS REMARKS ON 'ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of President Chen Shiu-bian's
electoral supporters in southern Taiwan released a statement on
Friday accusing Chen of betraying them by saying he would accept the
"one China, separate interpretations" basis for reopening
negotiations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The declaration, signed by more than 20 major supporters of
Chen's presidential campaign from the southern Taiwan counties of
Kaohsiung and Tainan, charged that Chen has made too many concessions
to mainland China since his inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen had told visiting Asian Foundation Chairman William Fuller
on Tuesday that he would embrace the "one China, separate
interpretations" consensus agreed upon by the two sides in 1992 as a
basis for reopening negotiations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the declaration, Chen's concessions have deeply hurt
the feelings of his long-time backers, represent a withdrawal from
hard-won precedents set by former President Lee Teng-hui, and are a
political betrayal of Chen's pro-Taiwan independence allies.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan and mainland China are independent
sovereignties, the statement said that mainland China has no right to
claim Taiwan as a part of it, and there is no need for Taiwan to
concede political ground in the face of China's military threats.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's remarks on "one
China" have been consistent in both spirit and content, Lin Chong-pin,
spokesman and vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
said here Friday.</P>
      <P>President Chen told Chairman William Fuller of the US-based Asia
Foundation on June 27 that his government is willing to accept a 1992
consensus, which would allow both sides of the Taiwan Straits to have
their own definitions of "one China." The consensus was reached
orally by negotiators from Taiwan and mainland China in a meeting.</P>
      <P>The remarks made by Chen on June 27 are consistent with those
made in his May 20 inaugural speech and June 20 press conference in
both spirit and content, Lin said.</P>
      <P>MAC chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen clarified Chen's June 27 remarks
at a press conference on the next day, Lin said. In the press
conference, Tsai stressed that the government is willing to accept
the way of making the definitions. It does not mean that Taiwan is

    <HEADLINE>TERRITORY DISPUTE CASTS SHADOW OVER PHILIPPINE-MAINLAND CHINESE TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila June 30 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dispute over the South China Sea casts a
long shadow over relations between the Philippines and the People's
Republic of China, despite closer ties between the two countries over
the past 25 years, Philippine Foreign Affairs Undersecretary for
Policy Lauro Baja Jr. said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a celebration of the 25th anniversary of official
relations between the two nations at the University of the
Philippines, Baja said some areas of the South China sea --
particularly Mischief Reef in the Spratly Islands and Scarborough
Shoal -- are the subjects of a protracted territorial and maritime
row between the two countries.</P>
      <P>"Neither side is willing to burn all its bridges on the South
China Sea," he said, but added that the issues would not be easy to
solve.</P>
      <P>The DFA official noted that bilateral and regional mechanisms
have been put in place to diffuse tensions in the area and build
confidence among concerned parties.</P>
      <P>"The ASEAN-mainland China working group on the regional code of
conduct in the South China sea has just come out with a consolidated
text for the formulation of the code. The eventual adoption (of the
code) in the immediate future will hopefully also contribute to a new
phase of mutual trust and confidence on security concerns of both
countries," Baja said.</P>
      <P>The Philippines and mainland China achieved only minimum progress
during their first 15 years of bilateral relations, which took a more
dynamic turn only in the 1990s, Baja noted.</P>
      <P>Incidents in the South China Sea involving the respective naval
forces of the two countries and their fishermen always caused wars of
words between the two countries and exchanges of diplomatic protests.</P>
      <P>"I am convinced that renewed confidence in the political and
security aspects of our relations could be found in the years that
lie ahead. I am optimistic that in the immediate future, we may see
the transition towards better and closer political ties and a good
understanding of mutual security concerns," Baja said.</P>
      <P>He added this would be achieved by intensified parallel exchanges
of officials in all levels of government, military, defense and
security departments from the two countries.</P>
      <P>Both the Philippines and mainland China have worked to develop a
more harmonious relationship, resulting a state visit by President
Estrada to mainland China last month. The two sides have also
released a joint statement on a framework for bilateral relations in
the 21st century.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-way ties between Taiwan and Hong Kong
should be further improved now that the former British colony has
been under Beijing rule for almost three years, said an ROC official
on Friday.</P>
      <P>C. C. Tsai, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Department
under the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said bilateral Taiwan-Hong
Kong relations need to be further improved, although the current
situation in Hong Kong remains stable under Beijing's "one country,
two systems" scheme.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, mainland China has not explicitly interfered
in Hong Kong affairs, but a lack of confidence among the people of
Hong Kong has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the free-wheeling
capitalism and freedom of the press in the territory.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the MAC will continue to seek ways to break the
deadlock over Chang Liang-jen, the newly-appointed director for the
Hong Kong Affairs Bureau who is expected to serve as the de facto

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE  YUAN  DECIDES  TO PROMOTE  NATIONAL PENSION PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After intense negotiations among various
parties, the Legislative Yuan decided on Friday to ask the Executive
Yuan to launch a national pension program, preferably beginning from
January 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>As to the administration's bill on a pension for senior citizens,
which will be preempted by the national pension program, the
Legislative Yuan said they will allow the Executive Yuan to withdraw
on the grounds of budget restrictions.</P>
      <P>In what was seen as another setback to Executive Yuan, Premier
Tang Fei agreed on Wednesday to replace the senior citizen pension,
one of President Chen Shui-bian's major campaign promises, with a
broader national pension program.</P>
      <P>Noting that a national pension system is the ultimate goal of his
administration, Tang said he would like to incorporate the senior
citizen pension into the national pension program.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan dealt a blow to the administration on June
16 by rejecting its bill to cut the minimum working hours from 48
hours per week to 44 hours per week. Instead, the Executive Yuan
voted to reduce the workweek to 84 hours every two weeks.</P>
      <P>However, the premier warned that the current government budget
would not be able to pay for the program, and the government is
mulling a tax hike to finance it.</P>
      <P>But his Cabinet members seem to have different opinions on what
tax should be increased.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chair of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Friday that he favoured raising the sales
tax by one percent next year.</P>
      <P>The tax hike will increase the government's coffers by NT$40
billion (US$1.33 billion) a year, enough to cope with the startup
costs of the program without seriously affect local industries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong opposed Chen's idea,
arguing that an increase in sales tax would further dampen
already-weakened non-tech industries, which have seen stock prices
dip to record lows recently.</P>
      <P>Although a tax increase is inevitable in light of the
government's dwindling revenue and increasing expenditure in social
welfare, Shea said the time could not be worse for a tax increase,
since it would undermine current government efforts to rejuvenate
traditional, labor-intensive industries.</P>
      <P>Tang's statement about a tax hike has drawn fire from the
Kuomintang (KMT), the major opposition party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Hung-chi said Tang's administration is
pulling the rug out from under President Chen Shui-bian, who promised
not to raise taxes both before and after the presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Chen of the KMT noted that President Chen said after being
sworn-in that his government would differentiate itself from the
former administration by being efficient and thrifty concerning
expenditures, rather than resorting to tax increases.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, a former CEPD chair and now head of a KMT think
tank, said the national pension program should be launched as a kind
of compulsory insurance financed mainly by premiums, rather than
social welfare funded by tax.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that according to the program crafted by the CEPD
under the former administration, the government would bear no more
than 40 percent of all premiums, and beneficiaries would get a
pension of about NT$8,700 per month.</P>
      <P>The program, if solely funded with tax, will drain the
government's resources, due to the expanding population of senior
citizens, which now stands at 1.8 million, and is expected to surge
to 5 million by 2010, said Chiang.</P>
