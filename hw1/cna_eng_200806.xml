      <P>Extracts of blue berries and green tea, as well as vitamin D3 and carnosine -- a
natural antioxidant -- have been found to contribute to increase stem cells in
the bodies of animals, a U.S. expert in neurosurgery said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Paul Sanberg, director of the Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair in
the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of South Florida, in Taiwan to
attend a symposium on stem cell research, said that a supplement formula
combining green tea and blueberry extracts, vitamin D3 and carnosine in a
certain proportion has been found to help increase stem cells.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held by the symposium's organizer, the professor gave a
briefing on his latest research results, saying that in animal tests,
researchers have found cord blood stem cells can help increase nerve cells in
the brains of mice.</P>
      <P>The results mean that stem cells of this kind may be able to help cure brain
diseases like Alzheimer's in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>Sanberg is among some 200 scholars and researchers in the medical field who will
attend the first Pan Pacific Symposium on Stem Cells Research, to open in the
central Taiwan city of Taichung Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taichung-based China Medical University organized the symposium, to run through
June 2, as part of celebrations for the university's 50th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Sanberg was invited to deliver a keynote speech on the topic of umbilical cord
blood stem cell therapy in neurological disease in the symposium.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improving Taipei's environment for cyclists: private groups</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With gasoline prices on the rise, more people are looking to modes of transport
not powered by fuel, such as bicycles.</P>
      <P>But  nongovernmental  organizations  said  that  the city's environment for
cyclists, especially those who want to cycle to work, is not friendly enough.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, most bike paths are constructed for leisure, " said Lee Ken-cheng,
secretaryVgeneral of Mercy on the Earth,  an environmental alliance, stressing
that cyclists should have the right to the road when they commute between their
home and workplace.</P>
      <P>In addition, many of mass rapid transportation stations in Taipei and in
Kaohsiung are overhead or underground, which is not convenient for passengers
with bikes, especially those with bikes that cannot fold up.</P>
      <P>"Bike paths in Taipei are not well designed and are even dangerous for cyclists,
" said Lee Han-lin, one of the heads of a student environmental alliance. He
contended that bike paths are often small lanes in sidewalks or roads, and
cyclists have to pay close attention to avoid pedestrians or motorcycles.</P>
      <P>"Besides, the theft rate is too high in Taipei, " complained Lee Han-lin, whose
brand new bike was stolen recently, forcing him to commute by public transport.</P>
      <P>If the government really wants to encourage the use of bikes as a means of
transport, it has to provide a friendlier environment for cyclists, they said in
one voice.</P>
      <P>In a workshop organized in early April for the International Car Free Day that
will be held in September in Taipei, the Department of Transportation under the
Taipei City Government vowed to build a friendlier environment for cyclists in
the capital by constructing more bike paths and establishing a "rent-a-bike"
program similar to that in Paris.</P>
      <P>The DOT said at the workshop that in order to transform the bicycle from a
vehicle of leisure into a means of transport, it plans to construct 50
kilometers of bike paths every year in the capital, starting this year with a
bike-pedestrian path along Dunhua North and South Roads in the downtown area.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, 47.5 kilometer of bike-pedestrian paths and 18.6 kilometers of
exclusive bike paths were already in service by the end of 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen will soon
have face-to-face contacts with young party members to listen to their views
directly, a DPP official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chao Tien-lin,  director of the DPP's Department of Youth Development, said that
the party will arrange for Tsai to meet with 100 young DPP members, dubbed a
"listen to hope" meeting, to be held next Saturday at the official residence of
the Taipei City mayor.</P>
      <P>Chao said that the DPP has not arranged such a meeting in a long time, noting
that young people had been invited to DPP activities for show rather than as the
main focus.</P>
      <P>"The opportunity has now arisen for the party head and the young members to gain
more understanding of each other," Chao said.</P>
      <P>He noted that this will be a beginning, noting that Tsai will seize the
opportunity to have more dialogues with young people in her planned grassroots
tour to reinvent the party's battered image after its two major election
setbacks this year.</P>
      <P>The DPP lost the March 22 presidential election and the Jan. 12 legislative
elections and now controls only one fourth of the seats in the 113-member
legislature.</P>
      <P>Chao noted that more than 2,000 young people answered a call by former DPP
chairman and presidential candidate Frank Hsieh during the presidential campaign
to join the party, and the young people have harbored a certain degree of
"passion and expectations of the party."</P>
      <P>Tsai has always believed that the young members were recruited "not just for one
election, " because they have expectations for the party's reforms, Chao added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung returned to Taiwan
Saturday after concluding a six-day visit to China during which he met with
Communist Party Chairman Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Wu was met by Presidential Office Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po and Chiang
Pin-kung, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>Upon his arrival, Wu said he would brief President Ma Ying-jeou on his trip
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Mentioning his high-profile meeting with Hu, Wu said they both showed good will,
trying to cultivate mutual trust while setting aside disputes between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Wu also said he found that the love and compassion Taiwan's people had shown
victims of the massive earthquake that hit Sichuan, southwestern China, May 12
had touched the heart of the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not he had a message from Hu for President Ma, Wu declined to
comment, but said that there would be no "backroom politics" and that any
results of the meeting would be communicated to the Presidential Office and the
SEF.</P>
      <P>Wu, heading a 16-member KMT delegation, set off for Nanjing, China, Monday,
where he visited the mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the
Republic of China and founding chairman of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Wu went to Beijing Tuesday, and on Wednesday met with Hu, who is also China's
president, in an unprecedented encounter between the chairmen of Taiwan's and
China's ruling parties.</P>
      <P>The two party leaders agreed to make every effort to push for the resumption of
long-stalled dialogue between the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Less than 15 hours after the Wu-Hu meeting, the ARATS sent a letter to the SEF
chairman inviting him to China to resume talks between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS were founded in the early 1990s to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties. Regular dialogue, however, has been
suspended since 1999 because of political differences between Taiwan and
Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computex Taipei is set to attract 40,000 overseas buyers and generate deals
worth US$20 billion (NT$608 billion) , representing 21 percent and 33 percent
year-on-year increases respectively, a top trade official told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>The world's second largest computer show after CeBIT in Germany, Computex will
feature 4,300 booths occupied by 1,500 exhibitors from the worlds leading
Information and Communication Industry (ICT) companies and is scheduled to run
from June 3 to June 7.</P>
      <P>"In terms of creation of business opportunities, Computex Taipei has become the
world's No.1 ICT procurement platform because it is a business-to-business (B2B)
trade show and a one-stop shopping center, " said Walter Yeh, executive vice
president of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), the event's
organizer.</P>
      <P>Asia's largest computer fair has arranged more business meetings than ever
before, offering buyers and manufacturers unprecedented opportunities to discuss
commercial ties face-to-face.</P>
      <P>"We will be holding 2,150 trade meetings alongside the five-day show, which will
help it generate US$20 billion in transactions and another US$50 billion-60
billion in follow-up deals," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The official  added  that the encounters  will offer  113 international buyers
from 32 countries who have already registered for the service the chance to
explore procurement deals.</P>
      <P>"However, companies must have over US$50 million in annual revenues to be
eligible to attend the meetings," he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from showing off state-of-the-art computers, peripheral products, and
storage, communication and other purpose-designated ICT devices, this year's
Computex will also feature its first-ever innovation awards.</P>
      <P>The winners, chosen from 17 finalists in a field of 143 entries, will be
announced June 2, one day prior to the opening of the trade show.</P>
      <P>"Most of the participants in the competition are from Taiwan, " Yeh  said,  a
reflection,  he  suggested,  of  the  country's industry-leading innovative
capabilities that have spawned such success stories as the small-sized notebook,
the Eee PC, and the wireless bluetooth USB.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association (TCA), co-organizer of the show, said the trade
fair will likely spur another industry innovation.</P>
      <P>"The WiMAX Expo Taipei, to be held in accordance with the computer exhibition,
could help Computex Taipei draw more global attention by fashioning a new
landscape in the ICT arena," said Chang Li, deputy secretary-general of the
TCA's overseas division, in a recent interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>WiMAX, a recently developed telecommunications technology that provides wireless
data over long distances, will inject fresh energy into the world's computer
industry, Chang said, much needed in a sector that has lacked an innovation in
recent years capable of generating a new spurt in creativity and growth, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwans cutting edge in broadband wireless communications technology will
create additional market share beyond the existing computer market," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) estimates that the global WiMAX market
will surpass US$10 billion (NT$304 billion) by 2010.</P>
      <P>Among the companies looking to capitalize on the new technology are Acer Inc.
and Asustek Computer Inc, both of which will present their latest notebooks with
WiMAX mobility at the show.</P>
      <P>This year's Computex will be spread over four venues -- Taiwan World Trade
Center (TWTC) Exhibition Hall 1 and 3, the newly completed Nangang Exhibition
Hall, and the Taipei International Convention Center -- while the WiMAX
exhibition will be held at TWTC Exhibition Hall 2.</P>
      <P>Only the final day of the show will be open to the general public.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's participation at an annual meeting of the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) for the first time as a "non-sovereign regional member" proceeded
"smoothly" and on an equal basis with other member countries, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh described Taiwan's attendance at the 76th General
Session of the OIE's International Committee held in Paris May 25-30 as "smooth"
and that no political dispute resulted from the participation of both Taiwanese
and Chinese representatives.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, one of 172 official members of the OIE, gained accession to the global
animal health regulatory group in 1954 under the name "Republic of China
(Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>The name was forced to change to "Taipei China" after Beijing was admitted to
the organization in 1992 and was changed again to "Chinese Taipei" last year
when China pushed to downgrade Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Yeh said this year's meeting served as a test of how Taiwan can interact with
China in the international arena while protecting its own rights.</P>
      <P>She stressed that as a permanent member, Taiwan has every right to participate
in the OIE meetings on an equal footing with other member states.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry will continue to closely monitor how Taiwan fares at the
OIE in the future after having its status changed in 2007 to that of a "non-
sovereign regional member, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The arrangement came following consultations among delegates from the United
States, Japan and the European Union in the face of China's efforts to downgrade
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Watson Sung, director-general of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture's
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, led Taiwan's
delegation at the OIE meeting.</P>
      <P>China had waged a protracted battle over Taiwan's status since 1992, when it
joined the OIE.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's official name in the OIE was changed at the time to "Taipei
China, " Beijing remained dissatisfied and refused to participate in OIE
activities or pay its membership fees.</P>
      <P>To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee adopted a
resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name from "Taipei China" to
"Separate Quarantine Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed to the new designation, but China refused to be placated and did
not take part in the final vote on the issue.</P>
      <P>China  has  regularly  blocked  Taiwan's  participation  in international
organizations as it views Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to
acknowledge its sovereign status.</P>
      <P>The OIE, founded in 1924, is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to
controlling and preventing animal disease.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BNHI's 'wrong' figures embarrass Taiwan's gynecologists:association</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A medical association blasted the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI)
Sunday over statistics the bureau posted online on the rate of complications
resulting from the removal of uterine myomas, or tumors, saying the numbers were
"totally wrong."</P>
      <P>"I was shocked by the NHI's statistics, " said Tsai Hong-te, chairman of the
Taiwan Association of Obstetrics and Gynecology, at a news conference organized
by legislator Huang Sue-ying of the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>"The figures are much higher than ours. Taiwan plays a leading role in the world
in gynecology and obstetrics, but the statistics made Taiwan's medical quality
appear even worse than in African countries," he complained.</P>
      <P>The statistics, posted online by the BNHI on April 25, indicated that the rates
of bladder, ureteral or gastrointestinal problems 14 days after the resection,
or removal, of a uterine myoma averaged 17.78 percent, much higher than the
association's 0.5-1.0 percent.</P>
      <P>The BNHI numbers showed rates for smaller-scale local hospitals and clinics as
high as 30.62 percent and 42.67 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The figures were posted on a BNHI Web site that provides the general public with
information on the medical quality of all medical institutions to give patients
a better understanding of diseases and medical care.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the BNHI's methodology was completely wrong, as the survey included
among the post-surgical complications medical codes for "symptoms" that quite
likely had nothing to do with the surgerical procedure itself.</P>
      <P>"Such a falsehood not only smeared gynecologists but also severely damaged the
relationship between doctors and patients, " he said. "We strongly protest and
disagree with such data."</P>
      <P>Lin Jin-lung, executive secretary-general of the BNHI's Dispute Mediation
Committee, said the bureau listed all detailed information related to the
statistics online and did not intend to cast aspersions  on  the  reputations
of local  gynecologists  and obstetricians.</P>
      <P>"The definition of the statistics, however, might be questionable as they are
somewhat oversimplified and not specific enough, " he admitted.</P>
      <P>He added that the bureau will review the figures and the survey's methodology
and consult the association for further information so that the online data can
accurately reflect Taiwan's medical quality.</P>

it sought advice from experts outside the association  instead  of discussing
the study  with  credible organizations.</P>
      <P>Association Secretary-General James Hsieh urged the bureau to remove the faulty
statistics from its Web site immediately and wait until the figures have been
updated before posting them again.</P>
      <P>Uterine myomas are fairly common and almost always benign. They are caused by

      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair trumpeted Taiwan's first non-smoking traditional
market Saturday on World No Tobacco Day, describing it as a new milestone in his
campaign to turn Tainan into a smoking-free city.</P>
      <P>Presiding over a ceremony celebrating the 100th anniversary of the market, Hsu
said that the city government has been building a smoking-free environment in
the southern city since 2004.</P>
      <P>At present, the city has a non-smoking road near National Cheng Kung University,
18 non-smoking parks, one non-smoking tourist area in Anping and four non-
smoking historical sites, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>The mayor acknowledged that the ban on smoking might draw opposition, but he
explained that a majority of the visitors to the market are women and that
everyone visiting the market deserves the right to reject being exposed to
second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>He said he believed that the ban will not affect the market's business because
it has a good management system and the vendors are good businesspeople.</P>
      <P>Hsu also hoped that the non-smoking market will raise people's awareness of
their health.</P>
      <P>He further called for cooperation from local residents and vowed to turn Tainan

      <P>Seventy-five percent of local office workers in Taiwan believe their English
ability is poor and nearly half of them have failed to improve it, according to
the results of a poll released by a local online human resources agency Sunday.</P>
      <P>Another 32 percent of poll respondents said they had lost ideal job
opportunities or had not received raises because their English was not of a high
enough standard, 1111 Job Bank said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Most of the office workers responding to the recent poll said they understand
how having good English skills could help their careers, the poll said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  nearly 50 percent of the respondents simply "worried about their
poor English" without taking any initiative to solve the problem, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>The respondents attributed the failure to their busy schedules, the inability to
afford English-learning classes, the fear of not being able to learn the
language well and laziness, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>People who serve in low-ranking administrative positions often think they will
not have the opportunity to communicate in English and therefore do not learn or
avoid studying the language, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>This type of thinking, however, will prevent them from landing better job
opportunities in the future, the job bank warned.</P>
      <P>Low-ranking workers can be easily replaced and having good command of a foreign
language can help make jobs more stable and lead to promotions or better
opportunities, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that some 70 percent of the office workers surveyed did
not consider it easy to learn English well, let alone master the language.</P>
      <P>To improve their English, the job bank suggested, people should first focus on
building confidence in their ability to learn and developing interest in the
language.</P>
      <P>It is also equally important for people studying the language to find a suitable
learning method and focus on their problems to make the learning process more
effective and efficient, the job bank said.</P>

      <P>The Japanese Interchange Association (JIA) has decided to appoint Masaki Saito,
a former Japanese ambassador to New Zealand, to serve as Japan's chief
representative in Taiwan, according to a news report published by the Tokyo

      <P>Saito will replace Tadashi Ikeda as head of the association's Taipei Office,
Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties
between the two countries, the report said.</P>
      <P>Saito, 64, a career diplomat who was trained to deal with Chinese affairs after
joining Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1966, has served as minister at
the country's embassy in China and ambassador to Cambodia.</P>
      <P>An expert specializing in Chinese affairs, Saito will be the second member of
the Japanese foreign ministry's "China School" -- an institute dedicated to the
study and understanding of Chinese issues -- to serve as Japan's top
representative in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Ikeda became the first "China School" member to take the post since
Japan severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in the 1970s in deference to Beijing's
"one-China" policy, the report noted.</P>
      <P>The personnel appointment was made at the association's recent board meeting and
a formal announcement will be made in the next couple of days, according to the

      <P>The state-owned oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan is planning to bid on 17 blocks of
land in northern Peru thought to have extensive oil reserves, according to
Taiwan's representative to Peru Huang Lien-sheng.</P>
      <P>Peru's state oil company Petroperu has invited companies from around the world
to participate in an international tender for the 17 blocks of land on Sept. 10,
the report said.</P>
      <P>CPC decided to participate in the tender in view of its 20 to 30 years of
experience in overseas oil exploration and the belief among CPC personnel who
inspected the sites that they had a good chance of becoming viable oil-producing
fields, Huang was cited as saying in a report published Saturday in the Lima-

    <HEADLINE>China urged to show good will by removing missiles</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  1  (CNA)
06/01/08  19:17:41
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung urged China Sunday to demonstrate
"concrete good will" toward Taiwan by removing most of the missles targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu, who returned Saturday from a visit to China, said the missiles are part of
China's military buildup and were not only targeted at Taiwan, but suggested the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait could still make an effort to prevent war from
ever occurring across the strait.</P>
      <P>Wu said that during his meeting with Chinese President and Communist Party of
China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao during his six-day visit in China, he
told Hu that Taiwan needs national security,  dignity and room to maneuver  in
the international community.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese leadership's initial reaction to my requests was positive, but the
most tangible sign of good will would be if it greatly reduced the number of
missiles it has targeted at Taiwan," Wu said during a gathering in Taipei City
with a group of fellow Hakkas from his native county of Taoyuan in northern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>War is mankind's most stupid behavior, and it would be even worse if it were to
happen in the Taiwan Strait, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"China could re-target its missiles at any time, and, if it could greatly reduce
the number of missiles targeted at Taiwan, it would be the most concrete way it
could show its good will," Wu reiterated.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes that the much criticized "KMT-CPC platform of
communications" would act like a lubricant in stagnant cross-strait relations
after the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party's tenure in office over
the past eight years.</P>
      <P>He added that since the KMT administration was inaugurated, cross-strait
relations have improved dramatically, with dialogue between Taiwan's quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), set
to resume shortly.</P>
      <P>Although the long-stalled SEF-ARATS would soon resume as the official
communications channel across the strait, the KMT-CPC platform will still play
its constructive role as a "lubricant, " helping cross-strait ties run even more
smoothly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said he welcomed the appointment of China's Vice Foreign Minister
Wang Yi to replace Chen Yunlin as director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council.</P>
      <P>Wu predicted that the appointment of Wang, a seasoned diplomat, would help
Beijing formulate a new diplomatic strategy that sought a balance between cross-
strait relations and its diplomatic relations with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Briefing President Ma Ying-jeou Saturday on his trip, Wu said the chemistry
between him and the Chinese officials he met on the trip, including Hu Jintao,
was "so good" that he couldn't believe that Beijing could use its missiles
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed the good chemistry to the groundwork laid down by Vice President
Vincent Siew when Siew met Hu Jintao in Boao, Hainan province in China April 13
on the sideline of the Boao Forum for Asia, and the good will shown by President
Ma in his inaugural address on May 20.</P>
      <P>The outpouring of sympathy and donations from Taiwan people for victims of the
Sichuan province earthquake also had a positive impact, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu visited China May 26-31 at the head of a 16-member KMT delegation. In
addition to Beijing, the KMT officials also visited Nanjing and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Soon after Wu's meeting with Hu, China invited the SEF to resume talks in
Beijing from June 11-14.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS were founded in the early 1990s to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties. Regular dialogue, however, has been
suspended since 1999 because of political differences between Taiwan and
Beijing.</P>

      <P>A total of 64 contestants took part in the first round of a Grape Princess
beauty contest organized by the Changhua County government Sunday as part of the

      <P>Vying for spots in the final 15, contestants went all out to attract the judges'
attention by wearing costumes with grape motifs or painting parts of their
bodies with designs related to grapes.</P>
      <P>The event was the first of a series of activities organized as part of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of direct air links across the Taiwan Strait may reshape human
resource maps in Taiwan and China, an online employment service provider
predicted Sunday.</P>
      <P>If direct cross-strait air links are launched, beginning with weekend charter
flights, the number of Taiwanese working in China on a divided-time basis or
Taiwanese engineers working in China on weekends and holidays would grow
dramatically, a 104 Job Bank official predicted.</P>
      <P>Such a development would alter human resource maps across the Taiwan Strait, the
executive said.</P>
      <P>More people in Taiwan are now thinking about working in China because of
unfavorable trends in Taiwan's job market and the soon-to-be-opened direct
weekend charters, said Huang Chih-yao, a 104 Job Bank executive in charge of
"headhunting for China."</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by 104 Job Bank in May, the number of Taiwanese
workers seeking job opportunities in China averaged 20,000 per day by the end of
May, the highest number since early 2006.</P>
      <P>The figure was 3,000 people more per day compared to March and a year-on-year
increase of 5,000 people per day, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The poll found that the number of China-based job openings had remained steady
at about 8,000 per day in recent months, Huang said.</P>
      <P>In a similar survey conducted by 104 Job Bank in February, Huang recalled, 45
percent of the respondents said they "dared not head to China, " while 49.3
percent said they did not because of factors ranging from a lack of "proper jobs
there" to family or relationship reasons.</P>
      <P>Another 41.7 percent respondents of the February poll said they did not opt for
working in China because they "could not gather enough information on China's
job markets," Huang said.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations beginning to warm up after the Kuomintang took
office May 20 and direct cross-strait charters expected to begin in July, many
of the negative factors cited in the February poll have been resolved, Huang
said, and more Taiwanese are now willing to head west to work in China.</P>
      <P>The opening of cross-strait weekend charters, likely to begin on July 4, will
enable Taiwanese executives or managerial personnel to take a business trip to
Shanghai and return to Taiwan the same day, Huang related.</P>
      <P>Companies in information technology, semiconductor manufacturing, banking and
insurance, logistics, services and the cultural industry are expected to have
the greatest numbers of openings, he added.</P>

      <P>The event, organized by the county's Labor Affairs Bureau at the square of the

food from Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Zongzi, a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice delicacy with a savory filling wrapped
in bamboo leaves,  is traditionally  eaten in conjunction with the Dragon Boat
Festival, which falls on June 8 this year.</P>
      <P>At the event hosted  by five hosts  speaking  Indonesian, Vietnamese, Filipino,
Thai and Mandarin Chinese, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei vowed to build
the county as the second home of new immigrants.</P>
      <P>Chou said that the county has some 50,000 foreign workers and 70,000 new
immigrants who are spouses of Taiwanese citizens, and promised to take care of
their lives.</P>
      <P>Chou noted he loved Southeast Asian food and encouraged new immigrants to open

      <P>Dennis Wilder, senior director for East Asian affairs at the U.S. National
Security Council, took part in an annual Dragon Boat race sponsored by Taiwan's
representative office in the United States Saturday in a show of good will
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wilder told reporters that President George W. Bush sent him to attend the event
to convey the U.S. government's regards and best wishes to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wilder's presence and remarks were seen as a sign of a thawing in Taiwan-U.S.
relations, which ebbed in the final years of former President Chen Shui-bian's
administration due to Chen's combative approach toward China, particularly his
insistence on holding a referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations as
"Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The May 20 inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (KMT), which
adopts a more friendly approach toward China, is widely expected to provide new

      <P>Wilder joined Joseph Wu, Taiwan's representative to the United States, and other
staff members at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in
Washington, D.C. in rowing a specially designed Dragon Boat in the Potomac River
as part of celebrations of the traditional Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, which
falls on June 8 this year.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Republic of China government, Wu expressed his gratitude for
Bush's good will and friendship toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Wu said the representative office had relayed Bush's goodwill
message back to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu, a political scientist-turned-politician who assumed his post in April 2007,

      <P>Thanks to a charity event held by an international insurance company, 3,700
disadvantaged children from all over Taiwan were able to spend an afternoon at
Taipei Arena Sunday enjoying the spectacle of Chinese acrobatics.</P>
      <P>Celebrating its 20th anniversary in Taiwan, ING Antai Life Insurance expanded
the scale of its annual "Happy Charity Day" by inviting  the China National
Acrobatic  Troupe to perform for disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>Nonprofit  groups such as the Taiwan Foundation  for Rare Disorders,  World
Vision Taiwan and the Child Welfare  League Foundation, helped ING Antai
organize the event, which drew 3,700 children and their families.</P>
      <P>"In the time celebrating our 20th birthday in Taiwan, we hope that the two
charity performances will bring more happiness to these children, " said John
Wylie, regional general manager of ING Asia Pacific.</P>
      <P>He added that the company has called on its employees to spend at least two days
working for charity by the end of 2008, in line with the company's philosophy of
bringing a more beautiful life to its customers and fostering a warmer society.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation which
helped invite the troupe, said the event was another way to bring closer ties
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"I hope that there will be more and more cultural exchanges like this to shorten
the distance between the people in Taiwan and China," he said.</P>
      <P>Dubbed the "Chinese Cirque du Soleil, " the China National Acrobatic Troupe
amazed the audience with routines brought to China more than 2,000 years ago by
performers migrating from Central Asia during the Han Dynasty (206 BC to AD220)
, backed by high-tech sound and light special effects.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1950, the China National Acrobatic Troupe was the first national
performing  arts troupe established  by China's government. It was also one of
the first to be confirmed as taking part in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Sunday's performance, titled "Splendid!," was made up of 13 acts, including
ballet and hand-to-hand balancing, plate spinning, ball catching, and
contortionists using props such as glasses and moving poles.</P>
      <P>Each performance demonstrated the excellent balance of the acrobats and
breathtaking movements that wowed the entire audience.</P>
      <P>One of the most spectacular routines was the "Strategy on the Chessboard, " in
which contortionists jumped over the vertical poles, leaving the audience in
trepidation as they dangerously spun and twisted through the air.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) will form a special task force to study the
feasibility of allowing the outlying island of Kinmen to purchase water from
China, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, head of the WRA under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made
the promise while meeting with Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng over the
issue.</P>
      <P>Chen traveled to Kinmen over the weekend to exchange views with Lee on the
island county's request for procuring water from China to help quench its thirst
for water.</P>
      <P>Lee said he keenly hopes the central government will give the green light to
Kinmen to introduce water from the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian to
help resolve the county's water shortage problems.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian than to Taiwan proper, has long been
troubled by inadequate water supply and poor water quality in its reservoirs,
Lee said, adding that the county's groundwater has been overly exploited to meet
its water demand.</P>
      <P>"If government authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait support our
proposal, we'll be able to introduce raw water from the Chinese mainland for
farmland irrigation or for household use after purification, " Lee said, adding
that the measure will contribute to the development of closer ties with China
and prevention of excessive use of the county's groundwater.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said, the issue mainly concerns the country's overall policy,
not technical problems.</P>
      <P>"We need to look at existing legal and security regulations before a decision
can be reached, " Chen explained, adding that a special task force will be
formed next week to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said either he or his deputy will serve as convener of the task force which
will be composed of officials from the WRA, the Kinmen county government and the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>"The task force will identify all relevant problems and come up with concrete
proposals within two months, " Chen said, adding that the proposals will then be
presented to the Cabinet for a final decision.</P>
      <P>Kinmen was a battlefield in the cross-strait confrontation in the 1950s. With
cross-strait trade and civilian exchanges increasing substantially since the
late 1980s, Kinmen has gradually been transformed from a defense outpost into a
new tourist attraction for people from both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Domestic pork prices will remain high till year's end because a large number of
hog farmers have abandoned their business due to ever rising corn feed prices,
a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The continued upward spiral of international grain prices since mid-2007 has
forced 800 local farmers to quit hog raising business and this is the primary
reason behind the recent pork price hikes, " said Huang Ing-haur, director of
the COA's Department of Animal Industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that each hog ranch raises an average of 700 pigs per year, Huang said
the closure of 800 hog farms means a decrease of 560,000 hogs in domestic
production, which has tightened hog supply and driven up port prices.</P>
      <P>With just a week to go before the traditional Dragon Boat Festival when pork
demand tends to rise as pork is a major ingredient of zongzi -- a pyramid-shaped
glutinous rice delicacy with a savory filling wrapped in bamboo leaves, Huang
said pork prices are expected to spike to new high in the coming days. Pork
prices have already hit an all-time high of NT$7,600 per kilogram last week.</P>
      <P>As it takes time for maturity of piglets, Huang said hog supply is not expected
to increase substantially in the second half of the year when two major
traditional festivals -- Mid-Autumn Festival and Spring Festival -- will
definitely push up pork demand and prices as well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WRA to review Kinmen's request for buying water from China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, June 1 (CNA)
06/02/08  10:42:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) will form a special task force to study the
feasibility of allowing the outlying island of Kinmen to purchase water from
China, an official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, head of the WRA under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made
the promise while meeting with Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng over the
issue.</P>
      <P>Chen traveled to Kinmen over the weekend to exchange views with Lee on the
island county's request for procuring water from China to help quench its thirst
for water.</P>
      <P>Lee said he keenly hopes the central government will give the green light to
Kinmen to introduce water from the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian to
help resolve the county's water shortage problems.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, which lies closer to Fujian than to Taiwan proper, has long been
troubled by inadequate water supply and poor water quality in its reservoirs,
Lee said, adding that the county's groundwater has been overly exploited to meet
its water demand.</P>
      <P>"If government authorities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait support our
proposal, we'll be able to introduce raw water from the Chinese mainland for
farmland irrigation or for household use after purification, " Lee said, adding
that the measure will contribute to the development of closer ties with China
and prevention of excessive use of the county's groundwater.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said, the issue mainly concerns the country's overall policy,
not technical problems.</P>
      <P>"We need to look at existing legal and security regulations before a decision
can be reached, " Chen explained, adding that a special task force will be
formed next week to tackle the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said either he or his deputy will serve as convener of the task force which
will be composed of officials from the WRA, the Kinmen county government and the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>"The task force will identify all relevant problems and come up with concrete

    <HEADLINE>6.0 magnitude quake rattles northeastern Taiwan</HEADLINE>

06/02/08  13:00:06
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A magnitude 6.0 earthquake rattled the northeastern county of Yilan at around 1
a.m. Monday. No injuries were reported as of 8 a.m., according to the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The earthquake had a focal depth of 95.7 kilometers and its epicenter was
located 20.9 kilometers north of Yilan City, said Kuo Kai-wen, director of the
CWB Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>Because the temblor's depth was relatively deep -- occurring when the Philippine
plate subducted under the Eurasia plate in a subduction zone -- the earthquake
had an intensity of only 3.0 in Yilan City, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Other areas that felt the quake at an intensity of 3.0 included Taipei City in
the north, Hualien County in the east and Taichung and Nantou counties in
central Taiwan, Seismology Center officials said.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the pre-dawn temblor had nothing to do with the devastating March 12
Sichuan earthquake, as it was the result of pressure released from movements of
the Philippine and Eurasia plates, on which Taiwan lies.</P>
      <P>The 8.0-magnitude earthquake in Sichuan, southwestern China -- the worst to hit
China since the 1976 Tangshan quake in northeastern China -- has claimed over
60,000 lives and left numerous others injured or unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Monday's temblor also had nothing to do with a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that
rocked the northern Philippines and southern Taiwan early Sunday, Kuo added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to issue statement marking Tiananmen massacre</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
06/02/08  13:12:12
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will issue a written statement Wednesday to express his
views and feelings on the Tiananmen incident in which the Chinese army brutally
crushed unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on
June 4, 1989, political sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma has consistently commemorated the tragic event in various ways since 1989,
including attending praying services for the victims and publishing
commemorative articles.</P>
      <P>Despite his campaign promise of promoting reconciliation and cooperation  with
China,  Ma told reporters after his May 20 inauguration that he will observe the
Tiananmen massacre in an appropriate and pertinent manner this year.</P>
      <P>Political sources said Ma is likely to issue a written statement or have
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi read a prepared statement on June 4 to
mark the incident.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Ma contributed an article to a local newspaper, in his capacity as the
Kuomintang presidential candidate, to mark the Tiananmen incident, in which he
reminded Chinese authorities that freedom and democracy should be the "common
language of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>"Only freedom and democracy can truly move forward cross-strait relations, lead
to effective dialogue and build mutual trust," Ma wrote in his article.</P>
      <P>In his inaugural address, Ma called for an early resumption of cross-strait
dialogue on the basis of the so-called "1992 Consensus." His explicit
recognition of the "1992 Consensus" or "one China, respective interpretations"
has since helped achieve a thawing in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The atmosphere of optimism has further deepened following ruling Kuomintang
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's May 26-31 visit to China and the May 29 announcement
that the two quasi-official intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait -- will resume their long-stalled talks June 11-14 to strike a
deal on the launch of direct cross-stair charter flights and admission of more
Chinese tourists to Taiwan in July.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen whether and how Ma's upcoming statement on the Tiananmen
incident will impact the gradually warming cross-strait relations, political
analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung City mulling offering free MRT service one day per week</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, June 2 (CNA)
06/02/08  13:21:05
(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday that the municipal government is studying
the feasibility of offering free MRT service one day per week to encourage
residents of the southern port city to use their private vehicles less to
commute.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a city council interpellation session, Chen said her government
is considering using the Environmental Protection Bureau's air pollution control
fund to pay for the free MRT service program.</P>
      <P>Responding to Taipei City's move to offer discounted MRT fares during the summer
months, Chen reiterated her remarks made late last week that her administration
could not unilaterally decide to follow suit, as the Kaohsiung MRT system,
unlike the Taipei system, was not completely funded by the municipal government.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the Kaohsiung MRT system was built using the BOT (build-
operate-transfer) model and that the city government therefore could not decide
on its own to lower fares as this would affect the Kaohsiung Rapid Transport
Corp.'s revenues.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the city government is therefore considering implementing the
policy of free MRT service one day per week as an alternative approach to
encouraging people to use their private vehicles less. This is part of the
government's efforts to meet energy saving and carbon emission reduction goals,
she said.</P>
      <P>The mayor further said that the government has already formed an energy
conservation and emissions control task force, with several units of the
government, including the Environmental Protection Bureau, the Bureau of Public
Works, the Department of Rapid Transit and the Transportation Bureau, working
together to set directions for achieving these goals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The total output of Taiwans WiMAX production value is estimated to reach NT$30
billion (US$987 million) by 2015 with the joint efforts of the government and
private telecommunication sector, Vice-Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-
shiang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the first-ever WiMAX Expo, Taipei at Taipei
World Trade Center, Shih said the exhibition is set to showcase Taiwansmost
advanced WiMAX technologies -- the latest mobile telecommunication technology
providing wireless data over long distances.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Economic Affairs projections, the global WiMAX market
is set to surpass US$10 billion (NT$304 billion) by 2010, Shih went on.</P>
      <P>The WiMAX exhibition, running from June 2 to June 6, features 60 domestic and
overseas exhibitors at 250 booths, showing a variety of WiMAX-related equipment
and application systems, including mobile components, system products, and WiMAX
testing services.</P>
      <P>"By featuring the entire ecosystem of the WiMAX industry, this exhibition will
help Taiwan's telecommunication companies to obtain foreign procurement and
cooperation deals," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He added that the expo will also complement the Computex Taipei exhibition, to
be held between June 3 and June 7, by attracting international  buyers  from
the Information  and Communication Technology (ICT) and telecommunication
industries.</P>
      <P>Wang Jen-tang, chairman of the organizing group Taipei Computer Association,
said the government has invested more than NT$20 billion in infrastructure
development and application modeling based on the WiMAX technology.</P>
      <P>"In addition, since last July, six local telecommunication operators have
acquired WiMAX frequencies and will be ready to open business at the end of this
year," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wand said Taiwan's famed notebook makers ACER, ASUS, and Quanta, will take
center stage at the show, displaying their latest laptops fitted with WiMAX
chipsets.</P>
      <P>To give visitors to the show a hands-on experience of the WiMAX environment, the
exhibition is offering WiMAX wireless service throughout the Xinyi and Nangang
districts, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"This wireless broadband service will allow users to download or upload at a
speed of 3MB/sec," he said.</P>
      <P>Also by taking the WiMAX Demo buses, passengers can enjoy wireless Internet
connection while moving at high speed, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The wireless Internet service currently in use cannot maintain normal operation
if the laptop in use is moving at a speed of more than 50km/hr. However with
WiMAX chipsets, laptops can remain connected to the Internet while being
transported in a vehicle that is moving as fast as 80km/hr.</P>
      <P>The expo also includes a Forum Operator Summit, which is expected to draw the
participation 70 leading telecommunication operators from 22 countries.</P>
      <P>The organizers said the expo is expected to attract some 30,000 overseas buyers.</P>

      <P>About one in four people in Taiwan suffer from hyperlipidemia, or high blood fat
levels, with three out of four of these people not being aware that they have
the condition, the Department of Health's Tainan Hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsiao-tzi, a doctor at the hospital in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan,
said that hyperlipidemia is closely linked with four of the top ten causes of
death in Taiwan, namely cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cerebrovascular
disease and high blood pressure.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that hyperlipidemia, which is the presence of a high level of lipids,
such as fat and cholesterol, in the bloodstream, is caused by several factors,
including poor functioning of the spleen, heart and liver.</P>
      <P>He stressed  although  there are several  drugs  to treat hyperlipidemia, the
best approach is taking preventative steps to avoid getting the condition.
Eating a balanced diet that includes foods that are high in fiber, not smoking,
avoiding deep-fried foods, and limiting one's coffee intake to two cups a day or
less are some the preventative steps that can be taken, he said.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to promote Taipei City's tourism industry, the city government
launched a new tour package Monday to attract Hong Kong tourists, inviting chief
executive officers and general managers of 16 Hong Kong travel agencies to try a
new travel experience in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The three-day, two-night package, " Novel Fun Taipei" -- organized by China
Airlines, the Landis Taipei Hotel, Asia Pacific Resort, Eslite Book Group and
TenRen's Tea among others -- allowed the CEOs and members of the Hong Kong media
to experience five tour packages carefully designed to accommodate gourmets,
shopping enthusiasts, culture lovers, groupies and families.</P>
      <P>Daniel Chan, deputy general manger of Hong Kong's Hong Thai Travel Services,
said even though he had visited Taiwan more than 40 times before, he felt that
he had gotten to know Taipei all over again this time around.</P>
      <P>"Surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Yangmingshan National Park while
enjoying the spa and gourmet food, my heart and soul were so refreshed, " he
said. "It is a new face of Taipei that I had never experienced before."</P>
      <P>Lanny Leung, chief executive officer of the Wing On Travel, said that she was
most impressed by the warmth of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>"I sensed that Taipei now has a different atmosphere than before. Everyone seems
so peaceful and happy," she said. "In the taxi, when I smiled at a motorist, she
waved back to say hi to me. I was so moved by this gesture."</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung, commissioner of the Taipei City Government's Department of
Information and Tourism (DOIT) said at the news conference that "while Taipei
City sincerely welcomes the Chinese tourists that the government plans to admit
in July, it also opens its arms with a warm heart to old friends from Hong Kong
who constantly visit the city.</P>
      <P>"Many worry that once Taiwan opens its door to Chinese tourists, Hong Kong will
be marginalized, but I think the relationship between Taipei and Hong Kong
should be complementary and mutually beneficial," Yang said.</P>
      <P>He added that the two cities can together launch a tour package that includes
tourist spots in both Hong Kong and Taipei.</P>
      <P>Each year, Taipei attracts around 400,000 tourists from Hong Kong, 60 percent of
which are returning visitors.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a steady growth in the number of female tourists and
individual travelers, the Taipei City Government said it hopes to attract more
tourists to sample the richness of the city's natural and cultural resources.</P>
      <P>Commissioner Yang will hold a news conference in Hong Kong on June 11 to promote
the new tour packages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Veterans Commission crafting measures for voluntary military system</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  2  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level  Veterans Affairs Commission (VAC) is planning to draft new
measures to cope with a new fully professional volunteer recruitment system that
is expected to be introduced in the next two years, the VAC chief said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National
Defense committees, Kao Hua-chu, minister in charge of the VAC, denied a local
newspaper report that "the VAC still has no clue, though a volunteer  military
service system will soon to be introduced."</P>
      <P>Kao said the VAC is planning to emulate the Montgomery GI Bill of the United
States -- which stipulates measures to protect the rights and interests of
enlisted men and women, veterans and their spouses -- in a bid to take better
care of retired servicemen and women.</P>
      <P>He added that if a volunteer recruitment system is introduced, more funds will
be needed, as the new veterans will be much younger than today's, and all
aspects of their welfare, including education, employment, medicare and daily
living, are costly.</P>
      <P>According to the VAC, the current number of veterans in Taiwan stands at
480,000, compared to 270,000 military personnel in service.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who took office on May 20, has promoted as part of his
policies the introduction of a fully professional, voluntary military
recruitment system and the continued streamlining of the military, with the
ultimate goal of reducing the number of military personnel to 200,000.</P>
      <P>New Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min confirmed May 21 that his
ministry will work in line with those policies, but added that the defense
ministry will not introduce a voluntary system just for the sake of doing so.</P>
      <P>Noting that all the countries that have adopted a volunteer recruitment system
face problems regarding the quality of recruits, Chen said that one of the main
considerations of his ministry in studying the full implementation of such a
system is whether the quality of military personnel can be maintained.</P>
      <P>Chen said another reason for continuing the military streamlining plan launched
under former President Chen Shui-bian's administration is that a voluntary
recruitment system cannot be implemented all at once with the current defense
budget, which stands at 3 percent of the gross domestic product.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of an anticipated influx of Chinese tourists to Taiwan, 30.3 percent
of related businesses in the tourism sector said they are not yet ready for the
opening, according to the results of a survey released Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the poll carried out by the 1111 job bank, one of Taiwan's major
online job research services, only 25.1 percent of the owners of local tourism-
related businesses said they have made preparations for the measure, while 44.6
percent said they are starting to ready themselves.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 50.6 percent of the businesses questioned are not
satisfied with the manpower quality in the tourism sector -- with 44.4 percent
of these companies pointing to a lack of professionalism, 40 percent complaining
about insufficient foreign language ability and 38.5 percent about poor work
attitudes among current employees.</P>
      <P>High turnover was pointed out by 44.2 percent of the companies that responded to
the survey as the major reason behind the lack of qualified personnel,  ahead of
30.7 percent that ascribed the situation to low salaries and 28.1 percent that
blamed a lack of training institutes.</P>
      <P>The 1111 job bank conducted the survey of tourism-related business owners from
May 23-29, recovering 267 valid responses.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang administration, which assumed office May 20, has pledged that
opening Taiwan to more Chinese tourists will kick off as planned on July 4,
along with direct cross-Taiwan Strait weekend charter flight services.</P>
      <P>In a related poll, the job bank also found that 65 percent of some 100 job
seekers willing to work in the tourism sector support the view that the
establishment of casinos will be helpful to boosting Taiwan's tourism revenues.</P>
      <P>Compared to a year ago, the number of job opportunities created in preparations
for the opening of casinos and related businesses, such as entertainment venues
and restaurants, has grown by around 21.5 percent, while the number of job
seekers in these businesses has increased 1.2 times, the poll discovered.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, workers in tourism-related businesses earned an
average monthly salary of NT$30,106 (about US$1,000) -- the lowest level among
nine major industries.</P>

      <P>Addressing the ceremony, she called for other Taiwan enterprises to emulate
Taiwan Cement in donating to NTU to help build the school into one of the

      <P>She said one of the most pitiful things for her late husband was that Koo Chen-

      <P>China-based Taiwan businesspeople attending the anniversary celebrations of the
Association of Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland, in Beijing Monday,
welcomed Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's call the previous day for China to
reduce the number of missiles it has aimed at the island.</P>
      <P>Wu, who recently returned from a historic visit to China that included a meeting
with Chinese President Hu Jintao, said Sunday that Beijing could show its
goodwill to Taiwan by scaling down the number of missiles targeted at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Theodore M. H. Huang, chairman of the Taiwan-based Chinese National Association
of Industry and Commerce, Taiwan, said on the sidelines of the Beijing gathering
that in terms of cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation, everyone is working to
creating a win-win situation, and that "having weapons in the background is
unnatural, and not too friendly."</P>
      <P>Working for cross-strait peace and economic development is the best approach, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Huei-teh, deputy director and spokesman of the Association of
Taiwan Investment Enterprises on the Mainland, said that the manner in which Wu
voiced his appeal to Beijing shows that the mood of cross-strait relations is
very positive and it inspires confidence regarding the future development of
links between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Chin-chao, head of the Taiwan businessmen's association in Xiamen, said
that cross-strait dialogue can first focus on people's livelihood and economic
issues, which will in turn lead to mutual trust and consensus on political
issues, after which a cross-strait peace treaty and the removal of the missiles
aimed at Taiwan will only be a matter of time. enditem/ pc</P>

      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that
taxi ranks will be set up on a trial basis in an effort to cut the ratio of non-
occupancy taxis in urban areas.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative committee meeting, Mao said the plan is just one of
several possible directions under consideration, adding that the ministry will
not put any measures into practice before holding public hearings and listening
to the views of taxi operators.</P>
      <P>"With surging gasoline prices, the established method of using and operating
taxis will have to be adjusted," Mao said.</P>
      <P>He said that establishing a system of taxi ranks will help taxi drivers who do
not want to drive around looking for fares.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also encourage more radio taxis so that taxis can be summoned
to specific addresses.</P>
      <P>He said that compared with other countries, Taiwan's taxi services are
convenient and easy to find, although with so many taxis on the roads, there is
a non-occupancy rate of as much as 70 percent.</P>
      <P>Mao noted that there will still be such taxis in the future, although he claimed

Monday.</P>
      <P>The program was initiated in 2006 in an attempt to "push the envelope" within
the conventional  education system,  said Lin Chen-yung, director of NSC's
Department of Science Education.</P>
      <P>"The conventional education system tends to teach in accordance with entrance
examinations -- if it is in the exam, it is on the curriculum, and if not, it is

and technology into daily lessons."</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, in the first and second phases of the program in 2006 and
2007, 28 high schools and 19 universities received subsidies. Also, 492 high
school teachers, 5,125 high school students, 290 experts, and 232 university
students received grants under the program, he said.</P>
      <P>The ongoing second phase would cost some NT$480 million (about US$15 million),

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan launched a project of atmospheric measurement of the Pacific Ocean Monday
with the cooperation of the European Union to make the global monitoring network
more complete and provide important data to international scientists in the area
of global warming, the National Science Council (NSC) announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The project,  sponsored  by the NSC and the Environmental Protection
Administration, will be part of the world's largest long-term monitoring
platform of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, according to NSC officials.</P>
      <P>The 20-year project,  called th Pacific  Greenhouse  Gases Measurement Project,
is being carried out in cooperation with the EU's In-service Aircraft for a
Global Observing System (IAGOS).</P>
      <P>In addition to the EU, which has been doing research on atmospheric observation
since 1994, Japan began a similar project in 1993, the officials said.</P>
      <P>However, Japanese and European aircraft are limited in number and flight paths,
which has led to a deficiency in the monitoring system with regard to the
Pacific Ocean, said NSC Minister Lee Lou-chuang, who noted that Taiwan's
participation can make the monitoring network in the Northern Hemisphere more
complete.</P>
      <P>Under the project, scheduled to begin in 2009, around six aircraft of the
Taiwan-based China Airlines and several cargo ships of the Evergreen Marine
Corp. will be equipped with sophisticated instruments that will collect
atmospheric data during their flights and voyages, said Wang Kuo-ying, a
professor at the Department of Atmospheric Sciences of National Central
University.</P>
      <P>"The advantage of cooperating with commercial aircraft and shipping operators is
that we can get regular and frequent data, " said Wand, who is in charge of the
project.</P>
      <P>He added that in the short term, the data can be used by scientists all over the
world for meteorological predictions, and in the long run as data for research
on global warming.</P>
      <P>The instruments installed on the planes and ships are expected to collect
information about the ozone, carbon dioxide, water vapor, carbon monoxide and
nitrogen oxide, without affecting the operation of the craft, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"After the Formosat-3 satellite, this is another important contribution that
Taiwan can make to the world in the domain of climate change," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Formosat-3 satellite, a collaboration between Taiwan and the United States,

      <P>The Taichung city government's Environmental Protection Bureau has begun
providing locally produced organic fertilizer to help farmers save money on
fertilizer costs amid growing inflationary pressure, bureau chief Lee Li-teh
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the bureau has to deal with some 10 tons of kitchen leftovers
per day, which can be used to produce about four tons of organic fertilizer, and
local farmers will be eligible to apply to have two tons of this fertilizer
delivered to their farms free of charge, he explained.</P>
      <P>In line with the practice implemented by Mayor Jason Hu, the city's
environmental protection bureau can supply local farmers with some 720 tons of
organic fertilizer each year -- some 21 percent of their combined annual
consumption of about 3,500 tons, he said.</P>
      <P>To supplement the central government's efforts to fight mounting inflationary
pressure, Hu has asked all municipal departments to devise workable means to
help citizens,  especially low-income families, cope with increasing consumer
product prices.</P>
      <P>Municipal Department of Economic Development director Huang Ching-shiao said the
problem of the fertilizer shortage in Taichung City is not so serious as in
other cities and counties, as its major staples such as rice, bamboo and
oranges, are currently not in the peak production season.</P>
      <P>Taichung City in central Taiwan is the country's third-largest city.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) confirmed Monday that it is consulting
with Washington over the appointment  of Jason  Yuan  as the next  Republic  of
China representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>In his first reception with reporters, Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco
H.L. Ou confirmed that Yuan, who has served as the Kuomintang's  (KMT's)  and
the People  First  Party's  (PFP's) representative to the U.S. since 2004, has
been tapped by President Ma Ying-jeou's administration to be the nation's
representative in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>"Yuan is experienced and well-connected in Washington and has a profound
understanding of the political situation in the U.S., which makes him very
suitable for the post," Ou said.</P>
      <P>"When I was the deputy foreign minister from 1996-1999, Yuan served as
ambassador to Panama and I believe that we will work well together," he added.</P>
      <P>ROC Deputy Representative to the U.S. Tung Kuo-yu said last Friday that he
expects the U.S. government to reply within "a reasonable period of time"
regarding the appointment of Yuan, who is also a former director-general of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's outgoing representative to the U.S. Joseph Wu, who was appointed in
April 2007 by the then-Democratic Progressive Party administration, tendered his
resignation May 22, two days after Ou was worn in along with the rest of the KMT

they fail to answer calls to appear at the Legislative Yuan to answer questions
from lawmakers, the Legislative Yuan's deputy secretary-general said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yu Teng-fang noted that the legislative Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes

Yuan's powers earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Th proposed punishment will become possible after the bill clears the

      <P>The fine could be launched on the same officials in succession if they continue
to ignore the legislature's calls for their presence at legislative sessions, Yu

      <P>Fifty of the world's top telecommunication operators from 22 countries attended
the opening of a two-day summit in Taipei Monday to explore business
opportunities in the growing WiMAX industry, according to Ron Resnick, president
of the WiMAX Forum, a non-profit organization that promotes WiMAX technology.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taipei Computer Association and the WiMAX Forum, the WiMAX
Forum Operator Summit is being held alongside the WiMAX Expo, Taipei, which runs
from June 2-6. Global players, including Alcatel-Lucent, Motorola and ZyXEL will
be able to share their visions and experience with WiMAX strategy, innovative
business models and applications, Resnick said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwanese telecommunication companies now spearhead the WiMAX
global development  and form the most mature WiMAX ecosystem, as 40 of the total
530 members of the WiMAX Forum are from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As for the future of the technology, he said the WiMAX Forum predicts that there
will be 133 million WiMAX users by 2012, topping that of any other competing
technology during the same timeframe.</P>
      <P>"WiMAX represents a new model for retail distribution, " Resnick said of the
latest mobile telecommunication technology,  which transits wireless data over
long distances for computers or mobile phone users traveling at high speed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Resnick estimated that there will be a total of 538 operators
around the world by 2012 and that "the number of companies in WiMAX the business
will grow almost double from the current 260 within the next four years."</P>
      <P>Mohammad Shakouri, vice president of the WiMAX Forum, said his organization has
been streamlining the certification process for WiMAX products in an effort to
further popularize the market.</P>
      <P>"By the end of 2008 there is set to be over 100 WiMAX devices certified by the
WiMAX Forum, " he said, adding that Taiwan's telecommunication companies have
been very active in acquiring certification for their products, although he
declined to specify how many or which Taiwanese companies have applied or are
currently applying for WiMAX certification, citing corporate confidentiality.</P>
      <P>An industry-led, not-for-profit organization, the WiMAX Forum was established in

    <HEADLINE>No schedule to go nationwide with per-bag trash collection fee: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   2  (CNA)
06/02/08  20:15:19
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Shen Shu-hung
affirmed Monday his intention to introduce nationwide the "per bag trash
collection fee" system, but said that no timeline can be set up before
convincing local authorities to adopt the method.</P>
      <P>In his first report at the Legislative Yuan since Taiwan's new government
administration was inaugurated on May 20, Shen admitted that it makes more sense
to charge trash collection fees using the "per bag" system -- which requires
residents put trash in special bags which they must purchase -- than to charge
fees according to the current widely used method in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But so far, only residents in Taipei City pay for trash collection using the
per-bag trash collection system. Under the system, trash collectors will not
take residents' trash unless they put them in special bags they must purchase
from stores.</P>
      <P>A village in central Taiwan with about 4,500 residents also abides by this
system.</P>
      <P>Under the more widely used method, households and businesses are charged for
trash according to how much water they use, leading many to mistakenly believe
trash collection is free and giving residents no incentive to cut down on the
amount of trash they generate as water fees are relatively low in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "per bag trash collection" system was first implemented in Taipei in 2000 to
reduce the amount of trash generated by the city's dwellers when Shen was the
director of the capital's Department of Environmental Protection under then
mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is now Taiwan's new president.</P>
      <P>According to Shen, after the system was put into effect, the amount of trash
generated in the capital was reduced by 60 percent, while the quantity of
recyclable items collected increased by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>The policy is seen as more environmentally friendly because it discourages
residents from generating too much waste and encourages them to recycle.</P>
      <P>But convincing other local governments to adopt this policy will take some
persuading, Shen said.</P>
      <P>"This was a successful policy, but to implement it on national scale, we need to
communicate with local authorities, " Shen said, adding that the difficulty lies
in the effect of the policy -- reducing revenues of local governments.</P>
      <P>Taking Taipei for example, Shen said that the city government had an annual
income of NT$1 billion (US$32.3 million) from trash collection fee charged in
accordance with the quantity of water used by each household. After the per-bag
trash collection fee system was put into effect, the city's trash collection
revenue dropped to NT$400 million (US$12.9 million), he said.</P>
      <P>Thus, Shen said, he cannot set up a schedule to implement the system on a
national scale without local authorities' support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City mass rapid transit system's ridership has slightly increased
compared to last week, with the daily growth rate averaging at 0.26 percent
after the Ministry of Economic Affairs raised the prices of gasoline and diesel
fuel on May 28, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the company, the average daily increase amounts to about 3,212
passengers per day.</P>
      <P>Company officials said ridership on the network merely climbed by 0.17 percent,
or 1,797 people, on June 1 -- the first day after the company, on May 30,
announced a 25 percent discount on fares for holders of the prepaid Easy Cards.
The discount offer will last through Aug. 31</P>
      <P>Company officials, however, admitted that it is still too early to judge that
the metro's discounted fare and the oil price hikes would help attract a higher
number of passengers to travel on the system over the long term.</P>
      <P>But according to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS), passengers took nearly 145 million rides on Taipei's mass
rapid transit network in the first four months of this year, up by some 8.7
percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>During  the four-month  period,  the Taipei  Rapid Transit Corporation earned
NT$3.17 billion (US$104 million) in revenue.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials forecasted that a higher number of passengers will travel on the
city's metro system in the months ahead, pushing ridership for 2008 above the
previous year's level of 416 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Diplomatic truce' with China not immediate priority: FM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou said Monday that discussions
between Taipei and Beijing on a "diplomatic truce" will have to wait until there
is positive interaction on economic and trade issues, but he suggested that
Taiwan would no longer engage in a diplomatic tug-of-war with China.</P>
      <P>Ou said President Ma Ying-jeou's proposed diplomatic truce hoped to transcend
the "number-of-allies myth" -- the idea that the higher the number of Taiwan's
allies, the better -- and that the country would focus on cementing the
alliances it already has.</P>
      <P>"Fighting for new diplomatic allies will not be our top priority in the future,"
said Ou in his first informal meeting with members of the media Monday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will instead use its resources to consolidate
relations with Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies, a decision Ou said was well-
received by several top officials of the nation's allies.</P>
      <P>But he acknowledged that Beijing might not accommodate Taiwan's new approach.</P>
      <P>"A diplomatic truce cannot be achieved unilaterally but requires the same
willingness from the opposite side." he said.</P>
      <P>The 68-year-old minister said Taiwan has felt the good will sent by President Hu
Jintao, who said recently that Taiwan's international space can be considered
and discussed.</P>
      <P>He believed, however, that a diplomatic truce should be talked about in a second
stage after positive interaction has been achieved on bilateral economic and
trade issues.</P>
      <P>Ou said he actually preferred the term "diplomatic coexistence" rather than
"diplomatic truce" as the word "truce" carries with it the smell of gun smoke.</P>
      <P>"Diplomatic co-existence is better as it seems more peaceful, " he said. "With
co-existence we can mutual prosper and together pursue a win-win situation."</P>
      <P>China has repeatedly stolen away Taiwan's allies with massive financial
incentives, both to embarrass Taiwan and marginalize it in the international
community.</P>
      <P>The most recent example was the southeastern African country of Malawi, which
was reportedly lured to switch allegiance to Beijing last December by a US$6
billion financial assistance package.</P>
      <P>Also quizzed by reporters on what the best name to use would be when describing
China, Ou responded "mainland China, " saying it best represented the status
quo.</P>
      <P>"The status quo is that we are the Republic of China. If we call the other side
the People's Republic of China, that would mean one country on each side of the
Taiwan Strait," Ou said, referring to the formula used to describe cross-strait
relations by the previous Chen Shui-bian administration.</P>
      <P>Ties between China and Taiwan remained chilly during Chen's term in office
because of such language asserting that Taiwan is a sovereign country
independent from the PRC.</P>
      <P>Ou said in the same news conference that in line with President Ma's idea of
"modus vivendi," "dignity, pragmatism, agile and flexible" will be adopted as
the principles of the new administration's foreign diplomacy.</P>

06/02/08  20:44:18

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed Monday that it received an official
invitation from Paraguay two days ago to attend the inauguration ceremony of its
new president Fernando Lugo on Aug. 15, but said it does not know whether
President Ma Ying-jeou will head the Taiwanese delegation to attend the
ceremony.</P>
      <P>In his first reception with reporters since taking up his post on May 20,
Taiwan's new Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said the ministry has not yet
submitted the invitation to the Presidential Office, but will definitely send a
high-level envoy to congratulate Paraguay's new president.</P>
      <P>"The ministry wants to play this card very much as President Ma is a very
charismatic politician, " Ou said. "If President Ma can attend the inauguration
ceremony, I believe the results from his visit will certainly be very positive."</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop who won his country's April 20 election,
said many times in public that he would like to establish relations with China,
giving rise to speculations that Taiwan might lose its only diplomatic ally in
South America, to China.</P>
      <P>Paraguay's inauguration will occur around the same time as the inauguration of
the Dominican Republic's newly-elected President Leonel Fernandez on Aug. 16.
Some analysts believe that going to the two inauguration ceremonies will be a
good opportunity for President Ma to cement diplomatic ties with Paraguay and
the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>If Ma decides to lead Taiwan's delegation to the two countries in August, the
trip will be his first state visit after taking office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of whether Ma would have to make any transit stops and if
so, where, Ou said he thinks the United States will communicate with China over
the transit location or at least inform Beijing when the location is decided, as
it is inevitable for Ma to make a stop in the United States if he decides to
visit these two allies.</P>
      <P>Beijing had previously objected to Taiwan's presidents visiting the United
States, because it sees the island as part of its territory awaiting
unification, not as a separate country.</P>
      <P>In his bi-annual news conference last month, American Institute in Taiwan
Director Stephen Young said that if President Ma asks to transit in the U.S.,
Washington will apply the same principles which it has always applied to such a
request -- "convenience, comfort, safety and dignity" of the traveler.</P>
      <P>The courtesy and treatment provided by the U.S. government, when Taiwan's
president makes transit stops in the U.S., are often viewed as a barometer of
relations between Taipei and Washington.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tuition fee hikes not to exceed 8 percent: education minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
06/02/08  21:29:49
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng said Monday that tuition and miscellaneous
fees at domestic universities will not exceed 8 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks amid reports that several domestic universities are
thinking of increasing tuition and miscellaneous fees, although they have to
wait for the Ministry of Education (MOE) to unveil its tuition plan before they
apply for hikes June 20.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that after the universities  apply for tuition increases, the
situation of each university will become clearer.</P>
      <P>"The ministry's adjustment will consider the recent increase in commodity prices
and the disposal income of each household, " Cheng said, adding that "the exact
rate of increase will be disclosed in a few days."</P>
      <P>Some critics of tuition hikes have suggested that National Taiwan University
(NTU) should not be allowed to raise its fees because it receives most subsidies
from the MOE under the agency's five-year, NT$50 billion (US$1.64 billion)
project to nurture top-notch universities.</P>
      <P>But NTU President Lee Si-chen rejected the argument, saying that the tuition and
miscellaneous fees of private universities are about double those of public
universities, and if the government allows private universities to raise fees
while curbing public universities, then "it will be another form of injustice."</P>
      <P>Lee indicated that NTU hopes to raise tuition and miscellaneous fees by an
average of 5 percent, although its College of Medicine hopes to raise them by
more than 8 percent.</P>
      <P>"I'd rather receive fewer subsidies than be unable to raise tuition and
miscellaneous fees," Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>Lee also supported a call by the National Alliance of Parents Organization that
subsidies to underprivileged groups be coordinated by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that NTU launched a program to help students from low-income families
last year under which the students were exempted from paying tuition and
miscellaneous fees and would also receive a grant of NT$10,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Only about a dozen students applied, however, which showed that NTU students
come from families of higher socio-economic status, he said.</P>
      <P>Private school students are generally from poorer families, however, and it is
unreasonable to ask them to shoulder the higher expenses, Lee argued.</P>
      <P>Legislator Pan Men-an of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party pointed out
last week that many universities have unveiled plans to increase their tuition
fees by 5-10 percent and room rates by 7-13 percent for the next academic year,
starting in September.</P>
      <P>The increases, along with an estimated 10 percent rise in textbook prices and
cost of living, are expected to raise the spending of each public university
student by NT$15,000 to NT$26,000 per semester, Pan said.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, a minimum hike of 5 percent will push public university
tuition and miscellaneous fees into the range of NT$26,000-NT$42,000 per
semester and those of private universities to NT$45,000-NT$74,000 per semester.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Economic Planning and Development  (CEPD)  approved  a plan
Monday to boost tourism construction of national scenic areas, which it
estimated would help the local tourism sector generate NT$1.728 trillion
(US$56.8 billion) in revenue between 2008 and 2011.</P>
      <P>Outlined and proposed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) , the plan calls for NT$20 billion to be allocated during the four-year
period to improve facilities in 13 of Taiwan's national scenic areas and other
local tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Such a plan follows the successful example of a previous MOTC plan that spent
NT$21.811 billion to develop 12 local tourist areas, including the northern
coast area, between 2003 and 2007.</P>
      <P>"To duplicate such a successful case, the new plan will invest in the
construction of service facilities in selected scenic areas, " said the CEPD
Chief Secretary of CEPD York Liao, citing Sun Moon Lake, Alishan, and Dapeng Bay
among those areas targeted for the projects.</P>
      <P>Announcing the approval of the plan at a press conference, Liao said the council
expects the four-year initiative to help Taiwan register an annual 7 percent
increase in tourist arrivals in the four-year period, during which the tourism
industry would total NT$1.728 trillion in revenues.</P>
      <P>Taiwan attracted a total of 3.71 million international tourists in 2007, he
added.</P>
      <P>Liao noted, however, that these projections did not factor in a potential influx
of 3,000 Chinese tourists per day.</P>
      <P>"The council will ask the MOTC to come up with new estimates and map out the
relative complementary measures," he said.</P>
      <P>Increasing the number of inbound Chinese tourists is one of the pledges made by
the new Kuomintang government, which took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Apart  from  the government  plan,  national  scenic  area administration
officials said preparations to accommodate the Chinese tourists in an effort to
maintain tour quality are under way.</P>
      <P>"To capitalize on the potential opportunities that could be brought by the
tourists from across the strait,  the Alishan administration has improved its
shopping environment by ensuring the genuine quality of local teas, " said Jason

    <HEADLINE>Text messages too expensive for disabled people: lawmaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, June 2 (CNA)
06/02/08  21:41:38
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Text message rates in Taiwan are at least 7,000 times higher than voice cell
phone call rates, imposing a heavy burden on local people with listening and
speaking disabilities, a lawmaker suggested Monday.</P>
      <P>Based on the lowest cell phone rate of Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's top mobile
operator, the rate for a 70-Chinese character text message with a transmission
speed of 0.0175 seconds is NT$1.3, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator
Kuan Bi-ling said.</P>
      <P>By contrast, the rate for a voice phone call per second is as low as NT$0.01,
Kuan told a press conference in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>In other words, the text messaging rate is 7,428 times higher than the voice
phone call rate, Kuan argued.</P>
      <P>Based on the same method of calculation, Kuan said that a monthly bill of NT$500
(US$16.6) can cover a maximum of 384 text messages based on the text messaging
rate.</P>
      <P>However, if based on the voice phone call rate, the same bill can cover 2.58
million text messages, which is completely not fair, Kuan complained.</P>
      <P>Kuan's comparative data, which came from Lin Tsung-nan, an associate professor
in National Taiwan University's Department of Electrical Engineering, failed to
account, however, for the fact that humans speak far more slowly than they text.</P>
      <P>Humans speak at rates ranging from 50-300 words per minute, which would
dramatically reduce the gap in pricing between text messaging and voice calls if
calculating  based on imparting  the same information.</P>
      <P>Also not factored in is that telephone conversations exchange more information
than a 70-word text message and last longer, pushing the cost per call higher.</P>
      <P>Still, the Consumers' Foundation also complained last year that Taiwan's text
messaging rates were higher than they were in Hong Kong and Japan.</P>
      <P>The foundation also urged local telecom operators to follow their counterparts
in Hong Kong by allowing subscribers of the same telecom operator to send text
messages for free.</P>
      <P>Kuan believed that local text messaging rates were unfair to the more than
110,000 people in Taiwan with listening and speaking disabilities who rely
heavily on text messages to communicate.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is currently no regulation governing text message rates, Kuan
urged the National Communication Commission (NCC) to amend current regulations
to offer low text message rates to disabled people.</P>
      <P>Kuan added that disabled people should also be entitled to lower video phone
call rates, something local telecom operators, including Chunghwa Telecom Co.,
said they were already doing according to local media reports.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, NCC section chief Hung Ming-chao promised that he will
talk with local telecom operators within the next two weeks to see what can be
done to lower rates.</P>
      <P>The number of text messages sent by people in Taiwan has grown nearly three fold
from 1.28 billion, generating revenues of NT$3.16 billion, in 2001 to 4.49
billion, generating revenues of NT$8.9 billion, in 2008, according to Kuan.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsiao-hwa, a Chinese spouse of a Taiwanese citizen, said at the press
conference through a sign language translator that in China, people with
listening and speaking disabilities do not need to pay if their monthly cell
phone bill is lower than NT$500.</P>
      <P>Wang Tao-peng, head of a union for the welfare of disabled people in the
southern city, complained that local telecom operators offer very low subsidies
to disabled people.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he once talked to Chunghwa Telecom Co. over the issue, but did
not receive a response.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will hold summer camps in rural areas for
teenagers,  enabling them to experience life in the countryside and learn about
agriculture and ecology, COA Vice Chairman Hu Fu-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>A total of 48 camps, with each camp lasting for between three to five days, will
be organized by 31 local farmers' associations around the island for students
aged between 10-17, including those with foreign nationalities, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Participants  will be given  tours  of rice paddies,  tea plantations, ranches,
orchards, or granaries to learn about how agricultural produce is grown and
stored.</P>
      <P>They will also have chance to visit wetlands, owls nests, and even bat caves, to
acquaint themselves with Taiwan's local ecology and wilderness, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The program has also planned activities such as picking bamboo shoots, making
dough, gazing at stars, observing insects and creating ornaments with local
produce for the students, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The COA has run the program for three consecutive years and received positive
responses from participants and parents, Hu said, adding that these camps
provide a safe and precious opportunity for students to learn, play, and create
in a group environment.</P>
      <P>Enrollment opened Monday for the camps that will take place between July 4 and
Aug.  22 and cost between NT$999-NT$3,999 (US$33-US$131) . Detailed information
can be obtained via the activity's Web site at www.summer.touch4u.net.</P>
      <P>Each camp has limited enrollment, and some were fully enrolled on the first day,
Hu said. He urged those interested in the project to sign up as soon as
possible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With Japan-grown mangoes selling in Taiwan for NT$2,800 (US$93) each,
agriculture officials in Pingtung County reminded local farmers Monday that they
still have plenty to learn about growing the fruit.</P>
      <P>In the previous mango season in June 2007, the officials of the southern county
recalled, County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung visited Osaka, Japan to promote
Pingtung-grown mangoes.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Tsao bought a mango produced in Miyazaki Prefecture in southern
Japan at a price of 9,450 yen (US$90).</P>
      <P>After comparing the fruit with Taiwan's Irwin mangoes, he found there was little
difference  in the two mangoes' texture and sweetness. The skin of the Taiwan-
grown Irwins, however, was less bright and colorful than that of the Japanese
fruit, Tsao observed, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>They attributed the difference to Miyazaki farmer procedures of never harvesting
the fruit at a premature stage and growing the crops in limited amounts.</P>
      <P>"They only leave 80 mangoes on one tree; they trim away excessive fruit on the
tree to allow the remaining mangoes to have enough room to grow, " one official
said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, most farmers target output as their key goal, but county officials
suggested that farmers ponder whether they want to breed 200 mangoes on one
tree, which are marketed at NT$50 each, or grow 50 on one tree, which are sold
at NT$200 each.</P>
      <P>Touting the special flavor and texture of Taiwan's mangoes, county officials
suggested that local farmers should not be content with their unique skills and
know-how in breeding sweet and juicy mangoes, but should try to find ways to
upgrade not only the quality but also their presentation and packaging.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin urged his city's residents Monday to observe new
regulations in the Tobacco Hazard Control Act that will forbid smoking in public
places and stress the right of non-smokers to reject second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>According to the new regulations, which will be put into effect on Jan. 11,
2009, smoking will be forbidden in most indoor public spaces, facilities used
primarily for education and youth activities, train stations, and in public
transportation.</P>
      <P>For those who smoke in non-smoking areas, the fine will be raised from the
current NT$1,000-NT$3,000 (US$32-97) to NT$2,000-NT$10,000 (US$64-322) after the
new act is implemented.</P>
      <P>"(The city government) asks citizens to follow the new anti- tobacco
regulations, as smokers should respect the right of others not to breathe
secondhand smoke, " said Hau at a ceremony on the eve of the June 3 Opium
Suppression Movement Day.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Department of Health (DOH) has been building a tobacco-free environment
since 2001. By the end of 2007, more than 3,600 restaurants, 311 workplaces, 122
campuses and taxis from 6 taxi companies in Taipei are tobacco-free, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, smoking is forbidden in 24 outdoor public places in Taipei, such as
parks, squares and zoos, to protect the health of children and young people, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Opium Suppression Movement Day was established to commemorate Lin Ze-xu, a 19th-
century Chinese official who insisted on destroying and prohibiting opium sold
to Chinese people by European countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Administrative fines for drunken driving will increase to as high as NT$60,000
(US$1,987) in July to further stem the practice, according to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The increase in the fine is aimed at bridging the big gap between administrative
fines and those imposed by local courts, the MOTC said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Those found with blood alcohol levels above 0.55 mg will be referred to a local
court and face a maximum fine of NT$150,000, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>At present, administrative fines range between NT$15,000 and NT$52,500, which
will expand to between NT$15,000 and NT$60,000 in July, the MOTC explained.</P>
      <P>The increase was the result of a March meeting called amid society's "zero
tolerance" for drunken driving, the MOTC noted.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) supports the fine increase, said Chen Po-hsun,
director of the NPA's Traffic Department.</P>
      <P>Chen said department statistics showed that higher fines can effectively
decrease the number of accidents and deaths caused by drunken driving.</P>
      <P>After criminal fines were raised to a maximum of NT$150,000 early this year, the
number of drunken driving accidents and deaths fell to 165 and 175,
respectively, in the first four months of this year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The figures were 183 and 203, respectively, in the same period of last year,
Chen noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of  Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo apologized Monday
for a press statement issued by the ministry that condemned the previous
administration over its change of the official name of the country printed on
the stamps.</P>
      <P>Mao offered the apology after a group of opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers expressed their indignation at legislative committee meeting
over the ministry's vengeful approach in handling postal affairs as reflected in
the statement.</P>
      <P>The statement announced the new Kuomintang government's decision to revert to
printing the country's official title -- Republic of China -- on local stamps
from mid-August rather than "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The government also intends to change the name of the postal service back to
Chunghua Post Co., in a reversal of a move made in early 2007 by the then DPP
administration to rename the company Taiwan Post Co.</P>
      <P>The statement also contained a paragraph that read: "We seriously condemn the
previous government for not acting in line with the law and rashly changing the
official name on the stamps from the 'Republic of China' to 'Taiwan.'"</P>
      <P>Mao said if the word "condemn" was deemed impertinent and thus caused
controversies and contentions, he would apologize.</P>
      <P>Despite being pressed by DPP lawmakers, Mao, however, adamantly refused to
reveal who wrote the statement.</P>
      <P>"No matter who drafted the press release, I must take the blame for it, " Mao
said, adding that as a political appointee, he should take full political
responsibility for the misconduct of ministry staff members.</P>
      <P>According to the MOTC's plan, seven more sets of Taiwan Post stamps will be
issued prior to the planned name changes on Aug. 20. The last set of stamps
bearing the word "Taiwan" instead of the nation's official name "Republic of
China" will be issued on Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>The issuance of stamps bearing the "Republic of China" name will resume with a
set of stamps marking the annual Yimin Festival -- a traditional religious
observance among the Hakka every July 20 on the lunar calendar -- and will bee
the first stamps with the name since Feb. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>The name change was made during a de-sinicization campaign initiated by the
former DPP administration in 2006.</P>
      <P>The campaign attempted to get rid of references that connect Taiwan to China to
underscore that Taiwan's national identity was separate from China.</P>
      <P>The campaign also targeted designations of other state-run enterprises.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-lai, director of the MOTC's Department of Posts and
Telecommunications, said last week that the decision to revert back to the old
designation on Taiwan's stamps was made based on the Universal Postal
Convention, which stipulates stamps issued by Universal Postal Union members
should bear the name of the country or territory in Roman letters.</P>
      <P>Despite not being part of the international organization, Taiwan still wants to
follow its regulations, Teng noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bodyguards for Cabinet-level heads to be reviewed: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's chief of staff has asked for a review of a policy to
send police officers to protect ministerial-level heads, amid criticism that
some officials might have abused national security resources, a spokesman of the
Presidential Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi said Chan Chuen-po,  secretary-general  of the Presidential Office,
has asked for the review, instructing that the police officers be removed if not
necessary, and that government heads can reapply for them if the need arises in
the future.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came after Chinese-language daily, the United Daily News,
reported that the new administration has followed the lead of the previous
administration to recklessly apply for police officers to serve as their
bodyguards.</P>
      <P>The report alleged that "national security resource abuse" is very serious and
that the matter has caused disgruntlement among police authorities.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism, the Executive Yuan's spokeswoman said Monday that
there were fewer ministerial-level heads who had applied for police bodyguards
than those who had not applied for them.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, minister of the Government Information Office, said that
16 government heads, including the interior minister, foreign affairs minister
and the education minister, have police officers at their sides, compared with
20 others, including the heads of the Environmental Protection Administration
and Mainland Affairs Council, who don't.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has instructed that government heads can apply for
bodyguards based on considerations of their personal safety, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>"If there is such a need, the government heads can apply for one police
officer," Shih cited the premier as saying.</P>
      <P>The premier also stressed that the major task of the bodyguards is to protect
the personal safety of the government officials, but that they are not
responsible for other tasks, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Agency (NPA) said that it has followed the law in
sending police officers from its Special Police Sixth Headquarters to serve as
bodyguards.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman said that more than 70 police officers were dispatched to
protect the safety of the government heads, and most of them have only one
bodyguard, adding that "the dispatch has not affected police operations."</P>
      <P>"The NPA also routinely reviews the police deployment," he added.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has decided to officially rescind Far
Eastern Air Transport Corp. (FAT) 's right to operate domestic flights as the
heavily indebted carrier failed to resolve its operational problems by a Monday
deadline, a CAA official said Monday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Billy Chang made the announcement after the agency received
a report Monday afternoon from the Taipei-based carrier on how it was solving
its problems.</P>
      <P>However, the report only indicated that the carrier has appointed professional
managers to improve its management problem and left three other problems --
unpaid wages, aircraft lease disputes and insufficient cash flow -- unsolved,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The CAA will inform FAT of the cancellation decision by written notice Tuesday,
and FAT can appeal the decision in five days, Chang said.</P>
      <P>If FAT fails to provide sufficient reasons to reverse the move, the CAA will
report its decision to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
-- which oversees the CAA -- for approval, Chang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that the CAA did not revoke FAT's rights to run
international flights because the carrier said it will receive an injection of
capital by June 15.</P>
      <P>FAT will also lose the right to operate international flights if it fails to fix
the remaining problems and produce by June 15 documents proving interest among
outside investors in the carrier, Chang warned.</P>
      <P>FAT, Taiwan's oldest private carrier, has been hit hard by a deteriorating
domestic aviation market and suspended  all its operations May 13.</P>

      <P>The ratio of women in a list of Control Yuan nominees will rise sharply,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after Vice President Vincent Siew presided over the second
meeting of a screening panel of Control Yuan members during which the
participants discussed the qualifications of the nominees.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the independence of Control Yuan members will be very important,
and the screening panel believes that the choice of a nominee should not
consider party affiliation to underscore the body's independence.</P>
      <P>"The  main concerns  in choosing  the candidates  will be professionalism,
fairness and good character," Wang said, adding that the ratio of women among
the 29 nominees will increase sharply.</P>
      <P>Tu Shan-liang, secretary-general of the Control Yuan, was invited to give a
report on the organization and function of the Control Yuan to the screening
panel.</P>
      <P>Tu also noted that the new Control Yuan members will have to deal with more than
32,000 petitions which has been left unattended because the Control Yuan member
positions have been left vacant for more than three years.</P>
      <P>Wang said the 32,034 petitions included land construction and regulation cases,
judicial litigation cases, and financial cases, which he said will require
expertise, meaning professionalism is important in choosing nominees.</P>
      <P>The screening panel has invited individuals and groups to recommend qualified
candidates until June 5.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has also written letters to major political parties,
asking them to recommend qualified personnel. But the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party said it would not recommend candidates.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will present nomination lists for both the Control Yuan
and the Examination Yuan on June 23 for Legislative Yuan confirmation.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the leading watchdog of elected officials and civil servants
and one of the five branches of government, has been without members since the
term of the previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The last legislature controlled by the KMT persistently rejected a nomination
list proposed by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The six-year term of the 20 Examination Yuan members will also expire Aug. 30

aged between 10-17, including those with foreign nationalities, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Participants  will be given  tours  of rice paddies,  tea plantations, ranches,
orchards, or granaries to learn about how agricultural produce is grown and
stored.</P>
      <P>They will also have chance to visit wetlands, owls nests, and even bat caves, to
acquaint themselves with Taiwan's local ecology and wilderness, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The program has also planned activities such as picking bamboo shoots, making
dough, gazing at stars, observing insects and creating ornaments with local
produce for the students, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The COA has run the program for three consecutive years and received positive
responses from participants and parents, Hu said, adding that these camps
provide a safe and precious opportunity for students to learn, play, and create
in a group environment.</P>
      <P>Enrollment opened Monday for the camps that will take place between July 4 and
Aug.  22 and cost between NT$999-NT$3,999 (US$33-US$131) . Detailed information
can be obtained via the activity's Web site at www.summer.touch4u.net.</P>
      <P>Each camp has limited enrollment, and some were fully enrolled on the first day,
Hu said. He urged those interested in the project to sign up as soon as
possible.</P>

      <P>Administrative fines for drunken driving will increase to as high as NT$60,000
(US$1,987) in July to further stem the practice, according to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The increase in the fine is aimed at bridging the big gap between administrative
fines and those imposed by local courts, the MOTC said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Those found with blood alcohol levels above 0.55 mg will be referred to a local
court and face a maximum fine of NT$150,000, the MOTC said.</P>
      <P>At present, administrative fines range between NT$15,000 and NT$52,500, which
will expand to between NT$15,000 and NT$60,000 in July, the MOTC explained.</P>
      <P>The increase was the result of a March meeting called amid society's "zero
tolerance" for drunken driving, the MOTC noted.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) supports the fine increase, said Chen Po-hsun,
director of the NPA's Traffic Department.</P>
      <P>Chen said department statistics showed that higher fines can effectively
decrease the number of accidents and deaths caused by drunken driving.</P>
      <P>After criminal fines were raised to a maximum of NT$150,000 early this year, the
number of drunken driving accidents and deaths fell to 165 and 175,
respectively, in the first four months of this year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The figures were 183 and 203, respectively, in the same period of last year,
Chen noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's chief of staff has asked for a review of a policy to
send police officers to protect ministerial-level heads, amid criticism that
some officials might have abused national security resources, a spokesman of the
Presidential Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi said Chan Chuen-po,  secretary-general  of the Presidential Office,
has asked for the review, instructing that the police officers be removed if not
necessary, and that government heads can reapply for them if the need arises in
the future.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came after Chinese-language daily, the United Daily News,
reported that the new administration has followed the lead of the previous
administration to recklessly apply for police officers to serve as their
bodyguards.</P>
      <P>The report alleged that "national security resource abuse" is very serious and
that the matter has caused disgruntlement among police authorities.</P>
      <P>In response to the criticism, the Executive Yuan's spokeswoman said Monday that
there were fewer ministerial-level heads who had applied for police bodyguards
than those who had not applied for them.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, minister of the Government Information Office, said that
16 government heads, including the interior minister, foreign affairs minister
and the education minister, have police officers at their sides, compared with
20 others, including the heads of the Environmental Protection Administration
and Mainland Affairs Council, who don't.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has instructed that government heads can apply for
bodyguards based on considerations of their personal safety, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>"If there is such a need, the government heads can apply for one police
officer," Shih cited the premier as saying.</P>
      <P>The premier also stressed that the major task of the bodyguards is to protect
the personal safety of the government officials, but that they are not
responsible for other tasks, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Agency (NPA) said that it has followed the law in
sending police officers from its Special Police Sixth Headquarters to serve as
bodyguards.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman said that more than 70 police officers were dispatched to
protect the safety of the government heads, and most of them have only one
bodyguard, adding that "the dispatch has not affected police operations."</P>
      <P>"The NPA also routinely reviews the police deployment," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ratio of women in a list of Control Yuan nominees will rise sharply,
Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after Vice President Vincent Siew presided over the second
meeting of a screening panel of Control Yuan members during which the
participants discussed the qualifications of the nominees.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the independence of Control Yuan members will be very important,
and the screening panel believes that the choice of a nominee should not
consider party affiliation to underscore the body's independence.</P>
      <P>"The  main concerns  in choosing  the candidates  will be professionalism,
fairness and good character," Wang said, adding that the ratio of women among
the 29 nominees will increase sharply.</P>
      <P>Tu Shan-liang, secretary-general of the Control Yuan, was invited to give a
report on the organization and function of the Control Yuan to the screening
panel.</P>
      <P>Tu also noted that the new Control Yuan members will have to deal with more than
32,000 petitions which has been left unattended because the Control Yuan member
positions have been left vacant for more than three years.</P>
      <P>Wang said the 32,034 petitions included land construction and regulation cases,
judicial litigation cases, and financial cases, which he said will require
expertise, meaning professionalism is important in choosing nominees.</P>
      <P>The screening panel has invited individuals and groups to recommend qualified
candidates until June 5.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office has also written letters to major political parties,
asking them to recommend qualified personnel. But the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party said it would not recommend candidates.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will present nomination lists for both the Control Yuan
and the Examination Yuan on June 23 for Legislative Yuan confirmation.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, the leading watchdog of elected officials and civil servants
and one of the five branches of government, has been without members since the
term of the previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>The last legislature controlled by the KMT persistently rejected a nomination
list proposed by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The six-year term of the 20 Examination Yuan members will also expire Aug. 30

says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed pro-democracy students in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square is a major factor which has driven the Chinese communists
toward a more open society.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to which men are
liable when in the presence of their superiors. First, to speak out when one is
not called upon to speak: that is called being forward. Second, to keep silent
when called upon to speak: that is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak
out without taking into consideration the expression in the eyes of the person
spoken to: that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Wang Sing-nan on
Tuesday urged the government to adopt daylight saving time to help conserve
energy and cut carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Wang and two of his colleagues said in a news conference that if the government
wanted to cut the use of air conditioning, in addition to encouraging officials
not wear their jackets, it should also follow the lead of 110 nations in the
world and adopt daylight saving time.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers argued that moving clocks forward an hour during the summer months
to make better use of daylight was a "more effective approach" to conserving
energy.</P>
      <P>If people could get to work an hour earlier in the summer, they would not have
to turn on the air conditioner or the lights, and if they got off work an hour
earlier, they could also use natural lighting to do things around their homes.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that Taiwan implemented daylight saving time 27 years ago, but
achieved only limited benefits at the time because of insufficient publicity.</P>
      <P>Air conditioners and electrical appliances were also not as popular as they are
today, Wang said, and this is why he wanted to suggest to Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan to consider the idea of adopting daylight saving time.</P>
      <P>Wang's colleague Chai Trong-rong also said an online survey showed that 52.8
percent of the public "are very supportive" of daylight saving time, "and that
18.6 percent said that they "are in favor" of daylight saving time.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Twu Shiing-jer also said that daylight saving time not only helps
conserve energy, but helps the public form the good habit of early to bed and
early to rise which will make them healthy, wealthy and wise.</P>

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung has said that he did not touch
upon the removal of over 1,000 Chinese missiles targeting Taiwan during his May
28 meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Wu told local reporters Monday that he only stressed the importance of cross-
strait peace during the one-hour meeting in Beijing, the highlight of his six-
day visit to China.</P>
      <P>The China Times, a major Chinese-language daily based in Taipei, recently quoted
anonymous sources, however, as saying that Beijing leaders privately told the
KMT leaders in Beijing that the missiles will be gradually removed since the
KMT's coming to power has put paid to the likelihood of de jure Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>The meeting marked the first time the leaders of the ruling parties in Taiwan
and China had met, with Hu attending in his capacity as the general secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The meeting was seen as a major milestone in rapidly warming cross-strait
relations after the pro-China KMT came to power on May 20, ending the eight-year
rule of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors formal Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>Wu explained that his visit to China was aimed at establishing mutual trust to
pave the way for both sides to handle cross-strait peace issues.</P>
      <P>The issues include the establishment of a military mutual trust mechanism and
the signing of a cross-strait peace agreement, which were part of the goals of a
communique signed by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and Hu in 2005.</P>
      <P>The removal of missiles,  he said,  could be handled  by quasi-official
intermediary bodies --  the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- or through
other channels in the future.</P>
      <P>China has been building up the number of its missiles targeting Taiwan over the
years and has threatened to use force against self-ruled Taiwan if it declares
formal independence.</P>
      <P>Wu said he told President Ma Ying-jeou during a May 31 briefing on his Chinese
visit that he "felt" that China greatly appreciated Taiwan's outpouring of
sympathy and donations for quake victims in Sichuan in southwestern China and
therefore it was not likely that Beijing would launch missiles against Taipei.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a European Union Center (EU Center) in collaboration with
Taiwanese universities will be completed before the end of this year as
scheduled despite delays in the official "call for proposal, " Guy Ledoux,
director of the Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"I'm very sad that there has been this delay in Brussels but it is purely for
administrative reasons, " Ledoux told the Central News Agency, adding that his
office will probably announce the call for proposal in the next few days.</P>
      <P>A call for proposal must be published before the cooperation project can be
submitted for funding.</P>
      <P>"The good news is the budget has been slightly increased from NT$40 million to
1.1 million euro, which is nearly NT$50 million, " he said. "Maybe it was worth
waiting a few months to get 10 more millions."</P>
      <P>The EETO announced in January its ambitious and comprehensive plan to work with
universities in Taiwan in establishing the EU Center to promote bilateral
relations and increase Taiwanese people's awareness of the EU.</P>
      <P>This project intends to consolidate and develop existing networks as well as
promote knowledge about the EU among Taiwan's people, signifying the degree the
EU values its relations with Taiwan even though there are no formal diplomatic
relations between the two.</P>
      <P>The EU Center would promote studies of the EU, its institutions and policies,
and EU-Taiwan relations through research programs, scholarly research and
outreach activities in local and regional communities.</P>
      <P>The EU Center network in the Asia Pacific region already spans South Korea,
Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Taiwan will be the third East Asian country
to join this network.</P>
      <P>Ledoux disclosed that four universities in Taiwan have approached him regarding
the project and an official from Brussels visiting Taiwan in February was very
impressed  by these universities' presentations.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, the official, whose primary focus is the EU Center
project, visited all four universities to look at the facilities and meet with
the professors, according to Ledoux.</P>
      <P>"The official had a report saying that the agencies are fantastic and there will
be absolutely no problem finding a very good university in Taiwan for the EU
Center," he said.</P>
      <P>This is the third cycle (2005-2008) of the EU Centers program, which was
launched in 1998. The EU Centers program will help create a foothold for EU
studies in Taiwan's higher education circles and serves as an information
resource for a broad Taiwan audience.</P>
      <P>The EETO acts as the de facto embassy in Taiwan promoting bilateral economic and
trade exchanges with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that he is cautiously optimistic about the
launch of direct cross-Taiwan Strait weekend charter flights and the entry of
Chinese tourists as planned on July 4.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while answering questions from Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker
Lee Ching-hua during an intepellation session, saying that there have been no
unanticipated difficulties in negotiations with China on the two issues.</P>
      <P>The premier hailed KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's recent six-day visit to China
and said he had returned with information helpful to the government in charting
a course for these issues -- both major campaign promises of President Ma Ying-
jeou.</P>
      <P>As to whether the two sides could complete negotiations by July on direct cross-
strait cargo charter flights, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
expressed confidence that the implementation of direct cargo charters would not
lag far behind the opening of passenger charter services.</P>
      <P>Wu met with Communist Party of China General Secretary and Chinese President Hu
Jintao May 28 in Beijing. The meeting was the first ever between the incumbent
leaders of the ruling parties of Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Wu and Hu agreed to resume two-way systematic negotiations between the Taipei-

      <P>The Cabinet will unveil a series of policies based on President Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign promises in mid-June after completing a review of the pledges, Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu said that during the review, the Cabinet will adjust the promises if
necessary and lay out the policies in accordance with their importance, adding
that the Cabinet will also arrange funding necessary for the programs.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative
Yuan when asked how the Cabinet would cope with the major expenditures needed to
realize Ma's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Shu-lei listed a number of commitments the new
government has already made that would decrease government revenues or increase
spending.</P>
      <P>Among them, the reduction of an excise tax on fuel products is expected to
decrease government revenue by NT$10 billion over the next six months and a plan
to offer an allowance equal to 60 percent of salary for workers on parental
leave for up to two years would cost NT$20 billion per year.</P>
      <P>In addition,  a plan to provide young people preferential mortgages that are
partially interest-free during the first two years would cost NT$2.7 billion per
year, and the plan to launch a voluntary military service system would cost
NT$60 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Lo also questioned the Cabinet's rashness in putting forth an NT$114.4 billion
package aimed at boosting domestic demand by increasing public infrastructure
projects, expressing concerns that the measure might result in the construction
of a large number of idle facilities.</P>
      <P>Liu explained the Cabinet had only limited time before finalizing the
supplementary budget for the package because the Cabinet wants the legislature
to approve it by mid-July, when the lawmaking body goes on its summer recess.</P>
      <P>Liu said most of the projects covered by the package are small ones that can be
completed within six months.</P>
      <P>As to idle public facilities built during the former Democratic Progressive
Party administration, Liu said the Cabinet will try to work out measures to
revive them using the most cost-efficient method.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Financial  Supervisory  Commission  Chairman  Hu Sheng-cheng said
the commission is communicating with concerned authorities on plans to ease
restrictions on the inflows of Chinese capital and encourage China-based Taiwan
businesses to list in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu said measures regarding allowing indirect investment in Taiwan by Chinese
investors will be finalized within one month at the earliest.</P>

points providing the service to Internet users over an area of 230 square
kilometers.</P>
      <P>"We did not develop WiMAX infrastructure then because it was only in the making
at that time," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said, however, that WiMAX offers a better quality of Internet service because
of its more mature technology with bigger bandwidth and high-speed mobility.</P>
      <P>The wireless Internet service currently in use cannot maintain normal operations
if a laptop in use is being used in a vehicle traveling at a speed of more than
50 kilometers per hour, but WiMAX chipsets enable laptops to remain connected to
the Internet while moving as fast as 80 km/hr.</P>
      <P>"WiMAX creates an open architecture  of wireless broadband service, as every
computer can be compatible with the service as long as the standards are the
same," the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma also referred to one of his pledges -- the 12 construction projects -- saying
his government will be using WiMAX technology to help build Taiwan into an
island of intellectual technology.</P>
      <P>He believed the technology will help narrow the digital divide.</P>
      <P>"We can especially help rural areas and the children there by donating advanced
computers with broader, better Internet access," Ma suggested.</P>
      <P>WiMAX's outdoor wireless quality could also help the country's less developed
areas that might not have adequate electric power facilities, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the record-breaking scale of the computer exhibition, Ma said the
event is estimated to generate business transactions worth US$15-20 billion
(NT$456-608 billion), while generating another NT$1 billion in revenues for the
area during the five-day event.</P>
      <P>He highlighted the increase in participation at this year's show, which is
welcoming a record-high 1,725 exhibitors occupying 4,492 booths, a 29 percent
and 53 percent increase respectively,</P>
      <P>The world's second largest computer show after CeBIT in Germany, Computex is
scheduled to run from June 3 to June 7.</P>
      <P>This year's Computex is spread over four venues -- the Taiwan World Trade Center
(TWTC) Exhibition Halls 1 and 3, the newly completed Nangang Exhibition Hall,
and the Taipei International Convention Center -- while a corresponding event,
WiMAX Expo is being held from June 2-6 at TWTC Exhibition Hall 2.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ranking officials can apply for more bodyguards if necessary: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that ministerial-level heads can have one
police officer serving as their bodyguard in principle, but if they have a need,
they could apply for more.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks during a question-and-answer session in the
Legislative Yuan during which Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the ruling Kuomintang
asked him about police officers working to protect government officials.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that more than 40 police officers were sent to related government
agencies on January 1 this year, and that the number was cut to 20 after May 20,
when Liu's Cabinet took office.</P>
      <P>Amid reports of discontent among police who think the abuse of the police force
by government officials has not only added to their already heavy work load but
has also reduced the number of police available to maintain law and order, the
Cabinet decided Monday that each ministerial-level official can apply for one
bodyguard in principle.</P>
      <P>Liu said that he agreed more police officers should return to their regular
duties to help maintain law and order, while stressing the safety of government
officials should also be ensured.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the security needs of each government official may vary,
and the premier said the guiding principle is "one bodyguard for one government
official."</P>
      <P>"If the officials have the need, or have safety considerations during a specific
time period, they could apply anytime to get more," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jiang Yi-huah, minister of the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission, has sent his bodyguard back to the Special Police Sixth Headquarters
under the National Police Agency (MPA) Monday.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that as his commission has to evaluate the performance of state-owned
enterprises, his predecessor Shih Neng-chieh had suggested to him to apply for a
bodyguard.</P>
      <P>But because the public has misgivings about using police officers in the role,
he has decided to send the policeman assigned to him back to the NPA and will
see if he needs to apply for protection in the future.</P>
      <P>Shih Su-mei, minister of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, also sent her bodyguard back to the NPA Monday.</P>
      <P>The Government  Information  Office  said Tuesday  that 21 ministerial-level
heads have not applied for bodyguards, compared to 15 heads who have bodyguards.
Among the 15, Defense Minister Chen Chao-min uses his staff, while Central Bank
of China Governor Perng Fai-nan has bank workers protecting him.</P>
      <P>Asked who among former government officials still have security personnel
accompanying them, Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi replied that as of
Monday, former Premiers Chang Chun-hsiung, and Su Tseng-chang and former
Examination Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh have bodyguards sent by the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu dismissed reports Tuesday that she has six
bodyguards, saying that from the day she served as the head of the Council of
Labor Affairs to her current position as mayor, she has used only one bodyguard.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Farmers' groups around Taiwan have released 8,380 tons of frozen vegetables into
the market to compensate for a fall in the supply of fresh vegetables caused by
heavy rains that have affected Taiwan since late May, agriculture officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains have caused damage to agricultural production in the central
county of Yunlin, where 190 hectares of farmland was inundated by floodwaters,
the Agriculture and Food Agency said.</P>
      <P>The agency estimated that agricultural losses have amounted to NT$3.2 million in
Yunlin, one of Taiwan's major vegetable and fruit producing regions, and said
that leafy vegetables were hit the hardest.</P>
      <P>Agency officials were confident, however, that the release of the frozen stocks
would remain sufficient to meet local demand, and called the agricultural losses
minor.</P>
      <P>Food agency statistics showed wholesale vegetable prices averaged NT$17.8 per kg
at the Taipei wholesale market Tuesday, higher by NT$0.9 per kg compared with
the level on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau reported Tuesday that a front carrying a lot of
moisture that arrived in Taiwan May 29 is still hovering above the island and
continues to lash parts of Taiwan with heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the bureau released a torrential rain warning for areas
south of Hsinchu, reminding people living in mountainous regions to take
precautions against possible landslides and those living in low-lying areas to
watch for possible flooding.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, Siluo township of Yunlin had received rainfall of more than 300
mm in the 24 hours since early Monday afternoon. Part of the township -- a main
vegetable production center -- was flooded with water that had reached a level
15-20 centimeters high, the weather bureau reported.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EETO calls for Taiwan to open up market and increase investment in EU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
06/03/08  16:25:43
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) Tuesday called for
Taiwan to open up its market to European consumer products and increase its
investment in the European Union (EU) to narrow the huge trade and investment
gap between the two economies.</P>
      <P>"I think we need to find ways of improving European access to Taiwanese markets
for European goods, " EETO Director Guy Ledoux said at a news conference in
which the office released its annual publication titled "the EU-Taiwan Trade and
Investment Factfile."</P>
      <P>"So we very much welcome President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration speech where he
said Taiwan's economy needs to open up because we hope that it will improve the
access of European companies to Taiwanese markets," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was sworn in on May 20, said in his inauguration speech that islands
like Taiwan flourish in an open economy and wither in a closed one. Therefore,
Taiwan must open up and deregulate the economy to unleash the vitality of the
private sector and to strengthen Taiwan's comparative advantages.</P>
      <P>Ledoux noted that the EU faces difficulties in exporting to Taiwan food products
such as meat, in which it has a strong interest.</P>
      <P>"We very much hope that with President Ma's announcement to open up Taiwan's
economy, he will also increasingly open up (Taiwan's markets) to European
consumer products," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that food safety is the main concern for Taiwanese government at the
moment, Ledoux contended that "if those products have passed the safety
regulations of the EU, we firmly believe that they should also be acceptable to
Taiwan's consumers."</P>
      <P>Expressing great confidence in Taiwan's economic prospects and bilateral
relations, Ledoux said it is unfortunate that there has been a lack of knowledge
of the European market among Taiwanese businessmen despite Taiwan's deep trade
ties with the EU.</P>
      <P>The EU is Taiwan's 3rd largest export market behind China and the United States
but ahead of Japan, and trade between the EU and Taiwan increased by 10 percent
in 2007, according to Ledoux, citing local statistics.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Taiwan is the EU's 13th largest trading partner, and that the
EU is the largest economy in the world and the largest foreign investor in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"However, the low level of EU exports to Taiwan largely explains both the EU's
sustained deficit and the gradual decline in Taiwan's position among the EU's
major trading partners," he said.</P>
      <P>Ledoux urged local businesses not to lose ground to other countries in Europe
and its healthy investment environment, and he hoped the investment report would
help Taiwan's new administration learn more about European markets.</P>
      <P>"This year we have made a special report called 'EU on the Top.' The aim of this
section is to emphasize changes in the EU, which is particularly important as
you have a new administration here in Taiwan," Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>"I think it's useful to inform the new administration about the recent changes
that have been taking place in the EU," he said.</P>
      <P>The EETO's 2008 Factfile stated that Taiwan's foreign direct investment (FDI) in
the EU remains low and out of proportion to the level of trade, not to mention
the level and ranking of EU investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Eurostat data, total Taiwanese investment in the EU fell to around
700 million euros at the end of 2003 and only gradually climbed back to 1.1
billion euros by the end of 2006, the factfile said.</P>
      <P>It added that Taiwan's FDI in the EU is not only less than that of Singapore,
which had 37 billion euros of investment in the EU at the end of 2006, but also
less than Hong Kong (16 billion euros), and India and mainland China, which each
has more than 3 billion euros invested in the EU.</P>
      <P>Also, the comparison of trends between Taiwan and South Korea is the most
telling, the factfile said.</P>
      <P>With more than 8 billion euros of FDI in the EU at the end of 2006, South Korea
has shown a remarkable awareness of its interest in establishing a strong
presence and being part of the game in the world's largest economy.</P>
      <P>"It is high time for Taiwan's business to wake up to this reality," the factfile
said.</P>

(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday called for further local
efforts to help the victims of Cyclone Nargis that hit Myanmar in early May,
saying the government is determined to continue to help members of the
international community in need.</P>
      <P>Addressing a press conference attended by MOFA officials and nongovernment
organizations involved in relief efforts in Myanmar, Deputy Foreign Minister
Andrew L. Y. Hsia hoped humanitarian aid to the victims will continue.</P>
      <P>"We at the MOFA will never lag behind other nations in providing those in need
in the international community with humanitarian assistance," Hsia stressed.</P>
      <P>He said his agency would continue its successful cooperation with NGOs to
undertake relief work in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Following the return from Myanmar of a second relief group providing mostly
medical assistance to the cyclone victims between May 23 and June 1, Dharma
Master Shin Tao urged the international community to pay more attention to the
country's orphans and drinking water problem in Myanmar's disaster areas.</P>
      <P>The relief group was comprised of Buddhist masters from the Ling Jiou Mountain
Buddhist Society (LJMBS), rescuers of the International Headquarters S.A.R.,
Taiwan, and doctors and nurses from the Taiwan International Health Action
(Taiwan IHA.)</P>
      <P>Hsin Tao, born in Myanmar, is founder of the LJMBS, the first relief group from
Taiwan permitted by the Myanmese government to carry out humanitarian assistant
immediately after the cyclone devastated Myanmar in early May.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the globe is without boundaries and is also a responsibility of
all international citizens, the Master further promised that the LJMBS will
continue to focus on care for an estimated 2,000 orphans as well as water
quality in the next phase of its relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Extending his appreciation for Taiwanese businessmen in Myanmar and local monks
in helping Taiwan's relief works, Lu Cheng Tsung, head of the International
Headquarters S.A.R., Taiwan, who was also involved in the mission, said that
"the victims' mental health and control of contagious diseases are both crucial
at the moment."</P>
      <P>As to the strong reluctance of the Myanmar government to allow relief groups
into the country to carry out humanitarian aide, Lu urged the media to report in
a more positive manner on Myanmar so that relief efforts could proceed more
smoothly.</P>
      <P>According to the official report from Myanmar, the cyclone has caused some
78,000 deaths with more than 56,000 people still missing. However, relief groups
and the Red Cross estimate that the death toll could have topped 128,000.</P>
      <P>The storm passed directly over the densely populated  and low-lying Irrawaddy
Delta, inundating the delta and sweeping large number of residents to their
deaths.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government is still assessing the possibility of having Mayor
Chen Chu take part in an international travel fair later this month in Beijing,
municipal Information Office Director-General Shih Che said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the Kaohsiung city government has yet to submit Chen's
application to the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to seek approval
for Chen's trip to China, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih indicated that the city's decision to submit an application will depend on
the MAC's attitude on the issue. The city government will fully respect the
MAC's policy and its decision, he said.</P>
      <P>On whether the pro-Taiwan independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) would also approve of Chen's Beijing trip, Shih said the mayor herself
will deal with party headquarters over the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated on Tuesday her requirement for parity and dignity if she travels
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China soured over the past eight years under the
DPP rule, which bowed out as the ruling party on May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen hopes to attend the 2008 Beijing travel expo from June 19-21, in which the
city government intends to set up a 12-booth Kaohsiung Pavilion to sell the port
city in southern Taiwan to Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>After a public protest by Shih, China eventually approved the application by
Shih and that of the city's Economic Affairs Bureau director, Liu Hsin-cheng, to
participate in the 2008 international travel fair in the Chinese capital.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday commended Taiwan's non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) as good partners of the government in
promoting the nation, and promised to work closely with them to make the country
known to the world.</P>
      <P>David Wu, vice chairman of the MOFA's NGO Affairs Committee, said he hoped that
the relations between the MOFA and the NGOs will continue to flourish, noting
that the NGOs have helped Taiwan in its international cooperation efforts and in
supplementing its diplomatic work with many countries in the absence of official
ties.</P>
      <P>"The NGOs are all good helpers of the MOFA in its foreign affairs work, " Wu
said. "We in the NGO Affairs Committee will do our utmost to be the NGOs'
friend, assistant and partner."</P>
      <P>Wu said he hoped more resources will be allocated to Taiwan's 2,162 NGOs which
are frequently involved in international affairs and cooperation, and he
encouraged those organizations that plan to engage in international activities
to apply for funding from the MOFA.</P>
      <P>Referring to a Web site specially designed to serve as a platform for
government-NGO exchanges, Wu said that "all NGOs are welcome to apply online for
funds."</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the Web site -- http: //www.taiwan.ngo.tw-- launched in
November 2007, also serves as a channel through which "the international
community can gain a better understanding of what we (in the Taiwan government)
are doing."</P>
      <P>The MOFA also hopes that through the Web site it will be able to integrate all
sorts of local resources to help people in need in other countries, Wu added.</P>
      <P>At routine MOFA briefing, Wu say that the efforts of Taiwan's NGOs have earned
the organizations, as well as the government, a good reputation, and pledged to
continue to work "to establish a good international image for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Through the NGOs and their efforts, Taiwan can be well-connected with  the
international  community...  and the MOFA  has the responsibility and duty to
assist them," Wu stated.</P>

      <P>A total of 21 Taiwan digital content and cultural creative industry companies
are set to take part in the New York Licensing International Expo 2008 to be
held June 10-12.</P>
      <P>The companies are participating in the world's largest licensing fair at the
invitation  of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB) and the nongovernmental Institute for Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The III and the Investment and Trade Office of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative  Office in New York will introduce the Taiwanese companies taking
part in the fair at a presentation slated to be held at the TECRO office on June
11.</P>
      <P>The Investment and Trade Office said that Taiwan's digital content industry has
been included in the government's "Two Trillion and Twin Star" industry
development project for the new century.</P>
      <P>Among the items being promoted under the program are digital content software,
digital audio-visual products, mobile application services, Internet services,
digitalized publishing, cultural and artistic industries, and digital
recreational and entertainment industries, to name a few.</P>
      <P>The office said that Taiwan's digital content industry has high growth
potential, noting that its production value reached US$12.3 billion (NT$373.1
billion) for 2007 and is expected to surpass the US$$20 billion (US$606.6
billion) mark by 2011.</P>
      <P>According to the office, the digital content industry can help traditional
industries increase their knowledge content, thereby transforming them into high
value-added industries, while at the same time serving as a basis to strengthen
Taiwan's overall industrial competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau and the III have therefore invited the Taiwan
digital content and creative cultural industry companies to take part in the New
York expo as a way of helping Taiwan's industry tap into international  markets
and increase exchanges with related U.S. companies.</P>
      <P>Since 2005, Taiwanese businesses, academics, government agencies and private
organizations have taken part in over 20 international licensing shows,
introducing Taiwan's cultural creative products and high value-added designs</P>
      <P>The New York show is the world's largest international licensing fair. Over 600
businesses, including major Hollywood production companies, several Fortune 500
firms, and leading publishing houses, will set up booths at this year's show,
according to the organizer -- the International Licensing Industry
Merchandisers'  Association (LIMA).</P>
      <P>More than 25,000 retailers, manufacturers and licensees from around the world
are expected to visit this year's show, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Pavilion for the New York show is being organized by the National
Science Council and presented by the Taiwan e-Learning and Digital Archives
Program under the theme "Creative Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The pavilion will be divided into "Licensing  Brands" and "Innovative Brands"

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO) said Tuesday that the
European Union will support Taiwan's participation in international
organizations if it reaches consensus with China on the issue.</P>
      <P>"If the dialogue between Taiwan and China is put forward and there is a
political signing between the two parties for Taiwan's participation in the
world's organizations, we will certainly support that and welcome that, " EETO
Director Guy Ledoux said in a news conference.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to reporters' questions about whether the EU
will support Taiwan's participation in international bodies like the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>He, however, reiterated that the consistent position held by the EU is that in
the framework of the one China policy, which it adheres to, the EU will continue
to support Taiwan's participation in specialized multilateral fora where
statehood is not a requirement, especially where Taiwan's practical
participation directly affects its people and is important to the EU and global
interests.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying, unsuccessfully, to become an observer in the World
Health Assembly, WHO's highest decision-making body, under its official title,
the Republic of China, since 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's participation in international organizations have been repeatedly
blocked by China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province to be reunited.</P>
      <P>Ties between China and Taiwan remained chilly during former President  Chen
Shui-bian's  term in office  because  of his administration's frequent assertion
that Taiwan is a sovereign country independent from the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>However, relations between Taiwan and China have improved under Ma's government,
which was inaugurated on May 20, and China's President Hu Jintao also said
recently that the issue of giving Taiwan more international space can be
discussed.</P>
      <P>Expressing confidence in cross Taiwan Strait relations and EU-Taiwan relations,
Ledoux said the two statements released by the EU on March 22 and May 26,
respectively, have special meaning as it is probably the first time the EU made
such a clear statement about cross- strait relations.</P>
      <P>"This is also a sign of Europe giving more importance to nations of the region
in general and is more assertive on the international stage," he said.</P>
      <P>Six days after Ma took office, the Slovenian Presidency of the EU released a
statement on May 26, saying that the EU welcomes the positive momentum given to
the development of cross-strait relations in the inaugural speech by Taiwan's
new leader Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>It added that the EU believes that the establishment of a new administration in
Taiwan provides a unique opportunity for the two sides to make further progress
in their practical relations and opens the possibility  for them to take
positive steps towards the resumption of a meaningful dialogue which will be of
benefit to the people on both sides of the Strait and would enhance regional
peace and stability.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater has started accepting applications
for its "Wanderer" program, which provides subsidies for artists to travel
abroad or take time off to gain artistic inspiration.</P>
      <P>This year, the program is inviting professionals in the social service field to
apply.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the theater Tuesday, budding artists or people in
social service age 30 or younger and have an enthusiasm in literature, music,
performance art, or image art, are welcome to send their application to Cloud
Gate.</P>
      <P>Experienced senior social workers and professional artists at or under the age
of 45 are also welcome to apply under a separate category, the executive said.</P>
      <P>The deadline for applying is July 23.</P>
      <P>Each of the winners will receive grant money amounting to between NT$80,000
(US$2,625) and NT$150,000 as well as plane tickets to travel mainly in Asia for
at least 60 days. Subsidy receivers will have to travel within next year and
complete their trips by Dec. 31 that year.</P>
      <P>Last year's subsidy recipients included one person who traveled on the Silk
Road, from China to Europe, to learn about different cultures and another who
spent time in Vietnam studying traditional music. Others went to China.</P>
      <P>Grant recipient Yi Chun-shan, however, chose Taiwan as her place for "wandering"
because as a physically disabled art therapist, she hoped to rediscover this
land where she felt hurt by its people due to prejudice against her disability
since she was little.</P>
      <P>The program was initiated in 2004 by Cloud Gate Dance Theater's founder Lin
Hwai-min. It has been sponsored by the Stans Foundation since 2006, and since
then has provided financial assistance to a total of 36 Taiwanese artists, the

    <HEADLINE>Premier to mull omitting '1992 Consensus' from cross-strait pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that he will "cautiously consider" omitting
the term "1992 Consensus" from any legal documents signed by the intermediary
bodies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait when they meet next week.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu was referring to the upcoming talks between the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Beijing counterpart the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) scheduled for June 11-14.</P>
      <P>The meeting was announced May 29, a day after ruling Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-
hsiung held a historic meeting with Communist Party of China General Secretary
and Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing.</P>
      <P>During a question-and-answer session at the Legislature, the premier said that
the "1992 Consensus" refers to recognition of "one China" with respective
interpretations of the term, and there will be no debate on whether "one China"
means the Republic of China or the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He said that the government has authorized the SEF to engage in talks with the
ARATS on two issues -- weekend cross-strait charter flights  and China's
permission  of its people to Taiwan for sightseeing purposes -- and the
negotiations will not include any political issues.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the "1992 Consensus" is a political issue that requires
authorization to be included in any cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>In the upcoming talks, any agreement between the SEF and the ARATS that mentions
the "1992 Consensus," would be "exceeding the authorization given," he said.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party legislators  Tsai Huang-liang and
Chiu Yi-ying have asked that any legal documents signed by the SEF and the ARATS
omit reference to the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that to Taiwan, the term one China is open to respective
interpretations, but to China, it means adherence to its "one-China" principle.</P>
      <P>He said that if the "1992 Consensus" is included in any documents signed between
the SEF and the ARATS, it would be a "denigration" of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Tsai also challenged the premier to show some guts, urging him not to be a
"rubber stamp to the Wu-Hu talks."</P>
      <P>After Wu concluded his six-day visit to China May 31, the DPP blasted his talks
with Hu, arguing that such party-to-party exchanges without the scrutiny of the
Legislative Yuan will hurt Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's ruling party, the KMT has the responsibility to push for official
cross-strait negotiations, and it is intolerable to allow the party to lead
government operations, as was the case in the martial law era when the KMT was
in power, the opposition party said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several Taiwanese information technology enterprises participating in the
Computex Taipei 2008, or the Taipei International Information Technology Show,
which opened Tuesday, are exhibiting green IT products, showing local producers'
focus on adopting the concept of green technology.</P>
      <P>As environmental protection is becoming an international trend, Taiwan,
generally considered a high tech leader, has been aiming to develop more energy-
saving products, said the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) ,
the exposition's organizer, in a statement.</P>
      <P>To showcase Taiwanese companies' green products, a Green IT pavilion has been
set up at the exposition this year, exhibiting eco- friendly creations,
including solar power systems, LED display panels, and power- saving devices.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Green IT pavilion, many companies exhibiting at the fair also
promoted their green technologies to help clients save energy.</P>
      <P>Top computer brand maker Asus, for example, promoted its "energy processing
unit" (EPU) , which automatically modifies the voltage consumed by the computer
according  to the system loading in real-time.</P>
      <P>Sean Lai,  the senior manager of Asus' multimedia product marketing department,
explained that the EPU, a chip installed on the motherboard, is used to detect
the system loading and to adjust the power operation.</P>
      <P>Thus, when a computer executes a program that requires low loading, such as
document processing softwares, the EPU will provide less energy than when the
computer executes a program needing high loading, such as Internet games, he
said, adding that about 40 percent of energy is saved with the leading
technology.</P>
      <P>According to Asus, when 24 million computers equipped with the EPU are shipped,
the carbon dioxide emission saved equals to the quantity that 40,000 trees can
absorb in a year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the energy-saving chip, a similar product, an integrated circuit,
has been developed by another company for machines in constant operation, such
as vending machines, automated teller  machines,  lottery  system  or kiosks in
airports  or transportation stations.</P>
      <P>"With the equipment, our clients can reduce energy consumption by 60 to 70
percent, " said Daniel Huang, Research and Development Product Manager for the
company, the Sunix Group.</P>
      <P>The Computex Taipei 2008, the world's second largest information technology show
only after that of Hannover, Germany, opens at the Taipei World Trade Center to
visitors from June 3-7, with more than 1,500 companies scheduled to exhibit
there.</P>

      <P>The innovative awards at the Computex Taipei exhibition will spur local
manufacturers to develop more products that have export potential, Shih Yen-
shiang, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In announcing the winners of the Best Choice of Computex Taipei Awards at the
opening of the computer show,  Shih said such recognition will encourage
Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT) companies to proactively
promote product technology and innovative design.</P>
      <P>"In addition, companies in the pursuit of excellence will be more willing to
invest in product development research," he said.</P>
      <P>One of the highlights of the show is the display of the 39 Best Choice products
chosen from among 550 entries. The winning items include data storage,
notebooks, motherboards, and security software systems.</P>
      <P>Apart from the local prizes, the trade show also featured its first-ever
Computex Taipei Design &amp; Innovation Award, which drew 139 entries from
Germany, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. The field has been narrowed down to
17 finalists.</P>
      <P>"WiMAX, ICT crossover, compact notebook PCs, and green information technology
(IT) are the main themes in this year's exhibition," said John Hsuan, the
convener of the Board of Supervisors of Taipei Computer Association, one of the
organizers of the show.</P>
      <P>The products displayed by the 17 finalists included notebooks and storage
devices, with an emphasis on high power efficiency and lightweight easy-to-carry
features.</P>
      <P>Four out of the 17 products selected, including a digital photoframe made by
Taiwanese ICT giant AsusTek, were picked for entry to the Gold Award. The hand-
sized AsusTek photoframe is capable of displaying Window Vista sideshow
programs, just like a mini monitor.</P>
      <P>Industry specialists said this year's innovations in both award categories were
an indication of the future direction of Taiwan's ICT products.</P>
      <P>"Many of the award winners are aiming to put their 'killer applications' into
use via various platforms," said Brendon Lo, a marketing specialist from
Gigabyte, another world-leading Taiwanese company.</P>
      <P>Killer applications refer to core computer programs with high market value.</P>
      <P>Lo mentioned the example of one his company's winning products, the UMPC M700,
which can function in various roles, such as a global positioning system (GPS)
or Internet Protocol Television (IPTV), within a 7-inch touch screen tablet PC.</P>
      <P>"Many of these long-existing technologies were given new life when they were
reconfigured for different machines or gadgets," Lo noted.</P>
      <P>He added that although these state-of-the-art creations might not necessarily be
profitable because of market uncertainty and high production costs, they have
indeed created more possibilities in the ICT world.</P>
      <P>"In addition, many of the innovative IT products from the two awards feature
friendlier designs," Lo said, citing as an example one of the motherboards on
display that looks more like a toy than an electrical circuit board because it
so colorful.</P>
      <P>To ensure these latest Taiwan-made ICT advancements are shown on the global
market, the other organizer of the show, Taiwan External Trade and Development
Council (TAITRA), has mobilized its branch offices around the world to put
together 12 groups of buyers from countries that include France, Japan, Hong
Kong and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The organizers estimated that 40,000 overseas buyers from 32 countries will
attend the five-day show from June 3-7.</P>

      <P>A total of 34 types of railway commodities, including the pocket watches used by
train conductors or station masters in the 1950's, will become available in the
market starting Wednesday to celebrate the 121st anniversary of the railway in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is also to mark the 100 anniversary of the completion of the Western Line
connecting the northern Keelung City and the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
according to Li Kun-kuang, a division chief of the Catering  Service  Department
at the Taiwan  Railways Administration (TRA.)</P>
      <P>In addition to 100 pocket watches priced at NT$ 33,000 (US$1,089) each,
figurines of train stewardesses and conductors in the TRA's 1978 uniforms, will
also hit the market and are expected to be snapped up by railway fans and
collectors, Li told a CNA reporter in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Ticket punchers that are no longer in use in Taiwan are also worthy of
collection, " Li said, adding that those devices will also become available.</P>
      <P>Noting that railway culture is closely connected with people's lives in Taiwan,
Li said he hoped through the sale of souvenirs, people's love and support of
"the railway culture in Taiwan will last forever."</P>
      <P>Li further suggested the interested parties hoping to collect the items can
purchase them from the TRA's Taipei, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and Hualien stations
between June 7-9.</P>
      <P>"After June 9 the public can also choose the souvenirs at TRA stations of
Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung, " Li noted, adding that between June 4 and July
17, consumers can also order the souvenirs at the 7-11 convenience stores
nationwide.</P>
      <P>The concept of building railways in Taiwan was first raised in 1887 by Liu Ming-
chuan, a Chinese official during the Qing dynasty who was appointed the first
governor of the newly established province of Taiwan after it was separated from
Fujian province in 1885.</P>
      <P>During Japanese colonial rule, the railway system in Taiwan was further
developed and became the most important system of transport for locals traveling
between the north and the south of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>One million vow to reduce carbon by eating vegetarian diet: group</HEADLINE>

      <P>More than one million people in Taiwan have pledged to help cut carbon emissions
by being a vegetarian, which will reduce at least 1.5 million tonnes of carbon
emissions in Taiwan in one year, a green group said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after some 1.2 million people -- including Legislative
Speaker  Wang  Jin-pyng,  Environmental  Protection Administration Minister Shen
Shu-hung, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu -- signed up to
become vegetarians during an anti-global warming drive organized by the Union of
NoMeatNoHeat between April 22 and June 2.</P>
      <P>The union consisting of more than 50 local groups is aimed at promoting
vegetarianism in Taiwan and urging the government to build a friendly
environment for vegetarians.</P>
      <P>According to Union Spokesman Pan Han-shen, who is also the secretary-general of
the Green Party Taiwan, cows and goats produce large amounts of methane, one of
the six greenhouse gases, during and after digestion.</P>
      <P>Growing animal feed and animal processing and transportation all also contribute
to global warming, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that 20 percent of the world's carbon emissions are created by the
livestock industry, which is higher than the 15 percent to 18 percent produced
by all the transportation vehicles in the world.</P>
      <P>Pan said that if one person eats only vegetables for one day, an estimated 4.1
kilo of carbon emissions can be reduced.</P>
      <P>If one person's vegetable diet persists for the whole year, an estimated 1.5
tonnes of carbon emissions can be cut, Pan noted.</P>
      <P>In other words, the more than one million people who have signed up for the
campaign can help decrease 1.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually, Pan
said.</P>
      <P>Adopting a vegetarian diet will reduce carbon emissions more effectively than
removing one's suit jacket, Pan said, referring to a government effort to
encourage civil servants to wear less clothing as part of its eco-friendly
measures.</P>
      <P>For instance, he added, if people staying in air-conditioned rooms in Taiwan all
take off their suit jackets and turn up the air conditioner's  temperature by
one degree Celsius,  300 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be conserved
in one summer.</P>
      <P>The amount of electricity saved is equivalent to a reduction of 207,000 tonnes
of carbon emission, while one million people's vegetarian diet can cut 375,000
tonnes of carbon emissions in one summer, Pan noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Pan pointed out that all these carbon-reducing efforts can be
easily offset if the government  approves the construction of a controversial
steel plant by Formosa Plastics Group.</P>
      <P>The project is currently under the government's environmental impact assessment,
and if approved, the steel plant will generate up to 15 million tonnes of carbon
emissions, an amount that will take 10 million people who need to eat only
vegetables for one year to offset, Pan warned.</P>
      <P>The government should not urge local citizens to save energy, while allowing big
enterprises to waste energy, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hsiao-hsuan, CEO of the Union's secretariat, suggested that Formosa
Plastics Group should set up 20,000 to 30,000 sites all over Taiwan to provide
vegetarian food at low prices to 10 million people.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Formosa Plastics Group can also offer vegetarian diet courses  to
raise the public's  awareness  about environmental protection.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) made public Tuesday a series of measures
it plans to adopt to save energy and reduce Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions --
one of the top policies of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration, which took
office two weeks ago.</P>
      <P>An energy-saving promotion team has been set up in the ministry to implement the
policy, said officials of the MND Office of the Deputy Chief of the General
Staff for Logistics at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The measures include controlling the amount of time spent on training programs
involving aircraft, ships and combat vehicles.</P>
      <P>Service personnel will also try to use simulators to conduct military drills as
often as possible, to reduce the amount of time spent on live-fire exercises,
which require a greater use of fuel and other resources, the MND said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, aircraft, ships and vehicles also will run on the economic mode
when they are not on duty for a combat mission or mobilized for emergency
operations, defense ministry officials said.</P>
      <P>In terms of electricity and water use, Col. Ku Lai Ren-hsiang, deputy director
of the MND office, said the budget for the ministry's electricity and water
consumption in 2008 will not surpass that in the previous year.</P>
      <P>The measures come as the MND's spending on fuel costs has increased from NT$5
billion (US$165 million) in 2005, to NT$6.4 billion in 2006 and NT$7.9 billion
in 2007. This year, a budget of NT$9.3 billion was listed for fuel costs, the
MND said.</P>
      <P>All fundamental units in the ministry are requested to take every possible
measure to save energy sources, Ku Lai said.</P>
      <P>But he reassured the public that the effort to control fuel consumption will not
affect the country's combat ability, underlining that the military will not
compromise training quality and combat capability.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming has approved a controversial acquisition deal
between cash-strapped Sino Swearingen Aircraft Corp. (SSAC), a Taiwan-U.S. joint
venture, and a Middle East company, according to a ministry statement released
Monday.</P>
      <P>The deal between Texas-based SSAC, which manufactures primarily small business
jets, and Emirates Investment and Development Co. (EIDC), a venture capital
company in the United Arab Emirates, will take effect in mid-June, the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS) gave its approval May 14 to the deal.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the acquisition, EIDC is allowed to control 80 percent of
SSAC's total stakes with a relatively small investment of US$150 million.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwanese  companies  serve as airplane  component manufacturers  for
the company,  Taiwan's  state-run  Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC)
will hold negotiations with EIDC later this week, according to reports carried
in local newspapers.</P>
      <P>The merger sparked fierce controversy before the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) transferred the reins of the government to the Kuomintang (KMT) May 20,
with KMT lawmakers lashing out at the DPP government, accusing it of mismanaging
SSAC and planning to sell it at a low price. Prosecutors are investigating the
alleged mismanagement.</P>
      <P>Noting that the merger has been approved by the U.S. government, the ministry
explained that if it had not given its consent, previous government investment
in SSAC would have been in vain.</P>
      <P>In addition, it would have violated a contract signed by the previous DPP
government and EIDC, and would have faced a compensation lawsuit, the ministry
said.</P>
      <P>KMT  lawmakers  urged  the  ministry  Tuesday  to continue investigating the
previous administration's responsibility for any suspected illegal practices
that could have resulted in SSAC's huge deficit.</P>
      <P>Former Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen said before leaving his post that his
ministry had handled the matter in an "open and transparent" manner over the
past two years and had kept the legislature informed about the progress of the
deal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker accused the Cabinet Tuesday of misleading the country's
citizens with its claim that fuel prices in Taiwan are the lowest among
neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>When making that comparison, the Cabinet always ignores the fact that
neighboring countries, including Japan and South Korea, have added fuel
surcharges and taxes such as license tax to fuel prices, while these payments
are charged separately in Taiwan, according to Yeh Yi-jin, a whip of the
Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>If fuel surcharges and license tax are taken into account, gasoline prices in
Taiwan will range between NT$52.4 to NT$57.01 per liter according to the engine
capacity of the motor vehicles, making fuel prices in Taiwan the highest among
neighboring countries, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>In early May, gasoline was being sold at NT$46.93 per liter in Singapore,
NT$47.65 per liter in Japan and NT$51.72 per liter in South Korea, according to
the latest data compiled by the state-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the Taiwan's consumer price index already climbing by 3.65 percent for the
first four months of this year, public resentment was high last week when the
Kuomintang administration increased the price of fuel supplied by CPC Corp.</P>
      <P>The price of 92-unleaded gasoline is now NT$33.9 per liter --an increase of
NT$3.9 per liter -- and the prices of 95-unleaded and 98-unleaded have also
risen by the same amount to NT$34.6 per liter and NT$36.1 per liter,
respectively, while premium diesel has gone up by NT$4.4 to NT$31.9 per liter.</P>
      <P>Despite public complaints about the increase, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
has insisted that fuel prices in Taiwan remain the lowest among neighboring
Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Responding to Legislator Yeh's accusation, CPC Corp. said Tuesday it can be
misleading to compare after-tax fuel prices, because different surcharges or
taxes are added by different countries to their fuel prices.</P>
      <P>A more accurate picture can be obtained if the pre-tax prices are used as the
basis of comparison, the company said.</P>
      <P>With crude oil costing US$120 per barrel and the exchange rate registering
NT$30.3 against US$1, the price of 92-unleaded gasoline is NT$23.83 per liter,
which is still lower than South Korea's NT$27.25 per liter, Japan's NT$25.9 per
liter and Singapore's NT$32.57 per liter, the company said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwans manufacturers recorded a 13.48 percent year-on-year gain in shipment
value in the first quarter, with oil refinery and coal production businesses
representing the biggest rise, together growing 44.05 percent compared to the
first quarter last year.</P>
      <P>Shipment values for the domestic and overseas markets saw an annualized 12.62
percent and 14.4 percent increase, respectively, in first quarter, which helped
the total shipment value jump to NT$3.1459 trillion (US$103.4 billion), the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a press release Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Next to the oil refinery and coal production industries, the industry which saw
the biggest growth rate in shipment value was the chemical material industry,
whose shipment value rose 28.89 percent year-on-year, according to the press
release.</P>
      <P>Taiwans world-leading high-tech industries also finished the first quarter with
flying colors, as they sold a total of NT$850.2 billion worth of electronic
components and parts in the first quarter, which amounted to an annualized 15
percent hike in shipment value.</P>
      <P>The ministry said such a performance can be attributed to the strong global
demand for electronic products, citing integrated device manufacturer and LCD
television makers as the major exporters that helped boost the local businesses
of display panels and motherboards.</P>
      <P>However, the MOEA said that the shipment value of computers and optical products
in the first quarter declined by 1.24 percent to NT$189.1 billion.</P>
      <P>CD sales were undercut by the growing popularity of USB storages, while a
portion of computer-making factories were moved overseas,explained the ministry,
adding that such a decline WAS offset BY? the growing shipment value of hand
phones and global positioning systems (GPS) in the same quarter.</P>
      <P>The domestic shipment value reached a total of NT$1.615 trillion in the first
quarter, representing 51.34 percent of the total sales income, said the
ministry, adding that the beverage, food and tobacco industries were the
businesses that focused most of their shipments on the local market, with 90
percent of their products being sold around the island.</P>
      <P>Overseas shipment value, the press release said, comprised 48.66 percent of the
total value of manufacturers shipments, reaching NT$1.5309 trillion.</P>
      <P>The industries that exported the largest proportion of their overall shipment
OVERSEAS? were computer, electronic and optical products, which recorded 84.61
percent of their overall shipment values from exports.</P>

      <P>The Global Human Rights Torch Relay, aimed at highlighting China's poor human
rights record ahead of the August Beijing Olympic Games, is on a 15-day stop in
Taiwan and will pass through 23 cities and counties around the island until June
15, an event organizer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The relay,  launched by the Coalition to Investigate  the Persecution of Falun
Gong (CIPFG) on August 8, 2007 in Athens, Greece, has been traveling throughout
more than 100 cities in 34 countries around the world, according to opposition
Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lai Ching-te, who is president of the
CIPFG Asian branch.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the torch relay is to spur the international community to condemn
China's abuse of human rights and to underscore the fact that China is not
qualified to host the Olympics because of its sordid human rights record and its
violation of freedom and democracy, Lai said Sunday at a rally to mark the
arrival of the torch relay in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>Eyeing enormous economic benefits in China, lots of countries agreed to grant
China the right to host the Olympics on condition that China improves its human
rights record, Lai said. But in fact, China has a long way to go to live up its
promises, he added, lamenting that many countries, as well as the United
Nations, have either turned a blind eye to or reminded silent on the matter.</P>
      <P>"The spirit of the Olympics is based on democracy, freedom and human rights, "
Lai noted. "Given China's failure to get in line with that spirit, it is not
qualified to host the Olympics."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Ching-hsi, chairman of Falun Dafa in Taiwan said that China not
only failed to honor its promises to set its human rights record straight, its
performance on human rights is getting even worse under the pretext of
maintaining social order in the run up to the Olympics.</P>
      <P>"Many countries and enterprises, in view of the vast market opportunities in
China, chose to tolerate the violations of human rights by the Chinese
government," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"In their eyes, it seems human rights is nothing, compared to benefits. This is
wrong. We hope the torch can rekindle China's conscience," Chang added.</P>

      <P>Despite China's show of goodwill toward Taiwan's participation in international
organizations, a group of pro-independence  advocates  expressed pessimism
Tuesday on the government's intention to apply for membership of the World
Health Organization (WHO) under the name Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>At the end of May, Chinese President Hu Jintao told Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung that the issue of Taiwan's participation in the WHO can
be a priority for future bilateral discussions.</P>
      <P>As President Ma Ying-jeou has said that the name Chinese Taipei might be the
best name under which Taiwan can apply for WHO membership, it is generally
believed that the government will file the application in 2009 under that name
rather than under the name Taiwan or a variant thereof, which has been rejected
every year since 1997.</P>
      <P>However, some representatives of the pro-independence Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan expressed reservations about the president's
choice.</P>
      <P>"China's goodwill is an old play for me, " said Lin Shih- chia, executive
director of the foundation, noting that in 2005, China also released a similar
message to then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan, but a few months later signed a
memorandum of understanding with the WHO Secretariat that further hindered
Taiwan's participation in the organization.</P>
      <P>She said that according to a foundation survey, 80 percent of Taiwanese polled
said they would prefer to file the application under the name Taiwan, and added
that Ma's supporters do not necessarily agree with all his views.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which insists that Taiwan is the best name to use on the
applications, has for the last 12 years failed to achieve any success in its
efforts to gain Taiwan's participation in the WHO under the name Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu Yung-tung,  a former president  of the Taiwan  Medical Association, said the
government should be careful about the name issue, as it concerns the country's
dignity.</P>
      <P>Admitting that it might be possible for Taiwan to join the WHO under the name
Chinese Taipei, Wu said the government should think about the consequences,
adding that he is concerned about a domino effect that could see the name
Chinese  Taipei used for all international activities.</P>
      <P>He added that more public opinion should be sought before the government makes a
decision.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on all sectors of society Tuesday to work together
to help combat the drug-related problems in the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at this year's national anti-narcotics meeting organized by the
Executive Yuan in Taipei City, Ma said that fighting the drug problem is an
arduous task that requires the continuous efforts of individuals, families,
schools, the private sector and the government in order to obtain results.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been on the list of drug trafficking and producing countries in
the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report released by U.S. Department
of State for the last eight years, which is the result of efforts made in the
past, Ma said.</P>
      <P>However, he said more efforts have to be made by more people to help curb the
drug problem, a task that has become much tougher for the government, given the
increase in the number of with drug trafficking channels and the more complex
patterns of trafficking.</P>
      <P>The increase in the different types of narcotics and the drop in the age of drug
addicts in recent years are also cause for worry, Ma said at the meeting, which
was attended by over 200 people, including government officials and experts in
the fields of law, medicine, education, and social work.</P>
      <P>The use of drugs jeopardizes people's health, causes crime and spreads AIDS as
drug addicts tend to share needles, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the first national narcotics meeting was held in Taiwan in 1994,
one year after the central government announced its resolution to combat drugs
in the hope of attracting professional assistance. Ma was serving as Minister of
Justice in the Kuomintang government at the time.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) urged the public Tuesday to consume more
locally produced mangoes as this is the peak harvest time of the sweet and juicy
fruit.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-teh, director-general of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency, noted
that Taiwan mango, at its relatively cheap price and with its beautiful color
and fragrant smell, is competitive internationally.</P>
      <P>Amid recent reports  that Japanese  mangoes  from Miyazaki prefecture on the
eastern coast of the island of Kyushu were selling on the local market at nearly
NT$6,000 (around US$200) for two, Chen reminded Taiwan residents of how lucky
they are to have tasty local mangoes.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan, located in a subtropical area, is very well suited to grow
mangoes. The area of mango plantation has reached 18,000 hectares, mainly in
Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, with an annual production of 215,000
metric tons.</P>
      <P>Among the different varieties of mangoes in Taiwan, the Iven mango with its
apple-red color is the most popular and accounts for 40 percent of the country's
total mango plantation. Other local varieties include the Chin Huang and
indigenous mangoes.</P>
      <P>The COA has made the Iven mango one of its flagship agricultural exports since
2004, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He said that exports of Taiwan mangoes over the past three years have increased
dramatically,  extending  from Asia to America, Australia and Europe.</P>
      <P>The main countries to which the fruit is exported include China, Hong Kong,
Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei, South Korea, Canada, Chile, New
Zealand, Australia and Spain.</P>
      <P>Customs statistics showed that mango exports totalled 915 metric tons in 2005,
2,703 tons in 2006 and 4,838 tons in 2007 -- a 428.7 percent increase compared
with 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that in July 2007, Yahoo Japan invited the public to vote online for
their favorite mangoes imported from Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand, and
Japan's Miyazake and Okinawa prefectures.</P>
      <P>The result showed that Taiwan mangoes  were the favorite, receiving 42,292
votes, or nearly 76 percent of the 56,305 votes, because of their quality and
price, Chen recalled. They were rated far ahead of mangoes from the Philippines
(12 percent) , Miyazaki (7 percent) and Okinawa (5 percent), he said.</P>
      <P>The COA said that mango exports to Japan increased from 481 metric tons in 2005
to 787 metric tons in 2007. The export value of the crop also increased to
NT$131.3 million, compared with 78.4 million in 2005, according to the COA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It has been two weeks since a 73-year-old farmer surnamed Chen began to station
herself in her millet fields in a village in Taitung County, southeastern
Taiwan, to safeguard her crops from marauding sparrows.</P>
      <P>It is now harvest season for millet in the county's Taimati township -- one of
Taiwan's key granaries. In Chen's fields, golden millet spikes shine under the
sun, luring hungry birds.</P>
      <P>Watching the crops her family shed sweat to cultivate, Chen said "now is the
real hard work" to safeguard the fields from the hordes of sparrows after her
precious seeds.</P>
      <P>"The army will sweep through as soon as I lose focus, " said the old lady
sitting on a stool, holding an umbrella and a bell to scare the birds away.</P>
      <P>Chen has erected in her fields as many and various bird-scaring devices as she
can, including scarecrows and a network of "alarm strings" hung with used
election banners, empty cans and bottles, even a national flag.</P>
      <P>Upon spotting possible attackers, she pulls the strings, saying that "one minute
too slow and all our painstaking efforts are wasted."</P>
      <P>Chen stays in the fields from before dawn, until after the sun sets.</P>
      <P>There are still two more days before the harvest, she went on, adding that until
then, she cannot leave her post.</P>
      <P>Millet is used mostly by indigenous people to make wine.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will enhance its actions to find absconded or
illegal foreign laborers to protect social order and the work rights of
Taiwanese, according to a statement released by the council Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CLA has asked local governments to enhance inspections of popular workplaces
for illegal laborers such as restaurants, and a reporting system will be
established among hospitals in order to better control the whereabouts of
missing and illegal foreign laborers, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that the council has made lowering the absconding rate
among foreign workers from 3.15 percent to 3 percent as one of this year's
policy objectives. It will also investigate 900 cases of illegal hiring and 80
of illegal agency operations.</P>
      <P>The COA warned foreign laborers not to work illegally in Taiwan and said they
should file complaints of unreasonable treatment by employers or agents with the
local authorities or the CLA rather than simply disappearing, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>Employers and agencies caught hiring or introducing illegal laborers will
receive serious penalties, the statement went on.</P>
      <P>The CLA called on foreign labors who have been listed as missing persons to
contact the council or the National Immigration Agency as soon as possible, in
order to protect themselves from being exploited and from accidents stemming
from illegal working.</P>
      <P>The statement also listed toll-free phone lines through which foreign laborers
can seek help, including an English language service at 0800-885-885, one in
Thai at 0800-885-995, one in Indonesian at 0800-885-958 and one in Vietnamese at

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) should change track in handling
local government heads' applications to visit China, Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc.
Chairwoman Joanna Lei said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lei, a former legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), made the remarks after
the MAC rejected Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng's application for permission to
attend a fundraising event in Beijing for victims  of the devastating
earthquake  that struck  the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan May 12.</P>
      <P>Lee was originally scheduled to have departed for Beijing that day to attend
Thursday's fundraiser, during which he was to have presented 10 million Chinese
yuan (NT$43 million) donated by Kinmen residents for Sichuan earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee's planned move could be seen as a meaningful humanitarian
exchange across the Taiwan Strait, Lei said she was disappointed by the MAC's
decision.</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT, which has consistently adopted a more friendly approach toward
China, has taken the reins of government from the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, Lei said the MAC should change its way of thinking
accordingly  and deal with cross-strait affairs with a more broad-minded vision
and perspective.</P>
      <P>Lei was part of a Kinmen delegation headed by Kinmen County Council Speaker
Hsieh Yi-chang, that traveled to Xiamen in China's Fujian Province Tuesday
afternoon via the direct "mini-three links" shipping services.  The delegation,
composed of more than 10 representatives from various Kinmen social quarters,
will then go to Beijing to attend the quake relief fundraiser.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, KMT Legislator Alex Fai also questioned MAC Chairwoman La
Shin-yuan during a legislative session over the propriety of rejecting Lee's
Beijing travel plan.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said the key reason behind the MAC's decision was the
complexity of Lee's Beijing itinerary. Besides attending the fund raiser, Lee
also planned to discuss a Kinmen county government plan to procure water from
China as well as making visits to major Chinese agencies in charge of Taiwan
affairs.</P>
      <P>Under existing laws, local government heads' China travel plans require prior
approval from the MAC. Lai said she agreed with Fai's view that the regulation
should be reviewed in line with the KMT administration's policy of pushing
cross-strait reconciliation and cooperation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an abrupt policy about-face, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) agreed late
Tuesday to Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng's plan to attend an earthquake relief
fundraiser in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had been informed of the MAC's approval of his travel plans and that
he would travel to Xiamen in China's Fujian Province the following morning via
the direct "mini three links" shipping services and would then fly to Beijing to
attend the Beijing fundraiser scheduled for Thursday evening.</P>
      <P>During the event, Lee will present 10 million Chinese yuan (NT$43 million)
donated by Kinmen residents for victims of a devastating earthquake that struck
the southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan May 12. More than 69,000 people
were killed in the magnitude-8 temblor, according to Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Lee, who had originally planned many activities during his China visit, said he
will confine his itinerary to just the fundraiser out of his respect for the
MAC's position.</P>
      <P>Under current law, local government chiefs are required to obtain the MAC's

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a man should beware
of in the three stages of his life. In youth, when the constitution of his body
is not yet formed, he should beware of lust. In manhood, when his physical
powers are in full vigor, he should beware of strife. In old age, when the
physical powers are in decay, he should beware of greed."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday the open attitude with which Beijing has
reacted to the May 12 earthquake in Sichuan province shows that the 30-year-long
policy of reform and opening-up in China is bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>Compared with the way China dealt with the aftermath of the 1976 Tangshan
earthquake, Chinese authorities have displayed a high-level of efficiency and
have been more ready to accept assistance from Taiwan and other countries
following this latest earthquake that has killed more than 69,000 people and
left 4.8 million others homeless, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the statement through the Presidential Office's official Web site to
mark the 19th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in which hundreds of
pro-democracy demonstrators were believed  killed in a military  crackdown
ordered by Beijing authorities on June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that every year on June 4 since the crackdown, he has taken part in
activities held to mark the incident or written an article to remember it.</P>
      <P>"My concern about the June 4 incident mainly focuses on whether the compatriots
on the mainland can enjoy a free and democratic lifestyle," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president  asserted that the true meaning of Taiwan's attention to the June
4 incident was expressed in his May 20 inaugural address.</P>
      <P>"We care about the welfare of the 1.3 billion people of mainland China, and hope
that mainland China will continue to move toward freedom, democracy and
prosperity for all the people. This would pave the way for the long-term
peaceful development of cross-strait relations," Ma said in his address at the
time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized President Ma Ying-
jeou Wednesday as stepping back from his commitment for democracy for failing to
mention China's latest crackdown in Tibet in his statement  marking the 19th
anniversary of the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP, Ma's statement fully demonstrates that the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) is a party that lacks a philosophy and is incapable of
upholding the values of democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued earlier in the day through the Presidential Office's
official Web site, Ma said his concern about the June 4 incident mainly focuses
on whether the people on the Chinese mainland can enjoy a free and democratic
lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Ma said the open attitude with which Beijing has reacted to the May 12
earthquake in Sichuan province shows that the 30-year-long policy of reform and
opening-up in China is bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-wei, director of the DPP's Department of International Affairs,
expressed disappointment at Ma's statement, which he said lacked any
constructive crititism or demands of China.</P>
      <P>Instead of discussing the Sichuan earthquake that is totally unrelated to the
June 4 incident, in which hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators were believed
killed in a military crackdown ordered by Beijing authorities, Ma should have
denounced Beijing for the way it dealt with the Tibet issue, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"China's crackdown on Tibetan protesters in March was a miniature equivalent of
the June 4 incident," Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Ma has abandoned his past critical stance toward China's
notorious human rights record and its handling of the Tibet issue because he
needs China's help to realize many of his campaign promises.</P>
      <P>"How is President Ma going to protect Taiwan's democracy and freedom when he
dares not even mention these problems? " Lin questioned.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with Ma's view that China has become more open than 30 years ago,
Lin noted that Chinese authorities prohibited the media from entering areas
affected by the Sichuan earthquake until the ruins were cleared away.</P>
      <P>Also, there were very few news reports about the 87,000 organized riots taking
place around China last year, a situation indicating press freedom remains
suppressed in the country, Lin argued.</P>

      <P>The government's debt is expected to reach NT$3.8 trillion (US$125.3 billion) by
the end of this year, Shih Su-mei, head of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the figure marks an increase of NT$1.4 trillion over the amount
in 2000 when the Democratic Progressive Party administration took power.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS head made the remarks during a hearing at the Legislative Yuan's
Finance Committee when asked to give a clear account of the government's
financial situation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lo Shu-lei said that the
government's total debt has increased continuously over the past eight years to
reach NT$4.6 trillion.</P>
      <P>She said that the amount translates to a public debt of NT$200,000 per Taiwanese
citizen.</P>
      <P>If the government's  "hidden debt, " namely its financial obligations in terms
of labor insurance, farmer's insurance, the pension system, privatization fund
and financial reconstruction fund, to name a few, is added, then the actual
government debt stands at about NT$13 trillion, the lawmaker said.</P>
      <P>Shih said that according to the Public Debt Law, the government debt stood at
about NT$2.4 trillion in 2000, increasing by more than NT$1.4 trillion over the
past eight years.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that if the debt of local governments, including those of
townships and villages, is added to the mix, then the overall government debt
amounts to about NT$4.4 trillion.</P>
      <P>She concurred with Lo, however, that if the government's other financial
obligations, including those related to the financial reconstruction fund and
guaranteed loans for the high-speed railway's construction, were considered, the
government's actual debt would add up to between NT$12 trillion and NT$13
trillion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TB unlikely to make inroads into Presidential Office: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of tuberculosis making inroads into the Presidential Office is
minimal, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, denied
a report in "Next, " a local weekly magazine, which speculated that the
Presidential Office could become a hotbed for the disease.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Presidential Office was informed May 21 that a
truck driver employed by the office was confirmed to have been infected with
open TB.</P>
      <P>But despite the warning,  President Ma Ying-jeou and Vice President Vincent Siew
reportedly shook hands with the driver during their rounds of the Presidential
Office May 26 to greet the staff.</P>
      <P>Chou said the DOH has adopted the highest level of disease prevention and
quarantine due to the importance of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the family members of the truck driver, 74 staff that have had
contact with the driver have been tested, " he said, adding that the results
have all been negative.</P>
      <P>Chou said the driver reported to work at the Presidential Office in April. He
went to see doctors four times because of persistent coughing, and was tested
positive for TB when his phlegm was examined the fifth time.</P>
      <P>But unless individuals had close contact with the TB patient in a poorly
ventilated enclosed space, Chou said they were unlikely to be infected with the
disease.</P>
      <P>Because the driver had not worked at the Presidential Office for long, and was
basically working outside of the office, the DOH believes the likelihood of
ranking officials and staff being infected with TB to be minimal.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said that the report of TB making
inroads into the Presidential Office does not "conform to the truth."</P>
      <P>Wang dismissed the reports that the Presidential Office was informed of the
matter May 21, saying it actually was not aware of the diagnosis until May 26,
when it immediately disinfected the building.</P>
      <P>When President Ma made his rounds at the Presidential Office May 26, the driver
had already taken sick leave and had no contact with the president, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The driver also had had no contact with any other ranking official, the
spokesman said, adding that the health department has warned that only staying
in a closed space for more than eight hours a day with a TB patient would put an
individual at risk.</P>

      <P>A nearly 80-member delegation representing over 30 travel agencies from China is
slated to visit Taiwan late this month to prepare for an increased flow of
Chinese tourists to Taiwan in July, Transportation and Communications Minister
Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan expected to open its market wider to Chinese tourists beginning on
July 4, Chinese tourism operators need to gain an understanding of Taiwan's
market and make the necessary preparations and arrangements, Mao said.</P>
      <P>The group will be able to visit Taiwan thanks to the mediation between the
Taiwan Strait Tourism and Travel Association and China's Cross-Strait Tourism
Association.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is only providing a
platform for travel agents from the two sides to hold dialogue in Taiwan while
they are on an islandwide market inspection tour here, " Mao stressed, speaking
at the launch of a five-star tourism train, the "Formosa Express, " by the
Taiwan Railway Administration.</P>
      <P>Mao expressed the hope that Chinese tourism operators could set up links with
their Taiwanese counterparts, including those at city and county levels, during
their coming visit.</P>
      <P>Asked about the group's itinerary in Taiwan, Mao said the opinions of its

      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Seh-Jen Lai said the itinerary cannot be
made public until after both the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation  and
its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou signed a letter of intent with Minister of
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming at a software park in Kaohsiung Wednesday, his
first step in a high-profile plan to invest in the largest city in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At the signing ceremony, which was witnessed by Vice President Vincent Siew and
Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, Gou said the investment in the Kaohsiung Software Park
represents his determination to help President Ma Ying-jeou carry out his
promise to boost investment in the port city.</P>
      <P>City residents have long complained that the central government ignores the
city's economic development, resulting in a north-south divide in the country.</P>
      <P>Gou said the Hon Hai group -- the world's largest contract maker of electronics
-- will base its Kaohsiung investment at the software park and that the project
will center on the cultivation and upgrading in terms of innovation, research,
development and design.</P>
      <P>In the early stage of the project, Gou said, 3,000 jobs for software engineers
are planned for within the next five years, with 520 software engineers to be
hired before May 20 next year -- the planned deadline for the first stage of the
project, he added.</P>
      <P>In an address at the ceremony, Siew reiterated that seeking economic development
and prosperity in the Kaohsiung area is one of the 12 major "Love Taiwan"
construction projects proposed by Ma during his campaign for the presidency.</P>
      <P>"We both care whether or not the Kaohsiung Software Park will work
successfully," Siew said, noting that Hon Hai's investment will help develop the
software park into a regional facility centering on development and research of
innovative technologies.</P>
      <P>He said that in the near future, the software parks in both Kaohsiung and
Taipei's Nangang district will become two core bases for Taiwan's development
in the digital content and software technology industry.</P>
      <P>With the facilities, long-awaited balance between the southern and northern
regions will also be achieved, Siew added.</P>

      <P>Hualien City in eastern Taiwan and Japan's Yonaguni Island are set to launch
charter flights in July to mark the 26th anniversary of the establishment of
sisterhood ties between the two places.</P>
      <P>Hualien Mayor Tsai Chi-ta said Wednesday that if regular charter flight services
can be developed, it will be of great benefit to the tourism industries of both
Hualien and Yonaguni Island, noting that a flight between the two sides only
takes about 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>Yonaguni is Japan's westernmost island and has a population of about 1,700
people. It is part of Okinawa Prefecture and lies about 110 kilometers from
Taiwan's northern coast.</P>
      <P>It is best known for its popularity among divers, with the main attraction a
recently discovered massive sunken rock and stone formation that surrounds the
island.</P>
      <P>Noting that Okinawa Prefecture receives some 5 million Japanese tourists a year,
Tsai said that if regular passenger ferry services were also set up between
Yonaguni and Hualien, it would create a strong sea-air transportation network
that would solidy efforts to advance the development of tourism in the two
locations.</P>
      <P>The first flight on the route in July will be a TransAsia ATR 72 jet. Tzou Mei-
na, director TransAsia's Hualien office, said that the plane can carry 72
passengers and that operating costs are lower because it uses less fuel, making
it the perfect plane to operate on the Hualien-Yonaguni route.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign minister has renounced U.S. green card: GIO</HEADLINE>

06/04/08  17:16:11

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) confirmed Wednesday that Minister of
Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou obtained U.S. permanent resident status in
2005 but renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position
May 20.</P>
      <P>The GIO was responding to an article published in the latest issue of Next
magazine, a local weekly tabloid, in which Ou was said to have obtained a U.S.
green card three years ago when he was the Republic of China's ambassador to
Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Although there is no law forbidding diplomats from holding permanent resident
status of a foreign country, such status might "call their allegiance into
question," the article claimed.</P>
      <P>According to GIO Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, the 68-year-old Ou originally
was planning to move to the United States with his wife after retiring from
public service and he happened to win a green card lottery in 2005.</P>
      <P>However, as Ou did not retire immediately after being awarded his green card, he
and his wife applied to the U.S. government to postpone the date for two years,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>In April, Ou was offered the position of minister of foreign affairs by then-
Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan, and he and his wife officially renounced
their U.S. permanent resident status at the U.S. embassy in Guatemala April 16,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said that before assuming office May 20, all Cabinet members were required
to fill in a form indicating if they held any foreign citizenship, all of whom
answered in the negative.</P>
      <P>Shih said the form is legally binding and that if any Cabinet members are found
to have lied, they will face legal action.</P>
      <P>Unconvinced  by the GIO's explanation,  lawmakers from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) demanded that Ou apologize to the public and step down
from the position.</P>
      <P>Pan Men-an, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, claimed that Ou is unfit for
the position of minister of foreign affairs because the fact that he obtained a
green card while still in public service shows that he was "preparing to flee
the country."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Wang Sing-nan demanded that President Ma Ying-jeou,
who admitted to having obtained U.S. permanent resident status in the 1970s but
noted that he lost the status more than 20 years ago, should follow Ou's model
and formally renounce his former U.S. permanent resident status at the American
Institute in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has used a U.S. visa instead of a green card to enter the United
States since the mid-1980s, a move he said is equal to renouncing his permanent
resident status.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min said Wednesday that goodwill gestures
by China do not mean lasting peace across the Taiwan Strait and that Taiwan's
defense buildup will have to continue as scheduled.</P>
      <P>"Defense buildup is still necessary, because it is the basic (action we must
take) to brace for possible wars," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a legislative committee meeting when opposition
Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang expressed concern that
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's recent comments after returning
from a landmark visit to China could undermine the morale of Taiwan's military.</P>
      <P>Tsai was referring to Wu, who after returning from his historic meeting with
Communist Party of China General Secretary and Chinese President Hu Jintao on
May 28, told President Ma Ying-jeou last Saturday that he "felt" that China,
greatly appreciated Taiwan's outpouring of sympathy and donations for victims of
the Sichuan earthquake in southwestern China, and was unlikely to launch
missiles at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai asked Chen to condemn Wu for his comments, saying such remarks would lead
Taiwan's military and civilians to let down their guard.</P>
      <P>But Chen argued that Taiwan is a pluralistic society, and refused to comment on
Wu's remarks, saying only that the military will maintain strictly neutral.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if Beijing agrees not to launch missiles, the military would see
that as a goodwill gesture, and would welcome it, but would not take it to mean
lasting peace.</P>
      <P>Asked by KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi how Taiwan will respond if Beijing withdrew
its hundreds of missiles deployed on its coastal provinces aimed at Taiwan, Chen
said that if China indeed withdrew the missiles, then "the ministry will make
adjustments on military procurement and research and development based on the
actual situation."</P>
      <P>China has been stepping up the number of its missiles targeted at Taiwan over
the years and has threatened to use force against the self-ruled island, which
split from the mainland after a civil war ended in 1949, if it declares formal
independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP lawmakers urge government to stand firm in cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/08  18:25:56
(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than a dozen opposition legislators on Wednesday urged the Kuomintang (KMT)
government not to do anything that would jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty as the
ruling party negotiates with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers made the appeals in a breakfast
gathering with Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
Taiwan's top policy coordinating body on affairs related to China; and Kao
Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary general of the Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , the quasi-official agency which handles negotiations with its
mainland counterpart.</P>
      <P>The cautionary words from the 16 out of the legislature's 27 DPP legislators
came amid increasing interaction across the Taiwan Strait since the new KMT-led
government came into office on May 20.</P>
      <P>A summit between the KMT and the Communist Party of China was held late last
month, the first talks between Taiwan and mainland China in 10 years are
scheduled to kick off in Beijing on June 11; and direct weekend flights are
expected to be launched in July.</P>
      <P>Insisting the government should maintain firmly the sovereignty of Taiwan during
negotiations with mainland China, the DPP whip Ker Chien-ming said he hoped the
talks between the SEF and it Chinese counterpart Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) should exclude the "1992 Consensus."</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the 1992 Consensus insisted by China is based "on one China--
the People's Republic of China," while the definition of the KMT and the current
government says that it allows both sides to agree that there is only one China,
but leaves open the interpretation of the term "one China."</P>
      <P>The agreement is used by Beijing as the basis for allowing cross-strait talks to
resume after a decade-long stalemate.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers further suggested that in the June talks, the issue of direct
cargo flights across the Taiwan Strait should also be included, for it has been
one of the main concerns of Taiwanese business people.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming that direct cargo flights is also on the agenda of talks, Lai,
however, said it might be more difficult to reach an agreement on the issue by
early July, unlike the other two issues -- charter passenger flights on weekends
and the arrival of Chinese tourist. That's because the issue of cargo flights is
less urgent and the soaring cost of fuel has affected the willingness of
airlines that might be involved in such operations.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the summit between KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and general secretary
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Hu Jintao as a meeting not transparent to
the public, the DPP lawmakers also said they worried that the country would
become under the rule of the KMT instead of President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration.</P>
      <P>"There is no reason for the MAC and the SEF to remain within the governmental
structure if the talks across the Taiwan Strait are carried out by the KMT, " a
DPP legislator Lai Ching-te said in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan rejected that claim, noting that talks across the Taiwan Strait
will always be conducted by the SEF, the only agency authorized by the
government, and the ARATS. Lai said that talks between the KMT and the CPC is
just another form of bilateral exchanges that will not dominate the government's
policy.</P>
      <P>"Issues of such bilateral negotiations are also under the monitoring of the
legislature, " Lai Shin-yuan, the country's top planner of mainland affairs,
stressed.</P>
      <P>Kao, who will visit Beijing for the talks in June, further stressed that
negotiations between the SEF and the ARATS "will be based on equality and
dignity to safeguard the interests of Taiwan and all the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>An agreement to resume talks between Taiwan and mainland China was reached on
May 29 after the SEF received a letter from the ARATS, in which ARATS agreed to
restart cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations on the basis of the "1992 Consensus"
and invited the SEF to visit Beijing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, from May 26-31, a delegation of 16 KMT officials, led by Wu, visited
mainland China at the invitation of Hu, who is also China's president.</P>
      <P>The visit was the first by the head of a Taiwanese ruling party to the mainland
and the first meeting between the chairman of a Taiwanese ruling party and the
chairman of the Chinese communist party.</P>

      <P>No incumbent political appointees possess dual citizenship, based on a
declaration of nationality status they filled out before taking office, Central
Personnel Administration Minister Chen Ching-hsiou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, Chen admitted it would be difficult to know whether or not the
officials lied in the declaration unless they are impeached.</P>
      <P>If any of the officials are found to have submitted false information regarding
their citizenship, Chen went on, they will face a punishment that will require
them to forfeit all the salary earned during their term in office.</P>
      <P>Under the Nationality Act, anyone who holds foreign citizenship is prohibited
from serving in the government.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that this is because government officials could have conflict of
interest if they possess dual citizenship, while their loyalty could also be
called into question.</P>
      <P>Chen offered the explanation in an interview with CNA after Foreign Minister
Francisco Ou was reported to have once possessed a U.S. green card during his
service as ambassador to Guatemala before he was sworn in as foreign minister
May 20.</P>
      <P>Although diplomats are not prohibited from holding a U.S. green card, their
loyalty to Taiwan is questionable, according to an article in a local tabloid
magazine.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Wednesday that he will assess the
feasibility of leading Taiwan's delegation to the 2008 Paralympics, which will
be held in Beijing in September, if doing so is beneficial to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China is hopeful that Taiwan could dispatch a delegation to take part in the
event scheduled from Sept. 6-17, shortly after the 2008 Olympics in August, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>But Wang said China has yet to send him an official invitation to participate in
the world's biggest sports event for people with physical disabilities. He said
he will quickly make a decision upon getting an invitation.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks to reporters after attending a ceremony marking the
establishment of an association to promote technological and humanities
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As to whether he will attend the summer Olympic Games in Beijing, Wang said now
is not an appropriate time to pay a visit to China in his capacity as
legislative speaker, although he revealed that he has received an invitation
from the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>"I would visit China only at a time when Taiwan's national dignity is fully
safeguarded and when the Taiwanese people approve of the trip," he said. "By
that time, Taiwan and China might both have a designation acceptable to either
side."</P>
      <P>Taiwan-China  relations  have shown  significant  signs  of improvement after
the Kuomintang (KMT) returned to power on May 20. Relations were at a standstill
during the past eight years due to China's distrust of the pro-independence then
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung visited China late last month and met Communist Party
of China General Secretary and Chinese President Hu Jintao on May 28 in Beijing
-- the first summit between the incumbent leaders of the ruling parties on both
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan split from China in 1949 at the end of a Chinese civil war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not issue landing visas to Chinese tourists: officials</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will not issue landing visas to tourists from China in the first
stage of opening the country to Chinese visitors, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks at a legislative committee meeting amid increasing concern
over talks slated to kick off June 11 in Beijing on direct charter flights and
the arrival of tourists from China.</P>
      <P>The government believes that launching direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights and
allowing Chinese tourists to visit the island -- two main campaign promises of
President Ma Ying-jeou -- will help boost Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Tsai Chin-lung as
to whether the government will consider issuing landing visas to Chinese
tourists upon arrival, Lai said that at the moment, the idea is "inapplicable."</P>
      <P>Attributing the main difficulty to the fact that information on Chinese tourists
is difficult for the Taiwanese government to obtain, Lai, however, promised the
legislators that "the MAC will discuss the matter with relevant government
agencies and will submit a report within a month."</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun further explained that because there is no
agreement on exchanging passenger information between Taiwan and China, issuing
landing visas to Chinese tourists would be a difficult task.</P>
      <P>"In the first stage, we can only require visitors from China to fill in a
personal profile form before entering Taiwan," Liu added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the issue of landing visas, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said the
government should include direct sea links in the Beijing talks, an idea that
was rejected by Lai on the grounds that the issue involves the positioning of
national flags on vessels.</P>
      <P>Fu Tung-chen,  another  MAC vice  chairman,  said  further negotiations on the
flag issue are essential because according to international convention, the flag
of the country a boat plans to enter should be hung at the bow of the boat,
while the flag of the country in which the boat is registered should be flown at
the stern.</P>
      <P>A resumption  of talks between Taiwan's  Straits  Exchange Foundation and its
Chinese counterpart the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait was
settled May 29 on the basis of the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Medical researchers identify 'cancer stem cells' in ovarian tumor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A collaborative research team from Taiwan, China, and the U.S. has identified
"cancer stem cells" and their unique bio-markers in ovarian tumors, which might
be helpful in improving existing cancer treatment, members of the team said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Scientists had previously found cancer stem cells, or cancer initiating cells,
in several kinds of tumors, but this was the first time that such cells were
found in ovarian tumor tissues, members of the team said.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer stem cells were first identified in 2003, while brain cancer stem
cells were found for the first time in 2004. Since then, cancer stem cells have
been identified in the tissues of lung and liver tumors. Scientists have
hypothesized that when normal stem cells are affected by toxic substances or
pathogens, they could develop into cancer initiating cells.</P>
      <P>The team -- composed of researchers from Taiwan's National Chung Cheng
University and Tri-Service General Hospital, China's Shanghai JiaoTong
University, and Indiana University and Ohio State University in the United
States -- cultured live ovarian tumor tissues in vitro to separate the ordinary
cancer cells and cancer stem cells.</P>
      <P>The researchers found two bio-markers, dubbed receptor CD44 and CD117, that are
endemic only to ovarian cancer stem cells. These markers can be utilized to
replace the existing marker, CA125, used in ovarian cancer diagnosis, as the
CA125 has an accuracy of only 50 to 60 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>Their findings have been published in the June 1 issue of the science journal
Cancer Research.</P>
      <P>Lai Hung-cheng, a team member from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
of Tri-Service General Hospital, said that the stem cells of ovarian cancer are
capable of regenerating new cancer cells and have a high resistance to almost
all drugs, which makes them very hard to destroy.</P>
      <P>"In experiments, it was found that even when nearly 100 percent of ordinary
ovarian cancer cells have been terminated, 75 percent of cancer stem cells could
still survive and wait for a chance of revival," Lai said.</P>
      <P>"It takes one million ordinary cancer cells to produce a new tumor, but only one
hundred cancer stem cells to do the same, " Lai explained.</P>
      <P>Michael W. Chan, a team member and a biologist at National Chung Cheng
University, said that conventional anti-cancer therapy treats all cancer cells
in the same way, but added that with the discovery of cancer stem cells,
treatment should be refined to prioritize the destruction of cancer stem cells
before ordinary cancer cells.</P>
      <P>Chan also said that the bio-markers the research team identified will be helpful
not only in the diagnosis, but also in the treatment of ovarian cancers.</P>
      <P>"By targeting these markers, an improved target drug could easily lock on to the
cancer stem cells and destroy them," Chan said.</P>

      <P>The results of a survey on public opinion about the Control Yuan show that 74.3
percent of respondents think the organization should continue to operate
independently, while some 9.8 percent hold the opposite idea, according to a
press statement released by the organization Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statement said the Taipei-based  Shih Hsin University, commissioned by the
Control Yuan, conducted the survey March 25-27 last year through telephone
interviews and received 1,072 valid samples from respondents.</P>
      <P>Citing the survey results, the statement said 83.8 percent of the respondents
think the Control Yuan's operations are "significant."</P>
      <P>They also show that 72.6 percent of the respondents think incorporating the
Control Yuan's power with that of the president is unacceptable, while 13.9
percent think the opposite.</P>
      <P>In addition,  57.7 percent of the respondents said it is inappropriate to give
the power of control to the Legislative Yuan, while some 22.7 percent think such
a move is appropriate.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 41.4 percent of the respondents are aware that they
can report civil servants' irregularities to the Control Yuan, while 58 percent
are unaware of that function of the government branch.</P>
      <P>On a question about whether the respondents would report civil servants'
irregularities to the Control Yuan, 38.8 percent say they would and 51.1 percent
said they would not.</P>
      <P>Among those who said they would not report irregularities, 20.8 percent cited
lack of evidence, followed by 19.9 percent who said they would consider
reporting through other channels. Some 17.2 percent said they do not know how to
file such reports while 15.7 percent said doing so would be time-consuming and
troublesome.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan monitors the behavior and integrity of elected officials and
civil servants, but the organization has been without members since the term of
the previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005, leaving a total 32,034 investigation
cases unresolved.</P>
      <P>The  last  legislature  controlled  by the  then-opposition Kuomintang,
persistently rejected a nomination list proposed by former President Chen Shui-

      <P>The number of cases backlogged at the Control Yuan has, to date, reached 32,034,
as the seats in the watchdog arm of the government have not been filled since
Jan. 31, 2005 when the terms of the previous members expired, officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Control Yuan administrative officials, among the thousands of
cases, more than 1,300 involved civil servants accused of irregularities or
taking bribes when handling big construction projects. There are also
allegations of misbehavior of military personnel and charges of frequent
construction accidents involving state enterprises.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the Legislative Yuan's failure over the last three years
to approve the list of Control Yuan members proposed by former President Chen
Shui-bian has seriously hampered the supervisory function of the watchdog body
and resulted in a violation of human rights, as many of the petitions submitted
by the general public have not been handled.</P>
      <P>The Control  Yuan has been in limbo since 2005 when the legislature, dominated
by the then opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , rejected the list of nominees
submitted by the president, on grounds that the selection process was not fair
and some of the candidates were unsuitable for the job.</P>
      <P>Many people, including scholars and politicians, criticized the Legislative
Yuan's move as a violation of the Constitution and one that could cause a
constitutional crisis. They argued that the legislature is obliged to approve
the Control Yuan nominees, as stipulated in the Constitution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>All eyes on government policy ahead of World Environment Day</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 4 (CNA) On the eve of the World Environment Day, government
agencies and non-governmental organizations focused their attention on anti-
global warming issues, while environmentalists called for a more comprehensive
and cohesive energy policy.</P>
      <P>Since Earth Day on April 22, various government agencies, including the
Environmental Protection Administration, have been engaged in a range of efforts
aimed at saving energy, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and heightening
public awareness of the effects of global warming.</P>
      <P>The effort has been led by President Ma Ying-jeou who was the first Taiwan
leader to mention the issue of global warming in his inaugural address.</P>
      <P>Since taking office May 20, Ma has been encouraging government officials to join
the energy-saving campaign. Some of them have responded by dispensing with
formal work attire in the summer to cut down on the use of air conditioning,
while others have opted to take such actions as choosing low emission vehicles
for official use.</P>
      <P>In the wider society, schools have been pushing to the front lines of the
campaign.</P>
      <P>At a press conference  held by the Ministry of Education Wednesday, the
principals of elementary schools detailed their efforts to introduce
environmental education among their students.</P>
      <P>Children are being taught how to make decorations from straw, to plant herbs and
to make herbal tea, the schools heads said, adding that the students are also
being encouraged to eat at least one vegetarian meal per month.</P>
      <P>In addition, a system has been established to pool and exchange resources among
schools, the principals said. Under this plan, a recently dismantled roof from
an elementary school in central Taiwan will be used by two other schools as
building materials, they said.</P>
      <P>As a principal player in the government's  greener energy campaign, the Bureau
of Energy issued a call Wednesday for all conventional light bulbs to be
replaced with LED lighting or energy saving bulbs, and for air conditioners to
be set a temperature of 27 degrees Celsius. The call was endorsed by the new
Minister of the Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming.</P>
      <P>Not to be outdone, the Taipei city government announced recently that during the
period June to August, holders of the city's multi-purpose Easycard will be
given a 25 percent discount for travel on the city's mass rapid transit system.
The second day after discount went into effect, the Taipei Rapid Transit
Corporation recorded a 2.4 percent increase in the number of passengers taking
the MRT.</P>
      <P>This accounted for 23,000 more passengers compared to a similar time of day last
week.</P>
      <P>In the southern city of Kaohsiung, where the cost of taking the city's new metro
system had already been reduced, the mayor announced Tuesday that in the three
months from June 12, travel on all 82 bus lines in the city will be free every
Thursday.</P>
      <P>While environmentalist have commended the government's efforts, they have
questioned its determination to tackle the root of the problem.</P>
      <P>Critics have claimed that the measures taken so far by the authorities appear to
focus more on changing old habits rather than on a comprehensive policy for
cutting the country's level of carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Liou Ming-lone, chairman of the Environmental Quality Protection Foundation,
sees the government's green initiatives as positive step, but suggested  that it
requires a coordinated  effort by the government, the people and industry to
build a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>"Since 1990, Taiwan's energy consumption has been climbing, but people's incomes
have not increased -- a trend that is contrary to the global shift, " Liou said.
He suggested that the government develop the country's tourism and cultural and
creative industries, rather than high energy consuming enterprises.</P>
      <P>"It is true that everyone should take small actions in daily life, but we demand
more than moral appeals from the administration," said Lee Ken-cheng, secretary-
general of the Mercy on the Earth Alliance.</P>
      <P>Referring to the economic minister's appeal on Wednesday to turn off lights that
are not being used, Lee said that he expected to see the minister introducing
equitable electricity rates that would put the squeeze on those who waste
resources.</P>
      <P>"That's what an economics minister should do," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said he looks forward to hearing President Ma take a clear stance on
reducing carbon emissions and set targets that he intends to achieve during his
term in office.</P>
      <P>Ma is slated to announce his administration's commitment to environmental
protection on Thursday, World Environmental Day, which is being observed this
year under the theme, "Kick the Habit! Toward a Low-Carbon Economy."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two possible candidates tipped to head the Control Yuan declined to comment
Wednesday on reports that they have been asked to head the watchdog branch of
the government.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has reportedly invited former Finance Minister Wang
Chien-shien, dubbed "Saint Wang" because of his integrity, to head the Control
Yuan. Shen Fu-hsiung, an outspoken former Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator has been tapped to serve as Wang's deputy, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is currently in China on a charity and education mission, said that
"no one has solicited my views on the position." He declined to comment further.</P>
      <P>Wang, a co-founder of the pro-unification New Party and a former legislator,
left the political arena in 2001 after he lost the magistrate election in Taipei
County by a narrow margin to Su Tseng-chang of the Democratic Progressive Party.
In recent years, he has been devoting his efforts to charity and education work
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wang, best known for standing up to former President Lee Teng-hui over land
taxes while he was finance minister, said that he had only arrived in China June
1 and had yet to decide when to return to Taiwan, according to media reports.</P>
      <P>For his part, Shen also said that he had no comment on the reports and that any
announcement or confirmation should be made by President Ma or the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that both Wang Chien-shien and Shen have
the integrity and expertise for the job, and that they could be "the most
appropriate" candidates.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung said that Wang Chien-shien, with his squeaky
clean reputation, would be able to fight official corruption, but added that the
job may be too much for the 70-year-old Wang.</P>
      <P>Opposition DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin said that as the KMT controls nearly three
quarters of the 113-member legislature, it is expected that the nominees will be
confirmed without a hitch.</P>
      <P>"Whoever  heads the Control  Yuan will be considered  KMT partisans," Yeh said,
adding that the body will "lack impartiality."</P>
      <P>Another DPP Legislator Pan Meng-an said that the Control Yuan should be an
impartial body, and urged President Ma not to consider "party affiliation" or
"political favors" in naming the nominees.</P>
      <P>Ma will present the list of Control Yuan nominees on June 23 for approval by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The 29 seats in the Control Yuan, which monitors and arbitrates on matters
relating to the conduct of government officials and civil servants, have not
been filled since Jan. 31, 2005, when the terms of the last members expired.</P>
      <P>The last legislature, controlled by the then opposition KMT, persistently
rejected a list of nominees submitted by former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>

      <P>On the eve of World Environment Day, Taiwan's largest environmental organization
announced that it will launch a "Lights Out" event on summer solstice day, June
21, when it will invite businesses and households to turn off their lights for
one hour.</P>
      <P>Initiated by the Society of Wilderness (SOW) in 2005, "Lights Out Day "
coincides with summer solstice and is aimed not only at saving energy, but also
creating an occasion for urbanites to get closer to nature, said the
organization in a statement.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the SOW plans to organize several activities islandwide, such
as outdoor concerts, nocturnal excursions and ecological tours, on June 21 to
help people rediscover nature.</P>
      <P>In the run up to "Lights Out" day, SOW volunteers will visit businesses to try
to persuade them to turn off their lights for one hour, from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. on
June 21. So far, Taipei Arena and Taipei 101 have agreed to join the activity,
the organization said.</P>
      <P>"In view of the activity and the upcoming increase in electricity rates, we hope
to convince more stores to turn off their lights for one hour on 'Lights  Out'
day, " said  Shih Chun-rong,  SOW secretary-general.</P>
      <P>He added that about 19 percent of the electricity consumed by households and
stores is for lighting, noting that half of the stores in the country keep their
signs lit after closing time, which he said is a waste of energy.</P>
      <P>The "Lights Out" activity will be held in tandem with Japan's "Candle night" and
an anti-light pollution movement in Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>There is evidence that the risk of developing oral cancer is 12.5 times higher
among betel nut addicts than among non-users, and 4.9 times higher among among
heavy smokers than non-smokers, said a researcher at the Taipei-based National
Health Institute Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wen Chi-pang said that, after examining more than 1 million health reports
compiled by the privately operated MJ Health Screening Center over the past 13
years, he found that betel nuts cause greater damage to the health than tobacco,</P>
      <P>Wen said that to date there are no effective methods for helping betel nut
addicts to quit, but added that for people who both smoke and chew betel nuts
and want to kick the habits, it would be easier to first quit smoking.</P>
      <P>Wen said the results of his analysis show that 77 percent of those who quit
smoking also managed to stop chewing betel nuts.</P>
      <P>Wen warned that chewing betel nuts can cause many different kinds of cancer,
including oral cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and cancer
of the throat. He suggested that health authorities work out measures to prevent
and control betel nut use while continuing their anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that more than 1.5 million people in Taiwan are addicted to
betel nuts, with some 90 percent of the addicts also being smokers.</P>

on behalf of the residents of Kinmen, and NT$43 million (US$1.42 million) on
behalf of the Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc., which is run by the county
government.</P>
      <P>Lee will first travel to Xiamen in China's Fujian Province via the direct sea
links between Kinmen and Xiaman -- popularly known as the mini links -- and then
fly to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county chief also complained that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
had failed to honor President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promise to immediately
open the mini links to all the country's citizens upon inauguration of the
Kuomintang (KMT) government on May 20.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Hsin-yuan might not be aware of Ma's campaign promise, but
the MAC's three veteran deputy chairmen should be very familiar with the matter
and should make adequate preparations to realize Ma's pledge, he said.</P>
      <P>If the functions and scope of the current mini links are not properly upgraded,
the livelihood of the people and economic development on the Kinmen and Matsu
islands would be adversely affected when full transportation links are set up
between Taiwan proper and China, he warned.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan and China soon to resume semi-official bilateral talks, the Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) should include the mini links issue in
its negotiations with its Chinese counterpart -- the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>The SEF should also consider the economic development of Taiwan's offshore
islands in its negotiations with the ARATS, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking part in the charity activity in Beijing, Lee said, he will
also use the opportunity to explore the Chinese side's viewpoints and to help
boost mutual understanding of matters of concern to both sides.</P>
      <P>Lee gained the MAC permission at the last minute Tuesday for his planned trip to
China. The MAC had turned down his application a day earlier, but the rejection
drew fierce backlash from KMT lawmakers, forcing the MAC to rescind its
decision.</P>
      <P>Under current law, local government chiefs are required to obtain approval from
the MAC before visiting China.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching's application to quit her job at Mega International
Commercial Bank has been approved, a bank spokeswoman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said that the application by Chow, chief of the department of
legal affairs, was approved at a meeting of the bank's board of directors.</P>
      <P>The  directors,  while  recognizing  Chow's  expertise  and professionalism,
agreed to her retirement in view of her wish to serve more people, the
spokeswoman added.</P>
      <P>But the directors also invited Chow to serve as the secretary- general  of a
cultural  and educational  foundation  under  a Mega-affiliated bank, the
spokeswoman disclosed.</P>
      <P>The foundation, which is funded to the tune of NT$200 million (US$6.56 million)
from donations solely by the Mega bank, will in principle  not  solicit  funds
from  the  public,  and  the secretary-general post will be an unpaid position,
according to the spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China said Tuesday that it
will invite Chow to serve as its honorary chairwoman. Chow later issued a
statement saying that although "I'm not yet up to the job, I will do my best to
help needy people."</P>
      <P>Chow, a career woman whose job status has been a popular topic of debate
recently, applied for retirement the day before her husband President Ma Ying-
jeou was inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>The bank had earlier expanded its retirement package to encourage early
retirement among its staff, but Chow chose not apply for the benefits before the
deadline, as she did not want it to appear that the package had been created for
her sake.</P>
      <P>Based on a calculation of her 26 years of service in the bank and a monthly
salary of NT$150,000, it is estimated that Chow will receive a retirement
payment of nearly NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Until her husband was elected president on March 22, Chow had been known for
avoiding the spotlight. The question of whether she should continue to work
arose after Ma's election victory, and Chow said at the time that she hoped to
remain in her job at the bank.</P>
      <P>However, according to Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi, the first lady
applied for retirement because she wants to contribute to the society by
devoting more time to volunteer work and does not want to "create trouble for
the bank."</P>

      <P>Taipei Songshan Airport will complete its preparations for the opening of
weekend direct charter flights between the two sides of Taiwan Strait, which
will allow it to accommodate the arrival of Chinese tourists starting July 4 as
scheduled, an official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-teh, deputy director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA), made the remark while accompanying ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
John Chiang and the media on an inspection tour of renovations to the airport.</P>
      <P>The government has chosen eight airports around the island to provide cross-
strait direct charter flights on weekends, which are slated to come on stream
soon in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's election promises.</P>
      <P>The airports selected to service the flights are Taipei Songshan Airport and
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung Airport in
central Taiwan, Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan, the offshore
Kinmen and Magong airports, and Hualien and Taitung airports in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that except for Songshan Airport, the other seven airports all have
experience in handling charter flights, but added that Songshan Airport is
speeding up its preparations for the charters.  The airport's  infrastructure
upgrades  include the construction of a parking lot in front of the terminal
building to exclusively accommodate 10 to 12 large tour buses.</P>
      <P>Lin said Songshan Airport will complete its preparations on June 25 and will
conduct a dry run on July 2.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Taiwan and China will each provide 18 flights per week in

06/04/08  23:37:54
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) urged the public Wednesday to
stop using or dispensing disposable chopsticks, in order to support the EPA's
efforts to reduce the volume of disposable eating utensils.</P>
      <P>According  to EPA  Minister  Stephen  Shu-hung  Shen,  the administration is
suggesting that individuals take their own reusable chopsticks when eating out,
and that workers, who constitute a major consumer group at convenience stores,
take non-disposable chopsticks to their workplaces.</P>
      <P>Shen said the Taiwan public uses 5 billion disposable chopsticks per year, with
the largest number dispensed at convenience stores.</P>
      <P>In its bid to reduce the volume of disposable utensils, the EPA plans to meet
with convenience store operators in June to discuss the possibility of
discontinuing the practice of providing customers with disposable eating
utensils, Shen said.</P>
      <P>He added  that the administration  will also discuss  any difficulties the
convenience stores might have in implementing the practice and will ask them to
place signs in front of the stores informing customers of the new policy.</P>
      <P>In a survey conducted from March to May this year,  the Kaohsiung-based
Conservation  Mothers  Foundation,  which  is commissioned by the EPA, found
that of the 690 restaurants around the country that it looked at, 331 provided
reusable utensils.</P>
      <P>The survey did not include restaurants in Changhua County in central Taiwan and
the offshore Lienchiang County. It also excluded restaurants  known to provide
only disposable eating utensils. according to the foundation's chairwoman Julia
Chou.</P>
      <P>Based on the survey, only 10-20 percent of restaurants in Taiwan do not use
disposable utensils, Chou estimated, adding that if a restaurant provides 100
pairs of disposable chopsticks per day to its customers, it will generate 12
kilos of trash.</P>
      <P>Chou also called on firms that give "environmentally friendly chopsticks" as
gifts to their employees to quit the practice, saying that it is only a waste
resources when those chopsticks are not used.</P>
      <P>The foundation has listed on its Web site restaurants that do not use disposable
utensils, for the reference of the public.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC to review restrictions on visits to China by local officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 4 (CNA)
06/04/08  23:47:28
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will look at the feasibility of easing
restrictions on travel to China by local government heads, the country's chief
China policy coordinator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman  Lai Shin-yuan  made the promise  during a legislative committee
meeting amid reports that several local government heads, including Taipei Mayor
Hau Lung-bin and Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, are planning to visit China either to
attend international activities or to promote tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, lawmakers from both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed concern over the MAC's
stance on local government heads traveling to China, following the May 20
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration which promises to pursue
reconciliation and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The issue became the focus of discussions at the meeting also because it was
held one day after the MAC made an abrupt policy about-face when it permitted
Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng to travel to Beijing to attend an
earthquake relief fundraiser, after initially rejecting his application.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, Lai said, elected officials are eligible to take
part in international conferences or activities in China that are organized by
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Taipei Mayor Hau can apply to attend 2010 Shanghai World
Expo-related activities, Lai said. As of Tuesday evening, Lai said, Hau had not
filed an application with the MAC for his reported planned trip to Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In Lee's case, Lai said the MAC agreed to his travel plan only after Lee
promised to attend the Beijing fundraiser in his capacity as a shareholder of
the Kinmen county government-run Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. and to confine his
itinerary to just the fundraiser.</P>
      <P>Lee had originally planned a number of activities on his Beijing trip, including
exploring Chinese authorities' views on the offshore island county's plan to
purchase water from China's Fujian province to help meet its drinking and
irrigation water needs, a proposal that is not in line with current government
policy.</P>
      <P>As many mayors and magistrates have expressed interest in visiting China to
trumpet closer cross-strait trade, investment, tourist and cultural exchanges in
order to accelerate economic revamp in their cities and counties, Lai said the
MAC will conduct an overall review and come up with a report in two to three
weeks on whether and how to update the existing regulations governing visits to
China by local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>At any rate, Lai said, the MAC will tailor the regulations to make them more
relevant to the needs of the local government chiefs.</P>

      <P>There is evidence that the risk of developing oral cancer is 12.5 times higher
among betel nut addicts than among non-users, and 4.9 times higher among among
heavy smokers than non-smokers, said a researcher at the Taipei-based National
Health Institute Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Wen Chi-pang said that, after examining more than 1 million health reports
compiled by the privately operated MJ Health Screening Center over the past 13
years, he found that betel nuts cause greater damage to the health than tobacco,</P>
      <P>Wen said that to date there are no effective methods for helping betel nut
addicts to quit, but added that for people who both smoke and chew betel nuts
and want to kick the habits, it would be easier to first quit smoking.</P>
      <P>Wen said the results of his analysis show that 77 percent of those who quit
smoking also managed to stop chewing betel nuts.</P>
      <P>Wen warned that chewing betel nuts can cause many different kinds of cancer,
including oral cancer, esophageal cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer and cancer
of the throat. He suggested that health authorities work out measures to prevent
and control betel nut use while continuing their anti-smoking campaigns.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that more than 1.5 million people in Taiwan are addicted to
betel nuts, with some 90 percent of the addicts also being smokers.</P>

      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng called Wednesday for the central

suggesting that cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations also include issues pertinent
to residents of these islands.</P>
      <P>Lee made the comments prior to his departure for Beijing, where he will attend
an event Thursday to raise funds for Sichuan earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>Lee will donate more than NT$9 million in relief aid to the earthquake victims,
on behalf of the residents of Kinmen, and NT$43 million (US$1.42 million) on
behalf of the Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc., which is run by the county
government.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a wise and good man
holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God, persons in authority, and the
words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on the other hand, does not know that there
are Laws of God; he, therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful
to persons in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan remains on U.S. 'Tier 2' list for human trafficking</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 4 (CNA)

(By Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the second consecutive year, the United States has placed Taiwan on a list
of "Tier 2" countries for human trafficking, noting that Taiwan authorities do
not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
but are making significant efforts to do so.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 released Wednesday by the U.S. Department
of State describes Taiwan as a destination for men, women and children
trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also a source of women trafficked to Japan, Australia, the United
Kingdom and the United States, the report says.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign workers remain vulnerable to trafficking because legal
protections, oversight by authorities and enforcement efforts are inadequate,"
it states.</P>
      <P>The report  recommends  that Taiwan pass and implement  a comprehensive anti-
trafficking law prohibiting and punishing all severe forms of trafficking and
extend full Labor Standard Law protections to all categories of foreign workers,
including domestic helpers and caregivers.</P>
      <P>The report also suggests that Taiwan fully implement a recent Immigration Law
amendment to extend its protections to trafficking victims and ensure that law
enforcement personnel, prosecutors and judges consistently follow formal
trafficking victim identification procedures to prevent the prosecution of
trafficking victims.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should establish procedures for referring victims to shelters, improve
incentives for victims to assist in the prosecution of traffickers,  and
increase  police  efforts  to investigate trafficking crimes and to identify
trafficking victims, the report says.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan should launch a campaign to discourage child sex tourism by
people from Taiwan and improve cooperation with the governments of labor source
countries, the report recommends.</P>
      <P>The 2008 report rates 170 countries and regions and places them on three lists,
based primarily on the extent of government action to combat trafficking.</P>
      <P>Governments that fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
human trafficking are placed on the "Tier 1 " list, while those that are making
significant efforts to meet the minimum standards are placed in "Tier 2."</P>
      <P>Governments that do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not
making significant efforts to do so are placed on the "Tier 3" list and may be
subject to certain sanctions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ranked among the "Tier 1" countries from 2001 to 2004, but was
downgraded to "Tier 2" in 2005.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Taiwan was placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully complying
with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. The U.S.
government removed Taiwan from the watch list and ranked it among "Tier 2"
countries again in 2007 in view of the country's significant efforts to tackle
the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Young Taiwanese physicist wins prestigious IUPAP prize</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
06/05/08  14:26:02
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kai-Feng Chen, a Taiwan-educated physicist, has been named a co-winner of an
award set up by the renowned International Union of Pure and Applied Physics
(IUPAP) to honor young scientists in particle physics, the National Science
Council (NSC) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen, 28, an NSC contract post-doctorate fellow who is now in Geneva doing
research at the world's largest particle physics laboratory -- known as CERN or
the European Organization for Nuclear Research -- shares the 2008 IUPAP Young
Scientist Prize with Yasaman Farzan, an Iranian scientist, the NSC said.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC, Chen won the honor for his outstanding innovative research
in B mesons decay through his participation in a BELLE experiment at Japan's
High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, better known as KEK, which is
located in Tsukuba -- Japan's city of science.</P>
      <P>During the research period, Chen published several highly acclaimed articles,
the NSC said, adding that one of his papers published in 2003 has been cited
more than 140 times and four other relevant papers have each been cited over 50
times.</P>
      <P>Chen told a videoconference organized by the NSC Wednesday afternoon that he is
honored to receive the award, which was given for the first time by the
authoritative IUPAP to young particle physicists.</P>
      <P>A public citation for the two winners will be held when the 34th International
Conference on High Energy Physics convenes at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia July 30-Aug. 5. At the ceremony, Chen will deliver a speech on the
main subject of his research.</P>
      <P>A self-effacing man, Chen attributed his clinching of the prize mainly to good
luck. However, his mentors at National Taiwan University (NTU) who attended the
videoconference at the NSC headquarters in Taipei said his success is by no
means fortuitous.</P>
      <P>Chen graduated from the NTU's department of physics in 2001 and obtained a
master's degree from the school the following year. Three years later, he
received a PhD from his alma mater. His research has consistently focused on
experimental high energy physics.</P>
      <P>"Despite his youth, Chen has published 14 papers in the field of high energy
physics. This is an extraordinary achievement, " said Hsiung Yi, director of the
NTU's department of physics.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiung, Taiwan joined the IUPAP under the name the Physical Society
of the Republic of China, but it does not hold a seat on the board of directors
of the organization's Commission on Particles and Fields, also known as C11,
which sponsors the Young Scientist Prize for particle physicist.</P>
      <P>"The prize winners were decided by seven executive directors from six countries
-- the United States, Japan and four European nations, " Hsiung said, adding
that without solid achievements, Chen could not have been selected for
commendation in the highly competitive academic field.</P>
      <P>Hou Wei-shu, an NTU physics professor, echoed Hsiung's views, saying that three
spokesmen for the BELLE experiment took the initiative to recommend Chen as a
candidate when the IUPAP decided to create the award this year.</P>
      <P>"Chen's brilliant work had long impressed his colleagues at the Japanese
laboratory," Hou said.</P>
      <P>Chen began to work on the BELLE experiment at KEK in 1998 when he was still an
NTU freshman. The BELLE collaborators comprise more than 350 physicists from
scores of institutions in 14 countries. The experiment uses the deluge of B
mesons from the accelerator to elucidate the mysterious difference between
matter and antimatter.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10-plus years, Hou said, tens of billions of New Taiwan dollars
have been spent on the project, under which more than 200 papers have been
churned out. Chen alone accounted for 14 of them. "It's an admirable
accomplishment," Hou added.</P>
      <P>Chen worked for the BELLE project until 2006 when he left for Geneva to join the
CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at
CERN. The CMS project promises to revolutionize human understanding of the
universe.</P>
      <P>As a member of a global core research team in high energy physics, Chen has
spent much of his adulthood abroad. "'Wandering' without a fixed place to live
is the destiny of those who dedicate themselves to experimental high energy
physics research, " he said in the videoconference.</P>
      <P>Noting that the CERN experimental scale is far larger than that of the BELLE,
with the research staff zooming from 400 to 2,000, Chen said he very much loves
his current work.</P>
      <P>"I cherish the experience  of learning  and working  with researchers of diverse
nationalities, " Chen said, adding that he particularly likes the European
people's habit of going to a restaurant to talk over whatever problems they
encounter.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife, Chang Min-chuan, was his classmate at NTU. Chang, who conducted two
years of post-doctor research in Japan, is now an assistant professor at the
department of physics at Fu Jen Catholic University. Chang said she maintains
close contact with her husband via Skype. "I'm very proud of his achievements, "
said Chang who is expecting their first child in September.</P>

losses due to heavy rains that been affecting the central counties since late
May.</P>
      <P>The premier made the call during an Executive Yuan meeting Thursday morning,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih told
reporters after the meeting.</P>
      <P>Shih said that according to initial estimates, agricultural losses caused by
heavy rainfall since the end of last month have amounted to about NT$20 million
(US$656,000) in the two counties.</P>
      <P>Although the amount is not high enough for the farmers to qualify for government
assistance, Liu instructed the COA to take into consideration the serious
situation on the ground and provide the farmers with funds to get their farms
back up and running, according to Shih. The premier also pointed out that
serious flooding in the region has affected the daily lives of residents there,
Shih added.</P>
      <P>In addition, the COA also decided during the meeting to increase the subsidy to
farmers who have experienced agricultural losses due to natural disasters, from
NT$6,000 per hectare to NT$10,000 per hectare, in order to reduce the financial
burden on rural residents, Shih said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Mobile Co. has the highest cell phone customer satisfaction rate among
Taiwan's major telecom providers, according to the results of a survey released
Thursday by the Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>In the survey, a total of 39.8 percent of Taiwan Mobile Co. customers said they
are "satisfied" or "very satisfied" with the company's cell phone service,
compared with only 19.8 percent of Chunghwa Telecom mobile phone customers and
18.6 percent of Far Eastone's customers.</P>
      <P>The online survey of mobile phone customer habits, telecom company fees and
customer satisfaction  was conducted  by the Consumers' Foundation between late
March and April 25, with a total of 1,063 valid samples collected.</P>
      <P>Among the questionnaires collected, 44.3 percent were from of Chunghwa Telecom
customers, 25.8 percent were Taiwan Mobile Co. customers, and 25.8 percent were
Far Eastone customers, with the samples of 47 Vibo Telecom Co. customers, 36
First International Telecom customers, 28 Asia Pacific Telecom Group customers
and 24 customers of other telecom providers also included in the survey.</P>
      <P>Customer satisfaction analysis was only conducted on the three main telecom
companies as the size of the sampling of customers of other providers was too
small, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 23.4 percent of Chunghwa Telecom customers are
"unsatisfied" or "very unsatisfied" with the company's mobile phone services,
compared with 19.7 percent of Far Eastone customers and just 15.3 percent of
Taiwan Mobile Co. customers.</P>
      <P>Among all the respondents, a total of 283, or 26.7 percent, said they are
"satisfied"  or "very satisfied"  with their telecom provider's services, while
52.9 percent said the quality of service is "average, " and 20.5 percent said
they are "unsatisfied" or "very unsatisfied."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) assured the public Thursday that
government-funded chicken pox vaccines are in sufficient supply amid an ongoing
outbreak of the disease among school children.</P>
      <P>The recent delivery of 50,000 doses of the vaccine to Taiwan is expected to meet
local demand for the next six months, and the CDC is currently procuring more
vaccine to cope with the need, CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao said.</P>
      <P>Since January 2004, the government has provided free inoculation against chicken
pox for infants reaching 12 months old.</P>
      <P>However, a global shortage of the vaccine since last year has forced the
government to delay the age for inoculation to 15 months.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, a total of 5,900 chicken pox cases were recorded in the
country between January and May this year, up 11 percent compared with the same
period last year when 5,300 cases were recorded.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, mass infections have been reported in 25 elementary schools
and kindergartens around Taiwan, Chou said, noting that most infected children
were born before 2004, prior to the launch of the government-funded chicken pox
vaccine inoculation program.</P>
      <P>Chou predicted that the outbreak will moderate after summer vacation begins in
July.</P>
      <P>Chicken pox is caused by an infection of the varicella zoster virus, which is
transmissible by coughing and sneezing, by direct contact and by aerosolization
of viruses from skin lesions.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, infections are reported all year round, and school children infected
with the disease are advised not to attend school for at least five days to
avoid spreading the virus to their schoolmates, according to the CDC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government, in collaboration with a number of private enterprises, launched
a platform Thursday to develop information and communication technology (ICT)
services so as to create a digital environment.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has had a strategic alliance
with the local ICT industry via a Communication Leaders United Board, also known
as the 3G Club. The club's main objective  was to integrate  third  generation
(3G)  wireless communication with applications in various other fields, such as
construction, medical care, and home-and-office security.</P>
      <P>This initiative will now be taken a step further as the ministry prepares to
create a ubiquitous network by utilizing advanced digital technologies, such as
wireless sensor networks and wireless broadband telecommunications, across a
broad spectrum of applications.</P>
      <P>Woody Duh,  the director of the Department  of Industrial Technology under the
MOEA, said at the formal launch of the "Intelligent Life SIG" digital platform
that the government will provide the advanced technologies and know-how to help
Taiwan industries upgrade their digitalized services.</P>
      <P>He however noted that while the country's economic development is often measured
based on statistics such business incomes, "oftentimes we fail to measure our
success in terms of happiness in our day-to-day lives."</P>
      <P>"By incorporating digital communications  into products and infrastructure  to
make our everyday lives more efficient and convenient, Taiwan could become a
digital technology island, " Duh said.</P>
      <P>For example, the housing sector could use 3G communication technologies to offer
residents wireless services to streamline communications with the rest of the
world, he said, adding that this proposal also has enormous business potential.</P>
      <P>The earlier platform, the 3G Club, now called the WIT Club (Wireless
&amp;Information  Technology Communication  Leaders United Board), will generate
an estimated NT$3 billion (US$986 million) in production value and NT$1 billion
in investment value within the next three years, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-chin, a senior official in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said that
the ICT industry could use digital communication to create new products and
applications in other fields such as architecture,  and could also explore the
overseas market for cross-field integration.</P>
      <P>"Such an initiative could spur more export businesses for the local private
sector," he said.</P>
      <P>Industry leaders who are joint partners in the development of the Intelligent
Life platform said it will focus on research into wireless communication,
electronics and information technology to help build an "intellectual living
environment" full of convenient services.</P>
      <P>"In addition  to making  our lives more comfortable,  the value-added products
and services will give Taiwan's industry an edge in global competition," said
Rock Hsu, the chairman of the WIT Club.</P>
      <P>Alongside the key players in the local ICT industry such as BenQ and Chunghwa
Telecom, Taiwan's leading think tanks such as Industrial Technology Research
Institute and Institute for Information Industry will play major roles in the
research work.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the government's input will be mainly technical support,
according to Duh.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China must first remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan if the two sides were to
clinch a peace accord, a Japanese newspaper quoted Taiwan's President Ma Ying-
jeou as saying Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary for Taiwan and China to ink an agreement to perpetuate peace
across the Taiwan Strait, but China must first dismantle its missiles targeting
Taiwan," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an exclusive interview with Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan supports  Japan's and the United States'  roles in developing an anti-
missile defense system to help maintain peace in the region, and it also backs a
Japan-U.S. security pact to serve that end, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Stable relations between China and Japan are beneficial to Taiwan, while secure
cross-Taiwan Strait ties are also good for Japan," Ma asserted.</P>
      <P>The best way to improve Taiwan-China relations is to shelve thorny political
issues and focus on urgent economic matters in the initial stage, ahead of
signing a peace accord, the president said.</P>
      <P>Ma urged the international community, including Japan, to back his efforts to
improve Taiwan's relations with China.</P>
      <P>Ma also hailed a landmark visit to China in late May by ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung,  during which Wu met Communist Party of China General
Secretary and Chinese President Hu Jintao on May 28 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and China are to establish direct weekend cross-strait charter
flights, open Taiwan wider to more Chinese tourists and allow a full
convertibility of their currencies in July, the president said he is confident
that two-way ties will improve and that daily cross-strait charter flight
service will be put in place as projected by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ma said he will flexibly push for Taiwan's entry into world bodies, such as the
World Health Organization, using any suitable name,  and expressed  his hope
that the problem  of Taiwan's representation in international organizations
would be adequately resolved next year.</P>
      <P>Giving his best wishes to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, Ma, however,
revealed no plan to visit China.</P>
      <P>But the president extended an invitation to a business visit by Chen Yunlin --
new chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), who now serves as China's top negotiator with Taiwan.</P>

would refuse to take part in the expo to be held later this month if the Chinese

      <P>Chen's remarks came amid reports that an increasing number of local city and
county chiefs in Taiwan are planning to visit China following the May 20
inauguration of the Kuomintang (KMT) government, which is seeking to build
closer trade ties with China.</P>
      <P>Chen said that this year is Kaohsiung's "year of tourism" and that the city
government has been working to promote the city's profile internationally.</P>

her visit and that it will be in line with Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council

      <P>Children born of Taiwanese and foreign spouses are less prone to allergic
problems such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis, according to a
survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Kung Memorial Hospital in Linkou, Taipei County, conducted the allergic
epidemiology survey on the first graders of the elementary schools in Keelung
City, where one out of every 10 school children are born to foreign spouses of
Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>The ratio among the immigrants' children who has had asthma was 10.8 percent,
compared with the 16.6 percent of their counterparts whose parents are both
Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The ratio of "new children of Taiwan", as the foreign spouses' kids are referred
to locally, having allergic rhinitis was 30.1 percent, far less than the 47.5
percent of their counterparts whose parents are both Taiwanese. Allergic
rhinitis is an inflammation of the nasal membranes caused by airborne particles
of dust, dander or plant pollens.</P>
      <P>But in terms of atopic dermatitis, the ratio of "new sons of Taiwan" having the
skin problem was 6.7 percent, similar to their counterparts at 9.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The hospital researchers said in their initial analysis that genes may have
played a certain role in the problems of asthma and allergic rhinitis, so that
"new children of Taiwan" seem to have better protection compared with their
counterparts.</P>
      <P>But if comparing asthma rates over the past year, the gap between the
immigrants' children and the local children has narrowed, a sign that shows "the
influence of environment is increasing."</P>
      <P>Many of the foreign spouses come from Southeast Asian countries which are less
developed and generally less polluted than cities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The researchers also found some risky factors for first-graders developing
allergies over the past year, such as the families whose parents have a higher
education, children using antibiotics and fever medication, families keeping
cats when their children are under one-year-old, and frequent use of fever
medication.</P>
      <P>But they said eating beans reduced the children's risk of developing the
allergies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Torrential rains over the past several days have affected almost all areas
around Taiwan, except for the northern part, leaving farmland inundated and
traffic obstructed, officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In central and southern Taiwan, a total of 1,073 hectares of farmland were
damaged by heavy rains over the past several days, with agricultural losses
exceeding NT$20 million (US$656,000) in several counties, mainly in the central
counties of Yunlin and Changhua, officials from the COA Food and Agriculture
Agency said.</P>
      <P>Fields of leafy vegetables were damaged the most in these two counties, while
other plantations of cabbage, grapes and green onions were also heavily
battered, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In response to an emergency order by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, COA Minister Chen
Wu-hsiung announced around noon Thursday that the government has increased the
subsidy to farmers who have experienced agricultural losses due to the natural
disaster from NT$6,000 per hectare to NT$10,000 per hectare in order to reduce
the financial burden on rural residents.</P>
      <P>The increased subsidy was offered to help the farmers get back on their feet
soon, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to COA officials, heavy rains also wreaked havoc on the
eastern coastal county of Taitung, where air transport to and from the northern
capital city of Taipei to Taitung City was obstructed Thursday, while the
Southern Cross-Island Highway in Taitung County was opened on and off due to
landslides in some sections.</P>
      <P>In the southernmost county of Pingtung, the rain was coming down in torrents
Thursday,  with the rain inundating highways near Pingtung's Linbian, known for
its production of popular fruits, including wax apples, the officials said.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng voiced reservations Thursday about
leading the Taiwan team to take part in the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing, saying
that the matter has to be "better assessed."</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will be the best person to lead the team to the
charity event, which will be held Sept. 6-17 in the Chinese capital, Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, he has relayed the idea to President Ma Ying-jeou, but Ma has
yet to respond to the proposal which was raised by the Chinese Taipei Paralymic
Committee.</P>
      <P>Apart from Chow, Legislative Yuan Deputy Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan can also do
the job, he said, adding that he has talked over the issue with Tseng who has
agreed to lead the team if Chow is not available.</P>
      <P>In a departure from his statements Wednesday on the matter, Wang said the
question of him leading the team would have to be "further evaluated."</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker had told reporters a day earlier that he would assess
the feasibility of leading the Taiwan team to the 2008 Paralympics in Beijing in
September, if doing so would be beneficial to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, China is hoping that Taiwan would send a team to take part in
the event shortly after the 2008 Olympics in August.</P>
      <P>But, he added, China has not yet sent him an official invitation to participate
in the world's biggest sports event for people with physical disabilities. He

    <HEADLINE>MOFA suspends directive to use 'ROC' instead of 'Taiwan'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
06/05/08  18:49:56
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it has suspended its
instructions to the country's embassies and representative  offices abroad to
use the terms "Mainland China" or "the mainland" to refer to the People's
Republic of China (PRC)  and to describe visits to Taiwan by foreign dignitaries
as visits to "the Republic of China (ROC)," instead of to "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"We have asked for instructions from the higher authorities and will seek a
national consensus on the issue, as we have heard many different opinions from
the general public, " said Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the ministry rebutted some media accusations that such
instructions represented a form of "de-Taiwanization." According to the MOFA,
the "makeshift directive" was in line with President Ma Ying-jeou's policy of
maintaining the status quo and conducting cross-Taiwan Strait relations under
the "1992 Consensus" which allows for recognition of "one-China, " but with
different interpretations.</P>
      <P>In the news conference later in the day, Ou stressed that the directive did not
forbid the use of "Taiwan, " a name better known in the international community,
but rather recommended that it was more "appropriate" to use the "ROC."</P>
      <P>At an informal press reception Monday, Ou was also quizzed by reporters on the
best name to use when referring to China. He responded, "Mainland China, "
adding that it best represents the status quo.</P>
      <P>"We are the Republic of China -- that is the status quo, " Ou said. "If we call
the other side the People's Republic of China, that would imply 'one country on
each side of the Taiwan Strait.'"</P>
      <P>Ou was referring to the term used by the previous administration of Chen Shui-
bian to describe the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Ties between China and Taiwan remained frozen during Chen's eight years in
office mainly because he was perceived by Beijing as asserting Taiwan's
independence, and the language he used to describe the status quo was seen as
highlighting his stance.</P>
      <P>China views Taiwan as a renegade province and continuously suppresses Taiwan's
international space by blocking its efforts to join international organizations
and protesting its use of the title ROC or Taiwan to join any international
entities.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press briefing Thursday, MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said
it is very natural to use the official name of a nation on formal occasions, and
that the MOFA's directive had nothing to do with de-Taiwanization.</P>
      <P>She said that under the basic principle of maintaining the status quo, it is
proper to refer to China as "Mainland China, " a designation that she said is
acceptable to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Also, the MOFA has not banned the use of the name Taiwan, especially for English
use, where it would be easy to confuse the ROC with the PRC, she said.</P>
      <P>On its official English Web site, the MOFA is listed as the "Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan)," while on its Chinese site it states
"Republic of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday passed a new set of policy guidelines to promote the
sustainable use of energy, following the principles of "high efficiency, " "high
value-added, " " low emission, " and "low dependency (on foreign fuel sources)."</P>
      <P>The guidelines  were reported  to the press by Government Information  Office
Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih at a press conference after the Cabinet adopted
the "sustainable energy policy guidelines" at a regular meeting.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan hoped that Taiwan can create a new "low-
carbon" economy that balances economic development, environmental protection and
social justice by following the new energy policy.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Liu also demanded that unclear power should be included in
the options of "no-carbon-emission" energy source and that the delayed fourth
nuclear power plant should be completed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, the previous government decided to suspend the construction of
the fourth plant. Construction was resumed after four months and is expected to
become fully operational no sooner than late 2009.</P>
      <P>In the meeting, the Cabinet also established several substantial steps to carry
out the policy, Shih said, adding that the government will overhaul the energy
structure by raising energy utilization efficiency,  encouraging  "clean"
energy,  and promoting energy conservation.</P>
      <P>On energy efficiency, the government has set the goal of raising energy
efficiency by 2 percent for each of the next eight years so that the nationwide
energy intensity in 2015 would be 20 percent lower than the levels in 2005 and
that the energy intensity in 2025 would be 50 percent lower than the 2005 level.</P>
      <P>Energy intensity is a measure of energy efficiency -- higher the intensity,
lower the efficiency.</P>
      <P>For clean energy, by deploying clean energy with low or no carbon emission, the
government expects to lower the nationwide emission volume back to the year 2008
level some time between 2016 and 2020, and back to the year 2000 level by 2025.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the percentage of low-carbon energy in the total energy generated in
Taiwan would increase from 40 percent at present to 55 percent in 2025,
according to the guidelines.</P>

      <P>The government, in collaboration with a number of private enterprises, launched
a platform Thursday to develop information and communication technology (ICT)
services so as to create a digital environment.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has had a strategic alliance
with the local ICT industry via a Communication Leaders United Board, also known
as the 3G Club. The club's main objective was to integrate third generation (3G)
wireless communication with applications in various other fields, such as
construction, medical care, and home-and-office security.</P>
      <P>This initiative will now be taken a step further as the ministry prepares to
create a ubiquitous network by utilizing advanced digital technologies, such as
wireless sensor networks and wireless broadband telecommunications, across a
broad spectrum of applications.</P>
      <P>Woody Duh,  the director of the Department  of Industrial Technology under the
MOEA, said at the formal launch of the "Intelligent Life SIG" digital platform
that the government will provide the advanced technologies and know-how to help
Taiwan industries upgrade their digitalized services.</P>
      <P>He however noted that while the country's economic development is often measured
based on statistics such business incomes, "oftentimes we fail to measure our
success in terms of happiness in our day-to-day lives."</P>
      <P>"By incorporating digital communications  into products and infrastructure  to
make our everyday lives more efficient and convenient, Taiwan could become a
digital technology island, " Duh said.</P>
      <P>For example, the housing sector could use 3G communication technologies to offer
residents wireless services to streamline communications with the rest of the
world, he said, adding that this proposal also has enormous business potential.</P>
      <P>The earlier platform, the 3G Club, now called the WIT Club (Wireless
&amp;Information Technology Communication Leaders United Board), will generate
an estimated NT$3 billion (US$986 million) in production value and NT$1 billion
in investment value within the next three years, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>Ho Ming-chin, a senior official in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said that
the ICT industry could use digital communication to create new products and
applications in other fields such as architecture, and could also explore the
overseas market for cross-field integration.</P>
      <P>"Such an initiative could spur more export businesses for the local private
sector," he said.</P>
      <P>Industry leaders who are joint partners in the development of the Intelligent
Life platform said it will focus on research into wireless communication,
electronics and information technology to help build an "intellectual living
environment" full of convenient services.</P>
      <P>"In addition  to making  our lives more comfortable,  the value-added products
and services will give Taiwan's industry an edge in global competition," said
Rock Hsu, the chairman of the WIT Club.</P>
      <P>Alongside the key players in the local ICT industry such as BenQ and Chunghwa
Telecom, Taiwan's leading think tanks such as Industrial Technology Research
Institute and Institute for Information Industry will play major roles in the
research work.</P>
      <P>For the time being, the government's input will be mainly technical support,
according to Duh.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of low-priced zongzi have been sold at supermarket chains
around the country in the run up to the June 8 Dragon Boat Festival, as
consumers try to economize amid rising commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Zongzi, a pyramid shaped traditional Chinese delicacy that is popular around the
time of the Dragon Boat Festival, is made of glutinous rice stuffed with various
savory fillings, such as pork, mushrooms and egg yolks. The rice dumpling is
wrapped in bamboo leaves and cooked by steaming or boiling.</P>
      <P>According to Ko Yu-huan, a specialist at the Marketing Division of a leading
chain store RT-MART International Ltd., a total of 870,000 zongzi had been sold
at RT-MART's 23 outlets islandwide as of Thursday. This represented a 30 percent
increase over the same period last year, Ko said.</P>
      <P>RT-MART's budget zongzi, priced at NT$9.9 (US$ 0.32) each, was the most popular
among customers, Ko told the CNA, adding that another type which costs NT$13.8
(US$ 0.45) each was also selling well.</P>
      <P>"As of Thursday, we at RT-MART had sold a total of 180,000 budget zongzi at
NT$9.9 each, fighting against soaring prices," Ko said. "We expect that sales
will continue to rise in the next few days, as eating zongzi is a tradition
during Dragon Boat Festival."</P>
      <P>Henry Yin, Public Relations Assistant Manager at Far Eastern Geant which
operates 14 marts around Taiwan, also said that cheap zongzi had become a hot
item this year, as " customers can save more by buying budget zongzi from
supermarkets than by making the rice dumplings at home."</P>
      <P>Noting that on average it could cost up to NT$25 to make one zongzi at home, Yin
said Geant's budget price of NT$9.9 had "of course lured many housewives."</P>
      <P>Geant also offers a variety of choices -- some 30 different flavors of zongzi,
Yin said, adding that so far the chain had sold some 800,000 zongzi, bringing in
NT$ 8.5 million (US$ 279,605) , at its various outlets.</P>
      <P>"That sales figure represents an increase of NT$1 million compared to last
year," Yin disclosed.</P>
      <P>The convenience chain stores, including the President Chain Store Corp. that
owns thousands of 7-11 outlets around Taiwan, and Hi-Life Co., Ltd., have also
been cashing in on the popularity of cheaper zongzi this year.</P>
      <P>According to Ryan Chen, a supervisor at Hi-Life's Marketing Division, zongzi
sales have risen by 10 to 20 percent this year, which he said is "quite
satisfactory to Hi-Life."</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-chen, a specialist on the Public Relations Team of the President Chain
Store Corp., also indicated that although the sales volume of zongzi this year
"is similar to last year, " the lower priced zongzi have "indeed attracted more
consumer attention."</P>
      <P>However, with the hyper marts and convenience stores seeing heavy zongzi sales
this year, small retailers have been squeezed out.</P>
      <P>"In the past people used to buy 10 or 20 zongzi at once... but now they're only
purchasing five to 10 because the price is too high," said Wang hsiou-yu, a
retailer in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Wang said that because the prices of the ingredients, such as eggs, mushrooms
and pork, have almost doubled compared to previous years, "the sales have
dropped dramatically" at her store.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese delegation promotes tourism in Seoul</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 60-member tourism promotion delegation from Taiwan held a travel consulting
conference Wednesday in Seoul to help raise Taiwan's visibility as a
destination, drawing the participation of around 200 representatives from South
Korea's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering, Chen Yong-cho, Taiwan's representative at the Taipei
Mission in Korea, said that more than 100,000 South Korean tourists visited
Taiwan in the first four months of this year, representing a 30 percent growth
year-on-year, but added that there is still ample room for growth.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that more than 10 million South Koreans travel abroad each year, and
added that he hopes at least one tenth of them will visit Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>"There are 104 flights between Taiwan and South Korea every week, and South
Korea is Taiwan's fifth largest trade partner." Chen said. "Travel is Taiwan's
only source of foreign trade surplus with South Korea."</P>
      <P>Chen attributed  the growing number of tourists  from the northeastern Asian
country to Taiwan over the past four months mainly to the promotional efforts
over the Tour Taiwan Years 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>Noting that South Korea's SBS TV's filming of the soap opera "On Air" in Taiwan
had also boosted South Koreans' interest in visiting Taiwan and their
understanding of the island. Chen said the film locations, such as Sun Moon Lake
in central Taiwan, the National Palace Museum in the north, Takaro Gorge in the
east, and Kenting Scenic Area in the south, have become popular tourist
attractions among South Koreans.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan plans to launch a series of tourism promotion activities in
South Korea, featuring hot springs, medical and health care tourism and golf
tours.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chung Woo-Sik, chairman of the Korea Association of Travel Agents,
said that Taiwan has been an important tourist destination among South Koreans
for the past 20 years, and that he hopes bilateral tourism exchanges will be
further enhanced.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by the Taiwan Visitors Association, is composed of
representatives of a number of tourism-related organizations, travel agents,
golf course operators, the catering industry, amusement parks and hotels. They
are in Seoul to attend the 2008 Korea World Travel being held from June 5-8.</P>

      <P>A group of gifted children from Paris that is visiting Taiwan for a three-week
travel-study program are not only improving their understanding of Mandarin
Chinese but also experiencing aspects of Chinese culture, such as the coming
Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>Students of the School Leonard De Vinci of Paris, the 24 children aged 8-13, who
have already been studying Mandarin in France, arrived in late May to explore
Taiwanese folk customs and culture.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the June 8 Dragon Boat Festival -- one of the most
important holidays of the Chinese calendar -- the students are being taught to
make zongzi and "fragrant sachets, " which are traditional Dragon Boat Festival
highlights.</P>
      <P>Zongzi are pyramid-shaped glutinous rice delicacies stuffed with savory fillings
and wrapped in bamboo leaves, traditionally eaten in conjunction with the
festival, while the "fragrant sachets" are used to repel mosquitoes and other
insects in the early summer months.</P>
      <P>"French experts and psychologists believe that learning Mandarin can help these
children develop their brain potential, " said Liao Kuo-pao from Taiwan, who has
taught Mandarin at the school for almost a year.</P>
      <P>In addition, taichi chuan, a soft Chinese martial art, is used as a method for
children to learn emotional control, Liao added.</P>
      <P>During the travel-study program, organized in collaboration with Taiwan's
Mandarin Daily News, the children learn Mandarin in the morning and take
cultural lessons in the afternoon, such as puppetry, calligraphy, the game of go
and Kung fu, as well as visiting various points of interest in Taipei, said
Helene Duchatelle, a teacher accompanying the children.</P>
      <P>The private School Leonard De Vinci of Paris, which caters to children ranging
from kindergarten to high school age, is for children who are intellectually
gifted.</P>
      <P>Three languages --  French,  English and Mandarin --  are obligatory, while
German and Spanish are elective subjects, said Liao.</P>
      <P>The school started its Mandarin courses about five years ago, catching the first

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) painted a rosy picture
Thursday of Taiwan's economic growth, saying that the domestic economy will fare
better in the second half of the year than in the first.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Hu Chung-ying said the domestic economy is expected to take a
turn for the better in the second half of the year, given that the U.S. sub-
prime mortgage crisis has eased, prices on the international crude oil market
have fallen, cross-Taiwan Strait relations are thawing and government investment
will be increasing.</P>
      <P>With increasing  domestic  investment  and rising  consumer confidence, Taiwan's
economic growth is expected to top 5 percent for the entire year of 2008, Hu
said.</P>
      <P>He added that as the second half year is a brisk period for for electronics and
information technology -- the prime movers behind Taiwan's export-oriented
economy --the CEPD was even more positive that the domestic economy will pick up
in months to come.</P>
      <P>Oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday morning to US$122.3
per barrel, down nearly by US$10 from the May 20 price, which represented a
"silver lining" in terms of a global economic recovery, Hu said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he said, the administration has decided to channel some NT$103.4
billion (US$3.39 billion) into public works to help spur domestic investment.</P>
      <P>The anticipated opening of direct cross-strait weekend charter flight services
and the expected entry of Chinese tourists into Taiwan next month are two other
factors helping to boost domestic investment and consumer's confidence for the
second half year, Hu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) has yet to decide whether to combine three
elections, scheduled to occur in the next two years, into one to save costs, CEC
Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Whether  to combine the elections  into one will require solicitation of
opinions from the public," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to Taiwan's city and county chief elections in late 2009, city
and county council members election, and township and village chief elections in
2010.</P>
      <P>Chang disputed Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi's recent remarks at the
legislature that his ministry will decide in mid-October whether to combine the
elections as it is stipulated that related authorities should announce a
decision a year prior to the elections.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that whether to combine the elections involves election operations,
not election policies, and the CEC should be the authority in charge of making
decisions about election operations.</P>
      <P>In making a decision, the CEC must also consider if changing election dates will
give rise to any public accusations about violating the law, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Combining elections will save NT$280 million (US$9.18 million) , Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the ruling Kuomintang asked Chang to resign
voluntarily now that the administration has been shifted to the Kuomintang (KMT)
from the previous Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chang said that his appointment expires on June 16, 2010, and he will follow the
law in fulfilling his duties.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao, another KMT legislator, said the premier could also act under the
Public Functionary Election and Recall Law to ask the president to assign
another CEC chairman.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if President Ma asks him to leave, he will respect the
president's wishes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of Department of Health (DOH) spot checks of the ingredients and
materials used to make zongzi found that 12 percent of the samples did not meet
food safety standards, with excessive levels of sulfur dioxide being the main
problem, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Zongzi, a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumpling with various savory fillings,
is usually cooked in bamboo leaves and is especially popular around the time of
the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 8 this year.</P>
      <P>Under the supervision of the DOH and the Cabinet's Consumer Protection
Commission, local governments around the country conducted spot checks of
zongzi, the bamboo leaves used to wrap them, and the dried foods in the local
markets used as the ingredients, an official from the commission said.</P>
      <P>As of June 3, of the 1,149 samples tested, 119 did not meet food safety
standards, and 89 of substandard samples were found to contain high levels of
sulfur dioxide, a bleaching agent.</P>
      <P>The sellers of the substandard products have been already fined, the official
said.</P>
      <P>In April and May, the commission also tested shelled peanuts, one of the major
ingredients of zongzi, for the presence of the cancer causing agent aflatoxin.
Tests were carried out on a total of 47 samples in 11 cities and counties, and
the samples were all found to be safe, the official said.</P>
      <P>The commission will continue to carry out food inspections, and consumers can
report any irregularities by calling the phone number "1950," the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, six wholesalers around the country have promised the commission that
they will support the government's  policy to stabilize prices, and that they
will provide consumers with adequate supplies so that there will be no need for
the hoarding of necessities, according to the official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM apologizes for upsetting public over U.S. green card status</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou apologized Thursday for upsetting
the public over his obtaining of U.S. permanent resident status in 2005, which
he renounced one month before assuming his current position May 20.</P>
      <P>"I admit that the process of handling the issue was somewhat flawed and
inappropriate, therefore I apologize to the general public, " Ou said at a news
conference, adding that he is also sorry for causing trouble for President Ma
Ying-jeou and the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Ou's comments came after an article published in the latest issue of Next
magazine, a local weekly tabloid, revealed that Ou obtained a U.S. green card
three years ago when he was the Republic of China's (ROC's) ambassador to
Guatemala.</P>
      <P>Ou said he obtained a green card because he originally planned to move to the
United States with his wife after retiring from public service and he happened
to win a green card lottery on Dec. 21, 2005.</P>
      <P>However, Ou said he and his wife applied to the U.S. government to postpone
using the green cards for two years as he did not want to retire immediately.</P>
      <P>"I found it was not the right time to apply for retirement because Guatemala was
going to hold its presidential election in 2007, " he said, adding that after
the election, he stayed in his post to help Taiwan cement its diplomatic ties
with the new president.</P>
      <P>In April, Ou was offered the position of minister of foreign affairs by then-
Premier-designate Liu Chao-shiuan, so he and his wife officially renounced their
U.S. permanent resident status at the U.S. embassy in Guatemala on April 16.</P>
      <P>Ou said Thursday that "obtaining a green card has nothing to do with switching
allegiance but is about where I choose to live after retirement."</P>
      <P>He said during his career as a public servant, the only country he swore
allegiance to was the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"Now that I came back to Taiwan, I will continue to work hard and use actions to
demonstrate my loyalty to the ROC, " the 68-year-old said.</P>
      <P>Ou said that although Taiwan currently does not have a law forbidding diplomats
from holding permanent resident status of a foreign country, the MOFA might look
into the matter in the near future to find out if there are other officials in
MOFA who possess a green card.</P>
      <P>"We will see later whether the issue needs to be resolved in some way, but of
course everything has to be done according to the law," he said.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act only states that anyone who holds foreign citizenship is
prohibited from serving in the government.</P>

      <P>With less than a month to go before Taiwan opens its doors to more Chinese
tourists, representatives of the island's medical tourism industry demanded
Thursday the government pass more flexible regulations to make it easier for
Chinese tourists to travel here for medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The new government headed by President Ma Ying-jeou has set a timetable of
opening direct weekend charter flights partly to promote Chinese tourists to
come here in July, with an estimated 3,000 mainlanders expected to arrive in
Taiwan initially each day, eventually rising to 10,000 tourists a day.</P>
      <P>But representatives of medical tourism professionals said the current plan for
Chinese tourists would not be conducive to promoting medical tourism for the
tourists.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, Chinese tourists can only visit Taiwan
accompanied by a tour guide and must stay in a group during the whole trip, with
no time slotted for individual activities.</P>
      <P>"If Chinese tourists can have one or two free days for medical services  during
their visit in Taiwan,  that would bring a considerable profit to the country,
"said Wu Ming-yan, executive director of the Taiwan task force on medical travel
under the Taiwan Nongovernmental Hospitals and Clinics Association.</P>
      <P>Wu also requested that medical purpose be added as one of the reasons
mainlanders are allowed to visit the island.</P>
      <P>In addition, medical professionals urged the government to allow Chinese
patients to come here for easily performed medical services, including custom-
made health examinations, plastic surgeries and ophthalmic surgeries, so they
can combine the treatments with tourism.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese patients are permitted to enter Taiwan only to  undergo
relatively  serious  procedures,  including  liver transplants, craniofacial
reconstruction, cardiovascular invasive treatment and surgery, artificial
insemination and joint replacement, according to a project launched by the
previous government last year to promote Taiwan's medical tourism.</P>
      <P>In a hearing held by Legislator John Chiang, industry experts said the
government should incorporate medical travel in its plans to promote inbound
visits by mainlanders, saying that the China market is the key to the Taiwan
industry's future prosperity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is eager to tap the potentially lucrative medical tourism market, in
hopes of imitating the success of Singapore, where tourists from all over the
world travel to for plastic surgery, health exams or treatment of serious
illnesses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's medical industry is considered well-positioned  to compete for such
tourists because the island offers advanced and high quality medical services,
which are relatively affordable compared to that of developed countries.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's medical technology and service are of high quality and
the price is relatively lower than other Asian countries, industry officials
said Thursday that Taiwan enjoys advantages in developing medical tourism but
needs more policy support from the government vis-a-vis Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The health care system in China is spotty, with good health care and service
obtainable only at the biggest hospitals in the biggest cities, which charge
high prices. Patients are often expected to give red envelopes to doctors in
order to guarantee good treatment.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries where medical tourism are well developed, services in
Singapore cost about three times that of Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As for Thailand and Malaysia, the quality of medical service is uneven, though
the price is generally lower than in Taiwan, said Shieh Ying-hua,  President of
the Asia-Pacific Travel Medicine Society.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has an advantageous position thanks to its high medical service quality
and low price. What we need is to integrate medical and tourism resources,  "
Shieh said,  adding that with good advertising, medical tourism might add about
NT$50 billion (US$1.64 billion) to the annual output value of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A film festival featuring 12 documentaries, animations and feature films is
slated to kick off in September with the aim of raising public awareness of HIV
transmission, especially through intravenous drug use, the organizer said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Noting that 80 percent, or 6,000 patients, of the reported HIV positive cases in
the past two years were infected through intravenous drug use, a number that is
"increasing rapidly, " May Chiu, executive director of the Garden of Mercy
Foundation (GMF) which is organizing the festival, expressed hope to CNA that
the films will galvanize at-risk people to pay more attention to the HIV issue.</P>
      <P>"In the past, most of those infected with HIV were homosexuals, but in recent
years, drug users have become more likely to become infected, as some of them
have the habit of sharing needles, " said Chiu.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, the 12 films to be screened in more than 80 venues around the
country have been chosen from a total of 93 submissions in a recent contest. The
producers of the winning pieces were scheduled to receive awards from the GMF
Friday.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope that through watching the films, the public can better
understand the disease and will know how to prevent it, " Chiu added.</P>
      <P>The GMF was founded in 1999 with the purpose of educating society,  promoting
humanitarian  care,  conducting AIDS-related research and seeking prevention and
cure, and providing education and care for HIV sufferers.</P>
      <P>It also established a residential care facility for HIV patients -- the Home of
Mercy -- in 2000 to help homeless terminal AIDS patients obtain safe medical
care, spiritual solace and support from family, friends and society.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of a peace agreement between Taiwan and China is not likely to occur
within the next two years, National Security Bureau (NSB) Director-General Shi
Hwei-yow said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although a cross-strait peace pact is the common wish of many people, it is
difficult to sign such an agreement in the near future, Shi told ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Fu Kun-chi during a question-and-answer session at
the legislature.</P>
      <P>A peace agreement will involve Taiwan's sovereignty, Shi said, adding that it
will not be easy for Taiwan's various local parties to reach a consensus on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Shi added that from the security bureau's perspective, Taiwan's statehood should
not be harmed by the signing of such an agreement.</P>
      <P>Shi added that another factor that makes the agreement signing impossible is
whether the agreement should be defined as a real peace agreement or as an end
to the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which used to rule China, fled to Taiwan after losing the war to
Chinese communists in 1949.</P>
      <P>Relations between the KMT and China's Communist Party have begun thawing after
the KMT lost the reins of the government to the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in 2000, with then KMT Chairman Lien Chan being the
first KMT head to set foot in China in 2005 since 1949.</P>
      <P>The May 20 inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou from the KMT has further drawn
the two sides closer, creating the possibility of establishing a peace agreement
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ma, who is seeking closer trade ties with China, has vowed that
cross-strait peace pact negotiations will not start without the over-1,000
Chinese missiles targeting Taiwan being dismantled first.</P>
      <P>China has deployed the missiles to warn self-ruled Taiwan against announcing
formal independence.</P>
      <P>At the legislature, Shi said that he is cautiously optimistic about improved
cross-strait relations, but added that the signing of a peace pact will not
likely happen anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shi said that the security bureau is facing new challenges that have
arisen from new Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>One challenge is how to set up a management mechanism with existing manpower and
resources to minimize the negative impacts of intensified cross-strait exchanges
on the local economy and on social order, Shi said.</P>
      <P>The KMT government has been pushing for the opening of weekend cross-strait
direct charter flights and allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan in
July.</P>

that seeks elimination of tariffs imposed by the European Union on a variety of
electronic products,  Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Fadah Hsieh said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The EU has imposed taxes on 19-inch-or-bigger liquid crystal displays (LCDs) ,
satellite Internet devices and multifunction printers, taxing some of the items
as high as 14 percent by claiming they are electric appliances rather than
information technology (IT) products.</P>
      <P>IT products are supposed to enjoy duty free treatment according to WTO
Information Technology Agreement (ITA).</P>
      <P>Citing an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the issue through informal WTO ITA
committee discussions over the past year, the U.S. requested May 28 that the WTO
investigate and rule on European tariffs on such imports. Japan also filed a
similar complaint that same day.</P>
      <P>The vice minister confirmed to CNA that the ministry, along with its Office of
Trade Negotiations, the Ministry of Finance and various industry leaders are
conducting final-stage discussions to determine the possibility of filing
Taiwan's first-ever trade litigation.</P>
      <P>"We would have a strong case if the decision to enter the trade dispute
settlement procedure is made, " Hsieh said, adding that the ministry will reach
a conclusion very soon, although he gave no specific timeframe on how soon the
final call will be made.</P>
      <P>He also said that if the ministry decides to take legal action, it will deploy
an ad hoc team to conduct the litigation.</P>
      <P>Citing the key reason for considering legal action, Hsieh said the WTO
complaint, if made, could block the EU from spreading the duty taxes on other IT
products.</P>
      <P>The WTO's trade dispute settlement procedure, often regarded as "the world court
of trade, " is vital for enforcing the rules and therefore for ensuring that
trade flows smoothly, but Taiwan has never been a party to any trade dispute,
apart from participating in other members' litigations as a third party.</P>
      <P>Referring to the vigilant attitude toward this potential case, Hsieh said the
discussion is being conducted based on industry reports and legal analyses.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, the U.S. and Japan have been preparing for the case for over a year",
he went on. "The legal grounds for such a complaint should be firm enough for
the two countries to make such litigation, " he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the ministry's trade legal team has learned about the situation from
the U.S. and Japan WTO representatives in a bid to consider the case more
thoroughly.</P>
      <P>The commercial and trade interests of Taiwan's LCD makers were hurt by the EU
taxes more than other local industries, as Taiwan is the world's dominant LCD
maker with 43 percent and 42 percent of the total market share in 2008 and 2009,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The production value of the industry has exceeded NT$1 trillion since 2006 and
is likely to generate NT$2 trillion by 2015.</P>
      <P>According to official tallies, the EU has collected as much as NT$19.6 billion
(US$650 million) in import duty from Taiwanese LCD exports, valued at NT$140
billion.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged local administrators,  public servants
and appointed  officials Thursday to exercise mutual respect when they are
planning to visit China and engage in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs that might
affect "the rights of the central government."</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chang Liang-jen was referring to the current visit to Beijing
by Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who traveled to the Chinese capital a day
earlier after many twists and turns with the MAC giving a last-minute approval
to his application for permission to make the visit.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes Lee will "speak and act appropriately" during his visit
to China in his capacity as a board member of Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. -- the
cash cow of the outlying island that is a former major anti-communist garrison.</P>
      <P>Lee attended a fundraiser in Beijing Thursday for earthquake relief in Sichuan
Province. Over 60,000 people have been killed with numerous others remaining
injured or unaccounted for after the devastating 8.0-magnitude earthquake hit
Sichuan May 12.</P>
      <P>During his five-day visit in China, Lee is also planning to talk with officials
of the southern Ch inese province of Fujian over a plan for Fujian to provide
fresh water to Kinmen and the construction of a Confucius temple on Kinmen by
Chinese builders.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin has also applied to visit China and
that his application has already been referred to the National Immigration
Agency.</P>
      <P>He noted that Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu and Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen have
also expressed their intention to visit China, although they had not filed
applications.</P>
      <P>He added that the MAC has asked the Tourism Bureau to gain a better
understanding of reports that Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei has sent his deputy
secretary-general to China to sign agreements on tourism exchanges between
Taipei County and several Chinese cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated that the MAC is taking a positive stance on the opening of
visits to China by public servants or politically appointed officials, adding
that the MAC is mulling how such opening should be implemented.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chiayi city mayor complains of 'unfair' fund allocation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
06/05/08  21:12:10
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiayi City Mayor Huang Ming-hui complained Thursday of what she called an
"unfair" allocation of state funds in an economic stimulus package recently
unveiled by the central government, saying the plan will worsen Taiwan's rich-
poor divide.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Executive Yuan's distribution of the NT$114.4 billion (US$3.76
billion) in the state funds based on each city's and county's population and
area is unfair and useless in helping to balance the unequal development among
different regions.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Chiayi City in southern Taiwan will be granted NT$1 billion
-- something which she said is not "surprising" but "irksome."</P>
      <P>Although Chiayi City has a relatively small number of residents and a small area
among Taiwan's 25 cities and counties, it has the country's fourth highest
population density -- 4,525 people per square meter, she said.</P>
      <P>With the city's industrialization in recent years, industrial sector employees
now account for about 72 percent of Chiayi City's total employees, which means
the city needs to quickly upgrade its infrastructure to meet its rapid
urbanization needs and its citizens' demands for higher living standards, she
said.</P>
      <P>Huang accused the Executive Yuan of failing to take this factor into account
when it decided to allot only NT$1 billion to Chiayi City from the NT$114.4
billion economic stimulus package, which is aimed at boosting local economies
and public construction projects.</P>
      <P>"Doing so would only further sharpen the existing divide between the rich and
large administrative districts and the other smaller and poorer ones, " the
Chiayi city mayor said. "The way that the special state funds are being given
away would only bring about greater disparity among them," she argued.</P>
      <P>Huang is a member of the ruling Kuomintang, which controls 18 cities and
counties out of a total of 25 local government jurisdictions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei County in northern Taiwan will receive NT$9.6 billion, the largest share
of the NT$114.4 billion (US$3.74 billion) in state funds, according to a list
made public late last month by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Taipei City will receive the second highest sum of NT$6.6 billion, followed by
Taoyuan County at NT$4.9 billion. Taipei City and Taoyuan County are also in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD list, Taichung County in central Taiwan is set to get
NT$3.9 billion, followed by Kaohsiung City at NT$3.8 billion and Changhua County
at NT$3.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County will receive NT$3.1 billion, Tainan County NT$2.8 billion,
Taichung City NT$2.6 billion and Pingtung County NT$2.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Several opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) local government chiefs,
including Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu and Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang
Chiu-hsing, have complained about the way the funds are distributed, making
similar arguments as Huang.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government will hold a seminar June 9 on the experience
Taiwanese rescuers and relief workers gained from participating in the aftermath
of the China earthquake last month, allowing experts to exchange views and come
up with suggestions for the government's future reference.</P>
      <P>According to an official at the Taipei City Fire Department, the seminar is
being organized by the Taipei city government, the National Science and
Technology Center for Disaster Reduction and the Red Cross Society of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>More  than  150  people,  including  government  officials, seismologists and
professional rescue team members will attend the seminar to provide ideas about
how to improve the country's disaster prevention and relief.</P>
      <P>A 22-member rescue team from the Red Cross organization and the Taipei City
Urban Search and Rescue Team, as well as a sniffer dog, went to China's Sichuan
Province four days after a magnitude-8 earthquake hit the province and
surrounding areas May 12.</P>
      <P>The team found the bodies of 15 victims and two live dogs during its five-day
stay in the province's Wenchuan County -- the epicenter of the earthquake -- but
it believes its performance would have been much better if the Chinese
authorities had given permission for the team to set out earlier.</P>
      <P>The earthquake has left 69,122 people dead, 373,606 injured and 17,991 missing,
according to a June 4 report by China's Xinhua news agency.</P>
      <P>Chen Ta-Cheng, a Red Cross executive, and Kuo En-shu, vice director of the
Taipei City Urban Search and Rescue Team, both of whom were members of the
Sichuan team, will introduce the team's operation to seminar participants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Shih-jen, another executive of the Red Cross, will introduce the
operation of a medical care team sent by the Red Cross to Sichuan May 20-25.</P>
      <P>Li Wei-sen, deputy executive director of the National Science and Technology

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) has stepped up its protection of local
fishermen during a peak period of fishery disputes between Taiwan and Japan, CGA
officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Urging local fishermen not to enter controversial waters, the CGA said in a
press release that disputed fishing areas should be resolved through diplomatic
dialogue or fishery negotiations.</P>
      <P>The statement came after the administration received a report June 3 that a
Taiwanese fishing boat was allegedly monitored and interfered with by a Japanese
government boat in an overlapping area of Taiwan's and Japan's exclusive
economic zones off northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese boat later reportedly radioed nine other Taiwanese boats in an
attempt to surround the Japanese boat, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The CGA immediately dispatched a patrol vessel to the disputed area, the
statement went on.</P>
      <P>However, as it took the patrol vessel two hours to reach the area, the
administration also asked the Fishery Agency to help resolve the dispute through
negotiation, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The CGA also asked a fishery radio station in northeastern Taiwan to ask the
Taiwanese boats to exercise restraint, the statement said, adding that by the
time the CGA patrol vessel reached the area, the boats had already left.</P>
      <P>The administration said that most of the Taiwan-Japan fishery disputes arise
during the April-July period, when boats from the two countries converge to fish
for highly prized bluefin tuna.</P>
      <P>The administration said it had already followed its normal practice by
increasing the number of patrols behind the temporary enforcement line within
Taiwan's exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>The CGA handled 25 fishery disputes involving Taiwanese boats and Japanese
government boats in April and May, 17 of which were reported behind Taiwan's
temporary enforcement line while eight were beyond the line, the administration
continued.</P>
      <P>Last year, it handled 34 disputes involving 39 Taiwanese boats, the statement
said, adding that none of the Taiwanese boats that were operating behind
Taiwan's line were detained by the authorities of other countries.</P>

      <P>The number of detained illegal Chinese immigrants dropped to a record low of 38
Thursday following the repatriation of an 87-member batch from the outlying
island of Matsu earlier in the day, according to immigration officials.</P>
      <P>With the traditional Dragon Boat Festival just around the corner, officials from
the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said they have coordinated with the Red
Cross Society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to accelerate the repatriation
of illegal Chinese immigrants in time for the holiday, one of the most important
events on the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>Early Thursday morning, the 87 illegals, who had been held at various temporary
centers around the country as well as at the two main detention centers in Yilan
and Hsinchu counties were sent to Matsu for repatriation in accordance with the
Kinmen Agreement, the officials said, adding that a Chinese ferry then took them
back to China.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Chinese immigrants were happy to be going home
to spend the Dragon Boat Festival with their families. The festival falls on
Sunday this year.</P>
      <P>Following the latest repatriations, all eligible illgals have now been deported,
the officials said, adding that only 38 are still being held at the Yilan and
Hsinchu detention centers, a record low. All the 38 have judicial cases pending,

      <P>The number of detained illegal Chinese immigrants dropped to a record low of 38
Thursday following the repatriation of an 87-member batch from the outlying
island of Matsu earlier in the day, according to immigration officials.</P>
      <P>With the traditional Dragon Boat Festival just around the corner, officials from
the National Immigration Agency (NIA) said they have coordinated with the Red
Cross Society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to accelerate the repatriation
of illegal Chinese immigrants in time for the holiday, one of the most important
events on the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>Early Thursday morning, the 87 illegals, who had been held at various temporary
centers around the country as well as at the two main detention centers in Yilan
and Hsinchu counties were sent to Matsu for repatriation in accordance with the
Kinmen Agreement, the officials said, adding that a Chinese ferry then took them
back to China.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Chinese immigrants were happy to be going home
to spend the Dragon Boat Festival with their families. The festival falls on
Sunday this year.</P>
      <P>Following the latest repatriations, all eligible illgals have now been deported,
the officials said, adding that only 38 are still being held at the Yilan and
Hsinchu detention centers, a record low. All the 38 have judicial cases pending,
which is why they were not included in Thursday's repatriations, the official
added.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) will cooperate with other government
institutions and non-government organizations (NGOs) to upgrade the efficacy of
its anti-human trafficking efforts, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The NIA official made the remarks after the U.S. Department of State released an
annual report on trafficking in persons a day earlier, in which Taiwan was
placed for the second consecutive year on a list of "Tier 2" countries for human
trafficking, noting that Taiwan authorities do not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making significant efforts
to do so.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that prevention of human trafficking involves many complex
operations, the official said cross-department coordination as well as
assistance from NGOs and other private associations are necessary to effectively
combat trafficking in humans.</P>
      <P>To upgrade operational efficiency, the official said, the immigration law has
been updated to include a special chaper on prevention of human trafficking and
protection of those who have fallen victim to such criminal acttions.</P>
      <P>Starting this year, the official said the Executive Yuan will launch a three-
year project aimed at building shelters for victims of human trafficiking deals
and commissioning NGOs to help those victims.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed  Thursday  the country's  first
indigenous  Japanese encephalitis case of this year.</P>
      <P>The patient is a 25-year-old Yunlin County resident who is doing his military
service in Kaohsiung, said CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao.</P>
      <P>The victim was hospitalized May 10 after coming down with a high fever, fatigue
and convulsions, and was discharged June 2 after he recovered, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou advised the public to avoid pigsties and places where mosquitoes multiply,
such as paddy fields, to reduce the risk of contracting the mosquito-borne
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV).</P>
      <P>Japanese encephalitis is endemic in Asia, transmissible to humans via mosquitoes
that become infected by feeding on domestic pigs and wild birds infected with
the virus.</P>
      <P>The incubation period of the disease runs between five and 15 days. Mild
infections usually occur without apparent symptoms other than fever with
headache. In more severe infections, patients may experience quick onset,
headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors,
occasional convulsions and spastic paralysis.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the Japanese encephalitis season runs from May to October each year
and an outbreak usually peaks two to three weeks after the JEV antibody-positive
rate among pigs exceeds 50 percent, with the peak period running approximately
one month, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>From 2003 to 2007, a total of 158 Japanese encephalitis cases were recorded in
Taiwan, four of which were contracted overseas, according to CDC data.</P>
      <P>The government has since 1968 provided JEV inoculation to children, with the
first two shots given at 15 months, the third shot the next year, and the fourth
shot during the first year of elementary school.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mainland Affairs Council welcomes resumption of cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top charter of the country's China policy expressed welcome Friday to
the imminent resumption of institutionalized engagement between the two
intermediary bodies across the Taiwan Strait after a hiatus of nearly 10 years.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said the first meeting in 10
years between the Taipei-based quasi-official Straits Exchange  Foundation
(SEF)  and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) is slated to be held in Beijing June 11,  restarting  the
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS were founded in the early 1990s to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties. Regular dialogue, however, has been
suspended since 1999 after former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
defined cross-strait ties as "a special state-to-state relationship." Beijing
viewed Lee's remarks as a move to promote Taiwan independence and suspended SEF-
ARATS talks.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, private airline associations from the two sides have
been authorized by the SEF and ARATS to meet in Macau to talk about two-way air
links to meet ever-increasing demand for air transport across the strait,
particularly for holidays -- a practice known as the "Macau formula."</P>
      <P>Welcoming the resumption of the SEF-ARATS talks next week, officials from the
Presidential Office said they will mark the end of the "Macau formula" for
cross-strait talks and the beginning of SEF-ARATS dialogue.</P>
      <P>"In the future, officials from the two sides might appear at the SEF-ARATS
negotiating table if necessary," the officials predicted.</P>
      <P>Quasi-official cross-strait engagement has grown by leaps and bounds since the
new Kuomintang (KMT) -led administration came to office May 20 with President Ma
Ying-jeou vowing to improve relations with China in his inaugural speech.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's meeting with Chinese President and Communist Party
of China General Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing May 28 also helped facilitate
the resumption of the SEF-ARATS talks.</P>
      <P>An agreement to resume talks was reached May 29 after the SEF received a letter
from ARATS in which ARATS agreed to restart cross-strait negotiations on the
basis of the so-called "1992 consensus" and invited SEF officials to visit
Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth could reach 4.8 percent for this year if the
legislature passes a Cabinet-proposed supplementary budget and special budget
amendment to provide extra funds for public infrastructure projects and price
stabilization initiatives, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the legislature, Liu said the stimulus provided by the supplementary
budget of NT$45.5 billion (US$1.5 billion) and an additional NT$68.3 billion to
fund the government's special budgets, coupled with a boost from the planned
launch of cross-Taiwan Strait weekend charter flights and the opening of Taiwan
to Chinese tourists, could raise Taiwan's economic growth by 0.45 percent to
achieve the government's target of 4.8 percent for 2008.</P>
      <P>Liu said that at a time of slowing global economic growth and high inflation,
the extra funds for public infrastructure development and price stabilization
are needed to give the economy a boost and lessen the impact of rising prices on
the public.</P>
      <P>The premier said that if the supplementary budget and special budget amendment
are passed, NT$103.4 billion of the funds will go toward public infrastructure
development, including assistance to local governments to carry out
infrastructure upgrading and pay off their loans, and money to finance the
central government's major national construction projects.</P>
      <P>The remaining NT$12.6 billion will go toward price stabilization initiatives,
Chao said, including measures to limit fuel and electricity  hikes,  increase
food  supplies,  promote  energy conservation, maintain the competitiveness of
Taiwan's industrial sector and assist disadvantaged groups, in order to lessen
the impact of high inflation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has passed a draft of energy policy guidelines that increases the
country's energy research budget for the next four years from NT$5 billion
(US$16.45 million) per year to NT$10 billion, Government Information Office
Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The guideline draft makes energy saving, environmental protection and economic
development as three objectives for Taiwan, highlighting "clean energy" and
"energy saving" as directions for future energy policies, said Shih.</P>
      <P>The guidelines will be the reference for each department under the Executive
Yuan  for crafting  measures  for environmental protection. The measures will be
sent to the Cabinet for revision before being delivered to the Legislative Yuan
for approval, Shih continued.</P>
      <P>In promotion of "clean energy," the draft says the country should exploit
carbonless renewable energy that uses natural resources such as sunlight, wind,
rain, tides and geothermal heat.</P>
      <P>Renewable energy should account for 8 percent of electricity generated by 2025,
with nuclear energy being an option. The draft also says low-carbon natural gas
should account for 25 percent of power generation by the same date.</P>
      <P>Governments and schools are encouraged to have negative growth rates in
electricity and fuel consumption in the coming years, with accumulated reduction
of energy consumption projected at 7 percent of current consumption by 2015, the
draft says.</P>
      <P>Related regulations will be amended, with the goal of making Taiwan "carbon
neutral" -- obtaining carbon offsets to balance greenhouse gas emissions
produced -- according to the draft.</P>
      <P>It also regulates that funds for carbon reduction should be set up and that
forest planting should be carried out to increase carbon reduction in order to
gain higher quotas of carbon credits.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) launched a research institute of textile
industry in Douliou, Yunlin County, southern Taiwan Friday in a bid to help the
traditional business of the area reach NT$70 billion (US$2.3 billion) in annual
revenue.</P>
      <P>Facing low-cost competition from Chinese and Southeast Asian makers, Taiwan's
textile industry has gradually lost its edge, with export revenues falling to an
annual US$10 billion in recent years, down from US$16.3 billion in the early
1990s, according to MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>"This 6,000-ping  research institute will help upgrade the industry
competitiveness of 2,800 textile manufacturers in central and southern Taiwan,"
Wu Ming-Ji, deputy director-general of the MOEA's Department of Industrial
Technology, said in a statement issued via his office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Yunlin institute is the first branch of the Taiwan Textile Research
Institute (TTRI) , which is directed and sponsored by the department.</P>
      <P>Wu said that in its first year, the research lab will focus on four areas --
helping local textile businesses to form industry clusters and strategic
alliances,  developing new environmental protection technologies, creating new
techniques to refine textile surfaces and providing other technical support.</P>
      <P>The department estimated that the institute, by coordinating with the Free Port
Zone in the area, could help textile makers in central and southern Taiwan to
generate NT$70 billion in business income per year.</P>
      <P>"These efforts will create new value for southern Taiwan's textile industry,  in
addition to generating enormous business opportunities," Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Celia Chiang, an official of the institute, told CNA by phone from Douliou that
the research projects will target product differentiation.</P>
      <P>"To help move the industry away from the low-cost market, Taiwan's textile
manufacturing will feature more industrial-use products and functional textiles,
" she said, adding that 40 textile companies and organizations signed an
agreement at the Friday launch to cooperate on product development,  manpower
incubation  and technology transfer.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the TTRI Yunlin branch will offer these companies the industry
information they need in order to explore their market potential," Chiang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tap water quality in Taipei City better than bottled water: CF</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quality of tap water in Taipei City is better than the bottled water sold in
stores or hypermarkets, the Consumers'  Foundation  Chinese  Taipei (CFCT)
claimed Friday, suggesting that the public consume more tap water as it is not
only cheaper but also healthier.</P>
      <P>According to the CFCT, based on the results of recent tests on water, samples of
tap water collected from 12 districts in Taipei City all meet the standards of
drinking water quality, including pH and electronic conductivity, as well as
ammonia, nitrite nitrogen, calcium, magnesium and sodium levels.</P>
      <P>"The quality of tap water is good and stable with ideal pH... it is safe for
people to drink tap water in Taipei, " said Gaston Wu, a chemistry professor at
National Taiwan Normal University,  who conducted the tests in cooperation with
the CFCT.</P>
      <P>Wu, however, went on to reveal that two of the 16 bottled water samples tested
were below standards in terms of either indication or packing, while two samples
had lower conductivity than tap water.</P>
      <P>"Another sample of bottled water was found to contain unsafe levels of ammonia
nitrogen, an indication of contamination," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Tap water costs NT$ 0.013 per litre, as opposed to bottled water, which costs
anything from NT$5 to NT$110 per liter, said Hsieh Tien-jen, vice chairman of
the CFCT.</P>
      <P>Consumption of bottled water increases carbon dioxide emissions as the bottles
are made of plastic and some water is imported, Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>"Cheaper tap water is not necessarily worse... and tap water is more
environmentally friendly," he added.</P>
      <P>CFCT Chairman Cheng Jen-hung, however, warned the public to pay attention to
their rooftop water tanks, saying that many of them are cleaned with chemicals
that degrade the quality of the drinking water and are harmful to the health.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Wu further promised to conduct tests on water in other counties
and cities around Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has decided to withdraw from the upcoming 2008 Taipei
International Dragon Boat Championships to show his concern for flood-affected
residents of central and southern Taiwan, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-
chi said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma was originally scheduled to have led a team of officials from the
Presidential Office in competing in the three-day event set to begin that day at
the Dajia Riverside Park as part of a series of activities to celebrate Dragon
Boat Festival, which falls on June 8 this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Ma made the decision to show his solidarity with residents of
central and southern Taiwan, which has been hit hard by flooding caused by heavy
rain over the past several days.</P>
      <P>Ma has also not ruled out the possibility of making an inspection visit to the
disaster areas if the situation worsens, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Ma's decision to withdraw from the dragon boat race had nothing to do with
security concerns, Wang went on, pointing out that adequate security measures
had been worked out in advance to deal with the president's participation in the
event.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Ma has been closely monitoring developments related to the
flooding in central and southern Taiwan and has been in constant contact with

    <HEADLINE>'Mini three links' to be expanded in two weeks: Premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
06/06/08  15:24:12
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that the scope of the "mini three links"
will be expanded within two weeks to benefit more travelers from Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refer to direct shipping and trade links maintained
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian province ports of
Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Quanzhou in Fujian was also added to the links in 2006 while Taiwan's Penghu
Islands was added in April 2007.</P>
      <P>At present, only residents with household registrations on Kinmen and Matsu,
China-based Taiwanese businessmen and groups involved in cultural, sports,
religious and economic exchanges are allowed to use the "mini links" to travel
to China.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Liu said such restrictions will be
lifted within two weeks so that all residents of Taiwan proper could choose to
travel to China via Kinmen or Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>Liu made the promise in response to a question raised by independent Legislator
Chen Fu-hai, who expressed concern that the imminent opening of direct cross-
strait weekend charter flight services and the entry of Chinese tourists into
Taiwan, targeted to begin on July 4, will have a major, adverse impact on the
"mini links" operations.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that the administration consider allowing Chinese citizens
from Fujian to enter Kinmen -- but not Taiwan -- with landing visas as a
"contingency policy to meet emergency needs" and compensate declines in tourist
numbers once direct charter flights between China and Taiwan are established.</P>
      <P>The premier answered that this part of the plan might need further discussion
within the administration.</P>
      <P>The mini-three-links were initiated in January 2001 by Taiwan to help offset the
lack of direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait and bolster
economic growth for the two islands that are located just kilometers off China's
southeastern coast.</P>

in the central county gathered at Nantou County Hall Friday to sign a 10-point
declaration on reducing carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>The local government chiefs made the move one day after the Executive Yuan
unveiled new energy-saving  guidelines  and the Presidential Office signed a
carbon-reduction declaration on World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Nantou county government has already implemented a variety of
water- and energy-saving measures that have proven effective in reducing the
government's monthly utility bills.</P>
      <P>Some of the new measures to reduce carbon emissions will include working to
create a paperless environment in government offices, setting up bicycle parking
areas in the basements of government buildings to entice more staff to pedal to
work, working to cut down on the number of government vehicle trips, and
encouraging government workers who live far from their place of work to use
public transport, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Other measures will include setting up rainwater recycling systems at government
offices, turning off some elevators and restricting elevator rides to three
floors or more, and setting air-conditioners at 27 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Lee said some of these measures have already been adopted at certain offices and
have proven effective, noting for example that rainwater recycling has saved the
government up to NT$200,000 (US$6,600)  per  month  on  water  bills,  while
restricting air-conditioner use has resulted in significantly lower electricity
bills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Incoming ROC rep to U.S. on green card waiting list: DPP lawmaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/08  16:06:24
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker demanded that a
background check be done on Taiwan's next representative to the United States,
Jason Yuan, who reportedly applied for U.S. permanent residence in 2004 and is
currently on a green card waiting list.</P>
      <P>Questioning Yuan's allegiance, Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs should immediately request the Ministry of Justice to help with
the investigation.</P>
      <P>According to regulations published by the Ministry of Civil Service, background
checks are required for civil servants in charge of security affairs or affairs
involving major interests of the country.</P>
      <P>One type of persons targeted by the regulations are individuals who are
"residing overseas and have become eligible for citizenship of the country of
residence," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Yuan has served as the Kuomintang's and People First Party's representative to
the United States since 2004.</P>
      <P>Before retiring from the foreign service in 2003, Yuan had served as the
Republic of China ambassador to Panama, director-general of the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Office in Los Angeles, and chief of the Congressional Liaison
Division at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The green card issue has drawn much attention in Taiwan recently after Minister
of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou admitted that he obtained U.S. permanent
resident status in 2005 when he was the ROC ambassador to Guatemala, and only
renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>Although there is no law forbidding diplomatic officials from holding permanent
resident status of a foreign country, opposition politicians nevertheless argued
that holding or applying for a green card calls their allegiance to the country
into question.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Kuan disagreed with GIO Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih's view that
the green card is a "travel document" and does not necessarily have any
connection to the allegiance of the holders.</P>
      <P>Kuan noted that green card holders are entitled to certain rights and
obligations in the United States, including paying federal and local taxes and
enjoying voting rights in specific elections in some states.</P>
      <P>"How would this not involve the allegiance issue? How could it be that the green
card is only a travel document?" Kuan asked.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Food prices are unlikely to stop their persistent rise in the near future,
although prices of some food items have declined recently, officials of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS statistics, Taiwan's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for May rose
3.71 percent over the same month last year, due largely to a significant hike in
food prices.</P>
      <P>Among food products, the price of meat increased the most at 18.22 percent,
followed by those of grains at 12.93 percent and aquatic products at 12.28
percent. Vegetable and fruit prices, on the other hand, declined slightly by
0.92 percent and 0.72 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Food products that have skyrocketed over the past year include bananas, up 160.4
percent year-on-year, and papayas, which were 67.11 percent higher than in May
2007.</P>
      <P>Prices of the widely consumed fish tilapia were up 35.54 percent due to hikes in
feed prices, while eggs rose 24.13 and adult milk powder increased by 24.14
percent due largely to a drop in production of fresh milk in Australia because
of drought.</P>
      <P>In addition, prices of western style breakfasts increased 15.47 percent, those
of Chinese noodles were up 13.66 percent, and rice and bread prices rose 11.43
percent and 11.16 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>There were some items, however, whose prices fell dramatically in May on a year-
on-year basis. The prices of garlic were down 27.76 percent, while the prices of
potatoes and watermelons fell 22.05 percent and 20.53 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The costs of tomatoes, peaches, oranges and guavas all declined by between 17.95
percent and 19.56 percent.</P>
      <P>From January to May, Taiwan's food prices registered an average growth of 8.6
percent compared to the 21.2 percent hike registered in China for the first four
months, 10.3 percent in Hong Kong, 7.2 percent in Singapore, 4.7 percent in the
United States, 2.7 percent in South Korea and 1.3 percent in Japan.</P>
      <P>The statistics also showed that the import price index factored in U.S. dollars
increased 23.99 percent in May over the same month last year, the largest
monthly hike since July 1980.</P>
      <P>Import prices calculated in Taiwan dollars, however, rose a considerably  less
14.02 percent year-on-year  because  of the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar
against the U.S. greenback.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Wholesale Price Index for May rose 2.62 percent compared to
April, due mainly to rises in the prices of basic metals, chemicals, petroleum
and coal, according to the statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NGO urges government to step up anti-human trafficking efforts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/08  16:45:38
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In response to a human trafficking report released by the United States,  a
Taipei-based  non-government organization urged the government Friday to upgrade
the efficacy of its anti-human trafficking efforts.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 (TIP 2008) released Wednesday by the U.S.
Department of State places Taiwan on a list of "Tier 2" countries for human
trafficking, the same level it held last year.</P>
      <P>It describes Taiwan as a destination for men, women and children trafficked for
the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. Taiwan is also a source of
women trafficked to Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and the U.S., according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The Anti-Human Trafficking Association, founded in 2007 by 11 NGOs, said in a
news conference Friday that the report indicates that there is still a lot to be
done by the Taiwanese government to prevent human trafficking and to protect the
rights of the victims.</P>
      <P>It made  four recommendations:  to pass  and implement  a comprehensive anti-
trafficking law as soon as possible; to apply the Labor Standards Law to foreign
workers employed as private nursing caregivers or domestic helpers, who are
especially vulnerable to labor exploitation; to strengthen communication among
government agencies and enhance international cooperation; and to collaborate
with local NGOs.</P>
      <P>"To combat sex and labor exploitation, we strongly urge the government to
prioritize the passage of the anti-human trafficking law, " said Sandy Yeh,
president of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation -- one of the organizers of
the Anti-Human Trafficking Association.</P>
      <P>She noted that although Taiwan has formal victim identification procedures and
provides training in these procedures, immigration officers, police, prosecutors
and other law enforcement authorities still often classify victims of human
trafficking  as illegal immigrants or runaway foreign workers with illegal
laborer status, and consequently many trafficking victims are detained,
prosecuted, fined or jailed, and ultimately deported.</P>
      <P>"In order to help the trafficking victims and bring the human traffickers to
justice, we have to identify victims using a broad definition  and  increase
penalties  for  human  trafficking significantly," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The TIP 2008 report says that the majority of victims are treated simply as
illegal immigrants or illegal laborers and housed in formal, long-term detention
facilities that are sometimes plagued by overcrowding and poor sanitation.</P>
      <P>Regina Fuchs, a German sociologist working in Taiwan, said it is precisely the
exploitation, the failure to enforce laws protecting the rights of workers and
the restricted mobility of legal laborers that has caused the notorious increase
in the number of runaways and illegal workers in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Justice delayed is justice denied, " she said. "The government must take
immediate steps to confront and resolve these issues."</P>
      <P>Lee Li-feng, secretary-general of the End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography
and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes Taiwan (ECPAT Taiwan) , said the
TIP 2008 report points out for the first  time  the problem  that  even  though
Taiwan  has an extraterritorial  law criminalizing  the sexual exploitation of
children by Taiwanese traveling abroad, it did not take other steps during the
reporting year to reduce demand for child sex tourism.</P>
      <P>"The government, especially the Tourism Bureau, should step up its campaign of
public service announcements to combat child sex trafficking and tourism, "she
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou took the lead in signing a carbon-reduction declaration
to lower greenhouse gas emissions during an event promoting energy efficiency
held at the Presidential Office Thursday to mark World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the event, Ma displayed a handkerchief and a pair of reusable
chopsticks he brought along to encourage others to get into the habit of
conserving energy and helping improve the environment.</P>
      <P>One way to save energy,  Ma suggested,  was to keep air conditioners turned off.
He said the air conditioners at his home are seldom turned on, and used only one
to two weeks during the summer at the most.</P>
      <P>He added that if the weather is really hot, his family members usually use
electric fans as an alternative because they consume less energy.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he was trained by his parents to always turn off lights when not in
use.</P>
      <P>The president also promoted the concept of using locally produced food
ingredients, saying that at his suggestion, all the dishes served at the state
banquet celebrating his inauguration held in Kaohsiung May 20 were procured
locally or from the adjacent county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Ma said his wife, Chow Mei-ching, rarely prepares more food at home than they
normally eat so as to reduce kitchen waste.</P>
      <P>Noting that around 98 percent of Taiwan's energy is imported, Ma said that "if
everybody does a little, a lot can be accomplished in energy conservation, and
we can expect a better life in the future."</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew and Presidential Secretary General Chan Chuen-poh
also signed the document pledging to help cut back on carbon emissions along
with all staff members in the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The declaration states various 10 ways to cut carbon dioxide emissions and
enhance energy conservation, including promoting casual wear, opening windows to
bring in cool air, turning off lights when leaving an area, keeping appliances
unplugged when not in use, cutting the use of private vehicles, walking more for
fitness, buying more locally produced goods, never ordering more food than you
can finish, shunning products with excessive packaging, and carrying reusable
food utensils and shopping bags as well as hankies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of farmers from central and southern Taiwan gathered outside the
Legislative Yuan Friday to protest recent hikes in fertilizer prices, warning
that they will stage a larger demonstration if the government fails to respond
to their requests.</P>
      <P>The group of farmers from Changhua, Tainan and Pingtung counties accused the
government of destroying their livelihoods with the decision to adjust
fertilizer prices higher.</P>
      <P>The farmers also displayed slogans urging President Ma Ying-jeou and the
Executive Yuan to apologize for the hikes -- marking the first public
demonstration  against  the government  since the Kuomintang (KMT)
administration assumed office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lu Tung-shieh, head of a farmers' rights group from Pingtung County, demanded
the government fully subsidize all fertilizer price increases for farmers and
pledge that there will be no fresh hikes this year.</P>
      <P>A 40-kilogram sack of urea is now priced at NT$510 (US$17) , up from the
previous level of about NT$350, he said.</P>
      <P>Lu also asked the government to tighten its crackdown on fertilizer  hoarding
and price manipulation  and increase the guaranteed prices paid for local
farmers' crops.</P>
      <P>"If the government fails to adequately respond to our requests, we might stage
another larger demonstration," Lu warned.</P>
      <P>Several opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers, including Ker
Chien-ming, Lai Ching-te and Yeh Yi-jin, were present to lend their support to
the farmers.</P>
      <P>DPP social development department director Shen Fa-hui, on behalf of DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, also extended his sympathy and concerns to the farmers.</P>
      <P>Ker contended that farmers can no longer sustain themselves after heavy rains in
central and southern Taiwan destroyed vegetable and fruit crops that were
waiting to be harvested.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) agreed immediately to at least one of the
protesters demands.</P>
      <P>"There will be no fresh increases in fertilizer prices in the coming seven
months, " COA Minister Chen Wu-hsing said Friday, in reiterating an earlier
promise.</P>
      <P>He insisted that Taiwan's fertilizer prices remained the lowest around the world
despite the recent adjustment.</P>
      <P>International  bulk urea prices  on the spot market  were approximately US$650
per ton at the end of May and even higher in southeast Asia,  according to the
Market,  a daily fertilizer newsletter produced in London. That translates to a
cost of at least NT$780 per 40-kg. bag.</P>
      <P>The price for urea, made from ammonia derived from coal or other hydrocarbons,
has soared along with prices for energy-related raw materials.</P>
      <P>Chen announced May 28 that from May 30, prices of fertilizer produced by Taiwan
Fertilizer Co. would rise by between 33 percent and 70 percent to reflect rising
raw material prices in the global market.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has listed nuclear energy as an option of carbon-free energy in a
set of draft guidelines for the government's future energy policies, Government
Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said Frdiday.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said on the same day that the
construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant should be completed as soon
as possible in order to meet the government's policy of increasing the
percentage of carbon-free  energy in electricity generation.</P>
      <P>Liu also said departments of the Executive Yuan should work together to find a
proper place to store nuclear waste in the future.</P>
      <P>Yeh Huei-ching, chief of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Bureau of Energy,
said the plant's construction, which is expected to be finished in July 2009, is
a little behind schedule.</P>
      <P>The previous government administration had postponed construction of Nuclear
Power Plant No. 4 for four months during 2001-2002 due to a dispute over whether
it was wise for Taiwan to build another nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has three nuclear power plants in operation, with two located in Taipei
County in northern Taiwan and one in Pingtung County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A total of 97,672 barrels of low-radioactive waste produced at the three plants
before 1996 were stored in 23 trenches on Taiwan's outlying island of Lanyu,
which is also known as Orchid Island.</P>
      <P>The storage site began operating in May 1982, but stopped accepting additional
nuclear waste in April 1996 because of protests by local residents. Nuclear
waste produced after 1996 are currently stored at each of the nuclear power
plants.</P>
      <P>According to Minister Shih, as part of the draft guidelines passed Thursday, the
departments of the Executive Yuan are supposed to craft measures for
environmental protection. The measures will be sent to the Cabinet for revision
before being delivered to the Legislative Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>The draft says Taiwan should increase energy efficiency by 2 percent per year in
the next eight years, and decrease energy intensity  --a unit of energy
consumption  per gross domestic product--by at least 20 percent of the 2005
level in 2015, with the ultimate goal being a 50 percent reduction of the 2005
level in 2025.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the draft also says national carbon dioxide emission should
be reduced to the level of 2008 sometime during 2016-2020, and reach the level
of 2000 in 2025.</P>
      <P>That means Taiwan's emissions must be controlled at 214 million metric tons as
that recorded in 2000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials suggested Friday that people use diluted household bleaching
agentst to keep their homes clean and combat the threat of enterovirus, instead
of ethanol-based products that do not kill the potentially lethal infant virus.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Toayuan County Public Health Bureau suggested using bleach to
keep their children safe because of statistics showing that 70 percent of
patients affected by the flu-like disease this year were infants and toddlers.</P>
      <P>The officials believed that the victims did not catch the disease in
kindergartens because they are all pre-schoolers, and therefore could have been
infected after coming into contact with their parents, other adult relatives or
older children at home.</P>
      <P>According to the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC's) statistics on enterovirus
outbreaks in Taiwan in 2008, there were 136 confirmed serious cases reported as
of June 3, of which four have died.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that 133 of the patients contracted Enterovirus Type 71 (EV 71)
-- a fatal strain that has spread to Taiwan from other Southeast Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>In comparison, there were 10 cases recorded in the same period in 2007, with one
death, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>Major enterovirus outbreaks occur roughly once every 10 years in Taiwan, and CDC
has warned that 2008 could be part of that cycle.</P>
      <P>Since ethyl alcohol can't kill the virus, officials in the northern county
suggested adding 20 milliliters of household bleach containing chlorine to 5
liters of tap water as a disinfectant when housecleaning.</P>
      <P>The handy disinfectant can be applied to objects that young children often
touch, such as door handles, tables, chairs, toys and books, to decrease their
risk of contracting the virus.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is a common cause of diseases such as meningitis and miocarditis.
The flu-like illness is usually contracted through direct contact with
contaminated sources.</P>
      <P>The virus enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, where it thrives,
and can move on to attack the nervous system. Children are more susceptible to
the infection than healthy adults.</P>
      <P>No vaccine  is available  to curb the virus and frequent hand-washing is still
the most effective way to prevent infection.</P>

      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching will decide for herself whether to lead Taiwan's team
to the 2008 Beijing Paralympic Games in September, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office will respect Chow's decision on the matter," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to suggestions by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
that Chow serve as the leader of Taiwan's team to the event, which will be held
Sept. 6-17 in the Chinese capital after the Summer Olympics.</P>
      <P>"Chow is definitely the best person to head the Taiwan team, " Wang Jin-pyng
said, noting she would be helping a charity event and caring for people with
disabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chow's presence at the international gala would help boost Taiwan's
profile, Wang Jin-pyng said.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker said he had suggested the idea to President Ma Ying-jeou
and provided him with related information.</P>
      <P>The president said that he would make an assessment, according to Wang Jin-pyng,
although he has yet to receive further information.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker noted that wheelchair-bound former first lady Wu Shu-jen
led Taiwan's team to the previous Paralympics in Athens, Greece in 2004.</P>
      <P>Wang Jin-pyng reportedly was first approached by the Chinese Taipei Paralympic
Committee  to lead the delegation  but had reservations  over accepting the
offer.</P>
      <P>He said he told the committee that if Chow couldn't lead the team, Legislative
Yuan Deputy Speaker Tseng Yung-chuan would handle the role, and the committee
agreed.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker was speaking on the sidelines of a cross-strait forum
sponsored by the Center for Global Peace and Strategic Studies of the National
Chung Hsing University in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chow, who recently quit her job at Mega International Commercial Bank where she
had served for 27 years, has agreed to serve as the head of a cultural and
educational foundation under a Mega-affiliated bank.</P>
      <P>She also accepted the offer to serve as honorary chairwoman of the Red Cross
Society of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday at the legislature that if Chow intends to
lead Taiwan's team, the Executive Yuan would give her the green light.</P>
      <P>Liu was responding to questions from Legislator Lu Shiow-yen of the ruling
Kuomintang on whether the Executive Yuan would have a different opinion on a
visit by Chow to China.</P>
      <P>Lu also asked in what capacity Chow -- who is both the first lady and closely
associated with a charity organization -- would attend the event and how it
could maintain parity and dignity.</P>
      <P>"All who travel to China to take part in activities have to follow set
regulations, and we'll study the protocol and needs of the first lady if
necessary," he answered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Majority of people support paid maternity leave: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of Taiwan citizens support the notion of paid maternity leave as part
of a government policy to boost the birth rate, government officials said
Friday, citing the results of a recent public opinion poll.</P>
      <P>Sixty-three percent of the people responding to the poll said they support the
Kuomintang administration's plans to introduce a partially paid maternity leave
for women, said officials from the Cabinet-level Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>Fifty-seven  percent said the maternity  subsidy plan will definitely help spur
childbirth, reverse the decline in Taiwan's birth rate, and raise the quality of
child care, the officials said.</P>
      <P>However, they noted, 71 percent of the respondents think that the childbirth
subsidy plan will cause problems in the local workforce. These issues may lead
industrial and business operators to retaliate, which in turn may cause female
workers to lose their jobs or encounter more difficulties in finding employment,
they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the same poll also found that 72 percent of the respondents  favor
the administration's  plan to introduce  a preferential mortgage loan program
aimed at reducing the financial burden on young people buying homes.</P>
      <P>Sixty-eight percent said the government-subsidized home loan plan will help to
encourage more young people to get married. The loans will be offered interest-
free during the first two years after the marriage of young couples seeking to
buy their first homes and to those seeking to upgrade to bigger houses after
they have had children.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll, conducted June 3-4, , received 1,086 valid responses. It has
a margin of error of 2.97 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Both the maternity subsidy plan and the subsidized home loan plan were part of
President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises and part of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's
economic stimulus plan publicized May 30.</P>
      <P>These two plans, however, are not likely to be implemented next year since they
were not included in the 2009 general budget plan, which the Executive Yuan will
forward to the Legislature in August for approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung-based Mormon missionaries on bicycles  traveled throughout  the central
Taiwan city Friday, distributing some 2,000 zongzi to the needy on the eve of
the Dragon Boat Festival, which falls on June 8 this year.</P>
      <P>Michael Hoer, who serves as mission president of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints' Taiwan Taichung Mission, said in standard Mandarin that about
150 missionaries from the church had planned to prepare some 1,000 zongzi the
day before for distribution Friday, but it turned out that 2,000 zongzi were
made, thanks to the donations of rice, pork and other ingredients by local
residents and Taichung-based companies.</P>
      <P>"Our cups were running over with love, " Hoer said. "I hope that the
missionaries' services to God and to the people will spread wider and farther
via the traditional Chinese delicacy of zongzi."</P>
      <P>Zongzi, a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice dumpling with various savory fillings,
is usually cooked in bamboo leaves and is especially popular around the time of
the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu joined Hoer, the Mormon missionaries and representatives
of other organizations at a zongzi-donation ceremony at the Taichung City
Assembly.</P>
      <P>"The zongzi represents a token of compassion for the needy, particularly at a
time of soaring inflation," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu said he often sees the Mormon missionaries riding throughout the city on
their bicycles, spreading the gospel and doing volunteer work.</P>
      <P>"They were even kind enough to offer their advice to the city government when
they found that some English road signs were incorrect," the mayor related.</P>
      <P>At Hu's encouragement, dozens of missionaries serving in Taichung now take note
of any unusual English translations on signs, as they go about their routine
work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said Liu Chin-piao, owner of the internationally renowned bike
maker Giant, has agreed to donate some bicycles to the missionaries as a token
of appreciation to the Mormons for the compassion they have shown the Taiwanese
people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>50% bedroom accessories fail to meet safety standards: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifty percent of bedroom accessories in Taiwan's market are unsafe, while 32
percent fail to specify the actual fiber mixture ratio, a survey conducted by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has found.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection randomly inspected  22
bedroom accessories  including  pillow cases and bedspreads, made in China,
Taiwan, Bangladesh, Thailand, India, and Pakistan, to protect the safety of
consumers.</P>
      <P>"Half of the samples were found unsafe because they contained migratable
fluorescent substances, which could cause skin allergies," Wang Cheng-huei, the
bureau's deputy director said at a news conference Friday presenting the
survey's results.</P>
      <P>Explaining the potential harm of the substances, Wang cited a recent case in
Japan where toddlers developed eczema caused by T-shirts for babies containing
the migratable fluorescent substances, which he described as a kind of synthetic
pigment.</P>
      <P>Wang said another seven samples were found to have inaccurate information on the
fiber mixture ratio.</P>
      <P>"These products failed to meet national standards because the ratios between
cotton and artificial  fibers were incorrectly labeled," the deputy director
said.</P>
      <P>Only 10 out of the 22 samples met all the safety standards, Wang said, adding
that the makers or suppliers of the other 12 items will be ordered to recall and
destroy their sub-standard accessories.</P>
      <P>The survey did find improvement in one specific area as no formaldehyde was
discovered in any of the samples, which Wang said was an indication that the
bureau's persistent efforts had paid off.</P>
      <P>"We found a total of seven samples containing formaldehyde in the previously-
conducted  surveys on bedroom accessories last July, August, September, October
and this March, " he said, attributing the push by manufacturers and suppliers
to improve their quality to the bureau's constant inspections.</P>
      <P>Formaldehyde, if absorbed into the human body, could pose health risks such as
cancer, Wang said. "Consumers can determine with their nose if the product is
contaminated with the chemical compound, which has a strong smell."</P>
      <P>Wang advised consumers to make sure products are clearly labeled before
purchasing them.</P>
      <P>"Products including a warranty will also be a plus because it offers legal
backup when requesting compensation," he said.</P>
      <P>To eliminate other infectious substances on bedroom accessories, Wang suggested
that users expose the products to the sunlight.</P>
      <P>"A variety of viruses, such as the enterovirus, can be killed when exposed to
the sun," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government will investigate the cause of Thursday's flooding
in the southern city to determine who is responsible, Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen
Chu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Thursday's torrential rains in central and southern Taiwan left a flood problem
in many places in Kaohsiung City, with some low-lying areas submerged in knee-
high rainwater for hours.</P>
      <P>Citizens complained that a concrete wall built by the city government for
dredging at Lotus Lake, the city's famous scenic spot, blocked the drainage
facilities and turned out to be the major cause of the flooding.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government's Public Works Bureau and related authorities will
investigate the reason for the flooding, and if the investigation shows the
cause was the concrete wall, the construction company that built it and the city
government will take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen also said Thursday's rains served as an assessment of the city's flood
prevention and drainage systems. The city government will make improvements to
the shortfalls revealed by the recent flooding, she said.</P>
      <P>Public Works Bureau Chief Wu Hung-mou said the bureau will investigate the
dredging project with experts at the Kaohsiung Civil Engineers Association to
understand the truth, but he also said precipitation in Thursday's torrential
rainfall is beyond the capacity of the city's drainage system.</P>
      <P>The city had about 240 millimeter of rainfall Thursday, with the maximum one-
hour precipitation reaching 90 millimeters, while the drainage system's dispatch
limit is set at 79 millimeters per hour, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Under normal conditions, flooding and inundation will go away gradually as the
rainfall becomes lighter and stops, as Thursday's situation showed, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>The 2nd Season Residency Artist Group Show kicks off</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Artist Village (TAV) , a non- governmental  artistic  community  run
by the Taipei  Cultural Foundation, launched the 2nd Season Residency Artist
Group Show Friday, inviting local and international artists to exhibit in the
multi-cultural activity.</P>
      <P>At the press preview and opening reception, Charlene Shih, a Taiwanese artist
and documentary film director, said she would deviate this year from the more
conventional style of expressing her thoughts through a documentary's people and
their stories.</P>
      <P>Instead, Shih has attempted a more experimental approach to "documenting" real
life, no longer acting as a director shooting a documentary but rather becoming
an actual observer who does not speak, ask questions or intervene in the story.</P>
      <P>By using  different  approaches,  she deconstructs  a pure "documented video"
and presents it in the purest way, showing different angles of the documenting
process in her installation artwork created for this year's show.</P>
      <P>Her shadow, however, can be detected in every corner where her chosen materials,
selected characters,  unfiltered  sounds and unpolished texts are all displayed
individually in parallel.</P>
      <P>"In the process, I found out that no matter how hard I tried, I'm still  in the
work,  " she said.  "That's  why it's  called 'Intervention.'"</P>
      <P>"By taking all the elements apart, I want the audience to feel it instead of
sitting in the theater watching what I would say as a director, " she said as
she stood in the middle of her installation artwork -- a living room with a
sofa, drawings, digital frames and a television that showed the interviews she
did with women from southeast  Asian countries  who were sold to Taiwan by human
traffickers.</P>
      <P>"This work is not so much directly about the content of the documentary but more
about what a documentary is about, " she said. "Once the audience comes into the
environment, immediately they become part of the work."</P>
      <P>German visual artists Angelika Middendorf and Andreas Schimanski chose Taipei to
be the fourth city -- after Berlin, Toronto and Yetaterinburg -- in which to
develop their project "25sec., "a video portrait of art and cultural mediators
who give 25-second statements outlining their professional goals.</P>
      <P>Having invited a cross-section of individuals from diverse levels of
institutional and independent art contexts, the German artists film the
participants, who have the option of supporting their statement with an object
that provides a link to their discourse and context.</P>
      <P>Schimanski said part of the concept of the 25sec. project is to build a
"network" among artists and their works. The very same idea was presented in his
paintings of geometric lines that symbolize the "network architecture."</P>
      <P>Middendorf, who set up several cylinder-shaped objects on the ground, said these
objects are called "Pop, " an acronym of three German words -- point, place and
position.</P>
      <P>She added that although they are of different sizes, the fact that they all have
the same height represents a non-hierarchal system.</P>
      <P>Right next to the "Pops, " three potted plants were installed to add a little
touch of local taste to their work, Middendorf said, as the first thing these
Germen artists noticed when they arrived in Taiwan were the potted plants used
to adorn the environment in places such as the airport, MRT stations and lobbies
of buildings.</P>
      <P>"This is a meeting point of our background and your culture, " she said.</P>
      <P>The 2nd Season Residency Artists Group Show is open from June 6-22 at the TAV,
which brings an international flavor to Taipei's already cosmopolitan art scene.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung urged domestic wholesalers  Thursday to reduce
commodity prices,  as commodity prices on international markets have declined
recently.</P>
      <P>Domestic fuel prices are also likely to drop in July as international crude
prices have fallen slightly recently, Chiu said while presiding over a seminar
on government agencies' mid-term administrative plans.</P>
      <P>Two conclusions were reached at a meeting held earlier in the day to map out
measures to stabilize domestic food prices ahead of the Dragon Boat Festival,
which falls on June 8 this year, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>One of them is that the government  will press  domestic wholesalers to quickly
reflect declining international commodity prices, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>The other is that better weather and the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture's
efforts to coordinate vegetable supplies will stabilize and even lower domestic
vegetable prices, which have been on the rise after supplies fell due to heavy
rainfall in vegetable growing centers in central and southern Taiwan, Chiu
added.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Consumer Protection Commission, Chiu said, has asked
shopping malls around the country to refrain from driving up prices by hoarding
daily necessities related to the Dragon Boat Festival.</P>
      <P>Six major shopping mall chains will establish low-price commodity sections after
the festival to allow the public to have a chance to compare prices on the
market, according to Chiu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pets to be allowed on board TRA trains</HEADLINE>

(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) announced Friday that starting July 1
passengers will be allowed to take pets on its trains for a three month trail
period.</P>
      <P>From June until September, passengers will be able to take dogs, cats, fishes
and other pets on the TRA's express trains, but dangerous animals such as snakes
will be prohibited, Yang Cheng-de, director of the TRA's Transportation
Department, said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"After the trail period, the TRA will make an evaluation based on the feedback
from passengers and will then decide whether or not to continue to allow pets on
board," Yang added.</P>
      <P>A poll conducted in April by the TRA among 7,000 respondents showed that 24
percent of its passengers supported the idea of allowing pets on trains, while
55 percent were opposed to the proposal.</P>
      <P>A similar poll conducted in 2003 showed only 14 percent support for the idea.</P>
      <P>While many people are still opposed to the initiative, Yang said, "the results
of the poll also indicate that more and more TRA passengers would like to be
able to travel with their pets, or do not mind sitting next to people carrying
animals."</P>
      <P>"The TRA needs to respect the opinions of the majority... and we are living in a
multi-dimensional society," Yang said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that during the trial period, passengers carrying pets will be
restricted to the TRA's express trains, such as the Tzu-chiang, Chu-kuang and
Fu-hsing, and he urged the public to pay attention to TRA stipulations regarding
cage sizes.</P>
      <P>"The size of each cage should not exceed 40 cm in length, 30 cm in width, and 26
cm in height, or the passengers will be fined," Yang said.</P>
      <P>If the pets make noises or smell badly, other passengers can complain directly
to the train conductor in and in order to "obtain an immediate response" and to
"maintain the quality of the service," he said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the other major railway operators -- Taiwan High Speed Rail
Corporation, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation, and the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corporation -- all allow pets on board.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen authorities hail premier's expansion of mini links</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/08  19:37:28
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen county government and county council hailed Friday Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan's pledge to expand the so-called "three mini links" to help boost the
local economy.</P>
      <P>Liu announced earlier Friday that within two weeks, the Executive Yuan will open
the direct shipping links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and several
ports in China's Fujian Province to all Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Currently the direct transportation routes are only open to those with household
registrations on Kinmen and Matsu and Taiwanese business people working in
Fujian. The routes allow the residents to travel to mainland China without
having to take the indirect flights of going through Hong Kong or Macau, which
takes longer and is more costly.</P>
      <P>By opening up the links to all Taiwanese, people who want to travel to mainland
China can go through Kinmen and Matsu instead of Hong Kong, Macau or another
destination such Jeju Island in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Expanding the mini links to include all Taiwan's people is one of the major
campaign promises of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Lu Chih-hui, general secretary of the Kinmen county government, praised the move
as the government heeding the wishes of the Kinmen people for further economic
development.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen harbor bureau has started improving the immigration inspection
facilities at the Shuitou Port's customs to cope with an expected growth in
passenger arrivals and departures, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-chao, deputy speaker of the Kinmen county council, said it is vital to
implement all the complementary measures in time to allow the Shuitou Port to
accommodate all passengers who would be coming from across the country.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's broader opening to tourists from China in July, both Lu and
Hsu also suggested the central government grant 72-hour landing visas to Chinese
tourists and permit them to use Kinmen as a transshipment center to do
sightseeing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Doing so will provide another option for Chinese tourists in traveling to Taiwan
and help bolster Kinmen's tourism, they opined.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, the two outlying islands, which are located between mainland China
and Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait, would be overlooked by tourists who would
generally prefer to see famous scenic and other attractions on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The mini links were initiated in January 2001 to offset the impact of the lack
of direct transportation services between Taiwan proper and China.</P>
      <P>Passengers made a total of over 725,000 trips last year via the mini links, and
ferry operators on Kinmen predicted that the number will further climb after the
service is made available to all Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The number of trips is up sharply from the 21,377 trips made in the first year
of the mini links' inception, relevant statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who is currently in Beijing to attend a
Sichuan earthquake relief charity, has complained that Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council had failed to deliver on Ma's campaign promise to immediately open the
mini links to all Taiwanese people upon the inauguration of the Kuomintang
government on May 20.</P>

      <P>The mayor of a city in the Dominican Republic visited Taipei County Friday to
study how it recycles waste and the impact recycling has on reducing carbon
dioxide emissions and protecting the environment.</P>
      <P>Jesus Feliz, the mayor of Santo Domingo Norte City in the country's Santo
Domingo province, arrived in Taiwan Monday for a five-day visit, accompanied by
city council speaker Pedro Mota and two other city officials.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Ambassador at Large Chen Hsien-hsiang, Feliz visited city hall, a
high school and a waste recycling yard in the northern county's Jhonghe City.</P>
      <P>At the recycling yard, Shen Chi-chung, head of the city's sanitation unit, told
the visitors that the city could earn around NT$50 million (US$1.65 million) a
year by recycling waste.</P>
      <P>"Kitchen leftovers, used clothes and waste light bulbs can all be turned into
gold," Shen said.</P>
      <P>The city earned NT$44 million in 2007 and NT$22 million in the first five months
of 2008 selling recycled materials, Shen said, with the city's recycling rate
having reached 39.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Income generated from the business would likely surpass NT$50 million this year,
the official said.</P>
      <P>Feliz said he was impressed by the way Taiwan cherished and recycled its natural
resources. His city produces 3,000 tons of garbage per month, all of it buried
in landfills, and he intends to take Taiwan's environmental experience with him
when he returns home, he said.</P>
      <P>The Dominican Republic is one of 23 countries that maintains diplomatic
relations with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>University tuition fees to rise no more than 2.88%: MOE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Increases in tuition and miscellaneous fees at domestic universities will not
exceed more than 2.88 percent for the coming academic year starting in
September, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Based on the rate, tuition and miscellaneous fees can rise between NT$327 and
NT$1,928, according to different departments and universities, the ministry said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>The ceiling was set after taking into account changes in the country's consumer
price index, earnings of local workers and the discretionary income of local
families, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The announcement came amid reports that many local universities are planning to
apply to the ministry to raise their tuition and miscellaneous fees by 5-10
percent for the next academic year.</P>
      <P>The idea to increase the fees has met strong objections from opposition
legislators, who are concerned the hikes will deal another blow to financially
strapped households already hurt by inflation.</P>
      <P>According to opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Pan Men-an last
week, a 5 percent hike would push public university tuition and miscellaneous
fees into the range of NT$26,000-NT$42,000 per semester and those of private
universities to NT$45,000-NT$74,000 per semester.</P>
      <P>With local households earning NT$76,000 per month on average and low-income
families receiving only NT$25,000 on average, a hike in higher education costs
would be nightmarish for many parents, Pan argued, warning that "a wave of
suicides" might occur when school reopens in September.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'1992 Consensus' will not be included in documents: top negotiator</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China assured opposition lawmakers Friday that the
term the "1992 Consensus" will not be included in legal documents to be signed
between Taiwan and China next week.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung also said that "the
national interest, parity and dignity will be paramount factors" in his
delegation's talks with the SEF's Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a meeting with the legislative caucus of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which expressed the hope that he
would not jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty in his upcoming negotiations with the
ARATS.</P>
      <P>Chiang is scheduled to lead a delegation to Beijing June 11-14 to discuss with
the ARATS the proposed launch of weekend cross-strait charter flights and
question of China permitting its citizens to visit Taiwan for sightseeing
purposes.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations, frozen for the eight years the DPP was in power, began
to thaw after the Kuomintang (KMT) administration took office May 20. Kuomintang
Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met with Communist Party of China General Secretary and
Chinese President Hu Jintao May 28 in Beijing and they both agreed to resume
two-way systematic negotiations between the SEF and ARATS based on the so-called
"1992 Consensus."</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang stressed that his party will not accept
any mention of the "1992 Consensus" or the "one-China" principle that is upheld
by Beijing, in the upcoming SEF-ARATS discussions. Tsai demanded that the terms
be excluded from any legal documents signed between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The DPP has argued in the past that "1992 Consensus" does not exist, and that if
does, it is based on Beijing's understanding that the "one China" supposedly
cited in the agreement is the People's Republic of China. The KMT maintains that
the "1992 Consensus" allows both sides to agree that there is only one China,
but leaves open the interpretation of the term "one China."</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said Friday that the late SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu had conveyed to his Chinese counterpart, the late ARATS
Chairman Wang Daohan, that there should be no denial of the existence of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ker urged Chiang "to maintain Koo's position and keep Taiwan in mind" in the
upcoming talks.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators also asked Chiang not to forget the issue of direct cross-
strait cargo charter flight in the discussions with ARATS, saying that the
implementation of such flights will serve Taiwan's best interests.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling asked Chiang to complete negotiations on the cargo
charter flight issue by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiang said that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the nation's
top China policy coordinator, had commissioned the SEF to discuss weekend
passenger charter flights and the admission of Chinese tourists to Taiwan. He
however noted that cross-strait talks on the cargo flight issue had also been in
progress for a long time.</P>
      <P>"I will definitely discuss the cargo charter flight issue in China and hope to
make some progress," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that direct shipping links between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait could be launched as soon as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group warns of increase in teenage males in sex trade</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of teenage boys in Taiwan engaged in the sex trade has increased at
an alarming rate, the Garden of Hope Foundation warned Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing police statistics, Cheng Min-ching, a senior researcher at the
foundation, reported that teenage males were involved in some 30 percent of the
total sex trade cases in Taiwan uncovered by law enforcement officers last year,
up from one percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>Cheng attributed the rise in male teenagers selling sex to the widespread use of
the Internet.</P>
      <P>Most of the policemen  were able to detain teenage  male prostitutes by
disguising themselves as clients and "fishing" for them on the Internet, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>The researcher believed, however, that the teenage male and female prostitutes
are actually the victims and should be protected, and argued that law
enforcement authorities, rather than going after the patrons who are the real
offenders, were arresting the victims.</P>
      <P>The way Taiwan's laws deal with prostitutes and their patrons has for the first
time sparked attention in the United States, she said, which observed that many
women from Southeast Asian countries are sold to Taiwan and forced into
prostitution here.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 (TIP 2008) , released Wednesday by the
U.S. Department of State, kept Taiwan on the same "Tier 2" list of countries for
human trafficking that it was on last year.</P>
      <P>The report describes Taiwan as a destination for men, women and children
trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation.</P>

      <P>A facility built by the Directorate General of Customs to breed and train
sniffer dogs against drug smuggling was inaugurated in Taichung County Friday,
with its first mission to develop a 40-dog squad by the year 2012.</P>
      <P>Director General of Customs Chien Liang-chi presided over the inauguration,
which was witnessed by Taichung County Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng, Board of
Foreign Trade Director General Huang Chih-peng, and Steve Waters, representative
of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chien said he hopes the plan to build up Taiwan's anti-drug forces will increase
the country's clearance rate on drug smuggling offenses to over 30 percent.</P>
      <P>The sniffer dog breeding and training center is located in Houli township in the
central county, which also is home to Houli Ranch, a popular site for horse
riding.</P>
      <P>Chien said the new facility, transformed from an old institution operated by the
Ministry of National Defense to breed and train military dogs, can also serve as
a tourist attraction that helps the county's economic development since it is

      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said Friday she will travel to Tokyo next week
to attend a forum marking the 50th anniversary of BPW Japan, the Japanese
chapter of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women.</P>
      <P>Lu is scheduled to depart for Tokyo June 11, where she will attend a forum June
14 on gender mainstreaming.</P>
      <P>"I have been invited to deliver a report at the forum on the status of Taiwanese
women and their future, " Lu told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's diplomatic suppression against Taiwan, Lu was unable to
visit Japan during her two four-year terms in office.</P>
      <P>"Now that I have retired from public service, I don't think that Beijing would
take any steps to block my travel plans, " she said in answer to a question on
whether she has faced any pressure from China in arranging her Japan trip.</P>
      <P>During her visit, Lu said she will also meet with Japanese Diet members,
politicians, major women's groups leaders and Taiwanese community
representatives.</P>
      <P>Asked her view about Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's suggestion that
first lady Chow Mei-ching head Taiwan's team to the Paralympic Games to be held
in Beijing in September, Lu said she would be pleased to see that happen.</P>
      <P>"I welcome any breakthrough in Taiwan's diplomatic isolation and any move
contributing to peace in the Taiwan Strait, particularly a diplomatic truce," Lu
said.</P>
      <P>An outspoken advocate of Taiwan's separate identity, Lu said she is worried
about what she described as a gradual dilution of the Republic of China's
sovereign status since the Kuomintang, which has adopted a more China-friendly
policy, took over the reins of the government from her Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) May 20.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was saddened to see many senior KMT officials avoid mentioning
Taiwan's official title once they set foot on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Touching on DPP affairs, Lu said she has reminded new DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen to lead the party to engage in more public-interest activities to regain
public trust following its bruising defeats in two major elections earlier this

    <HEADLINE>Premier defends budget plans amid lawmakers' criticism</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan defended the Cabinet's newly proposed "economic
stimulus" budget plans Friday, saying that they were legally and carefully
drafted and had no political overtones.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came in response to strong criticism expressed by opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers over the Cabinet's supplementary
budget plan and an amended special budget proposal for increased investment in
infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>Accusing the Cabinet of violating the Budget Act, DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu
noted that the Cabinet plans to earmark an initial planning fund of NT$200
million (US$6.6 million) for a massive package of infrastructure construction
projects -- also known as "i-Taiwan 12 projects." However, the Cabinet failed to
provide details, such as which ministry would be responsible for the projects,
Wong added.</P>
      <P>She threatened to refer the case to the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top watchdog
body, over what she called flaws in the budget plans.</P>
      <P>Wong also accused the Cabinet of misappropriating NT$8.5 billion from an
educational fund for the supplementary budget.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, described Wong's accusation as "a big smear" on the Cabinet and
countered that the fund in question will be used to finance two educational
projects under the new plan and that, in the future, the Cabinet will restore
the original designation of the fund.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said that the Cabinet did not violate any laws in proposing the
supplementary budget, because it followed precedent in making the move.</P>
      <P>At a question-and-answer  session in the legislature,  DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin
charged that the Kuomintang (KMT) -led Cabinet had deliberately slashed the
funds for several DPP-controlled local governments in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that the Cabinet wanted to see immediate results from the six-
month budget plans and that earmarking funds for local governments based on the
size of their populations was an easier way to plan the budgets.</P>
      <P>Liu added that in the future the Cabinet will also take into account the
geographical size of the constituencies under each local government and their
financial situation when allocating capital budgets.</P>
      <P>Yeh  also  blasted  the  Cabinet  for deciding  to launch infrastructure
projects aimed at creating domestic demand at a time when inflation is high.</P>
      <P>Saying that the projects will only "add fuel to fire, " Yeh expressed doubts
over the Cabinet's professionalism and noted that even former British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan had chosen
not to increase local demand when prices of goods were soaring.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, maintained that the Cabinet had made the decisions by means of
professional deliberation.</P>
      <P>Another DPP lawmaker, Pan Meng-an, also criticized the Cabinet's timing of its
planned injection of money,  via infrastructure projects, into the economy.</P>
      <P>Pan said that when local people are rushing to buy goods, the government should
not follow suit.</P>
      <P>But Liu explained that the Cabinet does not plan to launch large construction
projects, which he pointed out cannot be completed within six months.</P>
      <P>Rather, the Cabinet plans to earmark funds for good local construction projects
that are already in progress, but lack funding, he said.</P>
      <P>Taking another line of argument, Pan said that the budget plans did not explain
how the funds will be spent, and he maintained that the legislature should not
offer "blank checks" to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Liu acknowledged that the Cabinet had drafted the budget plans under a tight
schedule, but assured the lawmakers that the Cabinet will provide more details
and information during the legislature's review of the proposals.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the legislature's Budgetary Research Center said in an assessment
report that the Cabinet's special budget plan for public construction projects
lacked concrete details, which, it warned, will affect the legislature's review
of the proposals.</P>
      <P>The center also said that earmarking budgets based on the size of local
populations violates the spirit of the Special Statute for the Expansion of
Investment in Infrastructure Construction, which was aimed at balancing regional
development.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet should also propose supplementary measures to ensure that its public
construction plan will not fuel inflation, the center suggested.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Chang Sho-wen was quoted Thursday by a local newspaper as saying
that the Cabinet should not treat the legislature as a rubber stamp and he urged
the Cabinet to submit details of the budget proposals to the legislature for
screening soon.</P>

      <P>A cross-border drug trafficking ring of foreigners have approached young women
in Taiwan who love to learn English and later used them to smuggle drugs across
national borders, local police said Friday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after Taiwan and Australia jointly busted the foreign ring,
which used "language exchange" as an excuse to approach young female English
learners.</P>
      <P>Police in Australia detained a Taiwanese woman surnamed Wu who attempted to
carry 3.2 kilograms of cocaine hidden in scrolls through customs in Brisbane
April 18, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The bureau found that Wu, who had not been aware of the existence of the drugs,
was asked by her African boyfriend in Taiwan to take the paintings to Australia,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Wu, a fluent English speaker, fell in love with the African nicknamed Teddy in
Taiwan after they met through a language exchange, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>Australian police also arrested another Taiwanese woman surnamed Tseng, who
attempted to smuggle 3 kilograms of heroin through customs June 4, the statement
added.</P>
      <P>Tseng, 38, spoke good English and was asked by her African friend whom she met
in Taiwan to deliver the drug disguised as medicine to an Australian black in
Perth after picking it up in Malaysia, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The bureau said local women should gain a better understanding of their foreign
friends  in Taiwan before developing  a closer relationship.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it also discovered last month that two foreign nationals, a
Norwegian and an American, who were married to Taiwanese women, had committed
sexual assaults in their own countries.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged local women to be cautious in making foreign friends to improve

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will set up a round-the-clock hot line next
year to offer counseling for disgruntled migrant workers around the country, a
CLA official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-min, director of the CLA's Vocational Training Bureau, revealed the plan
after the U.S. Department of State released an annual report on human
trafficking, titled "The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008" Wednesday, which,
for the second consecutive year, kept Taiwan on the "Tier 2" list of countries
that it deems should do more to prevent human trafficking for forced labor and
sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, all of the country's 25 city and county governments have
offered free hot line services for foreign laborers. But all of those phone
services operate only during office hours.</P>
      <P>"We are planning to set up a round-the-clock hot line patterned after the one
for domestic violence victims that has only three numbers and is easy to
remember, " Chen said, adding that the new service is expected to be in place
early next year and will provide better protection for migrant workers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the U.S. report identifies several flaws in Taiwan's
prevention of human trafficking and protection of foreign laborers, it also
recognizes Taiwan's continued efforts to improve services for them.</P>
      <P>Among the services lauded in the report were free telephone services at Taoyuan
and Kaohsiung international airports, Taiwan's two main gateways, as well as
coordinatinating with 11 NGOs to shelter human trafficking victims.</P>

personal advantage, his object is to think of what is right."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Vice President Annette Lu said Friday she will travel to Tokyo next week
to attend a forum marking the 50th anniversary of BPW Japan, the Japanese
chapter of the International Federation of Business and Professional Women.</P>
      <P>Lu is scheduled to depart for Tokyo June 11, where she will attend a forum June
14 on gender mainstreaming.</P>
      <P>"I have been invited to deliver a report at the forum on the status of Taiwanese
women and their future, " Lu told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's diplomatic suppression against Taiwan, Lu was unable to
visit Japan during her two four-year terms in office.</P>
      <P>"Now that I have retired from public service, I don't think that Beijing would
take any steps to block my travel plans, " she said in answer to a question on
whether she has faced any pressure from China in arranging her Japan trip.</P>
      <P>During her visit, Lu said she will also meet with Japanese Diet members,
politicians, major women's groups leaders and Taiwanese community
representatives.</P>
      <P>Asked her view about Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng's suggestion that
first lady Chow Mei-ching head Taiwan's team to the Paralympic Games to be held
in Beijing in September, Lu said she would be pleased to see that happen.</P>
      <P>"I welcome any breakthrough in Taiwan's diplomatic isolation and any move
contributing to peace in the Taiwan Strait, particularly a diplomatic truce," Lu
said.</P>
      <P>An outspoken advocate of Taiwan's separate identity, Lu said she is worried
about what she described as a gradual dilution of the Republic of China's
sovereign status since the Kuomintang, which has adopted a more China-friendly
policy, took over the reins of the government from her Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) May 20.</P>
      <P>Lu said she was saddened to see many senior KMT officials avoid mentioning
Taiwan's official title once they set foot on the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Touching on DPP affairs, Lu said she has reminded new DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen to lead the party to engage in more public-interest activities to regain
public trust following its bruising defeats in two major elections earlier this
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier defends budget plans amid lawmakers' criticism</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
06/07/08  11:22:10
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan defended the Cabinet's newly proposed "economic
stimulus" budget plans Friday, saying that they were legally and carefully
drafted and had no political overtones.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came in response to strong criticism expressed by opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers over the Cabinet's supplementary
budget plan and an amended special budget proposal for increased investment in
infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>Accusing the Cabinet of violating the Budget Act, DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu
noted that the Cabinet plans to earmark an initial planning fund of NT$200
million (US$6.6 million) for a massive package of infrastructure construction
projects -- also known as "i-Taiwan 12 projects." However, the Cabinet failed to
provide details, such as which ministry would be responsible for the projects,
Wong added.</P>
      <P>She threatened to refer the case to the Control Yuan, Taiwan's top watchdog
body, over what she called flaws in the budget plans.</P>
      <P>Wong also accused the Cabinet of misappropriating NT$8.5 billion from an
educational fund for the supplementary budget.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, described Wong's accusation as "a big smear" on the Cabinet and
countered that the fund in question will be used to finance two educational
projects under the new plan and that, in the future, the Cabinet will restore
the original designation of the fund.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said that the Cabinet did not violate any laws in proposing the
supplementary budget, because it followed precedent in making the move.</P>
      <P>At a question-and-answer  session in the legislature,  DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin
charged that the Kuomintang (KMT) -led Cabinet had deliberately slashed the
funds for several DPP-controlled local governments in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that the Cabinet wanted to see immediate results from the six-
month budget plans and that earmarking funds for local governments based on the
size of their populations was an easier way to plan the budgets.</P>
      <P>Liu added that in the future the Cabinet will also take into account the
geographical size of the constituencies under each local government and their
financial situation when allocating capital budgets.</P>
      <P>Yeh  also  blasted  the  Cabinet  for deciding  to launch infrastructure
projects aimed at creating domestic demand at a time when inflation is high.</P>
      <P>Saying that the projects will only "add fuel to fire, " Yeh expressed doubts
over the Cabinet's professionalism and noted that even former British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and former U.S. President Ronald Reagan had chosen
not to increase local demand when prices of goods were soaring.</P>
      <P>Liu, however, maintained that the Cabinet had made the decisions by means of
professional deliberation.</P>
      <P>Another DPP lawmaker, Pan Meng-an, also criticized the Cabinet's timing of its
planned injection of money,  via infrastructure projects, into the economy.</P>
      <P>Pan said that when local people are rushing to buy goods, the government should
not follow suit.</P>
      <P>But Liu explained that the Cabinet does not plan to launch large construction
projects, which he pointed out cannot be completed within six months.</P>
      <P>Rather, the Cabinet plans to earmark funds for good local construction projects
that are already in progress, but lack funding, he said.</P>
      <P>Taking another line of argument, Pan said that the budget plans did not explain
how the funds will be spent, and he maintained that the legislature should not
offer "blank checks" to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Liu acknowledged that the Cabinet had drafted the budget plans under a tight
schedule, but assured the lawmakers that the Cabinet will provide more details
and information during the legislature's review of the proposals.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the legislature's Budgetary Research Center said in an assessment
report that the Cabinet's special budget plan for public construction projects
lacked concrete details, which, it warned, will affect the legislature's review
of the proposals.</P>
      <P>The center also said that earmarking budgets based on the size of local
populations violates the spirit of the Special Statute for the Expansion of
Investment in Infrastructure Construction, which was aimed at balancing regional
development.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet should also propose supplementary measures to ensure that its public
construction plan will not fuel inflation, the center suggested.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Chang Sho-wen was quoted Thursday by a local newspaper as saying
that the Cabinet should not treat the legislature as a rubber stamp and he urged
the Cabinet to submit details of the budget proposals to the legislature for
screening soon.</P>

      <P>A cross-border drug trafficking ring of foreigners have approached young women
in Taiwan who love to learn English and later used them to smuggle drugs across
national borders, local police said Friday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after Taiwan and Australia jointly busted the foreign ring,
which used "language exchange" as an excuse to approach young female English
learners.</P>
      <P>Police in Australia detained a Taiwanese woman surnamed Wu who attempted to
carry 3.2 kilograms of cocaine hidden in scrolls through customs in Brisbane
April 18, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The bureau found that Wu, who had not been aware of the existence of the drugs,
was asked by her African boyfriend in Taiwan to take the paintings to Australia,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Wu, a fluent English speaker, fell in love with the African nicknamed Teddy in
Taiwan after they met through a language exchange, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>Australian police also arrested another Taiwanese woman surnamed Tseng, who
attempted to smuggle 3 kilograms of heroin through customs June 4, the statement
added.</P>
      <P>Tseng, 38, spoke good English and was asked by her African friend whom she met
in Taiwan to deliver the drug disguised as medicine to an Australian black in
Perth after picking it up in Malaysia, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The bureau said local women should gain a better understanding of their foreign
friends  in Taiwan before developing  a closer relationship.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it also discovered last month that two foreign nationals, a
Norwegian and an American, who were married to Taiwanese women, had committed
sexual assaults in their own countries.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged local women to be cautious in making foreign friends to improve
their English.</P>

      <P>Visitors from Hong Kong, Macau and China will be able to tour the Presidential
Office in groups after it restarts its weekday tours, Presidential Office
spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that next Monday the Presidential Office will restart its weekday
tours, which were suspended earlier this year in preparation for handover of the
reins of government.</P>
      <P>The opening hours will be 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., Monday through Friday, and
visitors from Hong Kong, Macau and China, who were previously excluded, will now
be able to join the tours, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The public has been allowed to view the office's artifacts from the previous
presidents and to tour some parts of the colonial style building, but the
Presidential Office has now decided to also put on display gifts presented by
foreign dignitaries to Taiwan presidents.</P>
      <P>"To give the public a feeling of warmth and friendliness," Wang said, Deputy
Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Yeh Chin-chuan has also decided to
remove the wire barricades currently surrounding the building.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the Presidential Office will recruit volunteers of all ages and
train them as tour guides.</P>
      <P>In the future, elementary and high school students will serve as guides to
groups of students from their respective school levels, while adult guides will
be provided for adult groups, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office was first opened to the public during the tenure of
former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Four holiday tours of the Presidential Office are scheduled for this year --

official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lai Fu-huan, a CTPC managing director, said Chen would head the team after

that first lady Chow Mei-ching would be the best choice to lead the team.</P>
      <P>Wang argued that Chow would advance the cause of caring for people with

      <P>But Lai said that registration for the games, which will be held Sept. 6-17 in

      <P>"It is certain that CTPC President Chen Li-chou will serve as the team's leader,

      <P>Incoming  Republic  of  China Representative to the United States Jason Yuan
said Friday that he applied for U.S. permanent residence in 2004 but officially
filed for a termination of the application process early this month.</P>
      <P>In a written statement stressing that he does not hold a U.S. green card or U.S.
citizenship or citizenship of any other foreign country, Yuan said he will take
legal action against various people, including legislators, whom he said have
seriously violated his privacy by making public his personal data.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuan Bi-ling disclosed in
Taipei Friday that Yuan applied for permanent residence in the United States in
2004 and claimed he was on a green card waiting list, questioning Yuan's
allegiance and his eligibility to assume the position of ROC representative to
the United States.</P>
      <P>To support her claim, Kuan even revealed a number she claimed was Yuan's
immigrant visa number.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Yuan, who has served as a Kuomintang and People First Party
representative to the United States since February 2004, said he applied for
residence through a lawyer that year to facilitate his job, but had not obtained
a green card.</P>
      <P>Yuan said he currently holds a U.S. employment authorization card that requires
renewal every year.</P>
      <P>In late May, Yuan said, he told the U.S. government that he would terminate his
residence application if he were to return to public service in the ROC
government and he officially filed for a termination of the application in early
June.</P>
      <P>Before retiring from the foreign service in January 2004, Yuan had served as ROC
ambassador to Panama, director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Los Angeles, and chief of the Congressional Liaison Division at the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States.</P>
      <P>The green card issue has drawn much attention in Taiwan recently after Minister
of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou admitted that he obtained U.S. permanent
resident status in 2005 when he was the ROC ambassador to Guatemala, but
renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>Although there is no law forbidding diplomatic officials from holding permanent
resident status of a foreign country, opposition politicians nevertheless claim
that holding or applying for a green card calls their allegiance to the country
into question.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has decided to organize a
mission tasked with monitoring the long-anticipated talks between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait slated to take place June 11-14 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Ching-de, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said Saturday
that the caucus had passed a proposal by his colleague Tsai Hung-liang that a
team should be formed to closely monitor the talks.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should not miss any occasions on which cross-strait affairs are
discussed, " Tsai said, "particularly at a time when the ruling party is
observed to be leaning westward."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Taiwan is "weakening" in defending its sovereignty. "Taiwan's
interests will be damaged if it fails to adhere to its sovereignty during cross-
strait negotiations, " the lawmaker predicted.</P>
      <P>Lai said the planned DPP monitoring mission will be authorized by the party to
make an instant response to any of the conclusions that it believes would harm
Taiwan's interests during the talks.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the upcoming cross-strait talks be open to the media to
allow for live reporting.</P>
      <P>The team will be formed next Monday, with Legislator Ker Chien-ming -- also a

      <P>A ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker unveiled his plan Saturday to push for an
amendment to the Nationality Act to set out clear guidelines on whether public
servants are allowed to hold permanent resident status of another country.</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, such a move is essential to clarify the
connection between allegiance to the country and holding foreign permanent
residency rights.</P>
      <P>The amendment should introduce a disclosure system and state the types and ranks
of public servants who are not allowed to hold such status, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu put forth the idea amid an ongoing opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) campaign in which the party has challenged the allegiance of several
officials in the KMT administration who either once held a U.S. green card,
reportedly still hold a U.S. green card, or have applied for a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>The Nationality  Act forbids  ROC nationals  with  foreign citizenship from
assuming public office and requires those with foreign citizenship to be removed
from their posts. The law, however, does not forbid public servants from holding
permanent resident status of a foreign country.</P>
      <P>The issue has received much public attention recently after Minister of Foreign
Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou, responding to a related media report, admitted
Wednesday that he obtained U.S. permanent resident status in 2005 when he was
the ROC ambassador to Guatemala, but renounced the status one month before
assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>On Friday, DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling claimed that two other members of the
Cabinet still hold a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>She further said that Jason Yuan, the incoming ROC representative to the United
States, applied for permanent residence in the United States in 2004 and claimed
he is on a green card waiting list.</P>
      <P>Issuing a statement in the United States Friday, Yuan said he did apply for U.S.
permanent residence in 2004 but officially filed for a termination of the
application process early this month.</P>
      <P>The DPP also targeted President Ma Ying-jeou during the run-up to the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Responding to the DPP's doubts, Ma admitted that he obtained a U.S. green card
while studying in the United States in the 1970s. However, he noted that he has
used a U.S. visa instead of his green card to enter the United States since the
mid-1980s, a move he said is equal to renouncing his permanent resident status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Price stabilization to be government's top economic priority: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday that in
this period of domestic economic adjustment amid slowing global economic growth
and high inflation, the government's top priority will be stabilizing prices.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that domestic economic growth is expected to remain stable as the
U.S. subprime crisis has for the most part passed due to the Federal Reserve's
effective intervention measures, including lowering interest rates and pumping
more liquidity into credit markets.</P>
      <P>Many experts expect the U.S. economy to begin to rebound in the second half of
this year, the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>With stable economic growth of up to 4.78 percent expected in Taiwan for this
year, the CEPD said the government will make dealing with the more urgent
problem of inflation its top priority.</P>
      <P>The council noted that the wholesale price index in Taiwan is expected to
increase by a whopping 5.9 percent this year, while the consumer price index
(CPI) is forecast to rise by 3.3 percent.</P>
      <P>With rising oil and foodstuff prices, coupled with the increases in domestic
fuel and electricity prices at the start of May and the fact that inflationary
pressure is expected to increase, the CEPD said price stabilization to lessen
the impact of these forces on the country's citizens has become "the
government's most urgent task" at this stage.</P>

      <P>Nineteen representatives from member economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum visited southern Taiwan Friday to learn how to contain
a dengue fever epidemic.</P>
      <P>At a mosquito laboratory in Kaohsiung County, the representatives were shown how
to capture mosquitoes  and how to operate  a pesticide-spraying machine to kill
them.</P>
      <P>The representatives also saw a demonstration of how to prepare pesticide in the
proper concentration at the lab.</P>
      <P>According to Kaohsiung Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming, the southern county
reported more than 1,900 cases of indigenous dengue fever in 2002 and the county
government collaborated with the Cabinet-level Department of Health and the
Environmental Protection Administration to effectively curb the epidemic.</P>
      <P>Noting that government manpower was limited, Yeh said the county government also
mobilized the county's 227 communities to help fight dengue fever.</P>
      <P>The county government later developed the communities into a mechanism that Yeh
said played an important role in stemming other diseases such as enterovirus.</P>
      <P>This experience attracted the attention of other city and county governments in
Taiwan, also an APEC member, as well as that of other countries, Yeh went on.</P>
      <P>The central government accorded high recognition of the county government's
experience and said the experience should be shared with other countries, he
added.</P>
      <P>Yeh told the APEC representatives that the county government will send a team of
experts to their countries to help deter dengue fever if they request such help.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cultural meaning of Dragon Boat Day lost but not forgotten</HEADLINE>

06/07/08  18:06:23</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dragon Boat Festival, celebrated this year on June 8, features an array of
activities such as dragon boat races, eating zongzi and making "fragrant
sachets, " but the traditional festival -- one of the most important holidays of
the lunar calendar -- seems to have lost some of its cultural meaning, according
to a noted local folklorist.</P>
      <P>While China incorporated the Dragon Boat Festival among one of its national
holidays last year as a measure to protect and promote Chinese tradition, in
Taiwan, although the festival has been a national holiday for many years, it
seems to have been simplified to an occasion for eating zongzi and racing dragon
boats, according to Yuan Chang-rue, a folklorist and professor at the Graduate
School of Folk Culture and Arts of the Taipei National University of the Arts.</P>
      <P>"These days, the Dragon Boat Festival's emblematic meaning has already
superseded its practical functions, " said Yuan, pointing out that originally,
the festival was a means of reminding the public about the importance of health
care.</P>
      <P>In ancient times, the Dragon Boat Festival, celebrated in early summer, reminded
people that the "poison season" of May, June and July, is beginning, and with it
the emergence of all kinds of stinging and biting insects, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>The festival was created to prompt people to avoid illness caused by the
sweltering summer weather, which is why people would hang a bind of wormwood at
house entrances and drink Chinese medicinal wine during the festival,
traditions largely lost in modern days, according to Yuan.</P>
      <P>Even the dragon boat racing, he went on, was held in name of chasing away "water
ghosts, " but in fact was a kind of advertising designed to educate people to be
careful when playing in water during the warmer weather.</P>
      <P>"Today, the festival has lost its meaning of health care, as people's way of
life has changed with modern facilities, " said Yuan, noting that since people
now use air conditioners and various mosquito repellent products, they no longer
need the festival's practical functions.</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival is also designated as Poets' Day, in commemoration of
the Chinese patriotic poet Qu Yuan (340-278 B.C.) , who committed suicide by
drowning himself in a river in May.</P>
      <P>After his death, people made zongzi, a pyramid-shaped glutinous rice delicacy
with a savory filling wrapped in bamboo leaves that is still a common food for
Chinese people today, and threw into the river for the fish, so that they would
not feast on the poet's corpse.</P>
      <P>However, the top cultural organization, the Council for Cultural Affairs, does
not hold relevant activities for this occasion on a national scale and only a
few local authorities and high schools organize poetry recital competitions as a
faint reminder of the connection between Dragon Boat Festival and the poet.</P>
      <P>As head of a non-governmental organization in the area of literature, Yu Hsi,
president of the Chinese Poetry Society, said that although the cultural meaning
of the festival might fade from people's memories, it will not wither, as the
festival remains in the Chinese canon.</P>
      <P>Even though some traditions fade due to changes in lifestyle and habits, Yuan
said that culture is still an important factor that distinguishes one people
from another, implying that even though the practical functions have been lost,
the festival's symbolic meanings are still rooted in the Chinese cultural
conscience.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) , Taiwan's largest carrier, has decided to cut its
transport capacity by 10 percent from June to cope with high oil prices, a CAL
spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>CAL will drop 100 passenger flights and 50 cargo flights each month on its
routes to the United States and Asia, despite the approaching peak summer
tourism season, CAL spokesman Bruce Chen said, adding that European flights will
be unaffected.</P>
      <P>The new measures will save the company an estimated NT$200 million (US$6.6
million) per month, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>To fight surging oil prices, CAL has already reduced the weight of its planes
and lowered luggage allowances, as well as lowering its operational costs.</P>
      <P>The carrier has also proposed cutting the salaries of its 80 executives by 10
percent and asking its employees to accept unpaid leave, which is unacceptable
to the CAL workers' union, Union Director-General Chang Hsue-lien said.</P>
      <P>The union opposes any form of salary cuts and has decided to call a temporary
member representative meeting June 13, Chang said.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, the union will ask CAL to explain why the carrier is suffering a
deficit and propose other measures to solve the problem, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>CAL reported a loss of NT$2.5 billion last year and lost up to NT$2.9 billion in
the first quarter of this year, the largest single-quarter loss in its history.</P>
      <P>The carrier's deficit in the second quarter is likely to surpass NT$3 billion.</P>
      <P>The company attributed the record loss to skyrocketing oil prices, while the
union attributed it to the company's mismanagement and blasted the company for
placing orders for 14 Airbus planes worth a combined US$4.2 billion early this
year.</P>
      <P>Noting that plane purchases are part of the company's long-term plans, Chen
explained that the percentage of fuel costs in the company's total costs has
jumped from 30 percent last year to 48 percent this year.</P>
      <P>He claimed that CAL does not have financial problems and that the capacity-
cutting measure is only aimed at containing its losses.</P>
      <P>Other capital-saving measures regarding employees' interests have yet to be
finalized, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Local travel agencies said flight cuts will not cause an increase in summer
airline ticket prices because the company has already hiked ticket prices.</P>
      <P>According to local newspaper reports, Taiwan's second-largest carrier, EVA
Airways Corp., will slash 70-80 flights after the peak summer period.</P>

      <P>The second Taiwan International RFID Application Show will be held Oct. 7-11 in
the Taipei World Trade Center's Nangang Exhibition Hall, with new exhibits in
the areas of radio frequency identification (RFID) components, related software,
printing equipment and sensing modules taking pride of place, the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The show, organized by TAITRA and the Taiwan Electrical and Electronic
Manufacturers' Association, was held for the first time last year to facilitate
the development of the budding RFID industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>RFID is a wireless identification technology in which data is stored in passive
or active  RFID tags and can be remotely authenticated by transponders. RFID-
related technologies and devices have wide applications in cargo container
inspection, warehousing management and security control.</P>
      <P>According to Allied Business Intelligence Inc. -- a U.S.-based marketing
consulting company, the value of the RFID global market will reach US$3.843
billion in 2008, representing an average annual growth of 22 percent. Meanwhile,
the industry will achieve an annual growth of 21 percent for each year prior to
2012.</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials said the 2007 event attracted some 25,000 local attendees and
2,000 industry representatives from around the world, adding that during the
exhibition, company buyers from the U.S., Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia
and other countries placed business orders worth millions of U.S. dollars.</P>
      <P>TAITRA said that as 90 percent of last year's participating companies have
already registered for this year's show, they believe this year's show will
achieve even greater success in terms of both buyer attendance and orders
placed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA assessing importing water from China to Kinmen</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will assess the technical and efficacy
aspects of importing water from China to the outlying island of Kinmen, an MOEA
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official said the Water Resources Agency under the MOEA will "spend the next
one or two months conducting an assessment."</P>
      <P>The assessment will include whether to lay undersea pipes or build a bridge to
transport the water. Budgets and efficacy will also be studied.</P>
      <P>The agency will also have to learn how to improve purification treatment for the
imported water, adjust the existing purification equipment and make best use of
the water supplied by Kinmen's lakes and reservoirs, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official said that since Kinmen established direct transport links with
China in 2001, it has learned that importing water from China will not be too
expensive and will be cheaper than transporting water from Taiwan proper. Kinmen
lies closer to China's Fujian province than to Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"But this is not purely a water problem and the government also has to consider
political and security factors," the official said.</P>
      <P>The WRA is planning to submit the assessment report to the Executive Yuan for a
policy review in July, the official added.</P>
      <P>WRA officials said Kinmen has long been plagued by water shortages and has to
rely on sea water desalination to partially solve the problem.</P>
      <P>A technology assessment conducted by the WRA on importing water from China in
2001 failed to make headway because the political atmosphere at that time was
not in favor of such an idea.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government has asked the central government several times to
give a green light to importing water from China to assuage the water shortage
problem.</P>
      <P>WRA Director-General Chen Hsen-hsien recently traveled to Kinmen to communicate
with Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng on the problem, during which Chen vowed to
form a task force to study the issue.</P>

      <P>Whether job applicants succeed in job interviews depends 66 percent on whether
they maintain the proper decorum during the interview, according to the results
of a survey released Saturday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the 1111 Job Bank shows that 90.48 percent of businesses
surveyed think maintaining workplace etiquette is equally important as
displaying workplace professionalism.</P>
      <P>Taboos mentioned by the respondents for job applicants include failing to keep
an appointment for a job interview, not wearing the proper clothes, having no
knowledge about the position for which they are applying, providing fake
licenses or documents and failing to provide complete and true information in
their resumes.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 35.32 percent of workers have experienced job scams.</P>
      <P>Compared with 49.62 percent of these workers who did not suffer any damage, 28.9
percent suffered financial losses, 7.42 percent were shocked and 1.53 percent
were sexually harassed or assaulted.</P>
      <P>Signs that an employment offer might be bogus include that the employers fail to
provide clear information about the position, that the job content is
inconsistent with the title of the position, that job applicants are required to
pay money in advance, and that job applicants are asked to buy products.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has dropped to sixth place in the Asia-Pacific region this year on a
MasterCard International survey index aimed at measuring women's social
progress, according to the results of the survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recorded 73.2 on the Masterindex of Women's Advancement, behind the
Philippines' 86.82, Hong Kong's 77.37, Malaysia's 76.89, Singapore's 74.96 and
Thailand's 74.03, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was in third place last year behind the Philippines and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The index compares the socio-economic levels of women to those of men in 13
markets in the Asia-Pacific region by four key indicators, including
participation in the labor force, tertiary education, managerial positions and
above-median income.</P>
      <P>An index score above 100 represents gender inequality favoring women, while a
score below 100 shows gender inequality favoring men. A score of exactly 100
shows gender equality.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's decline on the index was attributed to its fall in the area of above-
median income from a score of 113.16 last year to 68.18, the survey said.</P>
      <P>This means that compared with every 100 Taiwanese men who regard their salaries
as being above average, 68 women in Taiwan consider themselves as earning above
the median income this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the survey discovered that of the 13 employment markets, Japan
received an index score of 49.83, the lowest in the region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey indicated positive developments in women's progress in the
region.</P>
      <P>Four -- Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam -- of the six Southeast Asian
countries surveyed performed better this year than last year on the index, while
the other two -- the Philippines and Singapore -- dropped slightly on their
scores, according to the survey results.</P>

      <P>The five-day Computex Taipei has attracted a record number of international
buyers in its first four days, with 33,317 buyers -- up by 5 percent year-on-
year -- and is set to generate US$20 billion (NT$608 billion)-worth of business
orders, the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As the world's second-largest show of its kind after Germany's CeBIT, the
exhibition featured 4,492 booths occupied by 1,725 information and communication
industry (ICT) companies from around the world, up by 53 percent and 30 percent,
respectively, compared with those of the previous year.</P>
      <P>Computex is mainly a B2B (business-to-business) trade show and only opens on its
final day for end-users, so most of the visitors are professional buyers from
overseas, according to TAITRA, which organized the show.</P>
      <P>Addressing the final day press conference Saturday, TAITRA Executive Vice
President Walter Yeh said that among the 1,725 exhibitors, 375, or 21 percent,
are foreign companies, indicating that Computex has become a very successful
international procurement platform.</P>
      <P>"The council is planning to expand the number of foreign exhibitors next year to
30 percent of the total companies on display," Yeh went on, expressing his hope
that through such efforts, more international buyers will come to the show.</P>
      <P>"As for multinational visitors in the first four days, the U.S. represented the
largest group with 14.7 percent of the total visitors, with another 10 percent
from Japan, which had the second-largest group of buyers," Yeh said, adding that
buyers from Hong Kong, South Korea and China ranked third, fourth and fifth.</P>
      <P>The senior trade official added that this year's visitor number for the first
four days topped last year's, rising 5 percent to 33,317, which is the show's
highest ever. "The total number of buyers and visitors for the five-day event
will reach 36,000," he predicted.</P>
      <P>Last year, the show attracted 33,000 visitors and buyers, according to TAITRA
statistics.</P>
      <P>Citing another achievement of the show, Yeh said it is being held alongside
over 2,000  trade meetings  that have allowed  113 international buyers from 32
countries to explore procurement deals with the exhibiting companies.</P>
      <P>"During the two days in which these meetings were held, a total of US$200
million-worth of business transactions was generated, " he noted, adding that
the overall business opportunities of the show could reach as high as a record-
breaking US$20 billion, up from US$15 billion the previous year.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, companies must have over US$50 million in annual revenues
to be eligible to attend the meetings.</P>
      <P>Referring to the potential expansion of the size of Computex in the coming
years, the trade official said the second Nangang Exhibition Hall will be
established by 2012, which will offer a venue nearly as large as the current
Nangang Exhibition Hall, which already provides space for 2,650 booths.</P>
      <P>This year's Computex was spread over four venues -- the Taiwan World Trade
Center exhibition halls 1 and 3, the Nangang Exhibition Hall and the Taipei
International Convention Center.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan released Saturday its 2007 Taiwan sustainable development
indicators compiled by the National Council for Sustainable Development Network
showing that Taiwan's living environment degenerated in 2007, despite
improvements in many sectors, including reservoir quality and waste recycling.</P>
      <P>Compared with the similar indicators applied to illustrate the country's
environmental sustainability in 2006, the report indicates that 15 of 41
indicators moved away from sustainability in 2007.</P>
      <P>They include the carbon dioxide emission amount, water resources, garbage output
per capita, the volume of public pollution petitions under government management
and the pesticide consumption percentage of agricultural output in a year.</P>
      <P>Other indicators featuring the death rate from cancer, the percentage  of the
central  government;s  general  budget  for environmental protection and
biological preservation, as well as the urban electricity consumption per
capita, also show an increasing distance from the goal of sustainable
development, according to the report.</P>
      <P>As improvements in environmental pollution was offset by far more serious
ecological degradation, the report concluded that Taiwan went in the opposite
direction of sustainable development.</P>
      <P>According to the Executive Yuan council, the indicators were first produced in
2003 to serve as reference for the nation to pursue environmental sustainability
and seek improvement to the environment.</P>
      <P>The indicators are divided into six categories -- environmental pollution,
biological resources, economic pressure, social pressure, system response and
urban development.</P>
      <P>The 2007 indexes that show efforts to seek improvement in the fields of
environment, biology, economy, system and urban development are at a level
better than those of 2006, while those in social pressure are at a lower level,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>The increasing social pressure, used to describe how social structure and
economic activities cause damage to the maintenance of the environment and the
development of sustainability, was detected in the garbage output per capita,
the plantation of betel nut trees, which are considered a key culprit in
landslides, the cancer death rate, household incomes and prevalence of
contagious diseases.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of Sunday's Dragon Boat Festival,  the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF)  and various non-government organizations organized a series of activities
for Chinese spouses to help them celebrate the traditional festival.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, SEF Chief Secretary Liao Yun-yuan said that through
different activities, the SEF tries to help Chinese spouses married to Taiwanese
gain an understanding of Taiwan's way of celebrating the festival and to convey
a message of goodwill from the government to the new immigrants.</P>
      <P>Chinese spouses and their family members are targets of the SEF's care services,
Liao went on, adding that with the collaboration of non-government
organizations, the foundation can provide more active and practical services for
new immigrants.</P>
      <P>The activities, held in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, attracted more than
600 people, including Chinese spouses and their Taiwanese families,  who
participated  in competitions to make traditional zongzi and "fragrant sachets,"
according to Li Nan- hsun, an SEF official.</P>
      <P>Zongzi are pyramid-shaped cakes of glutinous rice wrapped in bamboo leaves and
stuffed with savory treats, traditionally eaten during Dragon Boat Festival,
while "fragrant sachets" containing special herbs, are used for repelling
insects in summer.</P>
      <P>"The foundation launched the activities, including fairs and workshops,  last
year with the collaboration of non-government organizations, and so far we have
received very positive feedback from the Chinese spouses," said Li.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, more than 308,000 marriages between Taiwanese and Chinese had
been registered as of the end of April, and National Immigration Agency
statistics show that about 260,000 Chinese spouses live in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT) industry at Computex
Taipei has showcased a variety of trendsetting  products,  indicating  that
local makers have transformed themselves from downstream manufacturers into
brand makers, a senior official of the event's organizer, the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA), said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Computex, the world's second-largest computer exhibition behind Germany's CeBIT,
is a B2B (business-to-business) procurement platform attended by 1,725
exhibitors from around the world. It ran from June 3-7 this year.</P>
      <P>Addressing the final day press conference, TAITRA Executive Vice President
Walter Yeh said Taiwan's ICT manufacturers used to be downstream  makers  for
brand companies  but are now industry trendsetters.</P>
      <P>"ASUStek, a Taiwanese company, set the trend for small and compact notebooks by
launching the EeePC last year, with the second generation of EeePC continuing to
steal the show this year, " Yeh said, citing a vivid example during the five-day
show.</P>
      <P>Citing other highlights of the Taiwan-created ICT innovations at the show, the
trade official said the Computex Best Choice Awards and the first-ever
Innovation Awards featured many of the local creative ICT products.</P>
      <P>"The show focused on design and innovation, because that's where Taiwan's
strengths lie," Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Showing off state-of-the-art computers, peripheral products, and storage,
communication and other purpose-designed ICT devices, the award winners are
mostly Taiwanese companies, including Acer, ASUStek and Gigabyte.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question as to whether the brand-making will hurt these former
downstream manufacturers, which could find themselves competing with their own
clients, Yeh said such concerns are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Business for successful brand companies like Acer and ASUStek is still booming,"
he said.</P>
      <P>"ASUStek has separated its manufacturing and its brand-name businesses," Yeh
added, saying that this is a strategy that will help the company avoid competing
with upstream companies that place the business orders.</P>
      <P>This year's computer exhibition featured 4,492 booths occupied by 1,725 ICT
companies from around the world and is estimated to have attracted  US$20
billion  (NT$608  billion) -worth of business transactions, according to TAITRA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six Chinese crested terns -- a seabird facing extinction -- have been recently
observed in a protected zone on Matsu, a Taiwan-controlled island group off the
coast of southern China, a Matsu official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Shou-hua, a technician at the local government's economic development
bureau urged the public to refrain from disturbing the rare birds.</P>
      <P>Chang, also the chairman of the Wild Bird Society of Matsu, said the bureau
commissioned the Taipei Wild Bird Society earlier this year to monitor traces of
migratory greater crested terns in the waters around the islands.</P>
      <P>On May 24, members of the Taipei society spotted two groups of the seabird and
also discovered the Chinese crested terns -- described by local birdwatchers as
"birds of myth."</P>
      <P>Chang said the population of Chinese crested terns, a white bird with a black-
tipped yellow peak, has been reduced to fewer than 50 around the world due to
hunting and egg collection by humans.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau said Saturday that a contest to find Taiwan's most tourist-
friendly city and county has kicked off in view of the expected arrival of
Chinese tourists next month and the "2008-2009 Tour Taiwan Year" initiative of
the central government.</P>
      <P>Steve T.Y. Kuo Su, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau, said the
bureau has commissioned Global View, a local monthly magazine, to sponsor a vote
for the most tourist-friendly city and county.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su expressed hope that the activity will prod city and county governments,
as well as the public, to join hands to promote a tourism-friendly environment
and upgrade service quality.</P>
      <P>He said the country's points of interest will be divided into three categories
-- natural landscapes, sites of cultural and historic heritage, and shopping
areas.</P>
      <P>There will be preliminary, second and final round contest before an online vote
is conducted in July.</P>
      <P>He said that 25 cities and counties can recommend a maximum of four points of
interest for foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>After the preliminary round ends June 15, the magazine will send a team of
professionals to inspect the recommendations and assess their scores in five
areas --  signposting,  foreign language environment, cleanliness, scenery and
host services -- June 23.</P>
      <P>The inspections and the online voting will account for 80 percent and 20
percent, respectively, of the second-round score. Experts will choose the
winners between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>He said the top three cities or counties will be awarded NT$600,000, NT$300,000

      <P>Sales of commemorative coins marking the May 20 inauguration of President Ma

exorbitant gold prices, central bank officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) accepted orders for a set of

      <P>CBC officials attributed sluggish sales mainly to high gold price. Gold price
has surged to US$900 per ounce, more than double the price level three years ago

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said she will do her utmost to complete a peace
memorial park in the southern port city's coastal Chijin district to commemorate
many Taiwanese soldiers who were killed in battles after being forced to fight
for Japan during World War II and later for the Kuomintang government during
Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while attending a memorial service at a Presbyterian
church in Kaohsiung  County's  Fengshan  City in remembrance of Hsu Chao-jung, a
pro-independence activist who immolated himself May 20, the day when the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) handed over the reins of the government to
the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Hsu, who was forced to serve in the Japanese navy during World War II and later
fought for the KMT government during the civil war with the Chinese communists,
left a suicide note in which he protested the DPP government's failure to build
a monument in memory of many Taiwanese soldiers killed in those battles and to
offer due compensation for their bereaved families.</P>
      <P>Chen, herself a political dissident who was once jailed for pro-democracy
efforts during Taiwan's martial law era, said she will push for completion of
the "Chijin War and Peace Memorial Park" during her term in office. As some
critics were opposed to the park's name favored by Hsu, Chen said she will try
to resolve the issue through consultations.</P>
      <P>Hsu was twice imprisoned for his pro-independence advocacy during martial law
era. After he traveled abroad in the 1980s, his passport was invalidated for
supporting pro-democracy movement in Taiwan and became a political refugee. He
managed to return to Taiwan after Taiwan's democratization in the 1990s. He had
since worked for the cause of old Taiwanese soldiers and their families.</P>
      <P>Chen said she will also push the DPP to document stories of Taiwanese soldiers

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan will travel to southern Taiwan via a bullet train Sunday
to inspect regions affected by recent heavy rain, Executive Yuan spokeswoman
Vanessa Y. P. Shih said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The premier is concerned about the losses the recent torrential rains had
brought to local farmers, particularly those in the southern counties of
Pingtung and Kaohsiung, " Shih said in an interview.</P>
      <P>It will be Liu's first community outreach visit to southern Taiwan since he
assumed office May 20.</P>
      <P>His tour plan was seen a response to calls by lawmakers from both ruling and
opposition camps for the premier to have more face-to-face contact with
grassroots people to get first-hand information about damage to crops brought by
recent rains.</P>
      <P>As Liu had to deliver reports and answer questions at the Legislative Yuan over
the past weeks, Shih said, the premier didn't inspect the flooded regions during
weekdays.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Liu will inspect two hardest-hit regions, a special vegetable
production area in Kaohsiung County's Tzukuan township, rice paddies in Pingtung
County's Wantan township, and a floral garden in the southernmost county's
Chutien township.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) statistics showed that agricultural losses due to
heavy rain in central and southern Taiwan in recent days had amounted to
NT$53.66 million (US$1.77 million) as of Saturday morning.</P>

principle I have heard." "But men who live in retirement in order to study their
aims and who practice righteousness in order to carry out their principles: The
expression of such principles I have heard, but I have not seen such men."</TEXT>

      <P>A photo exhibition featuring Taiwanese comfort women is being staged in Taipei,
the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF), which is organizing the show,
announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Through  the exhibition,  titled "Assembly  of Ah-mas"  -- grandmother in the
Taiwanese dialect -- photographer Huang Zi-ming is presenting  through his
images the process of rebuilding  the identities of these old women who as young
girls were pressed into service as sex workers by the Japanese during World War
II, according to the TWRF.</P>
      <P>Huang first met the comfort women at a court case in Tokyo, where several
hundred surviving  comfort women from different  Asian countries demanded an
official apology and compensation from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>For more than three years, Huang recorded with his camera the women's images and
emotions in a psychological program organized by the TWRF in which they have
gradually reconstructed and rediscovered their identities and liberty, the
foundation said.</P>
      <P>"What I want to represent is the rebuilding process of the physical well-being
and self-image of these old ladies, who have endured ordeals in life but still
live with strength. Taking off the masks they have worn for over 60 years, they
demonstrate far more tenacity and courage than most people, " says Huang in one
of his photo albums on the comfort women.</P>
      <P>Some 1,000 to 1,200 Taiwanese women served as sex slaves to the Japanese army
during World War II, but fewer than 60 could be found , according to the
foundation.</P>
      <P>At present, only 22 comfort women, mostly aged over 80, are living in Taiwan,
where they continue their fight against the Japanese government for compensation
and an acknowledgement of their status.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being staged at the Cafe Noir in Taipei from Tuesday to
Saturday until July 31.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker accuses Cabinet of mini-links flip-flop</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
06/08/08  16:45:09
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent lawmaker Chen Fu-hai accused the Cabinet Sunday of doing a policy
flip-flop on the expansion of the mini-direct cross Taiwan-Strait links,
claiming that it is only using the outlying islands as a tool in its cross-
strait policies.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments to reporters after Government Information Office Minister
Vanessa Yea-ping Shih explained a day earlier that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan only
asked the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday to come up with a draft proposal
on further opening the mini-links within two weeks and to further promote the
links based on a goal of liberalization in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Shih's clarification marked a departure from a Friday promise made by Liu at the
Legislative Yuan to make the mini-links available to all Taiwanese citizens
within two weeks.</P>
      <P>The mini-links refer to direct shipping and trade services set up between
Taiwan-held Kinmen/Matsu islands and several ports in China's Fujian Province
since January 2001 to offset the negative impact of such links between Taiwan
proper and China.</P>
      <P>At present, the direct transport routes are only open to those with household
registrations on Kinmen and Matsu and Taiwanese businessmen working in Fujian.
The routes allow such people to travel to China without having to travel via
Hong Kong or Macau, which takes longer and is more costly.</P>
      <P>By opening up the links to all Taiwanese, people who want to travel to China can
go through Kinmen and Matsu instead of Hong Kong, Macau or another destination
such Jeju Island in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Expanding the mini-links to include all Taiwan's people is one of the major
campaign promises of President Ma Ying-jeou, who assumed office May 20.</P>
      <P>Chen, who questioned Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on the issue during a legislative
intepellation session Friday, said the premier must be held accountable for
every word he says.</P>
      <P>It is understandable should the Executive Yuan decide to put off the opening out
of concern over its needs to also cover the postal and telecommunications
aspects of the links, but the opening would not be any difficult with a
modification in administrative rules if it is merely confined to ferry services,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker said the policy flip-flop was a result of some MAC officials'
mindsets who still view Kinmen Island as a tool in the government's  cross-
strait  policies  and who keep adding  new restrictions.</P>
      <P>"I will contact MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan Monday and ask for an MAC
explanation of the policy twist," he said.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng, who attended a Sichuan earthquake relief charity
in Beijing Friday, has complained that the MAC has failed to deliver on Ma's
campaign promise to immediately open the mini-links to all Taiwanese people upon
the inauguration of the Kuomintang government May 20.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government has also suggested that the central government
grant 72-hour landing visas to Chinese tourists and permit them to use Kinmen as
a transshipment center to visit Taiwan, in view of Taiwan's scheduled broader
opening to tourists from China in July.</P>

      <P>Tibet's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama would very much like to visit
Taiwan again if given the opportunity, the Taipei-based Taiwan Tibet Exchange
Foundation (TTEF) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama met and talked Saturday with members of a delegation from the
foundation in Dharamsala, northern India, where the Tibetan government-in-exile
has been based since 1959, TTEF said in a news release.</P>
      <P>During the visit,  the Dalai Lama also reiterated to Liu Shih-fang, a TTEF board
member and Own Su-jei, TTEF deputy general secretary, his stance on supporting
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and not opposing China, according to the TTEF
statement.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said to Liu and Own that during his last visit to Taiwan in 2001,
he saw many followers of Tibetan Buddhism and many of his supporters in Taiwan,
which he said made a very deep impression on him.</P>
      <P>He praised Taiwan for having preserved the best essence of traditional Chinese
culture.</P>
      <P>The revered Tibetan spiritual leader also apologized to the Taiwanese people
that he could not have visited Taiwan sooner.</P>
      <P>"I've always thought about revisiting Taiwan over the past seven years, but
there were always things coming up at the last minute, " he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he also told his visitors that he did not play a role in the uprising
in Lhasa in March this year during which numerous Tibetans were killed by
Chinese troops and police following riots in which Han Chinese were targeted by
Tibetan protesters.</P>
      <P>"All communication data to and from Dharamsala will prove that I'm clean," the
Dalai Lama said, according to the statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Expansion of mini-three links 'a bit too fast': DPP chairwoman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
06/08/08  18:40:07
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen has said
that the planned expansion of of the "mini-three links" between Taiwan and China
within two weeks "seems a bit too fast."</P>
      <P>Tsai's remarks made Saturday came after Premier Liu Chao-shiuan announced a day
earlier that the scope of the mini-links will be expanded within two weeks to
benefit more travelers from Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The term refers to direct shipping and trade links maintained between Taiwan's
Kinmen, Matsu and China's Fujian Province ports of Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>At present, only residents with household registrations on Kinmen, Matsu and
Penghu, China-based Taiwanese businessmen and groups involved in cultural,
sports, religious and economic exchanges are allowed to use the links to travel
to China.</P>
      <P>Describing the expansion of the links as a security issue, Tsai said the
government needs to check whether Kinmen's port, airport and accommodation
facilities are capable of handling a huge influx of travelers.</P>
      <P>In addition, she went on, the government should explain why it decided to remove
the opening of direct cargo charter flights from the agenda for the upcoming
resumption of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>It should also explain whether the removal of the issue from the agenda will
sacrifice Taiwan's economic interests, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>She was asked by reporters to respond to remarks made June 6 by Chen Ming-tung,
a former chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the nation's top China
policy coordinator.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was "very surprised" to hear that the new Cabinet will exclude the
issue from the agenda.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the opening of cargo charter flights will benefit Taiwan's
economy more than the two other issues on the negotiation agenda -- the opening
of weekend passenger charter flights and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>It, Chen argued, will keep high-tech companies in Taiwan. Otherwise, they will
simply go to China and set up factories there, he continued.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan and China reached an agreement on the cargo charter flight
issue last August, but not on the other two issues.</P>
      <P>However, the opening of cross-strait cargo charter flights was not realized
because Beijing feared Taiwan would have withdrawn from talks on the two other
issues if the cargo flights had been given the go-ahead, Chen said.</P>
      <P>As a result, Beijing insisted that the three issues were a package  that should
have been simultaneously  announced  and implemented, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, P.K. Chiang, promised the DPP
legislative caucus that he will discuss the cargo charter flight issue during
his forthcoming visit to China.</P>
      <P>Chiang,  chairman  of the quasi-official  Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,
also expressed hope that direct shipping links between Taiwan and China can be
launched as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chiang is slated to lead a delegation to Beijing June 11-14 for talks with the
SEF's Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kid's Story House brings new meaning to bedtime story</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
06/08/08  18:49:00</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>We all have been told stories since we were young -- mostly at bedtime or
playtime, and mostly by our parents. Now, a whole new experience of storytelling
is available in Taiwan, in which children can actually walk into the world of
fairy tales and take part in the stories.</P>
      <P>Kid's Story House was founded four years ago by Chang Ta-kuang, a father of two
children now aged 6 and 9, in the belief that stories have "magical" power in
the development of a child's character and personality.</P>
      <P>Like any other father, Chang began telling stories to his children every day
when they were 2 years old. It was that passion and the smiles on his children's
faces that drove him to build the story house -- something he originally planned
to do after he retired.</P>
      <P>"We have different stories suitable for children of different ages," said Wu
Hong-bing, branch manager of the Kid's Story House in Taipei's Shihlin district.</P>
      <P>He said that for children of around 3 years old, it is the pictures and graphics
that attract their attention, while the storytelling is a process to help them
develop the ability to focus. Children aged from 3 to 6 start to understand the
development of a story, while children over 6 can appreciate the meaning or
moral of a story.</P>
      <P>"In addition to magic and adventure fairy tales, sometimes we integrate basic
science or daily life skills into stories so that the whole experience is not
only fun but also educational," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In order to create a real fairytale world that seems to pop out from the pages
of a book, Wu said the company worked with the top stage designer for children's
plays in Taiwan to build three rooms with different themes in each -- the
Dinosaur World, the Magic Cat Bus and the Little Witch Home.</P>
      <P>Also, working with 30 local illustrators, every story is made into a gigantic
book taller than an adult not only to attract the children's attention but also
so they can "play" with the story, he added.</P>
      <P>"Each child can interact with the story itself, " Wu went on, adding that
"through questions and answers and playing with the props, we encourage children
to find the next clue or development of the story by themselves."</P>
      <P>For example, he said, in the story of the Three Little Pigs, children can come
up and actually huff and puff and blow down a house made of straw or sticks --
special properties made to bring them the sense of vividness and excitement.</P>
      <P>In addition to visual and tactile incentives, moral education also plays an
important part in the entire experience.</P>
      <P>"Morals can be drawn from each story we tell, " Wu said. "For example, in some
stories, we teach children the concept of respect and modesty."</P>
      <P>Each one-hour storytelling session is divided into three stories with different
phases -- a short story usually contains more interaction to encourage the
children to sit and listen, followed by a longer one that often has something to
do with daily life, and finally a long story to really test their listening
ability.</P>
      <P>Wu said that 70 percent-80 percent of the stories told in the Kid's Story House
are created by themselves based on the Green Story, the fairy tales of Hans
Christian Andersen and local illustrations. The story house changes its stories
every month so that children will never feel bored.</P>
      <P>Costing NT$350 (US$12) for each session or NT$2,500 for 10 sessions, children
aged 3-8 can step into the magic world of fairy tales. It might not be
considered cheap by some people, but many parents think it is worth the money.</P>
      <P>"The way they tell stories here is much more creative and special," said Chen
Hsin-huei, a mother and return customer who has brought her 6-year-old daughter
to the story house every month for the past three years.</P>
      <P>"Stories help my daughter become more imaginative and improve her ability to
express herself," she said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he hopes parents can recognize storytelling as a profession and even a
kind of art.</P>
      <P>"Every story is a trip to wonderland and that kind of feeling is exactly what we
hope every child can feel," he said.</P>
      <P>After four years, the Kid's Story House now has two other branches in Taiwan and
each attracts over 1,000 children every month. It also has developed into a
multi-dimension business, providing storytelling services on company family
days, children's birthday parties and all kinds of children's exhibition events.
It can also tailor-make stories for certain themes or products for businesses.</P>
      <P>In addition, people who are interested in knowing the secrets of how to be a
good storyteller can attend storytelling workshops to learn about using body
language and voice to tell a story and how to guide children to learn and
understand the meaning of a story in the right way.</P>
      <P>"Although we are a business, our best reward is the children's smiles and their
parents' satisfaction," Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In cooperation with the non-profit Youth for Human  Rights  International
(YHRI) ,  several  non-government organizations in Taiwan held an International
Youth Human Rights Summit Sunday in Taipei to promote human rights for children.</P>
      <P>Over 30 children from all over Taiwan, who were conferred the title of "human
rights angels or "ambassadors for children's human rights, " took an oath to
promote the awareness of children's human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If we don't know what our human rights are, we will never have human rights, "
said Mary Shuttleworth, founder and director of the YHRI, in her opening remarks
at the summit that was organized by the YHRI, the Chunghwa Association for Human
Rights, the Taiwan Children rights Association and the Church of Scientology in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But with such rights comes responsibility, " she added. "It is the core value
that glues all human rights together."</P>
      <P>The YHRI was created in 2001 with the purpose of educating people on the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights so that they can become valuable advocates
for tolerance and peace.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-ting, minister of the Cabinet-level National Youth Commission, said that
only when everyone has a better understanding of what human rights are can these
universal values become reality rather than simply ideas.</P>
      <P>"It serves as the first step for youngsters to change the world by promoting the
basic values of human rights," she said.</P>
      <P>In celebrating the 60th anniversary of the United Nations' Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, Shuttleworth said she has seen great development in Taiwan's
promotion of children's human rights over the past few years.</P>
      <P>"I would like to congratulate the people of Taiwan for the incredible progress
made, " she said, adding that "we still have a long way to go, but if you keep
being positive and working in the way that you have, I believe you will really
set an example."</P>
      <P>"On this visit in 2008, it is my wish that we will collaborate with more like-
minded people, organizations, groups and religions in Taiwan to further increase
what's already been done and promote human rights education to more schools and
more children," she added.</P>
      <P>Following  visits to Haiti,  Dominican  Republic,  Jamaica, Venezuela, Congo,
Nigeria, Jordan and Pakistan, Shuttleworth arrived in Taipei Saturday on the
last stop of an annual world tour to promote human rights. She was also
scheduled to meet with Vice President Vincent Siew.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 58,000 couples got divorced last year, down by 6,000 couples from the 2006
figure, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to MOI statistics, an average of close to 160 couples got divorced
every day in 2007, a fall of 17 couples compared to the 2006 average. At the
same time, 11.6 out of every 1,000 married people was divorced in 2007 --
marking a decrease of 1.2 persons year on year.</P>
      <P>MOI officials ascribed the drop to a decline in the number of marriages in the
last four years.</P>
      <P>On the length of marriages of couples who divorced last year, couples married
for fewer than five years accounted for the biggest share of 30.8 percent and
followed by 26.3 percent of couples with five to nine years of marriage, MOI
statistics show. Couples who stayed married for longer had a lower divorce rate.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, the divorce rate in Taiwan has grown at an annual rate
of 4.15 percent, with couples married for over 30 years posting the largest
increase of 11.89 percent, followed by a 9.78 percent growth rate among couples
married between 25 and 29 years. The divorce rate among couples married between
five and nine years increased by the third-largest rate of 4.56 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>National enterovirus prevention center to be established</HEADLINE>

      <P>A national enterovirus prevention center will be established as part of
government's efforts to curb the spread of the disease, Health Minister Lin
Fang-yue said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will convene its first meeting Monday on the
center's establishment amid jitters about enterovirus after four deaths from the
disease were reported, Lin said during a fact-finding trip to the southern
county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>DOH officials  will review the existing  budget policy on enterovirus control
and prevention, as well as discuss any possible new ways of curing the disease
to which young children are prone, Lin said after visiting a pediatric ICU ward
at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>"The country could use new ways of thinking to battle the disease, although
conventional ways of treatment are effective, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>"So far, the battle against the disease has been won, even though four children
have died," he added.</P>
      <P>The scourge of serious type EV71 enterovirus this year first occurred in
Kaohsiung city and County and in Pingtung city and county, gradually spreading
northward, with the number of confirmed cases rising swiftly in two weeks to 107
last month, while fatalities had doubled from two to four by the end of May.</P>
      <P>Lin urged medical personnel and parents of infected young children to remain
patient, as it takes time and patience to allow those affected to recover,
pointing out that EV71 not only attacks the child's respiratory system but can
also injure the child's cardiac and nervous systems.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases were
documented  and there have been no serious enterovirus outbreaks reported since
2005.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can cause
serious  disease,  especially  in infants  and the immuno-compromised.</P>

      <P>The government should clearly state whether it is appropriate for officials to
hold a U.S. green card or U.S. citizenship, opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The government should make a decision on the issue and inform the public of its
decision, she said.</P>
      <P>If the government believes that holding a green card will not interfere with a
government official's exercise of his power, it should offer a clear explanation
of why this is so, she went on.</P>
      <P>People have a right to know which officials still have a U.S. green card or had
the card before, Tsai claimed, adding that the government should make public the
names of officials with a green card just as it requires public servants to
declare their assets.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks amid an ongoing campaign initiated by DPP lawmakers to
challenge the allegiance to the country of several officials in the Kuomintang
(KMT) administration who either had or has a U.S. green card, or have applied
for a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act forbids local nationals with foreign nationality from
assuming public office and requires those with foreign nationality to be removed
from their posts.</P>
      <P>However,  it does not forbid public servants from holding permanent residency of

    <HEADLINE>Experts find cause of fish die-off near Green Island</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
06/08/08  20:13:50
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading expert said Sunday that the cause of a massive fish die-off at the end
of last year around Green Island off the coast of eastern Taitung County was the
streptococcus bacteria.</P>
      <P>Over the course of two weeks in late December, island residents found a great
number of fish, including 26 species, washed up on the shore.</P>
      <P>The residents first believed that the fish had been illegally poisoned, or
killed with electric shocks or dynamite by poachers, and some of them picked up
the fish as food.</P>
      <P>But as the number of dead fish increased, residents began to doubt the cause of
death and the safety of eating the fish.</P>
      <P>Researchers collected samples that were examined by the Penghu Marine Biology
Research Center of the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute, which excluded
electrofishing or dynamiting as the cause of death.</P>
      <P>Toxicology tests at other institutes showed that the fish were not poisoned, but
Tsai Shin- shyong, professor of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at
National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, discovered that several
samples were contaminated with the streptococcus bacteria.</P>
      <P>Streptococcus is generally found in closed aquaculture facilities where the
quality of water is poor, especially during warm weather.</P>
      <P>"The Green island case might be the first in the world in which fish living in
the open ocean have been contaminated with the bacteria collectively, " said
Jeng Ming-shiou, deputy director of the Biodiversity Research Center of Academia
Sinica and the expert responsible for the investigation, in an interview with
CNA.</P>
      <P>Many additional aspects are also awaiting investigation, added Jeng, including
why more than 1,000 kg of big fish could be contaminated in the open ocean,
where the impact of the microbe is generally diluted, and why the dead fish were
all big ones that live 30 meters or more beneath the surface, while smaller fish
active in the intertidal zone and close inshore were unharmed.</P>
      <P>One of the possibilities is that fishing boats passing by the area dumped rotten
fish that was eaten by other fish, causing a large quantity of them to die in a
short period of time.</P>
      <P>Even no more dead fish have been found since then,  the investigation is still
under way,  Jeng went on, adding that streptococcus can be transmitted between
fish and humans and that even though boiling kills the bacteria, it is better
not eat contaminated fish.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will consult with local governments when crafting and
implementing agricultural policies in the future, Premier Liu Chao-shiuang said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the pledge in response to a proposal by Pingtung Magistrate Tsao Chi-
hung during an inspection tour of a special rice production zone in the county's
Wantan township. The crops in the zone suffered serious damage by heavy rain
that inundated central and southern regions last week.</P>
      <P>Tsao suggested that the Executive Yuan include local governments in
comprehensive discussions when forging agricultural policies and asked it to
increase subsidies for purchasing farmers' produce and for compensating their
losses incurred as a result of natural disasters.</P>
      <P>The premier vowed to do so and promised that it will not be just "lip service"
on the part of the central government.</P>
      <P>It was Liu's first inspection trip to southern Taiwan since the Kuomintang
administration took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Led by a Pingtung county councilor of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, a group of local farmers unfurled banners during Liu's visit in a protest
against the Executive Yuan, which they accused of being "too slow" to address
farmers' difficulties, including recent spikes in fertilizer prices.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Wu-hsiung announced May 28 that from May
30, prices of fertilizer produced by the Taiwan Fertilizer Co. would be
increased by between 33 percent and 70 percent to reflect rising raw material
prices in the global market.</P>
      <P>The announcement led to widespread fertilizer hoarding, sparking discontent
among farmers in central and southern Taiwan despite Chen's assurances that
there will be no fresh increases in fertilizer prices in the coming seven
months.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of farmers from rural Taiwan gathered outside the Legislative Yuan
Friday to protest against the fertilizer hoarding and price manipulation. They
also demanded that the government increase the guaranteed prices paid for local
farmers' crops.</P>

the southern port city of Kaohsiung, as well as the Taichung Export Processing
Zone in central Taiwan will be renovated to meet new demands, officials from the
Economic Processing Zone Administration under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
said.</P>
      <P>The software facilities at the Nantze, Kaohsiung and Taichung export processing
zones will also be upgraded to convert the zones into new greener manufacturing
hubs, the officials said. They envisioned that the hubs will be more efficient
in terms of production, water and energy use and carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>So far, more than 80 manufacturing companies have agreed to join the renewal
project, under which an additional 16,000 square feet of land will set aside for
greening.  Manufacturers have already committed to sponsoring the greening of
some 11,000 sq.ft. of the allocated space, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Nantze, Kaohsiung and Taichung export processing zones have been Taiwan's
"cradles of manufacturing" where most of the country's electrical and electronic
manufacturing industries started up some four decades ago. These zones have also
been the prime movers behind Taiwan's economic growth over the past years.</P>

      <P>Groups of tourists from China, Hong Kong and Macau called at the Presidential
Office Monday --  the first sightseers from the Greater China Area to do so,
Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>As of noon Monday, more than 200 people from home and abroad, including about 50
tourists from Hong Kong and Macau and a dozen from China, had visited the
Presidential Office on the first day of its reopening to the public, Wang said.</P>
      <P>People from China, Hong Kong and Macau were not allowed to visit the
Presidential Office before President Ma Ying-jeou came to power on May 20. Tours
of the Presidential Office had been suspended before Ma's inauguration in
preparation for the ceremony.</P>
      <P>In line with the Presidential Office's new rules, individual tourists, including
those from China, are now permitted to visit the Presidential Office without
making reservations, but groups of more than six members must apply for
permission beforehand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a bid to highlight the distinguishing features of the country's capital, the
Taipei City Government launched a campaign Monday to search for souvenirs that
would best represent the characteristics and image of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Liu Chug-chun, chief manager of Taipei City Office of Commerce (TCOOC), said at
a news conference that the aim of the event, which is being held for the first
time, is to solicit products that can be closely identified with the city of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Every product has to have a story that is related to Taipei, " Liu said. "In
addition to representing the city's character, the products also need to be
commercially competitive, easy to carry, environmental friendly and healthy."</P>
      <P>The call for submissions kicked off Monday and will last until July 10.
Individuals and shops can make recommendations or register to join the first
stage of selection, after which Taipei City residents will be asked to vote on
the shortlisted products.</P>
      <P>"We hope to choose something that would make visits to Taipei a wonderful and
unforgettable experience for tourists -- something that would make them want to
keep coming back," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Marko Kovacevic, an American studying in Taiwan for a master's degree, said that
he has no trouble choosing souvenirs, as Taipei is rich in culture and full of
distinctive features.</P>
      <P>"Its actually very easy to shop in Taiwan for people back home," he said. "I
always choose something that is uniquely different from the United States and
related to the local culture -- such as tea pots."</P>
      <P>Enrique Amador, chief creative director of Empanish Productions and a Spanish
post-graduate student in Taiwan, said he loves calligraphy scrolls and paintings
because they represent the oriental culture.</P>
      <P>"Whenever I go back to Spain to visit family and friends, my luggage is always
full of presents from Taiwan, instead of clothes," he said.</P>
      <P>The campaign, entitled "In Search of Taipei Gifts, " will select three types of
must-have products that best represent Taipei and will feature a series of
events that include a design competition and lucky draws.</P>
      <P>Persons  wishing  to  join  the  event  or make  souvenir recommendations may
log on to the Web site www.taipeigift.com.tw or contact the campaign organizers

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers urged law enforcement
authorities Monday to tighten a crackdown on contraband betel nuts, warning that
if the problem continues, it could affect the livelihoods of farmers in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers Pen Meng-an and Su Chen-ching issued the call at a news conference
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>They urged Premier Liu Chao-shiuan to address the issue and asked the Coast
Guard Administration to stamp out the increased smuggling of betel nuts into
Taiwan as it has brought down the price of locally produced betel nuts,
seriously affecting the livelihoods of some 400,000 families.</P>
      <P>Betel nuts smuggled from Thailand and China's Hainan Province were found "for
the first time" in the domestic market, they claimed.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County in southern Taiwan produces over 75,000 metric tons of betel
nuts per year, accounting for more than 30 percent of the country's total
output. Some 25,000 hectares of farmland in Pingtung County are legally
dedicated to the cultivation of the cancer-causing addictive nuts.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-chin, a betel nut farmer from Pingtung County, said their crop was
badly hit by heavy rain that inundated central and southern Taiwan last week.
"Our livelihoods are set to be impacted if the government fails to properly deal
with the rampant contraband betel nuts in the domestic market," he complained.</P>
      <P>Betel nuts farmers might consider taking to the streets if the Executive Yuan
fails to heed the issue, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Atomic Energy Council (AEC) Chairman Tsai Chuen-horng said Monday that he would
be willing to visit China for talks on Taiwan's search for low-level radioactive
waste disposal sites, if he is given an opportunity.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions in the Legislative Yuan, Tsai said he would go to China to
discuss the matter, if such disposal sites and skilled personnel and nuclear
waste management expertise were available there.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed, however, that for safety reasons there must be at least one
location in Taiwan for the disposal of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>The AEC head made the remarks in response to questions raised by ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
mainly on issues pertaining to reducing carbon dioxide emissions while
maintaining economic growth.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lai Shyh-bao asked Tsai whether nuclear power output should be
increased, since reducing carbon dioxide emissions is the centerpiece of the KMT
administration's energy policy. Lai cited France as a prime example of the use
of nuclear power to help reduce greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Tsai stopped short of giving a direct answer, saying only that nuclear power and
carbon dioxide reduction are two issues that should be considered under the
broader perspective of the country's overall energy policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, immediately after taking office May 20,
expressed the hope that construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant be
completed on time or even ahead of schedule, Lai said the handling and
management of low-level radioactive waste has thus become crucial.</P>
      <P>Lai asked Tsai whether he would be willing to contact China over nuclear waste
disposal.</P>
      <P>In his report to the legislature, Tsai said storing low-level radioactive waste
abroad could be feasible, but only if the recipient side is willing and capable.</P>
      <P>Tasi also mentioned that the three nuclear power plants currently in operation
in Taiwan produced 259 barrels of low-level radioactive waste in 2007,
representing a year-on-year decline of 21 percent from 2006 when the waste
totaled 327 barrels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, Taiwan Power Co. has chosen eight possible sites -- Wanan
township on the outlying Penghu island and seven others in Taiwan proper,
including Mudan township in the southern Pingtung County and Daren and Dawu
townships in the eastern county of Taitung -- to build storage sites for low-
level radioactive waste.</P>

      <P>A group of students from Mingde Elementary School have won an honorable mention
award in the "12 and under" category  of the  ThinkQuest  international  Web
site-building competition, the Taipei City Education Department announced
Monday.</P>
      <P>The grade 5 students -- Chen Bo-an, Lu Cheng-yen, Keng Hao, Wei Shih-hsuan,
Hsiung Hsin-yu and Chou Yun -- and their coach Chang Ling-yun won the award for
their "Dragons in Chinese Culture" Web site.</P>
      <P>The ThinkQuest competition, which has been held since 1996, is organized by the
Oracle Education Foundation -- an independent, charitable organization funded by
Oracle,  the world's largest enterprise software company.</P>
      <P>The competition, which is divided into three divisions -- for students aged 19
and under, 15 and under, and 12 and under -- is aimed at inspiring students to
cooperate in creating innovative and educational Web sites to share with the
world, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The city government Education Department praised the Mingde students for their
outstanding achievement, noting that only six groups of students out of hundreds
who entered the competition in their age group received major awards in this
year's competition.</P>
      <P>They are also the only students from Taiwan to win an award at ThinkQuest in
recent years, the department noted, adding that their site will be included in
the ThinkQuest library to be used as a research resource for students around the
globe.</P>
      <P>The students said that in researching ideas for a Web site theme, they
discovered that dragons appear in almost every facet of Chinese life, from
festivals and traditional costumes to literature and architecture.</P>
      <P>They therefore decided to create the "Dragons in Chinese Culture" site to
introduce the rich culture of Taiwan and China to the world.</P>
      <P>The students also thanked the teachers at their school who assisted them with
translation work and technical guidance in helping the process of setting up the
site.</P>
      <P>The department said that the "Dragons in Chinese Culture" site illustrates the
fruits of the students' hard work and cooperation, pointing out that all the
elements of the site, from the stories and pictures, were put together by the
students themselves.</P>

      <P>Featuring Israeli vocalist David D'or and his six-member band, the concert will
start in the southern port city of Kaohsiung and will then tour the island,
including Tainan, the central county of Changhua, the northern county of
Taoyuan, Taipei City, and its satellite city of Sanchong during the coming week.</P>
      <P>"The concerts are parts of our relief efforts to assist Sichuan and Myanmar, "
Lee Yi-huei, a spokeswoman of the Tzu Chi Foundation, told CNA.</P>
      <P>Noting that prayers will be held alongside the concerts, Lee said that "we at
Tzu Chi hope that through such events we will raise not only funds for the
victims but also people's awareness of the earth."</P>
      <P>D'or, who has performed for Tzu Chi three times since 2006, said singing for the
foundation is really meaningful, especially as it is helping to raise funds for
the victims in China and Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Commending Tzu Chi's humanitarian efforts as without borders, D'or said that
"for me it's amazing to see people that are choosing love because Israel is
surrounded by hatred."</P>
      <P>"Sometimes, helping people we don't know sounds a little bit naive, but this is
the essence of life," D'or went on.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the spirit of Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Tzu Chi Foundation,
D'or has also produced an English-language CD, the first especially produced for
the Tzu Chi Foundation by a foreign musician, comprising 13 songs written
according to Cheng Yen's teachings.</P>
      <P>"I am inspired by people who choose love as a way of life... I am inspired by
people that understand that human beings are connected to each other," D'or
said.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that no one can "just be a bystander" in the catastrophes of Sichuan
and Myanmar,  Raphael Gamzou,  Israeli representative to Taiwan, expressed hope
that the public can join Tzu Chi's efforts to help the victims.</P>
      <P>"This concert will be a collective prayer for the victims and survivors to wish
no more disasters for humanity," said Gamzou.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1966 by Dharma
Master Cheng Yen in Hualien, on the east coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It contributes to the improvement of social and community services, medical
care, education and humanism in Taiwan and around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Photonic shows slated to attract US$2 billion</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual Photonics Festival in Taiwan is again joining hands this year with
Display Taiwan, a panel-display fair, to showcase the country's most advanced
photonics products at an event that has projected business opportunities of US$2
billion (NT$60.8 billion).</P>
      <P>"For the past 25 years Taiwan has been developing photonics products such as
panel displays and LED products, " Peter T.C. Shih, the founder of the Photonics
Industry &amp; Technology Development Association (PIDA), said at a pre-event
press conference Monday.</P>
      <P>The PIDA is organizing the Photonics Festival in Taiwan, which will be held in
conjunction with the tenth Display Taiwan at Taipei World Trade Center
Exhibition Hall 1 June 11-13.</P>
      <P>The combined show, which will feature the latest technology in panel displays,
lasers,  LEDs, optics, optoelectronics,  fiber communications and solar energy,
is expected to attract a record 30,000 visitors. Some 525 manufacturers from 12
countries are expected to display their products at 1,360 booths -- all record
breaking numbers.</P>
      <P>Stressing that power-saving and environmentally friendly products are the major
attractions this year, Shih made special mention of the potential of solar power
as an alternative energy source in the face of the global shortage of fossil
fuels.</P>
      <P>Touching on LED lighting, Shih said the China market is growing, as the Beijing
government is planning to replace all of the country's street lights with LED
bulbs, which Shih said consume only 10 percent of the electricity used by normal
light bulbs.</P>
      <P>Chang Li, Deputy Secretarial General of the Overseas Division of Taipei Computer
Association (TCA), said at the press conference that panel displays are the
mainstay of Taiwan's photonics industry, as they generated NT$1.6 trillion in
production value in 2007 -- a major share of the phototonics industry's 2007
overall production value of NT$2 trillion.</P>
      <P>"The world-leading status of Taiwanese photonics companies like AU optics and
Chi Mei Optoelectronics indicates the future landscape of Taiwans high-tech
industry, " Chang said, adding that Taiwan's panel display industry is gaining
15-20 percent production value annually.</P>
      <P>According to the PIDA, the production value of the country's panel displays will
reach NT$1.8 trillion in 2008.</P>
      <P>The joint shows are estimated to produce roughly US$2 billion from business
transactions and follow-up business opportunities, the PIDA said.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, over 3,000 overseas buyers from countries such as Turkey,
Egypt, Spain, China and Japan will explore the business deals and hold one-on-
one  procurement  meetings with manufacturers' representatives.</P>
      <P>Some of the 60-plus events to be held at the trade shows include scores of
seminars led by 88 local and foreign scholars and experts.</P>
      <P>The organizing  team is drawn from Taiwan External  Trade Development Council
(TAITRA), TCA, PIDA, and Semi Taiwan, which is a local branch of the global
think tank, Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International.</P>
      <P>Since 1999, Display Taiwan has been part of the Photonics Festival, which
encompasses four different shows, including the International Optoelectronics
Exposition that is now in its 17th year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A central government task force on Monday inspected tourism facilities in the
Alishan area -- a famous scenic mountain in southern Taiwan -- as part of its
efforts to improve Taiwan's tourism quality ahead of the expected influx of
Chinese tourists from July.</P>
      <P>The task force, composed of officials from the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) , Ministry of Economic Affairs and Department of Health,
targeted Alishan as their first inspection stop as the mountain resort is a
must-see for Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ad hoc group, led by Chang Hsi-tsung, a section chief at the MOTC's Tourism
Bureau, inspected accommodation facilities, food quality and service, traffic
safety and tourism-related shops in the Alishan area to make sure they meet
guidelines.</P>
      <P>Ad hod group members were accompanied by officials and police officers of Chiayi
County, where the mountain is located.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Chiayi county government headquarters prior
to their inspection tour, Chang urged local businesses to put providing quality
services as top priority and to never engage in dishonest practices.</P>
      <P>He said the government will definitely punish businesses caught breaking laws
and regulations.</P>
      <P>As more Chinese tourists are likely to visit Taiwan from July, Taiwan's tourism
sector must effectively upgrade its service quality to protect Taiwan's image
and help the island continue to attract tourists, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is slated to allow up to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit each day from
July 4, up from the current daily level of 1,000. Eventually the daily number of
tourists to be allowed here is expected to increase to 10,000.</P>
      <P>The opening of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists is projected to be implemented
along with the establishment of direct weekend charter flights between mainland
China and Taiwan -- all major campaign promises of President Ma Ying-jeou, who
assumed office on May 20.</P>
      <P>The measures are expected to help boost Taiwan's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet members told to give up green cards: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/08  18:54:41

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday that he has made it clear to Cabinet members
that they had to give up their U.S. green cards before joining the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Describing the requirement as the best solution at present, Liu said the Cabinet
has a very clear stance on the issue and that when he was recruiting Cabinet
members, he had told them to give up their green cards.</P>
      <P>Responding to ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers' calls for him to step down if
any Cabinet member is found to have kept a green card, Liu said he can give up
his post, but he added that "Taiwan cannot leave itself without talent that has
a global view."</P>
      <P>Noting that today is a global era, Liu said it is necessary to have an executive
team staffed  by people with international experience and perspective.</P>
      <P>Some of the Cabinet members have worked in other countries and therefore some of
them will inevitably have a green card, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Having a green card should not be seen as having done anything wrong,  Liu
pointed out at a ceremony celebrating  the 121st anniversary of Taiwan's railway
service.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks amid a campaign initiated by opposition Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  lawmakers to question the allegiance of several
officials in the KMT administration who hold, have preciously held, or were
hoping to hold a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Y.P. Shih said it
had been confirmed that no Cabinet members have foreign citizenship and that
some members have already lost their permanent residency status of other
countries.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan and Council for Economic Planning
and Development Chairman Chen Tain-jy previously held green cards, which expired
before they took office May 20, Shih explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Shih  noted  that  Environmental  Protection Administration Minister
Stephen Shen and Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling had held Canadian
permanent residency status.</P>
      <P>Shen said his had expired, while Tai was already in the process of canceling
hers, Shih told a press conference.</P>
      <P>At the conference, Central Personnel Administration Minister Chen Ching-hsiu
said Taiwan's Nationality Act forbids local nationals with foreign nationality
from assuming public office, but does not bar public servants from holding
foreign permanent residency.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that this is because a permanent residency has nothing to do with
being loyal to another nation.</P>
      <P>Although foreign permanent residency is part of the government's screening of
civil servants' loyalty, the premise is whether they enjoy another nation's
benefits, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>The screening results mainly serve as a reference for government agencies and
does not involve any legal issues, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Shih nevertheless said that Liu does not wish to allow any Cabinet member to
have foreign permanent residency, but she added that having such status is not
illegal.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet will decide whether it is necessary to outlaw or ban such a practice
after listening to different sectors' opinions, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is still investigating whether any of its members hold permanent
residency of countries other than the United States, Shih added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU chairman visits MAC head on upcoming cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) chairman called on Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan -- also a TSU member -- at her office
Monday, saying he wanted to know whether the government was well prepared for
the long-expected resumption of talks between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Is the government ready yet? Has it delineated the different roles, functions
and duties that different governmental agencies should play and take on in
handing the resumption of (cross-strait) dialogue? " asked Huang Kun-huei, who
once served as head of the Cabinet-level MAC.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the TSU attaches great importance to the upcoming talks --
scheduled to be reopened this week for the first time since they were suspended
in 1999 -- and expressed the hope that they would lead to the positive
development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Huang  was accompanied  on his visit  to the MAC by TSU Secretary-General Lin
Chih-chia.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lai reiterated that as MAC chairwoman -- the only TSU member
serving in the Cabinet -- her duty is to "safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty and
secure the best interests of the Taiwan people. This is the approach that is
"most commonly affirmed" by the Taiwan people regarding cross-strait affairs and
the country's mainland policy, she said.</P>
      <P>"It is the MAC's duty to do its utmost to seek the broadest consensus" among
people who have different views on cross-strait relations and Taiwan's mainland
policy by trying to harmonize all the different voices, Lai said.</P>
      <P>A former legislator of the pro-independence TSU, Lai faced strong protests
against her appointment from after she was named last month to take over the
helm of the MAC, the top cross-strait policy coordinating unit in the
government.</P>
      <P>Praising Lai as an excellent member of the TSU, Huang said he hopes the cross-
strait exchanges will move in a "positive" direction and that the exchanges will
be proceeded with prudence as "haste makes waste."</P>
      <P>The TSU chairman also said the central government  should strengthen and improve
"vertical" communications with city and county units, noting that the MAC is
mandated only to coordinate with other Cabinet agencies to develop cross-strait
policy,  rather than "execute" policy.</P>
      <P>Huang made the suggestion after Lai was denounced by Kinmen County Magistrate
Lee Chu-feng during his visit to the mainland last week over the MAC's initial
rejection of his application to visit China.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, local government administrators are allowed to
visit China only for international events.</P>
      <P>The MAC initially turned down Lee's application to visit Beijing for a June 5
fund-raising event for Sichuan earthquake victims and other activities, but
later gave approval for the trip after some lawmakers criticized its decision.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the Ministry of the Interior, not the MAC, should be responsible
for approving visits to China by local officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't approves steel plant's expansion, delays power plant project</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/08  19:32:57
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) delayed approval on, but did
not reject a power plant project Monday, while giving the go-ahead for a steel
company's expansion, prompting environmentalists to question the government's
resolve to protect the environment as they said the projects will lead to
increased carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Under the approved project, the Dragon Steel Corp., a subsidiary of the China
Steel Corp. -- the only integrated steel maker in Taiwan -- will extend its
current site of 202.5 hectares in central Taiwan's Taichung County by 77.5
hectares.</P>
      <P>The steel plant's expansion was given conditional approval, provided that the
company take the future Greenhouse Gases Reduction Act into consideration when
expanding its facilities, and try to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 15
percent by 2014, the EPA said in a review meeting.</P>
      <P>In response, Ou Chaur-hwa, chairman of Dragon Steel Corp., promised to meet the
EPA's demands, and said otherwise the company will offset its emissions by means
of buying carbon credit or by reducing output.</P>
      <P>However, trade in carbon credit will not be allowed until after the Greenhouse
Gases Reduction Act is passed.</P>
      <P>As for the power plant project, the EPA's review panel decided to hold off
deciding on the project until more investigations and discussions are carried
out.</P>
      <P>The project involves replacing five clapped-out generator sets with four coal-
fired  generator sets,  to increase electricity generation at a Taiwan Power Co.
plant in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The project sparked strong opposition from environmentalists and the Kaohsiung
city government as coal-fired generators emit more carbon dioxide.</P>
      <P>Lee Ken-cheng,  a representative  of several  environmental protection groups
which oppose the project, argued that per-capita carbon dioxide emission in
Kaohsiung already ranks first in the world with about 34.7 tons, and that
residents of the city live four years fewer than those of Taipei, because their
city has the worst air quality in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We are not opposed to Taipower renewing generator sets, but it should think
about other cleaner energies, such as natural gas, instead of coal, " said Lee
on the sidelines of the EPA's review meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen Kai-ling, acting director of the Environmental Protection Bureau of the
city, agreed: "(The Kaohsiung city government) can only accept one generator
set, so stop the increasing carbon dioxide emission in Kaohsiung."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung's Mayor Chen Chu has also expressed her opposition to the project.</P>
      <P>If the power plant project is approved, it and the steel plant expansion could
lead to a considerable increase of carbon dioxide emissions in the country,
according to environmentalists.</P>
      <P>One environmental group, the Mercy on Earth, said that if the two projects are
passed, an estimated additional 22.5 million tons of carbon dioxide will be
emitted, accounting for 7 percent of Taiwan's total emissions in 2006.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists  on  Monday  questioned  the  government's determination to
follow its policies on sustainable development.</P>
      <P>"If within 20 days after taking office, Ma's administration allows Taiwan's
carbon dioxide emissions to increase by 7 percent, how can it be able to meet
its target, which is to reduce emissions to 2000 levels by 2025? " Mercy on
Earth and the Green Party Taiwan said in a statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NGOs launch campaign to raise awareness of arrhythmia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two  Taipei-based  non-government organizations launched the 2008 Arrhythmia
Awareness Week Monday to increase the general publics awareness of arrhythmia --
a disease of irregular heart beat which could be life threatening.</P>
      <P>In line with the 5th anniversary of the Arrhythmia Alliances annual week-long
event, Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSC) and Taiwan Heart Foundation (THF)
initiated the first ever Arrhythmia Awareness Week in Taiwan to help local
people to learn more about this hard-to-diagnose but potentially deadly disease.</P>
      <P>Having a better understanding of arrhythmia is very important, said Chiang Fu-
tien, executive director of the THF and president of the TSC.Although only less
than five percent of the patients are critical ones, sudden death caused by
arrhythmia is something that should not be overlooked.</P>
      <P>An arrhythmia is an abnormality of the heart beat, in which the heart beats too
fast, too slow or irregularly, affecting its ability to pump blood throughout
the body.</P>
      <P>The disorder involves a problem in the hearts electrical system, which could
cause a change in the regular rhythm of the heart. To enable the heart to beat,
electrical impulses travel through the heart via what is sometimes referred to
as a conduction pathway. Arrhythmia can be as a result of the conduction path
being damaged or blocked, or because an extra pathway is present.</P>
      <P>Lin Chun-li, a doctor at the National Taiwan University Hospital s(NTUHs)
Division of Cardiology, said that arrhythmia may occur at any age, any time, but
is most often a nuisance rather than a serious problem.</P>
      <P>We do not want to cause people to panic,Lin said.</P>
      <P>But he cautioned: "People could experience different symptoms of arrhythmia --
from dizziness, palpitation, blackout, to sudden death."</P>
      <P>Arrhythmia should not be dismissed, and it is always advisable to seek advice
from an appropriate health care professional if one thinks he may have an
arrhythmia," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chang Fang-hsian, a patient suffering from arrhythmia, said she never thought
that heart disease would almost take her life.</P>
      <P>It had never come cross my mind that I would have heart problem because none of
my family member has heart disease and I do not smoke or drink,Chang said.</P>
      <P>She said when she first had a blackout in a sauna, she was not worried, until it
happened again later. This time she was rushed to hospital and the doctor
immediately decided she needed to have a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)
implanted.</P>
      <P>An ICD is a device implanted under the skin and connected to the heart via leads
to send signals to the heart if it beats too slowly or too fast, to help restore
a normal heart rhythm.</P>
      <P>According to the THF, common causes of arrhythmia can include stress, caffeine,
tobacco, alcohol, diet pills and cough and cold medicines. And if ones heart
tissue is damaged as a result of acquired heart disease such as myocardial
infarction (hear attack) or congenital  heart disease,  one may be at risk of
developing arrhythmia.</P>
      <P>First-aid treatment plays an important role in saving patients suffering from
arrhythmia, said Ma Huei-ming, a doctor at the NTUHs Department of Emergency
Medicine.  The first eight minutes are the most critical. With every minute's
delay, the risk for the patient to die increases 10 percent, he
said.Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) needs to be carried out on the patient
until medical personnel arrive.</P>
      <P>During the 2008 Arrhythmia Awareness Week to be held in Taiwan from June 6 to
15, the THF and TSC will hold seminars in Taipei City and Yunlin County in
central Taiwan to promote awareness  of arrhythmia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed hope Monday that talks between the quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) , later this week
will establish systematic channels for continued talks.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while meeting with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, who is in
charge of Taiwan's contacts with China in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Chiang will lead a delegation to Beijing Wednesday for talks with ARATS
officials on the launch of direct cross-strait weekend charter flights and the
opening of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the delegation is the only team with official authorization to
have talks with China and said the talks will have historic meaning, as they
will be the first negotiation since the last bilateral talks a decade ago by
late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and late ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Ma said institutionalized channels are necessary for cross-strait affairs, which
are too complicated to be solved at one time.</P>
      <P>Taking the charter flight issue as an example, Ma said systematic talks will not
only give the opportunity for thorough discussion on weekend charter flights but
will also help extend the negotiations to regular charter flights on weekdays in
the future.</P>
      <P>Chiang told Ma that he will try to seek positive interaction with his Chinese
counterpart without hurting Taiwan's dignity. He also expressed hope that the
delegation will take the first step firmly as a good start in the bilateral
talks.</P>
      <P>The delegation has 19 members, including Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)  Vice
Chairman  Fu Don-cheng  and Deputy  Minister  of Transportation and
Communications Oliver Fang-Lai Yu. The MAC is the Cabinet-level organization
that coordinates the country's China policy.</P>
      <P>Ma said the talks between the two semi-official bodies will achieve positive
results both for Taiwan's development and for bilateral relations.</P>

issue.</P>
      <P>Wang said that neither Presidential Office Secretary-General Chan Chuen-po nor
Presidential  Office Deputy Secretary-General  Yeh Chin-chuan have permanent
residency of other countries.</P>
      <P>Kao Lang, another deputy secretary-general to Ma, "once possessed Canadian
permanent residency but completed procedures to renounce it in early May," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Ho Szu-yin, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, also once
had Canadian permanent residency but has also renounced it, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Chan Man-jung, an adviser to the National Security Council and an expert in
international trade, does have permanent residency, or a green card, from the
United States. He "will take measures to renounce it soon," according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that possessing permanent residency and dual nationality are
two different things and that obtaining permanent residency incurs "no question
of allegiance."</P>
      <P>"It is not a violation of the law for civil servants to have permanent residency
of other countries, " Wang pointed out, adding, however, that because of the
recent controversy over the issue, the Presidential Office has been studying the
situation as it applies to high-ranking administration officials.</P>
      <P>Turning his attention to Academia Sinica, the nation's highest research body,
which reports directly to the Presidential Office, Wang noted that according to
the Nationality Law, Republic of China nationals cannot join the civil service
if they have obtained foreign nationality.</P>
      <P>Exceptions,  however,  are made for presidents of national universities,
teachers in public schools who concurrently serve in administrative positions,
and heads and deputy heads of research institutes. These people have special
skills that are hard to find in Taiwan and their work does not involve national
security, Wang continued.</P>
      <P>Since the president of Academia Sinica can also have foreign nationality
according to the law, the president will respect the academic stature of the
office and "will not conduct a probe" into the nationality status of the
institute's president, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet initiative to sell Chunghwa Telecom shares rejected</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet initiative to sell part of the government's stake in Chunghwa Telecom,
Taiwan's biggest telecom operator, to finance an economic stimulus package was
rejected by the legislature Monday.</P>
      <P>Afraid of losing lucrative annual dividends from the company, lawmakers of both
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  and opposition Democratic Progressive Party refused
to approve the sale of a portion of the 35.65 percent stake in Chunghwa Telecom
owned by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The Cabinet approved an initiative May 30 to sell a 6.9 percent stake in the
telecom giant that would have raised NT$52.79 billion (US$1.73 billion) to help
fund the KMT government's NT$114 billion stimulus plan to boost domestic demand.</P>
      <P>"Releasing  such  a  stake  will  not  jeopardize  the checks-and-balance
mechanism  between company's  ownership  and management, " MOTC Minister Mao
Chi-kuo said as he tried to sell lawmakers on the plan at a legislative hearing.</P>
      <P>He also asserted that the interests of smaller shareholders would not be
threatened.</P>
      <P>To achieve the fund-raising target, the government would have to sell its
holdings at NT$80 per share, but after the stock closed at NT$76.5 on Monday,
some feared there was a risk that the government plan, if carried out, would
fall short of the goal.</P>
      <P>Mao said, however, that the government has backup plans if the share sale did
not succeed.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will consider other possible measures, including capital reduction
and lifting shareholders' return on investment (ROI) to raise the same amount of
money without reducing the government's stake," he said.</P>
      <P>Mao's arguments failed to persuade lawmakers, who ended the hearing with a
resolution to block the share sale out of concern over losses in returns from
the investment, which contributes over NT$10 billion to the national treasury a
year.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also feared that lowering the government's stake in Chunghwa
Telecom to below 30 percent would make it harder for authorities to have
leverage over and supervise Chunghwa Telecom's management.</P>
      <P>Other legislators believed that the sale of government shares will leave the
company vulnerable to speculative "hot money" from abroad, but Mao responded
that local and foreign investors would be regulated.</P>
      <P>"Foreign capital will be limited to 4 percent or lower of Chunghwa Telecom's
total shares, " Kuo said in his failed bid to convince the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The KMT's NT$114 billion (US$ 3.7 billion) stimulus plan proposes allocating
NT$58.3 billion in local construction funds and another NT$20 billion in loans
for local governments to help them complete construction projects and boost
domestic demand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu vowed Monday to make the southern port city cyclist-
friendly amid the trend that is seeing cycling become more popular as oil prices
continue to surge.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during an interpellation session at the Kaohsiung city
council in which Councilor Wu Yi-cheng of the opposition People First Party
asked her to improve the environment for cyclists who use their machines for
commuting or for exercise.</P>
      <P>Wu, who advocates the integration of the mass rapid transit system and cycling,
reiterated the importance of the integration of the two transport methods in an
era of high fuel prices, expressing hope that Kaohsiung City, which has long
been notorious for its heavy pollution due to its high level of
industrialization, can become the most cyclist-friendly city in Asia.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, there are still many impediments to people who wish to cycle in
the city, including many interruptions of bike paths because of heavy traffic,
as well as a lack of parking areas for bicycles.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that the city government should construct overpasses exclusively
for cyclists at places where traffic is at its most heavy, as well as dedicated
parking lots for bicycles.</P>
      <P>In addition,  he also suggested  that public  and private enterprises set up
shower rooms in office buildings for people who commute by bicycle.</P>
      <P>Concerning a NT$30 million (US$990,000) city government plan to set up 20 bike
rental stations around the city, Wu expressed hope that more such facilities can
be established.</P>
      <P>"The city government will do its best to achieve the goal, " Chen said, asking
Wu to offer more suggestions and information for the reference of the city
government.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Kaohsiung, which saw the length of its bicycle path break the
100-km mark in April, will have 200 km of bike paths by the end of next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>A book about a mouse and a spatula hopes to change housewives' lives</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/08  20:44:20</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a country that makes a large proportion of the world's computers and other
high-tech goods, it might surprise some that there are still many people of a
certain segment of the population who do not know how to use the computer --
housewives, but the subjects and the authors of a book launched this week is
trying to change that.</P>
      <P>"When the Mouse Meets the Spatula" is about the trials and tribulations of a
group of housewives in Taiwan who learned how to use the computer.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-ying, a carrot farmer in Jiangjun Township in southern Taiwan's Tainan
County, and one of the characters in the book, on Monday joined the others in
calling on every housewife in Taiwan to "use a spatula and a mouse as well" "to
make their lives complete in the wired, e-commerce world."</P>
      <P>"It's really good to use computers and surf the Internet, " said Chen.</P>
      <P>This is no small statement coming from someone who was computer illiterate only
a few years ago.</P>
      <P>A former accountant great with numbers, Chen quit her job after starting a
family. When she eventually wanted to go back to work, she realized she had been
left behind - office payroll, insurance, utilities and other forms were all
computerized. Not knowing even how to type, much less operate the computer
programs, Chen could no longer work in the profession she had been trained in.
"It seemed that there was no place left for me in the modern world and even a
former accountant like me who had calculating skills down pat was like an
idiot," she recalled.</P>
      <P>"So I decided to learn computers, " Chen said. Computer-teaching cram schools
were not helpful, said the stay-at-home mom, explaining that they were expensive
and were targeted at professionals.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a free computer learning class for beginners offered by Microsoft,
Chen began learning how to use the computer.</P>
      <P>She started by learning how to type Chinese characters on the keyboard via a
Chinese key-in software program named Boshiamy.</P>
      <P>"I worked so hard to learn to type that I keyed in a whole news article that I
found on the Internet everyday," she recalled.</P>
      <P>Now Chen is capable of typing 60 Chinese characters a minute, impressing even
her teenage son.</P>
      <P>After becoming proficient at using the computer and surfing the Internet, Chen
went on to use digital cameras and set up her own blog to share her experiences
on farming, daily life and tourism.</P>
      <P>Chen on Monday appealed to all housewives who do not yet know how to use the
computer to take that necessary step in opening up a whole new world for
themselves and narrowing the "digital gap" between housewives and "the rest of
the world."</P>
      <P>She made the appeal at a party held at Eslite Bookstore in Taipei marking the
launch of the book, which is published by the Taiwan Digital Phoenix Association
on how former computer illiterate women became electronically capable, or even a
computer whiz like Chen.</P>
      <P>The association was founded by Chen and other housewives studying at a computer
class in Tainan County last year.</P>
      <P>The book -- a collection of stories of housewives learning computer operation at
classes offered by Microsoft free of charge in 2005 -- was co-authored and
compiled by Lee An-ni, who is vice president of the economic think-tank Taiwan
Research Institute and daughter of former President Lee Teng-hui; and Lee Shih-
ming, deputy executive director of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Digital Opportunity Center 2.0 Project to promote e-learning in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The aim of the book is to push all housewives, regardless of their age, in
Taiwan to learn how to use computers and get themselves wired.</P>
      <P>"The book showcased the process of Taiwanese housewives struggling with digital
learning, " Lee An-ni said. "Mothers enjoyed higher status at home after they
knew how to operate a computer and how to go to a Web site. They now enjoy even
better chances to return to the job market equipped with computer skills."</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the book launching party, Chu Chu-hsien, wife of Vice President
Vincent Siew, said that she was moved by reading "When the Mouse Meets the
Spatula."</P>
      <P>"The housewives opened for themselves a window to the world by learning
computers," Chu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan records 2nd highest monthly export value in May</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports totaled US$21.38 billion (NT$650 billion) in May, the second
highest monthly amount ever recorded, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The US$21.38 billion in exports, paced by booming exports to other Asian
markets, lagged only behind the US$24.25 billion in exports recorded in March,
MOF statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>"Although the global market has slowed down due to the U. S. subprime mortgage
crisis and skyrocketing crude oil prices, Taiwan's May exports to Asian
economies marked steady growth, which helped Taiwan maintain its export
strength, " said Hsu Ray-lin, deputy director of the MOF's Department of
Statistics.</P>
      <P>The country's May exports to China (including Hong Kong), India, South Korea,
Japan, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) all increased by
more than 23 percent compared with May 2007, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan shipped US$9.64 billion, or 40.9 percent, of its May exports to China,
the country's largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>The U.S.  was Taiwan's  second largest export destination, receiving US$2.57
billion, or 10.9 percent, of the country's exports.</P>
      <P>"However  May exports to the U.S.  were down 3.6 percent year-on-year, " Hsu
said, an indication that Taiwan's export economy is shifting away from the
American market.</P>
      <P>On the negative side, Hsu said the country's exports grew more slowly in the
first five months of the year than imports, but the May figures reversed this
trend.</P>
      <P>Exports rose at a 20.5 percent clip while imports grew 17.6 percent in May
compared to the same month last year, and it marked the sixth consecutive month
that both exports and imports had registered double-digit growth, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>But for the first five months of 2008, the 17.4 percent year-on-year rise in
exports to US$110.19 billion was offset by the 22.4 percent hike in imports,
which totaled US$103.67 billion, MOF statistics showed.</P>
      <P>"The downward trend was due to the 53-percent annualized increase in crude oil
prices, which averaged US$106.48 a barrel in May, " Hsu said, dramatically
higher than the US$63.69 a barrel average recorded in May 2007.</P>
      <P>He said the soaring prices of imported commodities caused Taiwan's trade surplus
to fall to US$6.52 billion between January and May, a steep decline compared to
the US$9.16 billion recorded over the same period last year.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Monday warned Taiwan residents planning
to travel to Hong Kong of the avian flu, where authorities found several
chickens infected with the H5N1 virus.</P>
      <P>"Nationals who plan to go to Hong Kong should avoid any contact with birds and
poultry, " said the CDC in a statement.</P>
      <P>The agency also warned travelers against bringing birds back to Taiwan from
China or Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the bird-flu virus can be found on birds or their
excrement, and can infect humans if it is inhaled or makes contact with a
person's eyes and nose.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong authorities recently found several chickens in retail markets infected
with the H5N1 bird-flu virus. To avoid further contamination, they slaughtered
2,700 chickens and banned the import of live poultry from China.</P>
      <P>Avian flu caused six deaths in Hong Kong in 1997 and no major outbreaks have
occurred there since, according to World Health Organization figures. Taiwan, to
date, has not been seriously affected by the disease.</P>

      <P>Aviation police reported Monday that they have arrested two men who tried to
smuggle heroin worth a combined NT$50 million (US$1.64 million) into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Aviation police said the first case involved a Taiwanese man returning from
Macau at the Taiwan Taoyaun International Airport June 5. The man, surnamed Pan,
tried to cover the 2.2 kilograms of heroin he had hidden around his waist by
wearing a big jacket.</P>
      <P>Police later detected 3.5 kg of heroin in the luggage of a South Korean

      <P>All officials with dual nationality serving in the previous Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration renounced their dual citizenships through
legal procedures, the DPP legislative caucus asserted Monday.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus was responding to charges made by the Kuomintang (KMT)
legislative caucus earlier in the day that the DPP is applying a double standard
to the new KMT administration officials over dual citizenship or U.S. green card
issues.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers  have accused several officials  in the KMT administration of
having held or still holding U.S. green cards and questioned their loyalty to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus, however, said that 21 officials -- including a foreign minister,
a finance minister and an economics minister -- in the previous DPP
administration held dual nationality.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, those DPP officials were citizens of the United States,
the United Kingdom, France and Canada.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus deputy whip Pan Men-an responded that many of the former DPP
officials with dual citizenship were political dissidents who supported Taiwan
independence and were forced into exile during the martial law period under the
former KMT regime's authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>Every one of them had abided by the law in renouncing their foreign citizenship,
Pan said.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-te said those who remained in Taiwan and had dual
citizenship  had also relinquished  their second nationality.</P>
      <P>He said Christine Tsung, a former economics minister who was not a political
dissident, applied to renounce her foreign citizenship before she was sworn in.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's Nationality Act, Tsung had one year to complete the procedures to
abandon her citizenship after taking office, Lai said, but Tsung failed to
complete the procedures because she stepped down after a month and a half on the
job.</P>
      <P>Lai criticized the KMT caucus for attempting to confuse the public and shift

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei called Monday
for widespread public backing for the resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait talks,
but cautioned against a possible bad precedent being set of partisan talks
happening before official negotiations.</P>
      <P>"It is vital that the pertaining government authorities make adequate
preparations for the SEF-ARATS negotiations so as to help bolster bilateral
exchanges and lay a good foundation for the creation of a win-win situation
across the strait," Huang said.</P>
      <P>His comments came as the first talks across the Taiwan Strait in a decade are
scheduled to reopen later this week in Beijing from June 11-14.</P>
      <P>The talks will be conducted by the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) - two semi-official organizations tasked with cross-
strait negotiations in the absence of direct government-to-government contact.</P>
      <P>Although  Huang called  for firm unity for the government delegation in the
cross-strait negotiations, he voiced concern that the communications channels
between Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
would supersede the quasi-official SEF-ARATS dialogue channels.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait negotiations must be conducted exclusively on the official track
to avoid further complications," he insisted.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a summit between KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and Chinese
President Hu Jintao in China last month. Hu also serves as CPC general
secretary.</P>
      <P>The summit focused on two-way cooperation and as it preceded the SEF-ARATS
talks, opposition parties in Taiwan have expressed concerns about whether it was
appropriate for the ruling party to be negotiating with China.</P>
      <P>The KMT-led government, however, has insisted that keeping other channels of
communications with China open are helpful in improving relations and that
ultimately, only government-authorized agencies can negotiate with and reach
agreement with China. OK TO PHRASE LIKE THIS?</P>
      <P>Huang nonetheless expressed his hope for success in the talks.</P>
      <P>He made the comments during a news conference at the TSU headquarters following
a meeting with the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
earlier Monday.</P>
      <P>A former KMT member, Huang once served as MAC chief from 1991-1994 during the
previous Kuomintang (KMT) government.</P>
      <P>Lai is a TSU member and her appointment by President Ma Ying-jeou to the post as
Taiwan's top China policy planner sparked rampant criticism from within the
ruling KMT.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, he called on Lai to gain an understanding of whether the
government sector has readied itself for the reopening of official cross-strait
talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to lure Taiwanese entrepreneurs back home</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Kuomintang legislator on Monday urged the government to lure China-
based Taiwanese entrepreneurs and their NT$4 billion (US$132 billion) in wealth
accumulated overseas to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>John Chih-yang Wu made the appeal at a press conference held at the legislature,
where he announced that he has invited Taiwanese entrepreneurs with operations
in China on a tour of Taiwan's investment environment later this month.</P>
      <P>Wu said many Taiwanese investors love their country despite the efforts of some
to portray them as a group of businessmen interested only in pursuing profits
who do not love their homeland.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese entrepreneurs with investments abroad have played a significant role
in Taiwan's economic development to an extent that nobody can ignore," Wu
argued.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker branded the former ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
economic policy as restrictive and one that impeded many Taiwanese entrepreneurs
from returning home to invest.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to encourage Taiwanese businessmen to return home to
invest by relaxing certain regulations rather than devoting all its effort to
soliciting foreign or Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, a delegation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs with operations around
China will arrive in Taiwan June 11 to inspect the island's investment
environment, including a free-trade airport zone in Taoyuan County, northern
Taiwan, which forms part of President Ma Ying-jeou's 12 major infrastructure
projects.</P>

      <P>Taipei City was ranked as the seventh most economically influential city in Asia
in a newly published study conducted  by MasterCard  Worldwide that ranked the
commercial performance of 75 major cities around the world.</P>
      <P>Taipei City finished 22nd in the world in the 2008 MasterCard Worldwide Centers
of Commerce Index, a result Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said he was not 100
percent satisfied with but could "accept."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference Monday to publicize the results, Hau said he
expected Taipei would make a significant jump forward in the 2009 survey.</P>
      <P>Taipei was included for the first time in the index, an annual study launched in
2007 to evaluate and rank the instrumental role that major cities play in
driving the world economy and in performing critical functions that connect
markets and commerce around the world.</P>
      <P>The Centers of Commerce Index is compiled from research by a MasterCard
Worldwide panel of advisers who identified 75 cities around the world that met
their initial criteria.</P>
      <P>Cities were then rated on seven key factors: legal and political framework;
economic stability; ease of doing business; financial flow; business center;
knowledge creation and information flow; and livability.</P>
      <P>Taipei ranked in the top 25 Centers of Commerce behind the Asian cities of
Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Sydney, and Osaka, and two places ahead of
Shanghai, which jumped eight spots in this year's survey.</P>
      <P>The results confirmed "Asia's prominent role in the global economy, "a
MasterCard Worldwide news release said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taipei ranked second in Asia behind Singapore in the economic
stability category, MasterCard Worldwide said the result indicated that Taipei
has a high-quality economy.</P>
      <P>In terms of knowledge creation and information flow, Taipei finished fifth in
Asia, trailing only Tokyo, Seoul, Osaka and Singapore, reflecting its higher-
quality manpower and transparent information flow, MasterCard Worldwide said.</P>
      <P>London kept its title as the most influential city in the global economy in the
2008 report, followed by New York and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Yuwa Hedrick-Wong, MasterCard Worldwide chief economic adviser in Asia-Pacific,
said the study's results show the growing importance of emerging markets in the
global economy, particularly those in Asia, which enjoy strong economic growth.</P>
      <P>The economist named China and India as emerging powers that are moving the
center of the global economy to Asia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong movie star Jackie Chan became the focus of a rowdy debate Monday when
a joint committee of the Taichung City Council reviewed an addition to the
budget for Taiwan's biggest film festival.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party councilmen Hsiao Chieh, Chen Fu-wen, and
Wang Yue-bin and the ruling Kuomintang's Ting Cheng-chia asked the city not to
invite the star to the 45th Golden Horse Festival and award ceremony, the
equivalent of the Oscars in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Jackie Chan still owes Taiwan's people an apology, " Hsiao said, referring to
the actor-director's description of the shooting of former President Chen Shui-
bian on the eve of the 2004 presidential election as "a big joke, " which Hsiao
said was tantamount to "humiliating all of Taiwan's people."</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian's rival, Lien Chan of the KMT, alleged that the shooting, in
which Chen was slightly injured, was staged to sway the result of the hotly
contested election without providing substantial evidence. Chen won by a razor-
thin margin.</P>
      <P>"If Jackie Chan comes, I will definitely pelt him with eggs, " Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Yun-feng, director of the Taichung City government's
Department of Information, said the incident "was a thing of the past."</P>
      <P>He urged city councilors to look ahead, noting that directors from Hong Kong,
Macau and China will be invited to attend the film gala.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is expecting the arrival of more Chinese tourists next month, he said
the film festival will also help promote the city.</P>
      <P>The central Taiwan city has won the right to host this year's Golden Horse
Award, which will be held on Dec. 6.</P>
      <P>The festival's executive committee estimated that it will cost NT$60 million to
host the event, with NT$15 million coming from the Government  Information
Office,  NT$20 million  from the city government, and the balance coming from
the executive committee.</P>
      <P>Some councilmen, such as Huang Kuo-shu, said the Taichung City government should
not spend money on the project, but rather should ask for more subsidies from
the central government or solicit funds from private sponsors.</P>
      <P>Councilmen Chang Liao Wan-chien and Tseng Chao-jung argued that Taichung hosted
the festival four years ago and can let another city or county sponsor the
festival this time because the event will not do much to help promote Taichung.</P>
      <P>The joint committee ultimately passed a resolution asking the city to ask for
more funding from the central government. It said that if the city could obtain
more funding, then the additional NT$20 million budget would not be needed, but
if no new funding was forthcoming, then the NT$20 million budget would be
passed.</P>
      <P>In an addendum to the resolution, some councilmen asked that the Golden Horse
Award executive committee not invite Jackie Chan to the festival, but a majority
of councilmen present at the meeting said they disagreed with the proposal.</P>

      <P>South Korea on Sunday announced that it will offer some US$10 billion in tax
rebates and subsidies to help low-income earners and enterprises cope with

      <P>The one-year plan -- slated to take effect in July -- will cover about 13.8
million people in South Korea, including 78 percent of the nation's workers who
earn an annual income of less than 36 million won (NT$1.06 million) and self-

reports.</P>
      <P>In addition, fuel price subsidies will be provided to bus drivers, truckers,
farmers, fishermen and those with lower incomes, the reports said.</P>

      <P>Former Government Information Office (GIO) head Shieh Jhy-wey said Monday that
President Ma Ying-jeou and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) should apologize to those
who suffered directly or indirectly under the KMT's oppression of democracy and
human rights when it ruled Taiwan under martial law.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after Taipei prosecutors announced earlier in the day
that they have decided not to act on a slander complaint filed by Ma against
Shieh when Ma was a presidential candidate last July.</P>
      <P>Shieh hinted last July during the presidential campaign that the Harvard-
educated Ma was one of the students tasked by the then KMT authoritarian regime
with monitoring overseas Taiwanese students when he was studying in the United
States in the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>Learning of the prosecutors' decision, Shieh thanked the judicial system for
giving justice an opportunity and that the prosecutors' decision proved that he
had been right from the beginning.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that to him the decision was not about winning or losing, and
that he did not have any joy over the prosecutors' conclusion.</P>
      <P>He noted that back then, Ma chose to stand with an authoritarian regime and
become an accomplice in suppressing democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>As a witness to that era, he has the obligation to testify, he went on.</P>
      <P>Shieh said he cannot accept that the KMT and Ma have never made any confession
or apology and urged them to do so.</P>
      <P>Ma filed a complaint last July, claiming Shieh was guilty of slander, but
prosecutors said Monday that Ma was a presidential candidate at the time and
that his behavior should be subject to public comments.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shieh made the remarks based on an article in a local journal
published in June 2006, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The article quoted Ma as saying that while studying in the U.S., he was quite
active in anti-communist patriotic activities.</P>
      <P>It also said that Ma wrote articles to criticize remarks supporting Taiwan
independence and that he was later rewarded by the then ruling KMT for his
behavior.</P>
      <P>Shieh's remarks against Ma were made based on a public report and his remarks
were reasonable comments, and as a result Shieh would not be indicted over the
allegations, prosecutors said.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will begin a two-stage investigation  into whether government
officials hold permanent residency in foreign countries and will announce the

    <HEADLINE>U.S. has never inspected nuclear waste disposal site: Taipower</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/09/08  23:45:11
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has never inspected a low-level radioactive waste disposal
site in Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, off the southeastern Taiwan coast,
an official of the Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipower spokesman Tu Yueh-yuan was responding to a media report that U.S.
officials inspected the Lanyu low-level radioactive waste disposal site earlier
this year in the company of officials from the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council (AEC) and the state-run Taipower, Taiwan's electricity retailer.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U.S. officials inspected the facility because they
suspected that a new steel structure in the disposal complex was military-
related.</P>
      <P>"The report was not factual, " Tu said, adding that the steel structure has
nothing to do with the military.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that two officials from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Taipei Office visited Lanyu in the company of AEC officials March 8-9. The AIT
is a quasi-official institute authorized by the U.S. government to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>During their visit, Tu said, the U.S. officials indeed toured the new steel
facility at Taipower's low radioactive waste disposal site. But he insisted that
the visit was not prompted by any suspicion of the facility's functions.</P>
      <P>Tu explained that the new steel structure was completed last year to be used in
checking and maintaining barrels used to store the low-level nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>He also said that spent nuclear fuel rods used to power Taipower's three nuclear
power plants are stored in cooling ponds in the plants and are subject to the
inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</P>
      <P>"When we sign reactor procurement contracts with U.S. suppliers, the U.S.
government has demanded that used nuclear fuel rods be subject to monitoring
because they are highly radioactive, " Tu said, aluding to the U.S. concern that
they could be processed for non-peaceful uses.</P>
      <P>He said the IAEA has sent personnel on a regular basis to check the radioactive
waste.</P>
      <P>The Lanyu disposal site mainly accepts low-level solidified radioactive waste
from medical, agricultural, industrial and academic sectors and from Taipower's
three nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The site began to operate in May 1982 and stopped accepting additional nuclear
waste in April 1996. A total of 97,672 barrels are currently stored in 23
trenches on the island.</P>
      <P>Faced with the island's high temperatures, humidity and salty air, some barrels
storing the waste showed signs of corrosion early this year, and the AEC asked
Taipower to re-examine them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The three nuclear power plants currently in operation in Taiwan produced 259
barrels of low-level radioactive  waste in 2007, representing a year-on-year
decline of 21 percent from 2006 when the waste totaled 327 barrels, according to
Taipower tallies.</P>
      <P>Taipower has chosen eight possible sites -- Wanan township on the outlying
Penghu island and seven others in Taiwan proper, including Mudan township in the
southern Pingtung County and Daren and Dawu townships in the eastern county of
Taitung -- to build at least a permanent storage facility for low-level
radioactive waste by 2016.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Monday that it has done a good job in
protecting the nation's fishing ships operating within Taiwan's exclusive
economic zones this year.</P>
      <P>CGA Director General Wang Ginn-wan said that since the beginning of the year,
the CGA has conducted 172 missions involving 2,450 coast guard officers this
year to safeguard the fishing vessels operating in exclusive economic zones
north, east and south of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As long as the fishing vessels have operated within the provisional boundary of
the exclusive economic zones demarcated by Taiwan, there have been no incidents
reported of the ships being impounded by other nations," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when reporting on the operations of the administration at a
legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taiwan's exclusive economic zone overlaps with that of other
neighboring countries, and maintaining the country's sovereignty and fishing
interests have been one of the major tasks of the administration.</P>
      <P>He said that it has sent patrol vessels this year on 98 missions involving 538
personnel to waters where Taiwan's exclusive economic zone overlaps with that of
the Philippines, on 37 missions involving 896 coast guard staff to Taiwan's
exclusive economic zone east of Taiwan, and on 46 missions involving 1,016 coast
guard personnel to waters where Taiwan's economic exclusive zone overlaps with
that of Japan.</P>
      <P>A CGA report said that Taiwan-Japan fishing disputes hit their peak every year
between April and July, during the black tuna harvest period.</P>
      <P>To limit potential altercations at sea, the report said the Coast Guard has
followed past practice in sending vessels to several key waters to protect
fishing vessels beginning in April.</P>
      <P>Wang urged fishing ships to stay clear of controversial waters when operating at
sea, saying that "as long as they stay within the demarcated line, the CGA will
safeguard their operational safety and fishing rights."</P>
      <P>If they are caught in controversial waters, the dispute will have to be resolved
through diplomatic dialogue and fishery negotiations, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two Cabinet members have foreign residency rights: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Background checks on Cabinet members revealed that two officials hold residency
rights in another country and none have foreign citizenship, Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two officials are Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling, who has
permanent resident status in Canada but has applied to give it up; and Overseas
Compatriot Affairs Commission Deputy Minister Hsu Chen-jung, who is a permanent
resident of the Philippines, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu said the Cabinet will soon carry out similar checks on diplomatic officials
and will focus especially on whether they hold U.S. permanent residency rights.</P>
      <P>The checks were conducted and completed  Monday after the opposition  Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  challenged the allegiance of several officials in the
KMT administration who either once held a U.S. green card, allegedly still hold
a U.S. green card, or have applied for a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>The Nationality  Act forbids  ROC nationals  with  foreign citizenship from
assuming public office and requires those with foreign citizenship to be removed
from their posts. The law, however, does not forbid public servants from holding
permanent resident status in a foreign country.</P>
      <P>The issue ballooned after Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou,
responding to a related media report, admitted last week that he obtained U.S.
permanent resident status in 2005 when he was the ROC ambassador to Guatemala,
but renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position May
20.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling claimed that two other members of the
Cabinet still hold a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Also, she said Jason Yuan, the incoming ROC representative to the United States,
applied for permanent residence in the United States in 2004, and she claimed he
is on a green card waiting list.</P>
      <P>Issuing a statement in the United States Friday, Yuan said he did apply for U.S.
permanent residence in 2004 but officially filed for a termination of the
application process early this month.</P>
      <P>The DPP also targeted President Ma Ying-jeou during the run-up to the March 22
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Responding to the DPP's doubts, Ma admitted that he obtained a U.S. green card
while studying in the United States in the 1970s. He noted, however, that he has
used a U.S. tourist visa instead of his green card to enter the United States
since the mid-1980s, a move he said is equal to renouncing his permanent
resident status.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Government Information Office (GIO) head Shieh Jhy-wey said Monday that
President Ma Ying-jeou and the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) should apologize to those
who suffered directly or indirectly under the KMT's oppression of democracy and
human rights when it ruled Taiwan under martial law.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after Taipei prosecutors announced earlier in the day
that they have decided not to act on a slander complaint filed by Ma against
Shieh when Ma was a presidential candidate last July.</P>
      <P>Shieh hinted last July during the presidential campaign that the Harvard-
educated Ma was one of the students tasked by the then KMT authoritarian regime
with monitoring overseas Taiwanese students when he was studying in the United
States in the late 1970s.</P>
      <P>Learning of the prosecutors' decision, Shieh thanked the judicial system for
giving justice an opportunity and that the prosecutors' decision proved that he
had been right from the beginning.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that to him the decision was not about winning or losing, and
that he did not have any joy over the prosecutors' conclusion.</P>
      <P>He noted that back then, Ma chose to stand with an authoritarian regime and
become an accomplice in suppressing democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>As a witness to that era, he has the obligation to testify, he went on.</P>
      <P>Shieh said he cannot accept that the KMT and Ma have never made any confession
or apology and urged them to do so.</P>
      <P>Ma filed a complaint last July, claiming Shieh was guilty of slander, but
prosecutors said Monday that Ma was a presidential candidate at the time and
that his behavior should be subject to public comments.</P>
      <P>In addition, Shieh made the remarks based on an article in a local journal
published in June 2006, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>The article quoted Ma as saying that while studying in the U.S., he was quite
active in anti-communist patriotic activities.</P>
      <P>It also said that Ma wrote articles to criticize remarks supporting Taiwan
independence and that he was later rewarded by the then ruling KMT for his
behavior.</P>
      <P>Shieh's remarks against Ma were made based on a public report and his remarks
were reasonable comments, and as a result Shieh would not be indicted over the
allegations, prosecutors said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. has never inspected nuclear waste disposal site: Taipower</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
06/10/08  12:32:17
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has never inspected a low-level radioactive waste disposal
site in Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, off the southeastern Taiwan coast,
an official of the Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipower spokesman Tu Yueh-yuan was responding to a media report that U.S.
officials inspected the Lanyu low-level radioactive waste disposal site earlier
this year in the company of officials from the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council (AEC) and the state-run Taipower, Taiwan's electricity retailer.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U.S. officials inspected the facility because they
suspected that a new steel structure in the disposal complex was military-
related.</P>
      <P>"The report was not factual, " Tu said, adding that the steel structure has
nothing to do with the military.</P>
      <P>He confirmed that two officials from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
Taipei Office visited Lanyu in the company of AEC officials March 8-9. The AIT
is a quasi-official institute authorized by the U.S. government to handle
relations with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>During their visit, Tu said, the U.S. officials indeed toured the new steel
facility at Taipower's low radioactive waste disposal site. But he insisted that
the visit was not prompted by any suspicion of the facility's functions.</P>
      <P>Tu explained that the new steel structure was completed last year to be used in
checking and maintaining barrels used to store the low-level nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>He also said that spent nuclear fuel rods used to power Taipower's three nuclear
power plants are stored in cooling ponds in the plants and are subject to the
inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</P>
      <P>"When we sign reactor procurement contracts with U.S. suppliers, the U.S.
government has demanded that used nuclear fuel rods be subject to monitoring
because they are highly radioactive, " Tu said, aluding to the U.S. concern that
they could be processed for non-peaceful uses.</P>
      <P>He said the IAEA has sent personnel on a regular basis to check the radioactive
waste.</P>
      <P>The Lanyu disposal site mainly accepts low-level solidified radioactive waste
from medical, agricultural, industrial and academic sectors and from Taipower's
three nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The site began to operate in May 1982 and stopped accepting additional nuclear
waste in April 1996. A total of 97,672 barrels are currently stored in 23
trenches on the island.</P>
      <P>Faced with the island's high temperatures, humidity and salty air, some barrels
storing the waste showed signs of corrosion early this year, and the AEC asked
Taipower to re-examine them as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The three nuclear power plants currently in operation in Taiwan produced 259
barrels of low-level radioactive  waste in 2007, representing a year-on-year
decline of 21 percent from 2006 when the waste totaled 327 barrels, according to
Taipower tallies.</P>
      <P>Taipower has chosen eight possible sites -- Wanan township on the outlying
Penghu island and seven others in Taiwan proper, including Mudan township in the
southern Pingtung County and Daren and Dawu townships in the eastern county of
Taitung -- to build at least a permanent storage facility for low-level
radioactive waste by 2016.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA has done good job in protecting fishing ships</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Monday that it has done a good job in
protecting the nation's fishing ships operating within Taiwan's exclusive
economic zones this year.</P>
      <P>CGA Director General Wang Ginn-wan said that since the beginning of the year,
the CGA has conducted 172 missions involving 2,450 coast guard officers this
year to safeguard the fishing vessels operating in exclusive economic zones
north, east and south of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As long as the fishing vessels have operated within the provisional boundary of
the exclusive economic zones demarcated by Taiwan, there have been no incidents
reported of the ships being impounded by other nations," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks when reporting on the operations of the administration at a
legislative committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that Taiwan's exclusive economic zone overlaps with that of other
neighboring countries, and maintaining the country's sovereignty and fishing
interests have been one of the major tasks of the administration.</P>
      <P>He said that it has sent patrol vessels this year on 98 missions involving 538
personnel to waters where Taiwan's exclusive economic zone overlaps with that of
the Philippines, on 37 missions involving 896 coast guard staff to Taiwan's
exclusive economic zone east of Taiwan, and on 46 missions involving 1,016 coast
guard personnel to waters where Taiwan's economic exclusive zone overlaps with
that of Japan.</P>
      <P>A CGA report said that Taiwan-Japan fishing disputes hit their peak every year
between April and July, during the black tuna harvest period.</P>
      <P>To limit potential altercations at sea, the report said the Coast Guard has
followed past practice in sending vessels to several key waters to protect
fishing vessels beginning in April.</P>
      <P>Wang urged fishing ships to stay clear of controversial waters when operating at
sea, saying that "as long as they stay within the demarcated line, the CGA will
safeguard their operational safety and fishing rights."</P>
      <P>If they are caught in controversial waters, the dispute will have to be resolved
through diplomatic dialogue and fishery negotiations, he added.</P>

within her term.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at the Kaohsiung City
Council when Councilor Lin Kuo-chuan of the ruling Kuomintang urged the mayor to
attach importance to the employment and settlement of indigenous peoples so as
not to "let them down in their high expectations of the city government."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the port city is richer and more beautiful because of its
cultural diversity, and she urged Commission of Indigenous Affairs (CIA) head
Eteng Ingay to heed Lin's views so that the park can be completed by the time
her term ends in 2010.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that 12,000 indigenous people currently residing in Kaohsiung have not
had a suitable assembly place for a long time.</P>
      <P>Lin asked the CIA to plan and select a plot of land on which to build the
multifunctional cultural park and assembly hall for the aborignals soon.</P>
      <P>Lin also criticized a 2008 aboriginal harvest festival sponsored by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) Deputy Minister Hsu Chen-jung said
Tuesday he will visit the Philippines soon to complete the formalities of
renouncing his permanent residency rights there.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who was posted by the OCAC to the Philippines 19 years ago, said he
obtained a special resident retiree's visa issued by the Philippine Retirement
Authority for foreign retirees before he was transferred by the OCAC back to
Taiwan four to five years ago.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that although his residency rights will be automatically invalidated if
he does not return to the Philippines before his visa expires in September, he
will complete the formalities as soon as possible "so as not to cause any
trouble to the Cabinet."</P>
      <P>Hsu explained that he did not do so before assuming his present position because
the country's law does not forbid public servants from holding permanent
resident status in another country, although they are not allowed to hold
foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party has challenged the allegiance  of
several  officials  in  the  Kuomintang  (KMT) administration who either once
held U.S. permanent residency rights, allegedly still hold a U.S. green card, or
have applied for a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Cabinet required its members to fill out
questionnaires  Monday to disclose whether they have permanent residency status
in any foreign country.</P>
      <P>The checks revealed that Hsu is one of two officials who hold foreign residency
rights. The other is Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling, who has
permanent resident status in Canada but has applied to cancel it.</P>
      <P>In a bid to address the issue in a more systematic way, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-
sheng unveiled his plan over the weekend to push for an amendment to the
Nationality Act to set out clear guidelines on whether public servants are
allowed to hold permanent resident status in another country.</P>
      <P>The amendment should introduce a disclosure system and state the types and ranks

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it will provide all
necessary assistance to 16 Taiwanese rescued from a fishing boat that sank after
colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>"Lee Ming-tzung, the ministry's representative in Naha, has rushed to visit the
16 Taiwanese and has requested the local overseas Taiwanese leader to take care
of them, " said MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese  fishing boat with three crew members and 13 recreational fishermen
sank around 3: 38 a.m. local time some 6 nautical miles southwest of the
Tiaoyutai Islands, or Senkaku Islands in Japanese, after colliding with a Japan
coast guard patrol boat.</P>
      <P>The Japanese vessel Koshiki was on a routine patrol near the disputed islands in
the East China Sea when the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>Reuters reported that the two boats collided when the Taiwanese fishing boat
suddenly changed direction as the Japanese vessel attempt to check its name.
Other reports said the accident happened as the Japanese coast guard vessel was
chasing down the Taiwanese boat.</P>
      <P>But the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said details of the accident remained
unclear and that it was still investigating the collision.</P>
      <P>Yeh would only confirm that the captain was slightly injured and all 16 people
rescued were taken to Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawan chain some 200
kilometers south of the disputed islands.</P>
      <P>She added that Taiwan's representative office in Tokyo has also expressed its
concern to its counterpart and will work with the Japanese government to clarify
responsibility for the incident.</P>
      <P>"Our stance is that the ministry hopes to bring back the 16 people as soon as
possible, and clarify who is responsible for the accident and the matter of
indemnification," she said.</P>
      <P>Based on the principles of rationality and peace, the MOFA hopes that the
Japanese government will reopen bilateral talks with Taiwan over the disputed
islands.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands were seized by Japan in 1895 when it colonized
Taiwan. Tokyo continues to exert control, though both Taiwan and China also
claim sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The United States controlled the islands in World War II and returned them to
Japan in 1972 along with Okinawa, despite protests from Taipei and Beijing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has decided to file the country's first-ever complaint with the World
Trade Organization (WTO), joining with Japan and the U.S. in seeking the
elimination of European Union tariffs on certain Information Technology (IT)
products, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, the EU has imposed import duties as high as 14 percent on 19-inch or
larger liquid crystal displays (LCDs), set top boxes and multifunctional
printers, by categorizing them as electrical appliances instead of IT products.</P>
      <P>Under the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) , signed by 70 countries
responsible for 97 percent of the world's IT trade, IT products are supposed to
enjoy duty free treatment.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said in a statement Tuesday that following May 28 requests from the
U.S. and Japan to investigate and rule on the EU tariffs, Taiwan had decided to
join hands with the two countries and become one of the plaintiffs in the case.</P>
      <P>The WTO's trade dispute settlement procedure, often regarded as "the world court
of trade, " is vital for enforcing the rules and therefore for ensuring that
trade flows smoothly, but Taiwan has never been a party to any trade dispute,
apart from participating in other members' litigation as a third party.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it will soon follow the procedure to request a negotiation
with the EU.</P>
      <P>"If such a bid fails to resolve the dispute, Taiwan will request the WTO to
establish a court of trade and file a motion for a lawsuit," the ministry said
in the statement.</P>
      <P>Citing the global reach of Taiwan's IT industry, which has already been hurt by
the EU tariffs, the statement said local IT vendors might be forced to move
overseas if the ministry fails to take action to eliminate the EU import duties.</P>
      <P>"In the future, U.S. and Japanese brands could be forced to seek procurement
deals with Eastern European suppliers, " the statement warned in describing the
potential impact of not pursuing the case.</P>
      <P>The interests of Taiwan's LCD makers have been hurt by the EU duties more than
other local industrial sector, as the EU has collected as much as NT$19.6
billion (US$650 million) in import duties on Taiwanese LCD exports, valued at
NT$140 billion, according to official figures.</P>
      <P>The U.S. estimated that US$70 billion of its own trade interests were at stake
due to the EU tariffs, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>To protect such interests, the ministry has conducted scores of discussions with
various government and private stakeholders over the past year to evaluate all
possible options in handling the trade disputes, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also said a legal team specializing in trade issues has been
exchanging ideas regarding the case with the U.S. and Japan's WTO
representatives in preparation for the trade litigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislator wants number of Examination Yuan members cut in half</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Tuesday that he
will propose an amendment that would cut the number of Examination Yuan members
in half.</P>
      <P>Tsai expressed the hope that the amendment would be passed during the current
legislative session, which will be extended to July 18, "to help streamline
personnel and save money."</P>
      <P>He noted that he proposed to cut the number of Examination Yuan members in half
three years ago, but the proposal failed because the administration of then
President Chen Shui-bian would not agree to it.</P>
      <P>He said the Examination Yuan has a president, a vice president and 19 members,
which he said "outnumber the ministers without portfolio under the Executive
Yuan, " and that "they are paid more than legislators."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, an Examination Yuan member receives NT$5 million (US$163,940)
in direct and indirect payments annually. Cutting the number of members in half
will save the government NT$50 million annually.</P>
      <P>With the Presidential Office's current "lunch box culture" underscoring the
values of simplicity and frugality, the Examination Yuan should follow the lead
of the Legislative Yuan to cut its number in half, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The legislature that was installed in February saw its number of seats reduced
to 113 from the previous 225.</P>
      <P>He also said that because a lot of people aspire to serve as Examination  Yuan
members,  the Presidential  Office  is under "tremendous pressure" in coming up
with nominees.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Presidential Office's screening panel is in the process of
vetting possible aspirants for the reference of President Ma Ying-jeou, "it is
high time to propose the amendment, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He urged the Presidential Office not to interfere with his proposal, saying that
if the number of the Examination Yuan is cut in half, "it will be more in line
with mainstream public opinion."</P>
      <P>Under the ROC Constitution, the Examination Yuan is one of the five yuans
(branches) of the government.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan is responsible for the nation's civil service system. It
oversees examinations, qualification screenings, security of tenure, pecuniary
aid in case of death and retirement issues related to public servants.</P>
      <P>It also handles all legal matters related to the employment, discharge,
performance evaluation, salary scale, promotion, transfer, commendation and the
presenting of awards to civil servants.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan president, vice president and 19 members are appointed to
six-year terms by the president of the state with the approval of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The term of the incumbent members will expire at the end of August this year.
President Ma Ying-jeou is expected to present his nomination list to the
legislature for confirmation later this month.</P>

06/10/08  16:56:04
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has asked the Legislative Yuan to provide
letters of consent from legislators that would enable it to investigate whether
any of them have foreign nationality.</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Tuesday that the appeal was made
after the legislature asked the ministry the previous day to perform this check.
The Legislative Yuan's request included personal data on all lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Yeh said, the ministry asked lawmakers to provide English letters of consent
because such checks involve personal privacy issues.</P>
      <P>She added that the ministry also asked the lawmaking body to narrow down the
number of countries it wanted the ministry to check, as there are nearly 200
nations in the world and each has its own laws and administrative procedures.</P>
      <P>"If the Legislative Yuan can name certain countries for us to investigate first,
it would be more specific, practical and time- effective," she said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is now undergoing a two-stage investigation into whether government
officials hold permanent residency in foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The first-stage, which focused on all ministry heads, found that two officials
hold residency rights in another country and none have foreign citizenship.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the Cabinet will soon carry out similar checks on
diplomatic officials and will focus especially on whether they hold U.S.
permanent residency status, or green cards.</P>
      <P>In response, Yeh said the MOFA will discuss and decide on an appropriate measure
for background checks as soon as possible in accordance with the Cabinet's
instruction.</P>
      <P>The investigation of foreign residency status comes as opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers are challenging the allegiance of several
officials in the Kuomintang administration over dual citizenship and U.S. green
card issues.</P>
      <P>The issue gained the spotlight last week after Foreign Minister Francisco H.L.
Ou apologized for obtaining a U.S. green card in 2005 when he was the ROC
ambassador to Guatemala. He said he officially renounced the status one month
before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids Republic of China nationals with foreign citizenship
from assuming public office and requires those with foreign citizenship to be
removed from their posts. The law, however, does not forbid public servants from
holding permanent resident status in a foreign country.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has come under fire from the opposition,
which argues that green card-holding officials may not be loyal to the country.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung municipal government said Tuesday that it will offer free rides on
the city's public buses every Thursday between June 12 and September 14 to
encourage residents of the southern port city to use public transportation more.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the municipal government's Transportation Bureau said that
it will also offer free passenger service on the city's special tourist buses
every weekend and on holidays during the period.</P>
      <P>The "green Thursday" free passenger service on the city's 82 public bus lines
and six tourist  bus lines is part of the government's efforts to promote energy
conservation and carbon emission reduction, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>The free service is expected to cost the city about NT$30 million (US$988,500)
for the three months, but it is estimated that the program will help reduce
carbon emissions by about 170 tons in the three months, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said last week that the municipal government is also
mulling offering free MRT service for one day a week during the summer months,

      <P>The foreign ministry has reminded its offices in South Africa to enhance
security precautions and diplomats to pay extra attention to their personal
safety after one of its offices was robbed by three armed bandits June 6, a
ministry spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou
had placed a phone call to the Taipei Liaison Office in Pretoria a day after the
incident to express his concern over victims of the robbery.</P>
      <P>The robbery occurred at Taiwan's liaison office which located in a district
along with a number of other embassies and consulates.</P>
      <P>As a staffer prepared to get into a car driven by a family member in a parking
lot belonging to the office, three armed robbers appeared suddenly, beating them
and ransacking the office afterwards.</P>
      <P>The trio made away with an estimated 40,000 South African rand (US$6,000), Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>During the robbery, a security guard stationed at the office was severely
injured but is now recovering after being hospitalized, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The liaison office has reported the case to the local police authorities and the
foreign affairs ministry in South Africa, and it hopes the country will step up
public security, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The incident was not an isolated event, as many other country's embassies in
South Africa have frequently reported cases of their people being attacked or
premises being robbed.</P>
      <P>Despite the country's poor security record, Taiwanese officials stationed in the
country should still stick to their posts and continue to increase the safety
awareness of Taiwanese businessmen and expatriates in the country by
distributing safety manuals and other effective means.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan has three liaison offices in South Africa. In addition to the
office in Pretoria, there is also one in Cape Town and the other one in
Johannesburg, Yeh noted.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday he will not ask Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H.L. Ou to leave the Cabinet just because he held a U.S. green card.</P>
      <P>Liu said it was "improper" for Ou to hold U.S. permanent resident status when he
was an ambassador of the Republic of China but that he "would give Minister Ou a
chance" now that Ou has apologized over the incident.</P>
      <P>"I've never thought holding a green card has anything to do with the allegiance
issue. It only matters if someone has pledged allegiance to another country, "
Liu said during an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan, replying to
questions by a group of opposition Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)
lawmakers,  who continued to demand that Ou step down over the incident.</P>
      <P>Responding to a related media report, Ou admitted last week that he obtained a
U.S. green card in 2005 when he was the ROC ambassador to Guatemala, but
renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislators Huang Sue-ying, Lin Shu-fen and Tien Chiu-chin argued that Ou's
possession of a U.S. green card "trampled upon the country's dignity" because as
an ROC ambassador, he represented the country and its head of state.</P>
      <P>The legislators insisted Ou is unfit for the position of minister of foreign
affairs, arguing that hiding the fact that he obtained a U.S. green card while
serving as an ambassador showed "there are flaws with his allegiance and
professionalism."</P>
      <P>Liu said that while existing law only forbids public servants from holding
foreign citizenship but does not prohibit them from holding permanent residency
rights in another country, he has "adopted a higher standard"  by requiring
Cabinet members to relinquish any permanent resident status they have in a
foreign country.</P>
      <P>He said anyone who refuses to do so "can opt not to join our Cabinet."</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that all Cabinet members were required to disclose whether they
held any foreign citizenship before assuming office May 20 and that they were
further asked on Monday to disclose if they have foreign permanent residency
rights.</P>
      <P>Liu said he thinks giving up the green card is a kind of "sacrifice" for the
holders because "they are sacrificing their travel convenience at the very
least."</P>
      <P>Liu denied having said "holding a green card means a person has global view," as
legislators claimed.</P>
      <P>Also, Liu disagreed with legislators who argued that "persons with a green card
are preparing to flee the country."</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that the Cabinet will receive a "passing"
grade if inflation is kept at or below 3.3 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Liu said that his Cabinet, which was installed May 20, wants to boost the
overall economy while holding consumer price increases to 3.3 percent by the end
of this year.</P>
      <P>If the goal is met, then "it will be considered a passing and satisfactory
score," the premier said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a question from legislator Tien Chiu-chin of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party on whether he would introduce tax rebates,
following the lead of the three other "Asian Tigers."</P>
      <P>Tien noted that South Korea has followed the lead of Singapore and Hong Kong in
announcing a US$10 billion stimulus package to aid cash-strapped households and
businesses.</P>
      <P>South Korean Prime Minister Han Seung Soo announced income-tax rebates for
three-quarters of South Korea's 13 million workers, and subsidies for truckers,
farmers and fishermen struggling with soaring fuel costs.</P>
      <P>Tien said that Taiwan is the only tiger which has yet to announce an tax rebate
program.</P>
      <P>Declaring her opposition to the Cabinet's newly unveiled economic stimulus plan,
Tien contended that expanding domestic demand could cause the public and private
sectors to vie for raw materials and trigger inflation.</P>
      <P>She was also opposed to the "Love Taiwan" 12 major development projects promoted
by President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"The economic stimulus project will only deepen the public misery index, " Tien
said in asking the premier why he will not use tax rebates to replace domestic
demand expansion.</P>
      <P>The premier said that Taiwan's top economic planning body, the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , had weighed many options.</P>
      <P>"The CEPD decided to opt for the expansion of domestic demand, subsidies to
compensate for higher fuel prices and the expected arrival of Chinese tourists
to stimulate the economy," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Considering the possible impact on inflation, the 12 major development projects
will also not be launched this year, " the premier continued.</P>
      <P>After a six-month freeze on gasoline prices by the previous administration, the
KMT administration unveiled a 12.5 percent increase in the price of gasoline
late last month, which has fueled new inflation worries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CDC reports Taiwan's 5th enterovirus fatality this year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 2-year-old boy in the central county of Taichung has died of serious
enterovirus infection, making him the country's fifth victim of the disease so
far this year, the Department of Health (DOH) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will hold a news conference later in
the day to announce whether an enterovirus outbreak alert and the response level
will be raised.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus  is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract
and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and
can cause serious illness, especially in infants and the immuno-compromised.</P>
      <P>When the country's fourth enterovirus-related  fatality was reported in late
May, CDC officials said if one more deadly case occurs, the DOH will raise the
alert level against this ailment and set up a Cabinet-level epidemic response
command center to contain further spread of the disease, with DOH Minister Lin
Fang-yue as the top commander.</P>
      <P>Following the toddler's death, Taichung County's first this year, Chu Nien-feng,
director of the county's health department, said any daycare center or
kindergarten in the county that reports two enterovirus cases in a week should
be closed for one week for disinfection.</P>
      <P>If a second deadly case is reported in the county, Chu said, any daycare center
and kindergarten that reports a serious enterovirus case should suspend
operations for one week.</P>
      <P>The scourge of serious type EV71 enterovirus this year first occurred in
Kaohsiung city and county and in Pingtung city and county, gradually spreading
northward, with the number of confirmed serious cases rising swiftly to 136 as
of June 3, while fatalities had doubled from two to four by the end of May. All
four victims were infected with the same enterovirus strain-- EV71.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-chuan, director of the infectious disease control department at Cheng
Kung National University Hospital, said last month that this year might see a
major enterovirus outbreak, with the number of serious EV71 cases probably
surging to 300 by June. The spread of the disease tends to peak in mid-June.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan could experience a major enterovirus outbreak once
every 10 years and 2008 could be part of that cycle.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases were
documented  and there have been no serious enterovirus outbreaks reported since
2005.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top policy coordinator of cross-
Taiwan Strait affairs -- is working to review the possibility of relaxing
restrictions on cross-strait exchanges, in line with a directive from Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan, MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The review focuses on areas such as raising the ceiling on local enterprises'
investment in China, opening up Taiwan to visits by Chinese business and
professional personnel, permitting domestic banks to open branch offices in
China,  and allowing Chinese investments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai made the disclosure during her first meeting with Taiwanese business people
operating in China, since she took office May 20.</P>
      <P>Lai, whose appointment as head of the MAC drew criticisms because of her pro-
independence background, assured the entrepreneurs that the new government is
taking steps to normalize cross-strait economic and trade relations overall.</P>
      <P>In her short address to the group, Lai said she expects the two sides will hold
talks on other sensitive issues, such as direct air and marine links, investment
protection and reciprocal taxation exemption, soon after the upcoming dialogue
between two intermediary bodies on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The long-expected  talks between Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will be held
in Beijing June 11-14, with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his deputy Kao
Koong-lian at the head of the Taiwan negotiating team.</P>
      <P>Lai described the first dialogue between the two quasi-official organizations
since 1991 as "a key step toward positive exchanges and mutual trust between the
two sides."</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Lai also said that the MAC has completed its evaluation, as
requested by the premier, on the possible opening the "mini three links" between
Taiwan and China to all residents on Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>"Our evaluation concluded that the policy will benefit people living on the
outlying islands and on Taiwan proper, " she said. "It is logical to normalize
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges by first expanding the 'three mini
links.'"</P>
      <P>Lai said that other relevant authorities are preparing for the expansion, and
she expects all preparatory work to be completed within 10 days and submitted to
the Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu announced last Friday that within two weeks, the Executive Yuan will
open direct shipping links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and several
ports in China's Fujian Province to all Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>Currently, the direct transportation routes are only open to people with
household registrations on Kinmen and Matsu and Taiwanese business people
working in Fujian. The routes allow the islands' residents to travel to mainland
China without having to take the longer and more expensive indirect air routes
via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Expansion of the mini links to include all Taiwan's people was one of President
Ma Ying-jeou's main campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The mini links were initiated in January 2001 to alleviate the inconvenience of
travel between Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>A rice exhibition aimed at allowing the general public to better understand the
process of turning rice plants into food opened Tuesday at the Changhua County
Indigenous Peoples Cultural Artifacts Exhibition Hall and will run through Sept.
30.</P>
      <P>At the opening ceremony, Changhua County Deputy Magistrate Chang Juei-bin, along
with a centenarian Ku Shan-mei and a group of children, planted rice seedlings
in experimental plots outside the hall to gain an experience of the work of
farmers.</P>
      <P>Chang said the central county has been a big granary in Taiwan, with its output
accounting for one fifth of the country's total rice production.</P>
      <P>"Through the exhibition, visitors will be able to gain a better understanding of
how rice grains become a soft and tasty food," Chang added.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being presented under five different themes -- "rice and our
lives, " "the origin, development and cultivation of rice agriculture," "rice
varieties in Taiwan, " "farm labor and farming tools," and "the growing stages
of the rice plant."</P>
      <P>The organizers hope that visitors to the exhibition will become more aware of
the value of rice and of the hardship farmers endure to produce the grain.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was organized by the Changhua County Government and sponsored by
the Tainan-based National Museum of Taiwan History and the National Museum of

    <HEADLINE>4 convenience stores to stop giving disposal chopsticks unless asked</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting July, four major convenience store chains in Taiwan will stop giving
away disposal chopsticks randomly, the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Shun-chin,  director of the EPA's Department  of Waste Management, said that
7-ELEVEN, FamilyMart, Hi-Life and Ok Stores will soon post signs informing
patrons that they will not take the initiative in giving customers disposable
chopsticks.</P>
      <P>But if the patrons ask for them, then the stores will give the utensils to
customers who purchase food for free as they have done in the past, Ho said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the new approach will reduce the use of chopsticks by 36
million pairs, or 300 tons of chopsticks in six months. Ho said that translates
to preventing the logging of 10,000 20-year-old trees and the emission of 2.8
million tons of carbon dioxide a year.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwanese people use 5 billion pairs of disposal chopsticks, or
38,000 tons, a year in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the number of chopsticks saved by the four convenience chain stores in
six months will account for only a fraction of the total, Ho said, "it still
sets an exemplary example."</P>
      <P>She said that according to an online survey conducted by the Consumers'
Foundation last month, only 9.6 percent of Taiwanese people polled said that
they do not carry reusable chopsticks with them, while 80 percent said that they
have between one to three pairs of reusable chopsticks.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the EPA in November 2006, nearly 20 percent
of the people surveyed said they always bring their own dining utensils when
they eat out, showing that the public has formed the habit of not wasting
disposable utensils.</P>
      <P>Ho said that her department is also coordinating with the four convenience
stores to take the initiative to reduce the use of disposable cups, soft drink
cups or to provide discounts to patrons who carry their own cups.</P>
      <P>In response, the chain stores said that they will study the EPA's view and will
make plans for such a program in the future.</P>
      <P>Ho said that in view of the public's habit of usually buy soft drinks on the
spur, not yet developing the custom of carrying their own cups, the EPA has
therefore not set a timetable for phasing out disposable cups. enditem/cs</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's flat panel display manufacturers, despite their world-leading status,
should develop their upstream technologies  such as exploration  of advanced
materials  and facilities, a market analyst said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The South Korean government  has been the locomotive  of technology development
in the industry, helping its display makers, from upstream to downstream, to
form an all-around supply chain, " said David Chen, a senior industry analyst at
the Institute for Information Industry (III), a local private think tank.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar held by the III, Chen said that at present, Taiwan and
South Korea are the front runners in the global flat panel display market, with
the latter perhaps taking the lead in the fundamental research that is the roots
of the industry.</P>
      <P>"Focusing on the research of upstream technologies such as finding  better-
quality  materials  or  upgrading  manufacturing facilities, the Korean
companies have the advantage when it comes to industry upgrading, " he said,
referring to Korean giants LG and Samsung.</P>
      <P>The analyst said that until now, Taiwan's flat panel display industry has
focused on original equipment and design manufacturing rather than upstream
technologies that would upgrade its products.</P>
      <P>"However, the government has begun to build the cornerstones of the industry,
collaborating with private research labs such as the Industrial Technology
Research Institute," he went on.</P>
      <P>These efforts, Chen said, will help local makers integrate their high-level
technologies to develop innovative applications, of which he cited multi-touch
panels and 3-D displays as the new generation of display products.</P>
      <P>Panel displays have been the mainstay products in Taiwan's photonic industry,
generating NT$1.6 trillion (US$52.6 billion) in production value in 2007 -- a
major share of the 2007 overall industry production value of NT$2 trillion,
according to Photonics Industry and Technology Development Association (PIDA)
statistics.</P>
      <P>The PIDA is a private think tank that organizes the annual Photonics Festival in
Taiwan, which will be held this year in conjunction with the Display Taiwan at
Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1 June 11-13.</P>
      <P>Touching on the prospects for the flat panel display market, Chen said TFT-LCD
products, which now occupy 70 percent of the market in terms of value, will
continue to dominate the market within the next five years. "The active
matrix/organic light emitting diode (AM-OLED) sector has also matured and become
profitable, " he said, adding that such display technology, previously used in
mobile phones for fluid and full-motion video, is now applied to TVs as large as
31 inches.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the electronic paper (e-paper) display is also a key
technology Taiwan's manufacturers should develop in order to further expand
their business in the global market.</P>
      <P>"The Korean  companies  again  are in the lead with this technological
advancement," he added.</P>
      <P>Using a process called electro-wetting, the e-paper allows the user to save
images on a piece of thin display sheet that is bendable and readable. Its
applications include e-book readers, which are capable of displaying digital
versions of books or magazines.</P>

      <P>More than 600 employees of Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. (FAT) took to the
streets Tuesday to demand that the government help save the debt-ridden airline
company from going bankrupt.</P>
      <P>The street demonstration started peacefully but clashes erupted between FAT
employees and police on the main boulevard in front of the Presidential Office
when the protestors mistook a convoy for that of top presidential officials and
demanded a meeting with President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The FAT employees later sent representatives to deliver a petition to the
Presidential Office, but were apparently dissatisfied with the response that the
petition would be given to Ma and then forwarded to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to calm the protestors, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Chen
Chieh,  who also doubles as president of the Taipei-based Chinese Federation of
Labour, went to the scene of the protest and promised to help protect the rights
of the FAT employees.</P>
      <P>Chang Chiu-chuen, vice minister of the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) , also showed up at the scene and gave the assurance that
his ministry will set up a special window for future negotiations with the FAT's
workers' union over the matter.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the employees failed to receive an active response from the
MOTC when they first staged an hour-long sit-in in front of the ministry
building.</P>
      <P>Holding a banner that read, "Government should step in to save FAT, " the
employees complained that they had not been paid in the last two months. FAT's
financial crisis came to light four months ago.</P>
      <P>They asked the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) , Taiwan's top aviation
regulator, to suspend any penalties on the carrier and intervene immediately in
its management.</P>
      <P>The government should also help stabilize FAT's operations in the short term and
help the airline seek investment, the employees urged.</P>
      <P>The FAT workers' union suggested that the MOTC's China Aviation Development
Foundation invest directly in FAT, or that Taiwan's largest carrier China
Airlines (CAL) invest indirectly in FAT to save it from bankruptcy. CAL
currently holds a 5. 73 percent stake in FAT.</P>
      <P>The demonstration  marked another wave of appeals  to the government to help
protect the livelihood of FAT's 1,200 employees, following protests that were
staged in front of FAT's headquarters and the legislature in Taipei in late May.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's protests came after the CAA decided to officially rescind the

      <P>The Taipei-based Mandarin Airlines will take over from a bankrupt carrier the
right to operate commercial flights between Taipei and Taitung, from July 15,
Mandarin Airlines Chairman Chen Sheng-shan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement at a fundraising event held by the Genesis Social
Welfare Foundation to build a care facility in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan for
patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS).</P>
      <P>Chen said the company will launch a fundraising campaign on its Taipei-Taitung
flights to encourage passengers to donate the nickels and dimes in their pockets
to the Taipei-based foundation's effort to construct the health care center.</P>
      <P>The campaign will continue until the end of the year, Chen added.</P>
      <P>On June 2, the debt-ridden Far Eastern Air Transport Corp. was striped of its
right to operate domestic flight services after it failed to resolve its
financial problems. Since then, UNI Airways has been the only airline plying the
Taipei-Taitung route.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Mandarin Airlines will also take over other domestic air routes
formerly served by Far Eastern Air, Chen said that will be decided by the Civil
Aeronautics Administration.</P>
      <P>The Genesis Social Welfare Foundation was established in 1986 as the first care
center in Taiwan for PVS patients.</P>

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei urged Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan Tuesday to relax restrictions on visits to China by
local government chiefs.</P>
      <P>"The MAC should make the move at this time when Taiwan-China relations are
thawing, as visits to China by Taiwan's city mayors and county magistrates would
not involve state secrets," Chou said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county mayor asked the Cabinet-level MAC to agree to his plan soon so
that he could take part in an international travel fair in Beijing later this
month to help promote Taipei county tourism to the rest of the world, especially
as Taiwan is slated to allow in more Chinese tourists from July.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged investments in Taipei County by China-based Taiwan
businessmen and asserted his willingness to visit China to woo Chinese investors
here as well.</P>
      <P>Chou made the request during a lunch banquet with Taiwan businessmen whose
operations are based in China.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's local government chiefs are only permitted to visit China to
take part in international activities.</P>
      <P>Chou's  application  to attend a cross-Taiwan  Strait land developers conference

    <HEADLINE>More people dissatisfied with Ma administration: DPP survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dissatisfaction towards President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration has grown,
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday, citing a survey
it conducted, as it urged Ma to pay more attention to people's needs instead of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to the poll conducted from June 5-6, two weeks after Ma was sworn in
as the nation's president and the Kuomintang (KMT) government took power on May
20, 42.7 percent of the 889 people surveyed, or a rise of 10 percentage points
compared to a similar survey on May 27, were dissatisfied with Ma.</P>
      <P>The poll further indicated that the percentage  of people satisfied with Ma and
his administration dropped slightly to 50.8 percent, or a 4 percentage point
decrease compared to that of May 27.</P>
      <P>Stressing the rise of Ma's unpopularity as "record-breaking as well as a warning
to Ma himself and his government, " Chen Chun-lin, director of the DPP's Survey
Department, said that in addition to cross-strait issues, Ma needs to pay more
attention to "domestic affairs."</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of KMT chairman Wu Poh-hsiung avoiding using "Republic of
China", Taiwan's official title, and referring to Ma as Mr. Ma instead of
President Ma during his visit to mainland China between May 26-31, a total of
61.2 percent of the interviewees felt that was "inappropriate," DPP officials
said.</P>
      <P>Another 61.5 percent of the samples further disagreed that "to open Taiwan to
mainland China is the best method to solve the country's economic problems and
that it also helps improve people's lives."</P>
      <P>However, as many as 78.5 percent of the people surveyed believed that cross-
strait negotiations on peace must be based on the removal of Chinese missiles
aimed at Taiwan, according to the poll, while a total of 68.4 of the respondents
felt that "China will not pull out the missiles," DPP officials said.</P>
      <P>Although Ma's election victory on March 22 had created new optimism in many
quarters for better relations with China, 62.2 percent of the people surveyed
disagreed that the new government has hammered out relevant policies to deal
with more open cross-strait relations and stepped-up contacts with China.</P>
      <P>As Ma's administration is facing criticism over the fact that some Cabinet
members hold foreign residency rights, Chen Chi-mai, DPP deputy secretary-
general, urged Ma "to look into the whole issue seriously and to conduct an
investigation into this completely."</P>
      <P>"We at the DPP also hope that Ma can turn part of his focus from cross-strait
relations to people's livelihood and soaring commodity prices," Chen urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talks with China to be based on equality, dignity: chief negotiator</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
06/10/08  21:04:22
(By Howard Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is determined to improve relations across the Taiwan Strait, Chiang Pin-
kung, chairman of the quasi-official Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF), pledged
Tuesday, but he insisted that the upcoming negotiations with mainland China must
be based on "equality and dignity,"</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks one day prior to his departure for Beijing at the
invitation of the SEF's Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), for the first talks between the two sides in
10 years.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the upcoming talks slated to take place in Beijing's Diaoyutai
State  Guesthouse  from  June 12-13  will be "very significant, " and said he
hoped the two sides will eventually reach agreements on the issues on the
agenda.</P>
      <P>"The resumption of talks symbolizes a new beginning of gentler cross-strait
relations, " Chiang said in a press conference.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that both the SEF and the ARATS will conduct the negotiations
through "honest and sound interactions."</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations will bring impacts on not only Taiwan's political and
economic situations, it will also influence the future development of cross-
strait relations, security in East Asia, as well as the international
situation," Chiang added.</P>
      <P>To show Taiwan's good will toward mainland China, Chiang welcomed Chen Yunlin,
chairman of the ARATS, to visit Taiwan "at his convenience."</P>
      <P>According to Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF,
Taiwan's 19-member delegation will depart for Beijing via Macau on Wednesday,
followed by talks on Thursday regarding direct charter flights on weekends and
the arrival of mainland tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Chiang and Chen are expected to sign agreements on the two issues,
and then Chiang is scheduled to preside at a press conference at the
Intercontinental Hotel where the delegates will be staying during the four-day
visit.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the former Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) deserves some credit
for their effort to launch direct charter flights and open Taiwan to mainland
tourists. China had refused to hold talks when the DPP was in power as then
President Chen Shui-bian, who is from the DPP, had refused to agree to China's
preconditions.  Chiang promised that "issues relating  to the development of
cross-strait relations and to bilateral prosperity" are all possible topics for
future talks.</P>
      <P>The SEF's request to resume talks was sent to the ARATS immediately after
Taiwan's top China policy coordinator, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
authorized the SEF on May 26 to resume contact with China.</P>
      <P>The SEF received the ARATS' response three days after Chiang wrote to ARATS
asking that talks be resumed within the framework of the "1992 Consensus, "
which allows both sides to agree that there is only one China, but leaves it up
to each side to interpret the term "one China."</P>
      <P>Chiang welcomed the ARATS's prompt response, saying it was "really meaningful"
and that it had come at an "appropriate" time.</P>
      <P>After a number of fits and starts in the 1990s, bilateral negotiations across
the Taiwan Strait were suspended in 1999, when then President Lee Teng-hui
defined relations between Taiwan and China as "special state-to-state"
relations.</P>
      <P>When the pro-independence DPP and Chen assumed power in 2000, cross-strait
relations further deteriorated.</P>
      <P>After President  Ma Ying-jeou  of the Kuomintang  won the presidential election
on March 22, the trend turned to reconciliation and cooperation. Ma is not
opposed to eventual reunification, but has vowed not to discuss that with China
during his term in office and has previously said China must be democratic
before the two sides can reunify.</P>
      <P>Ma's election victory created new optimism in many quarters for better relations
with China. In addition to the resumption of semi-formal cross-strait
negotiations this week, there are high expectations that China will agree to
allow direct weekend flights and more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, measures
which are expected to help Taiwan's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central EV71 response center activated as 5th fatality reported</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
06/10/08  21:49:33

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center has been activated following
the confirmation of the fifth enterovirus-related fatality in Taiwan so far this
year, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The latest fatality involved a boy aged 2 years and 9 months residing in
central Taiwan's Taichung County, who died from serious enterovirus infection
Monday, " said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease
Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>"As of Tuesday noon, Taiwan had recorded 176 serious enterovirus cases, five of
which were fatal, " Chou said, adding that eight more people are battling the
disease in various intensive care units (ICUs).</P>
      <P>Over the past week, Chou went on, every DOH-reporting doctor has notified the
CDC more than 20 suspected enterovirus cases, a new high since 1998, when a
massive outbreak struck Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus  is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract
and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and
can cause serious illness, especially in infants and the immuno-compromised.</P>
      <P>With the enterovirus situation looking increasingly grim, Chou said, the
government has decided to activate a Cabinet-level epidemic response command
center, headed by DOH Minister Lin Fang-yue.</P>
      <P>In addition to DOH officials, Chou said, the center is staffed with officials
from the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Education and the
Environmental Protection Administration.</P>
      <P>The center has already  issued five directives,  including continuing various
disease prevention projects, stepping up health education for those who provide
care for children aged under 5 and accelerating development of testing agents
and vaccines for serious type EV71 enterovirus, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Daycare centers,  kindergartens and schools must close for disinfection whenever
the situation warrants, and the Bureau of National Health Insurance will offer
full financial support for treatment of enterovirus patients, according to the
directives.</P>
      <P>The scourge of EV71 enterovirus this year first occurred in southern Taiwan's
Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and Pingtung County and spread gradually
northward, Chou said, adding that while the disease situation in the southern
part of the island has shown signs of alleviation, the case numbers in central
and northern parts are rising.</P>
      <P>"We are now looking forward to a slowdown in the infection rate when local
schools close for summer vacation in two weeks, " Chou continued.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, nearly all of the serious enterovirus cases this year were
type EV71 and all those infected were aged under 5, apart from one 14-year-old
resident of Hsinchu City who was admitted to ICU at one point because of acute
limb paralysis and later transferred to a regular ward after his condition
improved.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, 368 classes in elementary schools, daycare centers and
kindergartens had been closed at some point because of the enterovirus outbreak.
Sixty-seven of them were still closed as of press time.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, a class must close for one to two weeks when two or
more enterovirus cases are reported. Schools that fail to report cases will be
slapped with fines ranging between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000, and any that refuse
to close will be fined NT$60,000 to NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-chuan, director of the infectious disease control department at Cheng
Kung National University Hospital, said last month that this year might see a
major enterovirus outbreak, with the number of serious EV71 cases probably
surging to 300 by June. The spread of the disease tends to peak in mid-June.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan could experience a major enterovirus outbreak once
every 10 years and 2008 could be part of that cycle.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases were
documented  and there have been no serious enterovirus outbreaks reported since
2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP opposes putting `1992 consensus' into words in cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of a resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, opposition lawmakers
expressed opposition Tuesday to putting the term "1992 consensus" into words
during the talks.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party legislators Wong Chin-chu and Twu Shing-jer
expressed their misgivings  as the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is set to
begin talks with its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), over cross-strait  weekend  passenger  charter
flights and Beijing's permission for Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The June 11-14 talks will mark the first cross-strait talks between the two
intermediary bodies in a decade.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations suffered a chill during the previous pro-independence DPP
administration, which only began to thaw after the Kuomintang (KMT)
administration took office May 20. KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung met in Beijing May
28 with Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu Jintao, who is also
China's president, and they agreed to resume two-way systematic negotiations
between the SEF and ARATS based on the so-called "1992 consensus" -- which
according to the KMT means both sides agree there is only one China, with each
side free to interpret what this means in their own way.</P>
      <P>Twu said that both former President Lee Teng-hui and late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-
fu have pointed out that the so-called consensus does not exist, and he
questioned how President Ma Ying-jeou thinks he can alter history.</P>
      <P>The DPP mistrusts the term deeply and has argued in the past that the consensus
does not exist, and that even if it does, it is based on Beijing's understanding
that the "one China" cited in the supposed agreement is the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>He urged the SEF to stick to the issues commissioned by the Mainland Affairs
Council, the nation's top China policy-charting body, and not "go out of bounds"
during the negotiations.</P>
      <P>He also expressed opposition to any statement or news release on the resumption
of talks between the SEF and ARATS, as well as the term "1992 consensus" being
put into print.</P>
      <P>The SEF also should not "give in to any requests by China just to deliver on
President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promise" and should "report to the Legislative
Yuan immediately upon its return," from Beijing, he said.</P>
      <P>Twu was referring to Ma's pledge during his presidential campaign on the opening
of cross-strait charter flights and allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan
from early July.</P>
      <P>Wong said the previous DPP administration had almost completed negotiations with
China over the two issues, as well as over cross-strait cargo charter flights,
but Ma, in "his rush to deliver on his campaign pledges," has left out the more
complex cross-strait cargo charter flight issue, even though this is the most
important issue for Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Wong said Taiwan has the edge in the manufacturing and parts and components
sectors and claimed that China cannot compete with Taiwan in that area.</P>
      <P>If the issue is left off the agenda of the talks, Taiwan's industry will be
affected, she added.</P>

      <P>Taichung City in central Taiwan is expected to begin construction of a mass
rapid transit (MRT) system next year, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lu
Shiow-yen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu, elected from Taichung City, made the remarks after Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo gave his verbal consent to a
sooner-then-expected start to construction of the rail system that has been much
anticipated by Taichung citizens, during a meeting with Lu and Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the now-opposition Democratic Progressive Party had originally
planned when it was still in power to begin the construction in 2010.</P>
      <P>However,  Taichung citizens believe that any delay in the construction will
seriously hamper the development of the city, and implored the government to
bring the start date forward.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang administration is now expected to give priority to the
construction of the 16.5 km city MRT line.</P>
      <P>Some real estate agents have estimated that once the MRT is completed, together

      <P>Several businessmen and local celebrities called on the public Tuesday to join a
fundraising drive to support the establishment of a care center for persistent
vegetative state (PVS) sufferers in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. Executive Director Ou Chin-der, Mandarin Airlines
President Chen Sheng-shan and aboriginal singers Wang Hung-en and Chi Hsiao-chun
made the appeal at a press conference in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>All four have connections with the eastern county of Taitung, where the care
center will be located.</P>
      <P>The center will be a branch of the Taipei-based Genesis Social Welfare
Foundation, founded in 1986, which has already set up 15 care centers around the
country, except for eastern Taiwan, to house PVS sufferers. The foundation has
provided help to more than 900 PVS sufferers over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics released last December, Taiwan has 5,006 PVS
sufferers, about 170 of whom live in eastern Taiwan, where there are
insufficient resources for taking care of them.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, the foundation launched the drive at the end of April and were
receiving  donations  of up to NT$1.3 million (US$42,763) per week until the
massive earthquake occurred in China's Sichuan Province May 12.</P>
      <P>The donations dropped to NT$180,000 in the week after the earthquake, as many
donations were made to help the earthquake victims in China, Ou said.</P>
      <P>The donations at present amount to just NT$6 million, while the first phase of
the care center's construction requires expenditure of NT$60 million, Ou went
on, calling on the public to take action to support the foundation's fundraising
drive.</P>
      <P>Ou said that in order to encourage more participation in the drive, those who
donate NT$600 will receive tickets for a children's drama to be staged by the
Song Song Song Children's and Puppet Theater at Taipei City Hall June 30.</P>
      <P>According to Mandarin Airlines President Shen Sheng-shan, the carrier will
support the drive by inviting passengers on its flights from Taipei to Taitung,
which will be resumed July 15, to make small donations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tycoon suggests settling sovereignty issue through referendums</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
06/10/08  23:13:47
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prominent high technology business leader criticized President Ma Ying-jeou's
cross-Taiwan  Strait policy Tuesday, claiming that Ma's "three noes" pledge
serves no purpose except to waste time.</P>
      <P>Robert Tsao, honorary chairman of United Microelectronics Corp., (UMC) made the
statement while advocating the establishment of a cross-strait peace law, during
a speech at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According  to Tsao,  Ma's stance  of "no unification,  no independence and no
use of force" regarding cross-strait relations only represents the lack of a
clear-cut strategy.</P>
      <P>"The independence-unification dispute between Taiwan and China can be resolved
by due process, which means holding referendums so that the Taiwan people can
decide," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  people,  whether  they  are  pro-independence  of pro-unification,
should drop their prejudices when it comes to the independence-unification issue
and settle their differences through the process of referendums, Tsao said.</P>
      <P>There is no major division in Taiwan with respect to that issue, although people
in the north of the country are more flexible toward Taiwan's unification with
China, while people in the south are more receptive to Taiwan's pursuit of de-
jure independence, he stated.</P>
      <P>In essence, the independence-unification problem resides with China because it
is China that is seeking to unify with Taiwan, therefore, Beijing should take
the initiative to establish due process, he contended.</P>
      <P>Beijing should clearly put forward its conditions -- whether it is the "two
countries, one system" unification formula or "high degree of autonomy" proposal
-- and allow the Taiwan people to decide the country's future by means of
referendum, Tsao proposed.</P>
      <P>"Such a referendum could be held every six, eight or 10 years, which would force
Beijing to offer different conditions to the Taiwan people," he suggested.</P>
      <P>"By leaving the ball in Beijing's court, Taiwan does not need to waste time on
the issue, " Tsao said. "It is meaningless for Taiwan's political figures to
engage in infighting over it."</P>
      <P>While the United States has its Taiwan Relations Act and China its Anti-
Secession  Law to deal  with  cross-strait  political contingencies, Taiwan has
no relevant laws to cope with such situations, he said.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a cross-strait peace law would help heal the differences
within Taiwan, while clarifying its stance to the rest of the world, Tsao said.
"It is meaningless for the nation to waste its energy on the independence-
unification issue."</P>
      <P>Tsao, however, admitted that Beijing must first recognize the existence of the
Republic of China, Taiwan's official title, to make the establishment of the law
possible.</P>
      <P>If China were willing to endorse such a law and to agree to let Taiwan to hold
referendums on its own future, it would mean that China really recognized the
ROC's existence -- or Taiwan's de-facto independence, he explained.</P>
      <P>Tsao first raised the idea of a cross-strait peace law in November last year
with the aim of helping to put aside disputes over Taiwan's status ahead of the
country's presidential election on March 22 this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China split in 1949 amid a Chinese civil war, but Beijing has
threatened the use of force against the self-ruled Taiwan if it moves toward de-
jure independence,  and has enacted an Anti-Secession Law to substantiate its
position on the issue.</P>

      <P>A Ministry of Education (MOE) counselor jumped to his death at the ministry's
headquarters Wednesday morning, but the reasons behind the suspected suicide
remained unknown as of noontime.</P>
      <P>Yang Chun-sheng, 52, a counselor to MOE Chief Secretary Pan Wen-chung,
apparently jumped to his death from the third floor of the MOE building around
7:30 a.m., Pan said.</P>
      <P>Yang, whose body was found lying in a motorbike parking lot, left behind a note
in his handwriting on a sheet of A4-sized paper, asking for a "simple
arrangement" for his funeral and offering appreciation to his superiors and
colleagues at the MOE, where he had worked for 21 years.</P>
      <P>Pan said the reasons Yang committed suicide were unknown. Police have started
looking into the case.</P>
      <P>The death stirred the attention of the Legislature, where ruling Kuomintang

      <P>More than half of the public are optimistic about the upcoming resumption of
Taiwan-China talks but are evenly divided over their perception of China's
attitude toward Taiwan, according to the results of a poll released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey -- conducted by a local Chinese-language magazine, Global Views
Monthly, -- was released one day before Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) , was scheduled to depart for China to discuss
economic issues.</P>
      <P>The SEF is Taipei's quasi-official intermediary body tasked with handling cross-
Taiwan Strait negotiations in the absence of formal relations between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>The agenda for Chiang's meeting includes the opening of direct passenger charter
flights on weekends between the two sides and paving the way for more Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that 13 percent of respondents were "very optimistic" about the
reopening of talks and another 44 percent said they were "optimistic, " in
contrast to the 19 percent who said they were pessimistic about the
negotiations.</P>
      <P>The  respondents  had a mixed  perception  of the Beijing authorities' attitude
toward Taiwanese people, with 39 percent describing the attitude as "friendly"
and nearly 38 percent saying it was "unfriendly."</P>
      <P>There  was also considerable  division  among the survey's respondents  over
what name the country  should  use to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>Nearly 37 percent supported using "Taiwan, " 31 percent backed using "the
Republic of China, " and 16 percent preferred "Chinese Taiwan, " while only 8.5
percent supported the use of "Chinese Taipei, " the name the country uses as a
member of the International Olympic Committee and most sports federations.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted between June 4-6, had 1,027 valid responses from people
aged over 20 and a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent at a 95 percent
level of confidence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Wednesday his
upcoming talks with Beijing will be a new beginning for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, a mission which he defined as a "tour of mutual trust and
negotiations."</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks prior to his departure for China for the talks slated
for June 11-14 in Beijing, setting the stage for the resumption of
institutionalized  cross-strait  dialogue after a nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>"There will certainly be a second and third round of talks after this first one.
We hope to create a win-win situation across the strait and allow the people on
both sides to live a better life, " Chiang said at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>The talks, to be led by Chiang and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will be the first
high-level meetings in nine years between the two semi-official intermediary
bodies authorized to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official
contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>High on the agenda of the negotiations are the launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights on weekends and the arrival of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, who saw Chiang off at the
airport, said the talks represent the reopening of institutionalized dialogue
between Taiwan and China and will "write a new chapter in history."</P>
      <P>"We hope Chairman Chiang and his delegation will successfully accomplish the
mission authorized by the government, laying the foundation for the stability
and normalization of cross-strait relations, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and the late ARATS Chairman
Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 led to a series of systematic exchanges between
Taiwan and China, which had shunned official contacts since the KMT retreated to
Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>But the exchanges ground to a halt in 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui
described cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state relationship, and
Beijing continued to refuse dialogue with Taiwan during the eight-year
administration of President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on the meaning
of "one China."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) vice chairman's role as an
adviser to a Chinese trade promotion group violates no existing laws governing
relations across the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said SEF Vice Chairman and
Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian fully explained on Tuesday how and when he
became an adviser to the Xiamen-based Fujian-Taiwan Council for the Promotion of
Economic Cooperation (FTCPEC).</P>
      <P>Lai said that after assessing Kao's explanation, the council has concluded that
his behavior had not violated the law and did not fall under categories of
interaction with China that are legally banned.</P>
      <P>Kao said at a news conference held Tuesday, one day prior to the departure of a
19-member SEF delegation to Beijing, that he was "passively appointed" as an
FTCPEC adviser three or four years ago when he and SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
were attending a meeting of the council in Xiamen as private citizens.</P>
      <P>"All the 30-odd participants of that meeting, from both Taiwan and Fujian, were
later appointed advisers," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Kao stressed that since then, he had not received any meeting notifications or
"consulting fees" from the group.</P>
      <P>Kao is one of the key members of the SEF delegation traveling to Beijing -- a
visit being made at the invitation of the SEF's Chinese counterpart, the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, (ARATS), for the first
talks between the two sides in nine years.</P>
      <P>The SEF-ARATS talks, slated to take place in Beijing's Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse from June 12-13, are expected to focus on the opening of direct
cross-strait charter flight services on weekends and increasing the number of
Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Thirteen recreational fishermen rescued from a Taiwanese fishing boat which sank
after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel Tuesday returned to northern
Taiwan from Japan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sunken vessel's three crew members, however, were still being detained by
Japan for questioning.</P>
      <P>Japan's decision to release the fishermen was the result of negotiations
between  Taiwan's  foreign ministry  and Japanese authorities, Taiwan's Coast
Guard officials said.</P>
      <P>Conflicting reports said the boat sank six nautical miles either to the south or
southwest of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, or Senkaku Islands in Japanese,
after colliding with the Japanese vessel.</P>
      <P>Japanese authorities  considered  the Taiwanese boat to be operating beyond the
"temporary enforcement  line" of Taiwan's exclusive economic zone at the time,
said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>According to precedent, the owner of the boat is likely to face high penalties,
the officials believed.</P>
      <P>According  to the Taiwanese  fishermen,  the fishing  boat encountered the
Japanese patrol vessel 5 nautical miles east of the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The Japanese patrol tried to communicate by radio with the Taiwanese fishing
boat, but the loud noise from the boat's engine made it nearly impossible for
the crew to hear the radio messages, the returned fishermen said, and the
collision occurred shortly afterwards.</P>
      <P>Captain Ho Hung-yi immediately asked everyone on the boat to put on life vests
and board a life raft, and then Japanese vessel members rescued them and brought
them on board their own vessel, the fishermen said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese vessel gave those rescued food, water and clothes and checked their
health after taking them to Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawan chain some
200 kilometers south of the disputed islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, Japan and China all claim the Tiaoyutais as their sovereign territory.</P>

      <P>Japanese authorities should immediately release three detained crew members of a
sunken Taiwanese fishing boat and offer an apology and compensation, a lawmaker
said in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While the crew members were still being detained in Japan for questioning, 13
recreational fishermen who were rescued from the sunken vessel returned to
Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Conflicting reports said the boat sank six nautical miles either to the south or
southwest of the Tiaoyutai Islands, or Senkaku Islands in Japanese, after
colliding with the Japanese vessel on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters near the Tiaoyutais, which Taiwan, Japan and China all claim as
their sovereign territory,  but collisions there are rare.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-hua asked the government to assert
Taiwan's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais and step up efforts to protect Taiwan's
fishing boats in the disputed waters.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a press conference that the Tiaoyutais -- which are believed to have
rich reserves of oil and natural gas -- are under the jurisdiction of
northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Peter Tsai, executive director of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs' Committee on Japanese Affairs, said that "the government's
stance on Taiwan's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai Islands has remained
consistent."</P>
      <P>Tsai  said that after  the collision,  ministry  officials immediately visited
the crew members and fishermen who were taken by Japanese patrol guards to
Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawan chain some 200 kilometers south of the
disputed islands.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia also expressed his concerns to Japan's
representative to Taiwan and asked Japan to treat the Taiwanese crew members and
fishermen well, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Hsia also urged Japan to investigate what happened, which will help define each
side's responsibility, said Tsai, adding that the foreign ministry will continue
to negotiate with Japanese authorities over the matter.</P>

      <P>A troupe from the renowned Liao Wen-ho Puppet Theater is slated to perform in
U.S. cities later this month, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative
Office (TECRO) in the United States said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chung-li, director of the TECRO's Press Division, said the troupe will
perform three shows at the Smithsonian Institution's Freer Gallery of Art and
Arthur M. Sackler Gallery June 21-22 and two shows at the Harrisburg Open Stage
in the capital of Pennsylvania on June 24.</P>
      <P>The troupe will perform the Chinese classic "Journey to the West" as well as its
adaptation of "The Master Swordsman, " chronicling the adventures of Da Yong-
hsia in his attempts to dethrone and slay the evil emperor Tien Mo.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the Liao Wen-ho Puppet Theater, which was established in 1976,
combines traditional and modern artistic styles in its performances, which
feature dazzling multimedia and sound and light effects.</P>
      <P>The puppet theater, which has a long list of adaptions of classical Chinese
tales of heroism to its name, has performed in many countries in recent years,
including South Korea, Canada, China, France and Germany, to name a few, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>The troupe has helped spread a traditional Taiwanese art form to new audiences
and has been warmly received wherever it has performed, he said.</P>
      <P>It has also won several prestigious awards over the years, including the Global
Chinese Culture and Arts Award in 1999, the Executive Yuan Council for Cultural

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung municipal government's Environmental Protection Bureau said
Wednesday that garbage treatment fees in the central Taiwan city will be raised
from the start of next year to reflect increased transportation and waste
disposal costs.</P>
      <P>The bureau noted that garbage fees have not been raised in the city in seven
years, while waste treatment costs have increased by NT$400 (US$13.20) per ton.</P>
      <P>It also pointed out that the by-products produced by Taichung City's
incinerators have to be sent out of the city to be treated and that all related
costs have gone up.</P>
      <P>If garbage treatment fees are not raised to cover the increased costs, the city
could face a garbage crisis, the bureau said, adding that this is why the
Taichung City Council has agreed to the fee increase from Jan. 1 next year.</P>
      <P>In Taichung City, a household's garbage treatment fees are calculated based on
its monthly water bill.</P>
      <P>The bureau said that the garbage treatment fee for households with running water
will be raised by NT$0.9 per every cubic meter of water used, while the fee for
households without running water will increase NT$13.5 per month.</P>
      <P>The bureau advised families that want to counter the higher fee to separate
recyclable materials out of their garbage and to use less water.</P>

      <P>Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) Minister Wu Ying-yih urged
Wednesday that a proposal to combine his commission with the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) be reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Answering a question on the issue from Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Liao Wan-ju
during a legislative committee hearing, Wu said the issue needed to be rethought
because overseas nationals are valuable assets to Taiwan's diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Wu argued that with President Ma Ying-jeou calling for a diplomatic truce
between Taiwan and China, affairs related to overseas compatriots and the
unofficial channels they provide have become even more important.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overseas citizens, particularly those in nations which maintain no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, provide valuable shortcuts for the government
to connect to the rest of the world, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He asserted that if the commission were merged with the foreign ministry, MOFA
officials would no longer be able to take part in overseas compatriot meetings
in non-allied countries, leaving the field open to China and making it difficult
to manage this valuable resource in the future.</P>
      <P>Wu also encouraged Taiwan's nationals living abroad to assist the government in
working toward harmony and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait by helping
dissolve confrontation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to the OCAC chief, overseas Chinese are longing for lasting prosperity
for all ethnic Chinese around the world and the perpetuation of Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>But the ideological divide over Taiwan's future in recent years has led to a
split among overseas Chinese and pushed many "old friends of the Republic of
China" away from Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Many overseas expatriates from Taiwan still harbor a strong affection for the
ROC and the OCAC will draft measures to help people living abroad return to
Taiwan and settle at home, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the OCAC's traditional responsibility of promoting Taiwanese
culture overseas and sponsoring training programs for ethnic Chinese youth, the
OCAC chief said he will also encourage overseas Chinese to invest in the 12
major infrastructure development projects outlined by the government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Partially state-owned China Steel Corp. should give back more money to Kaohsiung
citizens, given that its gas emissions might be detrimental to their health, a
city councilor urged Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Kuo-cheng of the ruling Kuomintang said the Kaohsiung-based company has
produced a great deal of gas, but its contributions to Kaohsiung is far lower
than its contributions to Taipei City in the north of the country.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the average life span of Kaohsiung residents was 3.86 years less
than their Taipei counterparts in 2006. Kaohsiung's mentally ill patients in
2006 totaled 5,107, four times that of the 1,022 registered in 2005.</P>
      <P>"Even the number of cancer patients in Kaohsiung City is higher than that in
Taipei City," he sad, questioning if the high ratio of liver, rectal and bladder
cancer in Kaohsiung is related to China Steel's emissions.</P>
      <P>In response, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said she "will rigorously monitor the
environmental pollution caused by China Steel and will take effective
administrative measures to safeguard the interests of Kaohsiung."</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that China Steel registered a surplus of NT$51.2 billion in 2007
but put back only NT$35 million (US$114,750) into the city, as well as paying
NT$380 million in local taxes.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that China Steel contributed a total of NT$3.53 billion to Taipei
City, but contributed only NT$1.93 billion to Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that the Environmental Protection Administration, in its recent
screening of an expansion plan for Dragon Steel Corp., a China Steel's
subsidiary company, told the company to pay NT$1.5 billion for its high
emissions of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.</P>
      <P>But the carbon dioxide emissions of China Steel amounted to 21.78 million tons a
year, so the company should pay NT$3 billion to the city.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that the dioxins emitted by China Steel in 2007 accounted
for an astonishing 42 percent of the nation's total dioxin emissions and a
whopping 93 percent of the city's dioxin emissions.</P>
      <P>Noting that China Steel will convene a meeting of its board of directors June 19
in which incumbent Chairman Lin Wen-yen will resign, Lin Kuo-cheng asked that
his successor should be someone with an environmental protection background,
given that the company has caused such enormous environmental pollution in the
city.</P>

      <P>Political appointees will be added to the list of officials required to undergo
background checks before taking office if the Legislative  Yuan approves a
pending bill,  an Investigation Bureau official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Existing regulations published by the Ministry of Civil Service only require
background checks on career civil servants in charge of security affairs or
affairs involving major interests of the country, noted Pan Hung-mou, a section
chief at the bureau.</P>
      <P>A draft law proposed by the ministry, which has been forwarded to the
Legislative Yuan for consideration, would expand the checks to all types of
civil servants, including political appointees, Pan said.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws
and Statutes Committee, Pan was responding to a call by opposition Democratic
Progressive  Party (DPP)  Legislator Wong Chin-chu that the Investigation Bureau
conduct comprehensive checks on all Cabinet members, especially on whether they
are citizens of or hold permanent residency rights in a foreign country.</P>
      <P>Wong and the DPP have challenged the allegiance of certain officials in the
Kuomintang (KMT) administration who either once held U.S. permanent residency
rights, allegedly still hold a U.S. green card, or have applied for a U.S. green
card.</P>
      <P>In particular, the DPP has demanded the resignation of Minister of Foreign
Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou, who obtained U.S. permanent resident status in 2005

      <P>Farmers in Taichung County -- the largest pear production area in Taiwan -- have
achieved success on a project launched by the local government to cultivate
high-quality pear seedlings, county officials responsible for agricultural
affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Pears are one of main fruits grown in Taiwan, where 9,000 hectares of land is
dedicated to the fruit. The central county of Taichung alone grows 5,600
hectares of pears.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports over 158,000 kg of pear seedlings per year from Japan to meet
local pear farmers' demand, at prices ranging from NT$10,000 (US$329) to
NT$15,000 per kg. "Transportation accounts for the lion's share of the import
costs," the officials said.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to help local farmers cut down on production costs, the Taichung
County Bureau of Agriculture in 2007 launched a project to cultivate quality
pear seedlings for sale to local farmers. Eight experienced farmers were invited
to join the project.</P>
      <P>After numerous failures, the project recently achieved success, officials at the
county bureau said, noting that the farmers have managed to cultivate an
improved quality of pear seedlings.</P>
      <P>The officials expressed confidence that the project would produce high-quality
seedlings that can be mass reproduced to meet local demands in the near future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produces around 110,000 tons of pears a year, most of which are the so-
called grafted pears grown from a hybrid of local trees and seedlings imported
from Japan.</P>

      <P>Quarantine and disease prevention efforts will be strengthened as Taiwan
prepares to open its doors wider to Chinese tourists, Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Lin Fang-yue said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan on Taiwan's imminent opening to
Chinese tourists, probably in July, Lin noted that Taiwan cannot demand that
Chinese visitors have health checks prior to boarding a Taiwan-bound airplane,
based on the principles of equality and international exchange etiquette.</P>
      <P>"We cannot tell the Chinese that they are not welcome until they have had a
health check prior to their arrival, " Lin said, pointing out that all Taiwan
can do to dispel concerns that "Chinese tourists might bring in diseases, " is
to strengthen health awareness and knowledge of epidemic diseases such as
tuberculosis and enterovirus among "frontline personnel."</P>
      <P>"We can make efforts to give local tour guides and tourist hotels hosting
Chinese tourists better knowledge about epidemic diseases so that they can
contribute to helping control diseases that might be brought in by the Chinese
holidaymakers, " Lin continued.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks before the Legislative Yuan Public Health, Environment and
Labor Affairs Committee, where legislators of all political persuasions voiced
concern that Taiwan might fall victim to epidemic diseases once Chinese citizens
start pouring into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Hung-chih asked the health minister how the DOH
plans to keep epidemic diseases at bay in the face of the influx of Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Taiwan has been unable to efficiently curb the spread of
tuberculosis, while China reportedly has over 6 million TB patients.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tien Chiu-chin also asked Lin
whether the DOH is ready to deal with possible diseases brought in from China by
tourists.</P>
      <P>Tien claimed that health and medicare standards are generally more primitive in
China and that the situations regarding some contagious diseases such as
enterovirus and H5N1 -- a deadly bird flu that can be transmitted person to
person -- are "more serious than we know."</P>
      <P>Responding to the two legislators' inquiries, Lin said that in addition to
strengthening training of local tour guides and hotel personnel to enhance their
alert levels, Taiwan and China must reach agreement on disease prevention and
medical exchanges.</P>

      <P>The art festival will not only allow visitors to appreciate collections of the

exchange views, said Chang Yu-teng, vice chairman for the Council for Cultural
Affairs (CCA), one of the event organizers.</P>
      <P>"We hope the exposition this year will attract over 70,000 visitors and will

international art markets, the art exposition will also feature works of eight
local promising young artists, hoping more foreign brokers or galleries may find
creations interesting.</P>
      <P>"The AGA has been devoted to forming alliances with international gallery
organizations, and hopes that through these efforts, especially the Art Taipei
2008 we can promote the artistic work and artists from Taiwan," York Hsiao,
chairman of the AGA, said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President urges photonics industry to pursue clean energy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwans photonics products should focus on clean energy and conservation of
power to contribute to nationwide efforts to reduce the countrys carbon
emissions to half the volume generated in 2000 by 2050, President Ma Ying-jeou
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the Photonics Festival in Taiwan, Ma said
Taiwans photonics industry will record NT$1.8 trillion (US$59.2 billion) in
production value this year, with production value expected to reach NT$2
trillion in 2010.</P>
      <P>However, there are more things to be done other than continuing to make higher
profits,he said.</P>
      <P>Citing saving energy and using clean energy as the major themes in this years
exhibition, the president said such aims are in line with the global trend to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</P>
      <P>Ma said every industrial sector in Taiwan needs to pay attention to carbon
reduction, which he said was one of the governments main policies.</P>
      <P>Our measures will ensure there is balance between economic development and the
long-existence of mankind,he added.</P>
      <P>As part of the new governments carbon-reduction pledge, the Environmental
Protection Administration recently promoted a draft to reduce carbon emissions,
mandating all of the countrys factories cut down their GHG emissions by 15
percent.</P>
      <P>Although our country is not a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, our products
could be banned by other countries if we do not follow global standards, warned
the president.</P>
      <P>An international treaty on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the Kyoto Protocol
has driven many of its signatory countries to establish  green product standards
for importing  goods,  thus potentially forcing global manufacturers to develop
products that save more power and generate less carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>Ma made a special mention of the Light Emitting Diode (LED) , saying despite its
higher cost, such advanced lighting technology in the long run will actually be
more cost-efficient because it saves a lot of electricity.</P>
      <P>The government aims to not exceed the greenhouse gas emissions of this years
level by 2016, Ma pointed out, adding that the emissions in 2025 should be as
low as half of that in 2008.</P>
      <P>By 2050 the situation needs to be further improved, reaching the level that is
only half of the GHG produced in 2000, the president vowed.</P>
      <P>Admitting such a plan is ambitious, Ma expressed his hope that overseas
Taiwanese factories could also help the country meet this goal.  The emissions
reduced in factories based in foreign soil will also count,Ma said.</P>
      <P>The annual Photonics Festival in Taiwan is held in conjunction with the 10th
Display Taiwan at Taipei World Trade Center Exhibition Hall 1 on June 11-13.
Together the two events feature panel displays, lasers,  LED  applications,
optics,  optoelectronics,  fiber communications and solar energy products.</P>

      <P>Two earthquakes, both of a magnitude of more than 5.0 rattled Taiwan Wednesday,
with the epicenter of both located in the southernmost county of Pingtung,
according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>No injuries had been reported as of Wednesday  afternoon, officials from the CWB
Seismology Center said.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 5.2 temblor rocked Pingtung at 12: 33 p.m., with its epicenter
located 31.2 km east of Hengchun, a coastal township in the county. The quake,
which had a focal depth of 18.5 km, had an intensity of 4.0 in Oluanpi -- the
southernmost tip of Taiwan -- and 2.0 on nearby Orchid Island, said Hsiao Nai-
chi, a division director of the CWB Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>A second quake of magnitude 5.0 occurred at 2: 19 p.m., with its epicenter
located 36.8 km southeast of Hengchun. with a focal depth of 15.9 km, it had an
intensity of 4.0 in Oluanpi and 2.0 on Orchid Island, according to Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a temblor of magnitude 4.7 rocked Taiwan's northeastern city
of Yilan at 6:33 a.m. with a depth of 92.1 km.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 6.0 earthquake rattled Yilan June 2, but also caused no injuries,
Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>He called for the public not to panic over the spate of earthquakes, describing
them as only the results of pressure released from movements of the Philippine
and Eurasian plates, on which Taiwan lies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experiences about 1,500 to 2,000 earthquakes each month, but the number
of temblors stronger than magnitude 4.0 totals about a dozen, he added.</P>

      <P>The Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) is slated to celebrate the
Philippines' 110th anniversary of independence June 12, with the Philippine
representative to Taiwan Antonio Basilio on Wednesday  taking the opportunity
to also congratulate the people of Taiwan on their achievements in democracy.</P>
      <P>Dignitaries, including Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew L.Y. Hsia and
foreign diplomats, are expected to participate in the celebrations at the
Shangri-La's Far Eastern Plaza Hotel Taipei Thursday evening, according to the
MECO.</P>
      <P>Commending Taiwan on the success of its recent elections -- the Jan. 12
legislative elections and the March 22 presidential poll -- Basilio told the CNA
that these elections proved "once again how deeply democratic ideals have taken
root here (in Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>The Philippines independence celebrations will honor the memory of the 88
Filipino  patriots  who signed the Declaration  of Independence, hoisted a
national flag of their own design and sang the national anthem for the first
time to establish the country 110 years ago, Basilio said.</P>
      <P>The event will also pay tribute to those who fought and sacrificed their lives
for the country's independence, he added.</P>
      <P>Basilio said that he wished Taiwan's new government all the best and success in
its many initiatives aimed at making the country more prosperous and confident
of its future.</P>
      <P>"A prosperous and confident Taiwan is good for the Philippines, its closest
neighbor to the south... We look forward to more beneficial exchanges, more
mutually profitable partnerships, and greater freedom to pursue them to the
maximum degree possible, " Basilio said.</P>
      <P>He stated that the Philippines has been a friend and will remain a friend of
Taiwan, adding that he hoped the people-to-people relations and the various
areas of bilateral cooperation between the two sides will continue to blossom.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to pursue every opportunity possible to enhance and deepen the
historic friendship that exists between the people of Taiwan and the
Philippines," he added.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will definitely deliver on its promise of making the mini
direct links available to all Taiwanese people within two weeks, Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan will approve the mini links expansion proposal next week in
line with its planned establishment of direct passenger weekend charter flights
across the Taiwan Strait and the opening to more Chinese tourists from July 4,"
Liu said.</P>
      <P>The government's promise to expand the mini links to all Taiwanese citizens will
be made a reality," Liu told reporters during a lunch meeting.</P>
      <P>"In principle, no restrictions will be imposed on the number or the status of
the passengers traveling on the routes, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>The mini-links -- direct shipping and trade links between Taiwan's Kinmen and
Matsu islands and Xiamen and Mawei ports in China's Fujian Province -- were set
up in January 2001 to help boost development on the two islands and to mitigate
the impact of the lack of such links between Taiwan proper and China.</P>
      <P>Only residents with household registrations on the islands, Fujian-based
Taiwanese businessmen and their dependents and the people from Taiwan-controlled
Penghu islands are permitted to use the mini links, while Quanzhou, also in
Fujian Province, was added to the service last year.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen and Matsu people are keen to have the mini links further expanded as
direct transport services are set to be put in place across the strait.</P>
      <P>Asked why the direct cargo charter flight service issue has not been included in
coming cross-strait negotiations, the premier said negotiators from the two
sides have already discussed the issue in previous rounds of talks.</P>
      <P>The cargo charter issue will certainly be included in future negotiations
between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), Liu said.</P>
      <P>The premier gave his best wishes and threw his full support behind SEF Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung -- Taiwan's top negotiator in the SEF-ARATS talks, saying that
he is optimistic about the outcome of the negotiations, which have been
suspended for some 10 years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang's delegation had arrived in Beijing for talks with its ARATS
counterpart to be held June 12-14. Chiang is slated to meet Chinese President Hu
Jintao June 13.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are set to clinch two accords -- on weekend passenger charter
flights and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists-- June 13 in Beijing.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is working on a plan to market Taiwan's quality
agricultural products to Chinese tourists, who are expected to visit Taiwan in
greater numbers beginning in July.</P>
      <P>Details of the project are still being thrashed out, COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung
said Wednesday, but the plan would involve having Chinese tourists order fruit
while in Taiwan and pick it up in China.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has instructed the council's staff to pay special attention to
issues such as quarantine restrictions and product delivery and pickup measures,
to make the plan work.</P>
      <P>Such issues still need to be negotiated by the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange
Foundation  and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations across
the Taiwan Straits, before they can be implemented, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The COA plans to set up an exhibition hall to showcase Taiwan's quality farm
products at one of the most popular destinations for Chinese tourists. It has
consulted with the National Palace Museum and the Alishan  National  Scenic Area
Administration  on the possibility of setting up such a hall under their
jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The council hopes to select a location and operator for the hall by the end of
August, the COA said.</P>
      <P>It noted that while the government will fund part of operating cost, the
contractor responsible for the operation will still need to work with travel
agents to attract Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Even though the COA has confidence in the competitiveness of Taiwan's fine
fruits and high quality agricultural products, the key to success will be how to
choose logistics companies and distributors in China to handle home delivery and
after-sales service, the council indicated.</P>
      <P>Currently, a total of 22 varieties of Taiwan-grown fruit are allowed to be
exported to China, including the four -- mangoes, pineapples, guavas and wax
apples -- most favored by Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>In addition, some of the top 100 agricultural products selected by the COA have
also been given open access to the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>The COA also plans to collaborate with duty free shops at airports and airline
companies that run flights to China to launch services to enable Chinese
tourists to place farm product orders at the shops or on airplanes.</P>

Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, all local governments can apply for the subsidies
and have the same deadline by which they must submit their applications to the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The subsidy program, proposed by the Executive Yuan last month, will pump
NT$103.4 billion (US$3.4 billion) into public construction in order to increase
job opportunities, improve the investment environment, and eventually boost
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Some NT$58.3 billion of the total amount will be earmarked for local
governments  to help pay their debts  and fund public infrastructure projects,
the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>The application and evaluation guidelines for the funding have been consistent
from the beginning, and are not flexible as some local governments have claimed,
the statement read.</P>
      <P>Priority will be given to major central government construction projects that
are in progress in various cities and counties but lack funds, and to local
governments public works that are in line with the central government's economic
policies and can be completed by the end of this year, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Projects that have been rejected before by the Executive Yuan, those that cannot
be completed within the stated time frame, and those that have not had clear and
definite budget assessment, are likely to be refused funding, the council
advised.</P>
      <P>To date, local governments have applied for a total of NT$70 billion to fund
about 1,200 projects, the CEPD disclosed.</P>
      <P>Local government applications will close Wednesday and the Executive Yuan will
complete its preliminary reviews of these applications by June 18, the CEPD
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Wednesday she looks forward to improvements in the
local election culture after two supporters of her rival in the 2006 mayoral
race were convicted of vote buying in their second trials.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks a day after the Kaohsiung branch of the Taiwan High Court
ruled that Ku Hsin-ming and Tsai Neng-hsiang were both guilty of election
bribery, in a reversal of a lower court ruling issued last November that
acquitted both men.</P>
      <P>"The conviction of Ku and Tsai indicates that the vote-buying charges were real
and factual, " Chen said, adding that the case has caused her to suffer a great
deal of smearing and that she keenly hopes that similar illegal campaign tactics
will not happen again.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the Dec. 9, 2006 Kaohsiung mayoral election, Chen's campaign
staff  accused  her rival,  Huang Chun-ying  of the then-opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) of vote buying at a late night news conference. A videotape featuring Ku
and Tsai paying NT$500 in cash to passengers aboard a tour bus returning from
one of Huang's campaign  rallies was displayed  on the occasion to back the
accusation.</P>
      <P>In the first trial, judges from the Kaohsiung District Court ruled that the
defendants were not guilty of vote buying because they were just paying wages to
all those who were mobilized to attend the campaign rally regardless of whether
they were eligible to vote in the election or not.</P>
      <P>However, the judges in the second trial said in their verdict that Ku had asked
recipients to vote for Huang and for Huang Po-lin, who was a candidate for the
Kaohsiung City Council elections held simultaneously, when he distributed the
money. An inspection of the optical disc featuring  the video footage also
recorded vocal responses from those who received the money, the verdict said.</P>
      <P>In terms of those findings, the judges revoked the District Court verdict and
sentenced Ku to three years and six months in prison. Ku should also have his
civil rights deprived for three years. He can still appeal his case to the
Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>Tsai was given a four-month prison sentence but under the terms of a commutation
statute implemented in 2007, he will have his sentence cut to two months, which
can be replaced by paying a fine.</P>
      <P>After losing the election by a slim margin, Huang filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's election victory on the grounds that the election-eve vote-
buying charge against him had unfairly swayed the electoral outcome.</P>
      <P>In the first trial, the judges invalidated Chen's election victory, but the High
Court revoked that ruling Nov. 16, 2006, which legalized her election and put an
end to the dispute.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prices on Taiwan's housing market will rise to reflect  the hot demand  expected
as result of increased cross-strait economic activity, with Taipei becoming an
even more high-priced real estate megacity, Perng Pei-yeh, general manager of
the Taiwan Housenews Company, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's property market is expected to see investments totalling 8 trillion
yuan (US$1.15 trillion) , Perng caid, claimed at a press conference to launch
his book on the prospects of local real estate.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and his Kuomintang (KMT) government have pledged to relax
cross-strait regulations to allow more tourists from China to visit Taiwan and
permit China nationals to invest in Taiwan real estate -- initiatives that are
expected to result in an increase in local property prices.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the new situation, foreign investors will follow this trend with an
eye on local property investment," Perng forecast.</P>
      <P>He added that many Taiwanese companies based overseas are also likely to return
with capital to buy housing properties as a means of repatriating their assets.</P>
      <P>Perng projected that housing prices in central Taipei City could reach NT$5
million per ping (3.3 square meters), with Taipei becoming a megacity that would
incorporate the adjoining counties of Taoyuan and Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>"With the Taoyuan International Airport and the world-leading high-tech industry
clusters in Hsinchu nearby, housing properties in 'mega-Taipei' will rank among
the highest priced in Asia, comparable to Shanghai" said Perng.</P>
      <P>One of the fastest-growing cities in the world, the port city of Shanghai boasts
two international airports -- Hongqiao International Airport and Pudong
International Airport -- and is regarded as the financial center of China.</P>
      <P>Perng said that in the future, housing prices in Taiwan will reflect property
costs in other Asian cities, rather than being determined by local trading
prices or government-controlled land value.</P>
      <P>For first-time buyers seeking lower prices, there might be some pockets of lower
cost housing, he said. For example, Miaoli County, sandwiched between Hsinchu
and Taichung City in central Taiwan, might be one such area, as it has not yet
been heavily developed, he added.</P>

      <P>Five Chinese men were handed over to the Kinmen Prosecutors Office Wednesday for
investigation of charges of poaching sea gravel off the Taiwan-held Kinmen
Island, according to the Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA).</P>
      <P>The five men, who were working on a gravel ship registered in Xiamen City in
Fujian Province, were detained by CGA officers after they were caught illegally
mining gravel some 0.9 nautical miles off Kinmen Island Tuesday evening, the CGA
said.</P>
      <P>The five men from Hunan Province in central China, including the ship's captain
Yen Yuhua, were found to have dug up about 200 cubic meters of gravel off the
coast of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In a preliminary probe conducted by CGA agents on Tuesday evening, Yen admitted
to having poached sea gravel in Kinmen's waters more than once.</P>
      <P>CGA officers turned over the five Chinese men to the Kinmen Prosecutors Office
Wednesday morning for allegedly breaching the Criminal Code, National Security
Law and the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The Chinese shipping company could also be fined up to NT$1 million (US$33,000)
under administrative law if the Kinmen County government rules that is guilty of
poaching the county's gravel, the CGA said.</P>
      <P>The CGA's Kinmen unit vowed to continue cracking down on such illegal activities
in the island's waters, saying that these actions result in serious damage to
Kinmen's ecological marine resources and affect the security of ships passing
through the area.</P>

      <P>With the increasing fuel prices, 24 percent of 1,071 respondents to a recent
survey said they will change their means of transport using more fuel-efficient
vehicles, while 75 percent said they will not, Taipei City's Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission Director Emile C.J. Sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Among those willing to change means of transport, 70 percent were car drivers
and 22 percent were scooter or motorcycle riders, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Of the 377 scooter riders and car drivers who said they will not change their
means of transport, 30 percent said they have to use their vehicles to carry
their families and enjoy the convenience of private transport; 23 percent said
they want to save time; 8 percent said they save money by using their own
transport and 28 percent said they have not been affected by the rising fuel
prices, Sheng noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that he will meet with lawmakers of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday, with the aim of strengthening communication
with them to facilitate smoother operations between the two government branches.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remark as he addressed  recent controversies surrounding the
Cabinet and its members, at a lunch that was attended by Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung, Secretary-General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan, ministers without portfolios
and the media.</P>
      <P>Liu said he hopes that by stepping up exchanges with the lawmakers, the
Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan will interact more smoothly.</P>
      <P>The premier said he will meet first on Thursday with a group of KMT conveners of
legislative committees and KMT legislative whips.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT Central Committee had discussed earlier in the day a
proposal to invite the premier, vice premier and other ranking government
officials to give reports at its regular meetings, Liu said that if he is
invited, he would go.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih said that the party will invite government
officials to give reports on June 18, when the KMT Central Committee convenes
its next regular meeting, at the earliest. The reports will focus mainly on the
formulation of major policies, contingency plans for natural disasters and major
unexpected events, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Liu said that there are communication mechanisms in place between the KMT and
the Cabinet, the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, and the KMT Policy
Committee and the Executive Yuan, and that they can be activated at any time. A
five-man team convened by President Ma Ying-jeou also meets every Monday, he
added.</P>
      <P>On KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin's criticism of the Cabinet's launch of an
NT$114.4 billion (US$3.75 billion) economic stimulus plan and its handling of
the issue of Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco H. L. Ou's U.S. permanent
residency status, Liu said that he will respect the views of every lawmaker.</P>
      <P>But, the premier said, he is confident that after better communications have
been established with the lawmakers, the KMT legislative caucus would support
the Cabinet's policies.</P>
      <P>Just three weeks into office, Liu's Cabinet has drawn flak from KMT lawmakers,
who said it was being "rash" in launching an economic stimulus plan without
careful consideration. Legislator Lee has argued that if the Cabinet continues
in that vein, KMT lawmakers will "face difficulty gaining another term."</P>
      <P>The ruling KMT hold nearly three-quarters of the seats in the 113-seat
Legislature.</P>
      <P>The premier was also criticized as failing to act "resolutely" in dealing with
the green card issue.</P>
      <P>The green card issue ballooned after Foreign Affairs Minister Ou, responding to
a media report, admitted recently that he had obtained U.S. permanent resident
status in 2005 when he was the R.O.C. ambassador to Guatemala, but had renounced
that status one month before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party then challenged the allegiance of
several officials in the KMT administration who either once held a U.S. green
card, allegedly still hold a U.S. green card, or have applied for a U.S. green
card.</P>
      <P>The premier was forced to conduct a full check of the status of Cabinet members,
after being badgered by the DPP over the issue.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government is packaging the Taiwan capital as complementary
destination for visitors to Hong Kong, and particularly travelers from mainland
China, a Taipei City tourism official said in Hong Kong Wednesday,</P>
      <P>Yang Hsiao-tung, commissioner of the Taipei City Department of Information and
Tourism, made the remarks at a promotion meeting with Hong Kong travel agents.</P>
      <P>Taipei City has designed tour packages that include famous attractions in the
capital such as its food, scenic spots and culture, with the hope of drawing
more Hong Kong visitors, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang told the Hong Kong travel  agents  that the central government's plan to
open Taiwan to more Chinese visitors will not necessarily pit Taiwan and Hong
Kong against each other for the tourist dollar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is likely to open its doors wider to tourists from China starting in July
-- an initiative that is expected to bring in NT$60 billion (US$1.97 billion) ,
if the projected 1.1 billion Chinese tourists visit the island each year, Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Tour packages that combine Taiwan and Hong Kong attractions will allow tourists
to visit two complementary destinations in one tour, Yang stated.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City government is seeking the cooperation of Hong Kong authorities
and is designing tour packages with that goal in mind, he added.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong citizens make an average of 400,000 visits to Taipei each year.</P>

two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave the instruction during a DPP Central Standing

Kuomintang (KMT) government may fail to safeguard Taiwan's interests, the

      <P>Tsai named former Mainland  Affairs Council Chairman  Chen Ming-tong as convener

international,  policy,  cultural and information affairs to assist in
monitoring the resumption of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
slated for Thursday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung arrived in Beijing Wednesday at the head of a
delegation to negotiate with the ARATS on issues concerning the launch of
weekend cross-strait charter flight services and visits to Taiwan by Chinese

      <P>Talks between the SEF and ARATS had been suspended since 1999, as Beijing felt
that then-President Lee Teng-hui was moving Taiwan toward independence.  The SEF
was founded  in 1991 to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official
ties.</P>
      <P>The resumption of cross-strait dialogue was the center of debates in the DPP

      <P>The government will step up its crackdowns on hoarding and market rigging by

      <P>A three-and-half-year-old boy in the</P>
      <P>central county of Changhua died of severe enterovirus infection Wednesday,
making him the country's sixth fatality from the gastrointestinal disease this
year, the Department of Health (DOH) reported.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
said that on May 25 the child developed symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease
(HFMD), a relatively common viral infection that usually begins in the throat.
He died Wednesday as a result of cardiopulmonary failure.</P>
      <P>Chou said that according to the results of an investigation, another boy living
in the same home as the child was found to have had HFMD symptoms on May 19, but
only developed symptoms of minor enterovirus infection.</P>
      <P>Chou said another five cases of severe enterovirus were reported Wednesday, all
of which were infections contracted from people with minor enterovirus.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases of severe enterovirus had reached
180, with six deaths reported, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He urged people to wash their hands frequently, saying that it is still the most
effective way to avoid contracting the disease.</P>
      <P>He also reminded parents that if their children develop symptoms of enterovirus,
they should keep them away from other children, at home and at school, to avoid
spreading the infection.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus infections are caused by a virus that enters the body via the

      <P>Taiwan will begin testing an enterovirus vaccine on animals next year,
Department of Health Minister Lin Fang-yue said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin said developing a vaccine would be the best way to prevent enterovirus,
adding that this would greatly reduce the number of severe cases and prevent
fatalities.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has been working on developing a type EV71 vaccine for some
time, Lin estimated that "tests on animals can begin next year, and the vaccines
could be launched in two to three years."</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks at a legislative committee meeting at which the
recent increase in the number of severe enterovirus cases became a topic of
concern.</P>
      <P>The DOH reported Wednesday the sixth enterovirus fatality this year, and revised
the number of severe cases of the disease upward to 180.</P>
      <P>Lin said the infection curve indicates that the situation should begin to ease
off after a two-week surge of enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>"If the situation does not subside, then we'll have to start to pray," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kenneth K. Wu, president of the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), an
autonomous research organization under the supervision of the DOH, said that the
EV71 vaccine has already been tested on mice, and that the major challenges in
the ongoing research would be toxicity experiments on animals and human testing.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the human testing will be conducted on children, not adults.</P>
      <P>According to DOH officials, nearly all of the serious enterovirus cases this
year were type EV71, with all the infected patients, except one, being under age
5. The exception was a 14-year-old resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated Tuesday to deal
with the growing number of enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-chuan, director of the infectious disease control department at Cheng
Kung National University Hospital, said last month that there might be a major
enterovirus outbreak this year, with the number of serious EV71 cases probably
rising to 300 by June. The spread of the disease in Taiwan tends to peak in mid-
June.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan could experience a major enterovirus outbreak once
every 10 years and 2008 could be part of that cycle.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases each year has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases
were documented and no serious enterovirus outbreaks have been reported since
2005.</P>

      <P>Chinese citizens had made 288,420 pleasure trips to Taiwan in 22,956 groups as
of the end of April, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to admit certain categories of Chinese citizens for group tours in
2002.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May, official tallies showed, 119 Chinese tourists had
absconded from tour groups following their arrival and 22 remained unaccounted
for, with the average absconding rate standing at 0.04 percent.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which coordinates the government's policy toward China, unveiled the
figures on its Web site, as a high-profile Taiwan delegation traveled to Beijing
earlier in the day for historic talks with its Chinese counterpart on technical
details regarding the much-anticipated launch of direct cross-strait charter
flights on weekends and Taiwan's plan to admit more Chinese tourists in July.</P>
      <P>The delegation is being headed by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) . Chiang and his Chinese counterpart,
Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , are scheduled to sign agreements on the weekend charter
flights and the admission of more Chinese tourists, at the end of bilateral
talks June 13 on behalf of their respective governments.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have so far operated
301 direct charter flights, with 105,682 passengers aboard, during a total of
seven special festivals, since such a measure was introduced for the first time
in 2005.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) have
presented a comprehensive blueprint to cope with the launch of weekend charter
flights and the arrival of Chinese tourists in early July. The MAC, the MOTC and
the Ministry of National Defense will unveil relevant new regulations and
complete the necessary preparations as soon as possible to ensure smooth
implementation of these trend-setting steps, the council said on its Web site.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two main gateways to Taiwan, Taoyuan and Kaohsiung
international airports, six other domestic airports -- Songshan Airport in
Taipei City, Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung County and Hualien, Makung,
Kinmen and Taitung airports -- will also be open for direct cross-strait charter
flight services in the future, the MAC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>High-profile murderer's request for parole rejected again</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
06/12/08  00:08:36

      <P>A proposal to grant parole to a graduate student who murdered her classmate in a
love triangle case 10 years ago was rejected by the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister  of Justice Huang Shih-ming  said that Hung Hsiao-huei, a graduate
student of National Tsinghua University, who murdered Hsu Chia-chen and
mutilated the body in March 1998, had committed a crime that "seriously affected
law and order in the society."</P>
      <P>"Hung has not shown sufficient remorse over her horrendous acts," Huang said,
noting that Hung, although ordered by the court to pay more than NT$20 million
to the family of the victim, has yet to take "substantive action to compensate
Hsu's family."</P>
      <P>"Having considered the factors of social justice, the perception of the general
public and the feelings of the family of the victim, the ministry has decided to
turn down the request for parole," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the ministry had tried unsuccessfully to contact the family of
the victim to discuss Hung's request, and that it was unlikely the family would
respond even if the ministry made further efforts.</P>
      <P>The MOJ's decision Wednesday marked the fourth time that Hung's request was
rejected.</P>
      <P>Huang said that if Hung continues to behave well at the Kaohsiung Women's
Prison, and does not break any rules, she could apply again in four months time
for parole.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that all requests for parole will be rigorously screened."</P>
      <P>Hung was found guilty of killing Hsu in an auditorium at National Tsinghua
University in Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, and was sentenced to 15 years in
prison for the murder. She was also found to have mutilated the body after the
murder, and the court sentenced her to an additional three-and-a-half-years in
prison for that offense.</P>
      <P>The court verdict against Hung also included an order to compensate  Hsu's
parents  to the tune  of NT$24.17  million (US$795,066).</P>
      <P>Hung and Hsu were rivals in a love triangle, and during an argument Hung beat
Hsu so severely it rendered Hsu unconscious and eventually caused her death.
Hung then poured a potent corrosive chemical -- aqua regia -- over the body and
dragged it to the rear of the auditorium to avoid detection.</P>
      <P>Hung and Hsu were both second-year graduate students at the prestigious
university's radiobiology institute at the time of the murder.</P>
      <P>Hung was not eligible for commutation of her sentence for the murder charge
under an amnesty statute passed by the legislature last year, but under the law
her sentence for mutilation of the body could be halved, which would bring her
release date to April 2, 2014.</P>
      <P>But prison officials said Hung has had a record of good behavior since she has
been imprisoned, and is eligible to apply for parole as she has served more than
half of her prison terms.</P>
      <P>Hung served part of her sentence at the Taipei Prison and Taoyuan Prison from
January 1999 through March 2001. She was transferred to Kaohsiung Women's Prison
March 21, 2001 and has been there since then.</P>
      <P>Known as the best educated inmate at the Kaohsiung Women's Prison, she teaches
other inmates English and other subjects, prison sources said.</P>
      <P>Prison sources said Hung is looking forward to continuing her graduate studies
after her release. They said she hopes the society will forgive her and will
allow her to stand on her own feet and save enough money to meet her obligations
to Hsu's parents.</P>

      <P>A Presidential Office screening panel has selected 40 candidates from more than
200 hopefuls for possible nomination for the Control Yuan posts, sources said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the Presidential Office had received 200-plus
recommendation letters before the June 5 deadline.</P>
      <P>The screening panel held its first meeting Wednesday to review all the
recommendation letters and tentatively came up with a short list of 40 qualified
candidates, through extensive consultations.</P>
      <P>The entire short list was agreed on by all members of the screening panel, the
sources said, adding that the selection work is almost in the final stage.</P>
      <P>The panel is expected to present a final list to President Ma Ying-jeou for
reference in the next few days, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Ma will then select from the list 29 candidates for the Control Yuan seats,
including the president and vice president of the body, which is the
government's supreme watchdog arm tasked with mointoring conduct of political
appointees, elected officials and senior civil serants.</P>
      <P>The president is scheduled to refer the Control Yuan nomination list to the
Legislative Yuan June 23 for confirmation.</P>
      <P>Because of partisan bickering between the country's two rival political camps,
the Control Yuan seats have been left empty since the term of office of the
previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi declined to make any comment on the
recommendation list for Control Yuan seats. He was also tight-lipped on reports
that Ma will nominate former Finance Minister Wang Chien-hsien to head the new
supreme watchdog body.</P>
      <P>According to earlier media reports, former National Chinan University President
Lee Chia-tung and Chien Hsi-chieh,  chief exeuctive of the Peacetime Foundation
of Taiwan, have been tapped for Control Yuan posts, but the screening panel
declined to confirm the reports.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the panel said one thing is certain that the ratio of female
Control Yuan members will be much higher than the previous level and that the
candidates' professionalism, social reputation and representativeness will be
key yardsticks in candidate selection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will form a special team to
monitor the upcoming talks between two semi-official intermediary bodies on the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave the instruction during a DPP Central Standing
Committee meeting, as she expressed concerns that the negotiators picked by the
Kuomintang (KMT) government may fail to safeguard Taiwan's interests, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Tsai named former Mainland  Affairs Council Chairman  Chen Ming-tong as convener
of the team, and mobilized personnel on DPP committees  in charge of
international,  policy,  cultural and information affairs to assist in
monitoring the resumption of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) ,
slated for Thursday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung arrived in Beijing Wednesday at the head of a
delegation to negotiate with the ARATS on issues concerning the launch of
weekend cross-strait charter flight services and visits to Taiwan by Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>Talks between the SEF and ARATS had been suspended since 1999, as Beijing felt
that then-President Lee Teng-hui was moving Taiwan toward independence.  The SEF
was founded  in 1991 to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official
ties.</P>
      <P>The resumption of cross-strait dialogue was the center of debates in the DPP
meeting, with several members of the party's policy-making committee expressing
the view that the talks would have a huge impact on Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to begin testing enterovirus vaccines on animals next year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will begin testing an enterovirus vaccine on animals next year,
Department of Health Minister Lin Fang-yue said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin said developing a vaccine would be the best way to prevent enterovirus,
adding that this would greatly reduce the number of severe cases and prevent
fatalities.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has been working on developing a type EV71 vaccine for some
time, Lin estimated that "tests on animals can begin next year, and the vaccines
could be launched in two to three years."</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks at a legislative committee meeting at which the
recent increase in the number of severe enterovirus cases became a topic of
concern.</P>
      <P>The DOH reported Wednesday the sixth enterovirus fatality this year, and revised
the number of severe cases of the disease upward to 180.</P>
      <P>Lin said the infection curve indicates that the situation should begin to ease
off after a two-week surge of enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>"If the situation does not subside, then we'll have to start to pray," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Kenneth K. Wu, president of the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), an
autonomous research organization under the supervision of the DOH, said that the
EV71 vaccine has already been tested on mice, and that the major challenges in
the ongoing research would be toxicity experiments on animals and human testing.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the human testing will be conducted on children, not adults.</P>
      <P>According to DOH officials, nearly all of the serious enterovirus cases this
year were type EV71, with all the infected patients, except one, being under age
5. The exception was a 14-year-old resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated Tuesday to deal
with the growing number of enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>Liu Ching-chuan, director of the infectious disease control department at Cheng
Kung National University Hospital, said last month that there might be a major
enterovirus outbreak this year, with the number of serious EV71 cases probably
rising to 300 by June. The spread of the disease in Taiwan tends to peak in mid-
June.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan could experience a major enterovirus outbreak once
every 10 years and 2008 could be part of that cycle.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases each year has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases
were documented and no serious enterovirus outbreaks have been reported since
2005.</P>

      <P>The meeting between Chiang and Chen Yunlin, chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) took place as long as 10 years after
the last visit to the Chinese capital by the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are the two semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan
and China respectively to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official
ties. High on the agenda of the talks are the launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights on weekends and the arrival of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Chiang extended condolences over the loss of life in the
May 12 earthquake in Sichuan province and offered to assist Beijing in handling
the aftermath of the disaster.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the SEF will coordinate  efforts  by Taiwan's government and private
sectors and help with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the disaster
areas based on Taiwan's experience in handling the aftermath of the Sept. 21,
1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>In return, Chen expressed his appreciation to Chiang for the offer.</P>
      <P>Chen said the resumption of dialogue between ARATS and SEF "is an important
platform for the development of cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>A meeting between the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and the late ARATS Chairman
Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 led to a series of systematic exchanges between
Taiwan and China, which had both avoided official contact since the Kuomintang
retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>But the exchanges ground to a halt in 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui
described cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state relationship, and
Beijing continued to refuse dialogue with Taiwan during the eight-year
administration of President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on the meaning
of "one China."</P>

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou His-wei went to the Interchange Association
(Japan) Taipei Office,  Japan's representative office in Taiwan, Thursday to
protest to the Japanese government over a collision between a Taiwanese fishing
boat and a Japanese patrol vessel that resulted in the sinking of the Taiwanese
boat. He urged that Japan apologize over the incident, offer compensation for
the damage incurred in the accident and release the detained Taiwanese captain
immediately.</P>
      <P>Apart from the official complaint lodged by Chou and other government officials
of the Taipei County Government, a protest was also staged  outside  the
Interchange  Association  by several non-governmental organizations, including
the Fishermen Labor Rights Association and the Concentric Patriotism Association
of the Republic of China, over Japan's handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>After a 30-minute meeting with the chief administrative officer of the
Interchange Association Ito Kiochi,  Chow vowed to do everything possible to
protect the fishermen of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"In light of Japan's rude and arrogant behavior, if it does not release our
people and pay compensation as soon as possible, we might resort to
international litigation to safeguard the rights of our fishermen," he said.</P>
      <P>"I do not wish to see bilateral relations between Taiwan and Japan reach a
breaking point, but the Japanese government should not trivialize the incident,"
he added.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat registered in Taipei County, carrying three crew
members and 13 recreational fishermen, sank around 3: 38 a.m. local time Tuesday
near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, after it collided with a Japanese coast
guard patrol boat.</P>
      <P>The 16 people were all rescued by the Japanese patrol vessel and were taken to
Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawan chain some 200 kilometers south of the
Tiaoyutais, for medical checks and for questioning.  The 13 recreational
fishermen retuned to Taiwan Wednesday morning and two crew members were released
Thursday, but the boat's captain Ho Hung-yu was still detained by the Japanese
authorities.</P>
      <P>Chou quoted Ito as saying that the Interchange Association would convey his
requests to the Japanese government, but that Japan maintained its sovereignty
claim over the Tiaoyutais and could not accept Taiwan's claim to the islands.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japanese,
were seized by Japan in 1895 when it colonized Taiwan. Tokyo continues to exert
control over the island group, though Taiwan and China also claim sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Chow said he finds it hard to accept the central government's inability to
protect the lives and safety of Taiwanese fishermen, and its failure of manifest
sovereignty over the disputed islands, adding that he will ask the Legislative
Yuan and the Executive Yuan to immediately dispatch warships to the Tiaoyutai
Islands.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government kicked off its "green Thursday, free bus ride"
campaign Thursday as part of its efforts to help save energy and cut carbon
dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu said that during the three-month campaign, the
city government will offer free rides on the port city's 82 public bus lines
every Thursday, and free tourist bus services on weekends.</P>
      <P>Chen said that she estimates the program will attract 20 percent more bus riders
during the three-month period, which will end on Sept. 14.</P>
      <P>The free service is expected to cost the city about NT$30 million (US$988,500) ,
but it is estimated that the program will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions
by about 170 tons, Chen added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the "green Thursday" program, the major said, the city government
will also set aside NT$30 million to launch a bicycle rental program at 20
locations throughout the city to encourage residents to ride bikes rather than
drive vehicles.</P>
      <P>Mayor Chen, Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chuang Chi-wan, city government
officials and city councilors boarded a city bus Thursday to promote the
campaign, which has been launched amid steep increases in international oil
prices.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the public to take public transportation more often, ride
bicycles, walk more, unplug electric appliances, cut down on the use of air
conditioners and turn off lights "to share responsibility as a citizens of a
global village."</P>
      <P>Chen said last week that the city government is also mulling offering free MRT
service one day a week during the summer months, with the costs to be covered by
the Environmental Protection Bureau's air pollution control fund.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) reasserted Thursday Taiwan's sovereignty
over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands and rebutted a report that claimed the
ministry  had instructed a Taiwanese coast guard vessel to "retreat" as it
approached an area where a Taiwanese fishing boat had sunk after a collision
with a Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the United Daily News, the Taiwan coast guard boat,
which rushed to the area after the accident, "faced-off" with the Japanese
patrol vessel for one hour until it was recalled by the MOFA.</P>
      <P>"The ministry did not ask the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) vessel to
retreat, but hoped that it would standby in the area near the accident without
entering the 12-nautical-mile zone of the islands at that time, " said Deputy
Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia at a news conference. The CGA boat left the area
after it had collected evidence of the collision, he stressed.</P>
      <P>He added that the ministry believed the CGA took the right action, which he said
also clearly demonstrated the Republic of China's sovereignty over the
Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat registered in Taipei County, carrying three crew
members and 13 recreational fishermen, sank around 3: 38 a.m. local time Tuesday
near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, after it collided with a Japan coast guard
patrol boat.</P>
      <P>The 16 people were all rescued by the Japanese patrol vessel and were taken to
Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawan chain some 200 kilometers south of the
Tiaoyutais, for medical checks and for questioning.  The 13 recreational
fishermen retuned to Taiwan Wednesday morning and two crew members were released
Thursday, but the boat's captain Ho Hung-yu was detained further by the Japanese
authorities.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japanese,
were seized by Japan in 1895 when it colonized Taiwan. Tokyo continues to exert
control over the island group and claims sovereignty over the 12 nautical miles
of marine territory, though both Taiwan and China each claim rights to the
island group.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Hsia reasserted Taiwan's sovereignty over the island
group, saying that the "Tiaoyutai Islands are part of the Republic of China's
territory and the government's determination to protect the rights of our
fishermen is unquestionable."</P>
      <P>He said the MOFA has already made clear its stance on the Tiaoyutais Tuesday to
Ikeda Tadashi, chief representative of the Japanese  Interchange  Association
Taipei  Office  --  Japan's representative office in Taiwan. Tadashi was asked
again Thursday morning to meet with Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou, he
added.</P>
      <P>Hsia said now that both Taiwan and Japan are investigating the accident and
trying to clarify how it occurred, the ministry hopes to resolve the matter
through diplomatic channels.</P>
      <P>"Once it is established that Japan should take responsibility for the accident,
the ministry will definitely  ask the Japanese government to apologize and to
offer compensation (for the damage incurred) , " Hsia said. "We would never
brush aside the incident and leave the Taiwanese fishermen to deal with it on
their own."</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Nano Exhibition, the second largest of its kind in Asia, kicked off
in Taipei Thursday, showcasing Taiwan's latest nano applications and products
and gearing up to attract some 10,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>"The industrialization of nanotechnology,  in both Taiwan's traditional and
high-tech industries, is creating new values and business opportunities, " Shih
Yen-Shiang, the vice minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA), said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing  the  opening  ceremony  of  the  sixth  annual nanotechnology fair,
Shih said there are more manufacturers this year than ever before at the show,
displaying a variety of applications such as nano ceramics,  nano light-emitting
diodes (LED)  and nanocatalysis.</P>
      <P>The three-day fair, being held by the Taiwan Nanotechnology Industry Development
Association (TANIDA) , has seen record-breaking participation  this year of 116
exhibitors at 200 booths,  a considerable jump from last year's 67 exhibitors at
185 booths.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that the MOEA in 2005 established a certification system to
standardize nano products, with the aim instituting quality safety controls for
Taiwan's nano products.</P>
      <P>"This type of certification not only protects the interests of consumers, but
also helps to encourage local industries to improve their nano products," said
Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih made special mention of two local think tanks,  the Industrial technology
Research Institute (ITRI) and Taiwan Textile Research Institute (TTRI), saying
that they have transformed various nanotechnologies into applicable and
marketable products and offered technology transfers to local manufacturers.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, Taiwan's manufacturers achieved
nanaotechnology production value of NT$300 billion (US$9.68 billion) in the last
five  years,  thanks  to a six-year  government nanotechnology program that
integrates the efforts of the industry and academia.</P>
      <P>Shih said the program will continue for another six years, from 2009 to 2014.</P>
      <P>Michael Reilly, the director of British Trade and Cultural Office, praised the
program, during in his speech at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>"By any standards, NT$23 billion of funding over five years is very impressive
indeed, " he said, referring to the budget for the national nanotechnology
program.</P>
      <P>He said this year his office brought four exhibitors from the U.K.,  including
the National Physical Laboratory  and Applied Microengineering, to seek research
and business partners.</P>
      <P>Expressing the hope that Taiwanese companies will join the UK NanoForum to be
held October 28-30 in London, Reilly said that the event will offer the
participants opportunities to meet with U.K. counterparts to discuss issues in
areas of healthcare for the modern age, clean technologies and an intelligent
connected world.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, the Taipei fair is second in scale in Asia only to
Japan's Nano Tech.</P>

      <P>Kao made the remark to reporters following a historic meeting between SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of
the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
earlier in the day in Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Chiang and Chen reached a verbal agreement on setting up
regular SEF-ARATS contacts and visits so as to ensure the stable and smooth
development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Regular exchanges can help the two sides of the strait put aside long-term
disputes and engage in creating a win-win situation for both of them, " he said.
"The quick resumption of SEF-ARATS negotiations marks a good start to a new era
of cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are slated to sign a formal accord Friday on regular SEF-ARATS
exchanges that will also include the implementation of weekend cross-strait
charter flights and the admission of larger numbers of Chinese tourists to
Taiwan starting July 4, Kao said.</P>
      <P>Chiang, at the head of a team of officials from the SEF, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the Mainland Affairs Council, arrived in
China Wednesday for talks with the ARATS, which will run through Saturday.</P>

(By Michelle Tsai and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council urged the administration of U.S. President
George W. Bush Wednesday not to further delay the sale of an arms package that
it promised Taiwan in 2001 or reject Taiwan's request to purchase additional
F-16 aircraft.</P>
      <P>The council was referring to a situation in which the Bush administration is
sitting on eight arms sales notifications related to the package, which are
ready for informal review by Congress, and continues to reject a Letter of
Request (LOR) from Taiwan for 66 F-16 C/D fighters.</P>
      <P>"Investing political equity today in Congressional Notification, as well as
accepting the LOR for F-16s, is in the long-term interests of both America and
Taiwan. Delay only makes matters worse, " Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of
the council, said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers predicted that if the Bush administration does not make a move
now, pressure from China will make hard decisions even harder early in a new
U.S. government that will be formed in January 2009.</P>
      <P>Also, if the Letters of Offer and Acceptance for the eight notifications are not
signed by the end of this year, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense will have
to budget all the items again, leading to the possibility that some of the
programs will be dropped or altered, Hammond-Chambers said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States has an obligation under the Taiwan
Relations Act and a core strategic interest in seeing Taiwan engage China from a
position of strength.</P>
      <P>"The notion that we should reduce or retard Taiwan military modernization at
this time only emboldens those who seek coercion and intimidation to resolve
cross-strait differences," he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing  disapproval  over  what  he  called  the  Bush administration
"blatantly manipulating the arms sales process, " he said the matter "leaves  a
legacy sure to bolster those who reflexively oppose this aspect of the Taiwan
Relations Act."</P>
      <P>The package of arms offered by the Bush administration to Taiwan in 2001
consisted of six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-fueled
submarines  and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine aircraft.</P>
      <P>The procurement was delayed for years owing to differences between ruling and
opposition parties in Taiwan, and the funding for the arms was only passed by
the Legislative Yuan in 2007.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also requested to purchase F-16 C/D fighters from the United States.</P>
      <P>However, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said last month "there
are no plans to offer the F-16s to Taiwan at present" because Taiwan is in the
middle of a political transition and the U.S. government will have to "await
developments there."</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has formulated a code of ethics for the country's public
servants which stipulates public office holders cannot receive gifts worth over
NT$3,000, as part of efforts to realize President Ma Ying-jeou's goal of
creating a clean government, a Cabinet official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official said as it is a social custom in Taiwan to present red envelopes
containing money to business associates during holidays or special occasions,
such as weddings and celebrations, and give money in white envelopes during
funerals, public functionaries are allowed to accept red or white envelopes
during the special occasions, but the amount of money cannot exceed NT$3, 000,
according to the code.</P>
      <P>The code further states that public office holders are prohibited from accepting
free meals, entertainment or hospitality that could make them suspected of
gaining personal benefits by taking advantage of their official posts.</P>
      <P>The code specifies that public servants are not allowed to accept gifts through
a third party, including their family members or relatives.</P>
      <P>The code aims to provide standards for public functionaries to follow and to
ensure they will carry out their duty based on the principles of integrity and
impartiality in order to enhance the people's confidence and trust in the
government, the official said.</P>
      <P>The code was formulated after taking for reference the codes of conduct for
public office holders in the United States, Japan and Singapore, the official
noted.</P>
      <P>The rules are applicable  to all employees  of the local governments, the
Control Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the Legislative Yuan and all government
agencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet plans to set up a committee to promote probity and

    <HEADLINE>Taipei to be full of Thai culture in coming days</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
06/12/08  17:42:27</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Thailand is one of the most popular destinations for Taiwanese tourists, and
economic cooperation between the two countries continues to bloom, the Thai
Trade and Economic Office (TTEO) will launch a program starting this weekend to
promote Thai culture to Taiwanese people, in hopes relations will further
develop.</P>
      <P>The Thailand's representative office here will spend the coming week enhancing
Taiwanese people's understanding of the country and they will do it by
highlighting one aspect of Thai culture - its puppet shows, Wanthanee
Viputwongsakul, deputy executive director of the TTEO, told a CNA reporter in an
interview earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Although some 427,000 Taiwanese tourists visited the Southeast Asian country
last year, and Taiwanese can easily say they have seen Thailand's historical
temples, tasted its cuisine, or even ridden on its elephants, they are much less
familiar with another treasure of the Buddhist country -- its puppet shows,
which has a history of more than a thousand years.</P>
      <P>In order to introduce this ancient cultural aspect of Thailand to Taiwanese
people, the TTEO decided to bring Thailand's only puppet theater to Taiwan. The
theater will give a performance on Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The Traditional Thai Puppet Performance", to be performed by a 19-member
puppeteers and musician troupe from the Joe Louise Puppets Theatre Company, is
scheduled to give the performance at Taipei City Council's auditorium.</P>
      <P>"Thailand and Taiwan have been friends for a long time, and we have very close
cooperation in the economy.... The TTEO is therefore thinking that we could
promote culture that helps to enhance better understanding between Thailand and
Taiwan," said Viputwongsakul.</P>
      <P>The Joe Louis Puppets Theatre Company is the only troupe of Thai theatrical
puppeteers in existence, and was given the award for the best traditional
performance at the 10th World Festival Puppet Art 2006 held in Prague, the Czech
Republic, according to Viputwongsakul.</P>
      <P>In ancient Thailand, the first puppet performance was called "Hun Luang" or
Royal Puppet.</P>
      <P>Puppet shows first started during the Ayutthaya period, in the 14th-15th
centuries, but were performed during royal functions and only within the royal
palace.</P>
      <P>Later, during the reign of King Rama IV, "Hun Lek", or Small Puppets, performed
Ngiew Jeen (Chinese Opera), and the Ramayana, a Buddhist story, along with the
"Hun Kabok, " or Stick Puppets, and Hu n Lakorn Lek, or Traditional Thai Small
Puppets, became open to the public and were performed widely around the country.</P>
      <P>"Thai theatrical puppetry is unique because each puppet requires the
synchronized efforts of three puppeteers in its manipulation, all of whom appear
on stage with the puppet," Viputwongsakul said.</P>
      <P>Puppeteers' movements are choreographed just as carefully as those of the
puppets and are in fact part of the show. When the puppet nods its head, the
puppeteers nod theirs. When the puppet looks to the left, so do the puppeteers.
Before puppeteers can be trained with these puppets,  they must complete  a
course in traditional Thai dance.</P>
      <P>Noting that puppet performances are something that can not only be a part of
people's daily life, but is also suitable for people of all ages, Viputwongsakul
was confident that "it will be very unique for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Besides the puppet show, a joint painting exhibition featuring memories and
impressions during six famous Thai and Taiwanese artis ts' trips to Taiwan and
Thailand, respectively, are also slated to open on from June 18-22 at the Red
House in Taipei City. The artwork include oil and water-color paintings.</P>
      <P>"It would not only promote cultural exchange and understanding between Taiwan
and Thailand, but also further signify the on-going and multi-dimensional
exchanges between Thai people and Taiwanese people," Viputwongsakul stressed.</P>
      <P>The three participating Thai artists -- Saman Klangchaturat, Navin Saengrob, and
Suwit Vidhyachak -- were impressed with their Taiwan experience and reflected
their sentiments in their paintings.</P>
      <P>The TTEO deputy head hoped locals will be able to enjoy a new combination of
Thai art and Taiwanese scenery by viewing the paintings.</P>
      <P>Klangchaturat, known as Mr. Rose in Thailand, is chairman of Artist' 96, and is
a teacher of oil painting at Bangsai Art and Craft Center in Ayutthaya Province.
He is also a member of the U.S. Arizona Art Group. Saengrob and Vidhyachak both
have more than 10 years of experience in painting and the arts field, according
to the TTEO.</P>
      <P>Although Thai culture is expected to grab Taipei people's attention in the next
few days and the TTEO events are expected to help Taiwanese people understand
Thailand from different angles, the Thai mission believes its work will not be
done.</P>
      <P>Viputwongsakul said many more projects that promote cultural understanding await
the TTEO to carry out, and it plans to conduct future activities, including
cooking lessons to teach Taiwanese people how to prepare Thai cuisine.</P>
      <P>She invited more Taiwanese tourists to visit Thailand and to see more of the
nation.</P>
      <P>She said she hopes that through exchanges of all kinds "we will learn from each
other... and we can live together peacefully."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China negotiators announced Thursday in Beijing they had reached an
agreement on all provisions regarding the launch of weekend cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights.</P>
      <P>The two sides are expected to officially sign the agreement Friday, according to
the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian
and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) Vice Chairman Sun Yafu.</P>
      <P>Kao and Sun, however, did not disclose the details of the agreement.</P>
      <P>After concluding the talks on the charter flight issue in the morning,
negotiators from the two sides engaged in further talks in the afternoon on the
issue of the admission of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China had previously held several rounds of
negotiations on the two issues, but were not able to seal an agreement owing to
differences on some crucial provisions.</P>
      <P>The negotiations were taken over by the SEF and ARATS -- the two semi-official
intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and China respectively to handle cross-
strait affairs in the absence of official ties -- after Beijing finally agreed
to the resumption of dialogue between the two organizations.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two sides have been thawing in the wake of the Kuomintang
administration's May 20 inauguration. The SEF-ARATS dialogue that began Thursday
in Beijing marked the first of its kind in nine years. Exchanges between the two
organizations ground to a halt in 1999 when then-Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state relationship.</P>
      <P>Beijing continued to refuse dialogue with Taiwan during the eight-year
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on the meaning
of "one China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Six industries vow to cut CO2 emissions by 830,000 tons</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's six major industries have vowed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
830,000 metric tons this year as part of their efforts to cut greenhouse gas
volumes, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The six major industries are steel, petrochemical, cement, paper, artificial
fiber and textile dyeing and printing, said Yang Poh-keng, deputy director of
Sustainable Development Division of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB).</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the six industries had signed an agreement with the MOEA in
2005, vowing to voluntarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 4.02 million
metric tons by 2008.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI) , Yang said the six industries succeeded in cutting carbon
dioxide emissions by 2.59 million metric tons between 2005 and 2006.</P>
      <P>In 2006 alone, the six sectors invested a total of NT$8.1 billion (US$267
million) in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, mainly through methods such as
improving or renovating equipment, he disclosed.</P>
      <P>Initial statistics show that the six industries would have cut carbon dioxide
emissions by 790,000 metric tons in 2007, he added.</P>
      <P>"Once the greenhouse emission law is enacted in Taiwan, these industries  will
have  little  time to make adjustments  and preparations, and that is why the
IDB has been promoting the voluntary reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for
years now, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>He estimated that Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions will reach 531 million
metric tons by 2015, but added that the country's goal is to reduce that volume
to 361 million metric tons by 2025.</P>
      <P>"Some 54 percent of the projected carbon dioxide emissions will come from the
manufacturing sector, " Yang said, stressing that the only way for the country
to cut greenhouse gas emissions is to promote high value-added and low energy-
consuming production.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier orders greater efforts to stop spread of enterovirus</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan gave directives Thursday for efforts to curb the spread
of enterovirus infections, which have caused the deaths of six children so far
this year.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in addition to intensifying its monitoring and public awareness
campaign, the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) should take "more active
steps" to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease, such as speeding
up the research and development of an enterovirus vaccine.</P>
      <P>"Relevant agencies should also consider whether a national enterovirus vaccine
fund should be established to push for a new vaccine policy that would better
protect the people's health, " Liu said during a weekly Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated Tuesday to deal
with the growing number of enterovirus cases in the country.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Lin Fang-yue said Wednesday that Taiwan tends to experience a
major enterovirus outbreak once every 10 years and 2008 could be part of that
cycle.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that the best way to prevent enterovirus infection is to develop a
vaccine domestically -- a solution that he said would greatly reduce the number
of severe cases and prevent fatalities.</P>
      <P>Reporting  at the meeting  on the  enterovirus  situation, particularly on the
severe type EV71 infections, Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the DOH Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) , said the spread of the disease is at a peak in Taiwan,
and that the CDC has launched  a sweeping nationwide  campaign to alert and
inform households with children under the age of 5.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that in all six fatal cases this year, the virus was contracted from an
older sibling. Children infected with enterovirus should be isolated and given
medical attention immediately, he advised.</P>
      <P>Warning that there might be a major enterovirus outbreak this year, Kuo said the
number of severe EV71 cases nationwide could rise to 300 by mid-June.</P>
      <P>He said that the CDC is scheduled  to present a vaccine development plan next
week, paving the way for the country to begin testing an enterovirus vaccine on
animals next year.</P>
      <P>According to DOH officials, nearly all of the serious enterovirus cases this
year were type EV71, with all the infected patients, except one, being under age
5. The exception was a 14-year-old resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan recorded 405 serious EV71 cases, 78 of which were fatal. The
number of serious cases each year has since declined. In 2000, only a few cases
were documented and no serious enterovirus outbreaks have been reported since
2005.</P>
      <P>The type EV71 infections this year first occurred in Kaohsiung City and County
and in Pingtung City and County in the south, and gradually spread northward,
with the number of confirmed cases rising swiftly over a two-week period to 107
last month. The number of fatalities jumped from two to four at the end of May
and to six this week.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can cause serious
illness and death, especially in infants and people whose immune systems have
been compromised.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng on Thursday unveiled the outlying island's
latest tourist attraction -- locally developed black garlic.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the hope that the product, made from garlic through a special
fermenting technique, will become yet another tourist attraction in addition to
the must-buy product for the island's visitors -- Kinmen's "kaoliang" (sorghum)
liquor and peanut candy.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a presentation of the unusual garlic, which was co-
developed by the National Kinmen Institute of Technology, Kinmen County Farmers'
Association, Kinmen County Agricultural Research Institute and Kinmen County
Animal and Plant Disease Control Center.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that black garlic, which gets rid of the obnoxious smell of the
ordinary garlic, but retains and contains more nutritious ingredients to the
ordinary garlic, could become a popular natural health food.</P>
      <P>"The nutritious value of black garlic are several times that of the ordinary
garlic, making them a pure, superb and natural energizing product," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsin-mei, assistant professor of the National Kinmen Institute of Technology
who heads the project to develop the black garlic, said that after going through
the special fermenting technique, the black garlic can be sold for NT$120
(US$3.94) each, compared to just NT$100 per kilogram of the ordinary garlic.</P>
      <P>"Although both Japan and Taiwan have developed the black garlic, the Kinmen
black garlic is of better quality and therefore, more competitive," Lin Hsin-mei
added.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-mei said that there are more than 20 garlic farmers in the outlying
island, producing between 20,000 and 30,000 kilograms of garlic annually.</P>
      <P>Magistrate Lee said that the county government will do its best to help farmers
produce the black garlic, adding that the county may promote the product as a
hangover cure after drinking the "kaoliang" liquor.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will visit acquaintances in southern Taiwan from June
14-16 as part of his efforts to reach people at the grassroots level after being
sworn in last month, Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma will visit friends he made on his presidential campaign trail in Yunlin and
Chiayi counties, as well as attend the Tainan University of Technology's
graduation ceremony. He will also stay over night at the ROC Military Academy in
Kaohsiung County, said Wang.</P>
      <P>Ma focused on canvassing at the grassroots level when he was campaigning to be
elected in the March 22 presidential election. During his so called "long stay"
campaign movement, he stayed at the homes of farmers and fishermen in many areas
of the country and took the opportunity to address issues concerning people's
livelihood.</P>
      <P>Wang emphasized Ma's upcoming trip will serve as a chance for Ma to maintain
friendships he made during the presidential campaign and is not aimed at dealing
with the aftermath of flood damages caused by torrential rains earlier this
month in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture statistics showed that agricultural losses due to heavy
rains in central and southren Taiwan earlier this month had amounted to NT$53.66
million (US$1.77 million) as of June 7.</P>
      <P>Although Wang denied there was any link between the timing of Ma's southern
Taiwan trip to the flood aftermath, local media said Ma will meet with farmers
and fishermen in Yunlin and Chiayi counties to listen to their opinions about
agricultural losses.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan already visited Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties on June
8 to acquire a better understanding of farmers' losses caused by the floods.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang said the Presidential Office will design Ma's other grassroots
trips, and does not rule out the possibility of holding the "long stay" movement
once again.</P>

      <P>An association has been set up to enhance the quality of service provided by

drugs, founding members announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Quality Improvement for Pharmaceutical Affairs Association, Taiwan (TQIPA)
has been set up by experts in pharmaceuticals, public health, medicine and law
to address the problem in Taiwan of consumers not always being well informed
about the proper usage of drugs, which may lead to damage to their health,
founding members said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, most pharmacists are overworked, with pharmacists in hospitals'
outpatient departments often each having to fill 300 prescriptions a day, said
Yu Wang-neng, executive director of the Union of Pharmacist Association and one
of the founders.</P>
      <P>"Misuse of drugs is a consequence of most of Taiwan's pharmacists in big
hospitals having an excessive workload, without time to appropriately explain
the usage of medicine, " Yu said.</P>
      <P>The association, which focuses on educating consumers about drug usage and drug
safety, differs from the existing Union of Pharmacist Association, which is a
society composed only of pharmacists to promote their interests.</P>
      <P>The new association's priority will be to lower the number of prescriptions each
pharmacist has to fill each day to 100 and to urge the government to integrate
the association's suggestions into the Pharmacist's Act, said Yu.</P>
      <P>In addition to calling for pharmacists' rights be protected and advocating
consumer drug safety, the association will also help institutions to train
professionals in the industry.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, there are about 40,000 licensed pharmacists in Taiwan, but only
24,000 of them work as pharmacists.</P>

      <P>The sixth Taiwan Nano Exhibition, the second biggest of its kind in Asia, opened
Thursday with a focus on the latest nano applications in household items.</P>
      <P>"This glue remover, which is partly composed of nanometers, could easily clean
any sticky substances from the surface of an object," said Harold Cheng, a
senior researcher from the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a
local think tank that has largest show booths at the fair.</P>
      <P>Introducing one the ITRI's latest innovations, Cheng said the cleaner is
particularly useful in removing the gummy residue that usually remains on
surfaces when stickers are removed.</P>
      <P>The three-day fair features a variety of applications, including nano ceramics,
nano light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and nanocatalysis. The Taipei show is the main
part of Taiwan Nano, which also includes forums, innovative competitions, and
the presentation of research results.</P>
      <P>Another ITRI creation, dye-sensitized solar cells, is seen as having great
potential for next generation solar energy applications.</P>
      <P>"These solar cells, which combine nanocrystal technology and nano thin films,
are efficient in converting sunlight into electrical energy," said Tung Yung-
liang, another ITRI senior researcher.</P>
      <P>Within three to five years, the cells could be incorporated into into marketable
products, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Textile Research Institute (TTRI), another local think tank that has a
strong presence at the technology show, is showcasing a range of textiles and
clothing that utilize nanotechnology.</P>
      <P>"Our nano silver coated yarns are textiles with an anti-bacterial finish that
could protect the wearer from scores of bacterial infections," said Chen Heng-
yi, a TTRI project director.</P>
      <P>Other nano applications that could provide greater convenience in daily life
include nano-technology ceramic sanitary wares that are easier than usual to
clean.</P>
      <P>"Our special product is capable of achieving the so-called lotus effect, which
means that the nanostructured surfaces of sanitary wares such as toilet bowls
will not retain grime," said Jiang Chi-kung, a researcher with the manufacturer,
Tien Kuang Enterprise.</P>
      <P>Jiang said their products were the first sanitary wares to be certificated by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>In 2005, the MOEA established a certification system to standardize nano
products, with the aim of introducing quality and safety controls on Taiwan's
nano products.</P>

      <P>Vaccines against enterovirus that are currently  under  development  will enter
the stage of animal experimentation next year and are expected to be verified
for human testing within three years, the head of Taiwan's Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>With enterovirus infections having claimed the lives of six children so far this
year and the possibility of a large-scale enterovirus outbreak looming, Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan instructed the national health administration to step up efforts
to produce vaccines against the virus.</P>
      <P>At a press conference following a weekly Cabinet meeting, CDC Director Kuo Hsu-
sung said that according to CDC estimates, the animal testing stage of the
enterovirus vaccines should begin as soon as early 2009, while the human testing
stage will start three years from now, after the animal testing is completed.</P>
      <P>Kuo also noted that the CDC will include the development of an enterovirus
vaccine as one of the government's major biotech projects and will seek help
from the domestic biotech industry and academia to accelerate the new drug
development process.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, if there is a major enterovirus outbreak this year, the
number of severe enterovirus infections could rise to 300 nationwide by mid-
June.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China extended an invitation in Beijing Thursday to
his Chinese counterpart to make a reciprocal visit to Taiwan later this year.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taiwan-based intermediary body the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), offered the invitation to Chen Yunlin, president of
the quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
according to a SEF official.</P>
      <P>Chen gave Chiang a favorable response, saying that "he would visit Taiwan at an
opportune time, " the official said in a news release.</P>
      <P>During their meeting at Beijing's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for the first SEF-
ARATS dialogue in nine years, both Chiang and Chen expressed hope that the two
sides will reach consensus and agreement soon on the much-anticipated issues of
direct cross-strait weekend charter flights and allowing Chinese tourists to
visit Taiwan, according to the news release.</P>
      <P>Chiang, Chen and the other delegates at the meeting agreed that complementary
talks on relevant  technical  issues,  including cross-strait cargo charter
flights, an increased number of weekend flights and the opening of more
destinations and flight routes, will ensue without delay, the official said.</P>
      <P>They also agreed that the function of cross-strait contact and notification in
the event of emergencies be resumed immediately.</P>
      <P>The negotiators also agreed that both intermediary organizations -- authorized
in the 1990s to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence  of official  ties
--  will  engage  and push for a "normalization"  of cross-strait  business,
trade and cultural exchanges, the official said in the news release.</P>
      <P>Chiang made a number of proposals during the meeting, including that the two
sides start talking soon on the opening of cross-strait shipping links, joint
exploration for undersea liquefied natural gas in the Taiwan Strait, cross-
strait crime-fighting, expansion of the "mini three links" and cooperation in
research into climate change and meteorology.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and the late ARATS President
Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 led to a series of systematic exchanges between
Taiwan and China, which had both avoided official contact since the Kuomintang
retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>But the exchanges ground to a halt in 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui
described cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" and
Beijing continued to refuse to enter dialogue with Taiwan during the eight-year
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the so-called "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on
the meaning of "one China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't urged to adopt quarantine measures for direct flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than three weeks before direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights will
start, opposition party legislators reminded the government Thursday of the
importance of adopting quarantine measures to prevent diseases spreading from
China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has set a target of starting cross-strait charter fights
on July 4, which China agreed to Thursday, in hopes of receiving 3,000 Chinese
tourists per day at the initial stage. The new measure is considered a means of
promoting Taiwan's tourism and boosting its economy.</P>
      <P>But opposition party legislators said Thursday the government should at the same
time ensure that the ease of travel to and from mainland China will not cause
mainland diseases to be easily spread to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The government only focuses on potential economic profits that direct charter
flights may bring,  neglecting  the problem of quarantine,  " Twu Shiing-Jer, a
legislator of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who once served
as minister of the Department of Health, told a press conference.</P>
      <P>He added that many diseases still occurring in China have disappeared from
Taiwan for years, such as rabies and malaria. According to Twu, an average of
about 40,000 cases of malaria occur in China every year, while in the past 10
years, all cases of malaria in Taiwan were imported.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the first
known outbreak of which occurred in 2003 in China, Twu stressed that the virus,
which is widely believed to have come from southern China, was brought to Taiwan
by travelers via Hong Kong, causing 84 deaths here and enormous economic loss,
including the lost of tourists.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan opens the door to Chinese tourists, quarantine measures should be
enhanced, Twu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that while the government is preparing for direct charter flights,  the
budget of the Department of Health for quarantine has not increased.</P>
      <P>In response, Chou Chih-hao, deputy director of Taiwan's Centers for Diseases
Control (CDC), admitted Thursday that the budget did not increase, but said that
all international exchanges contain risk, and what should be done is to control
the risk.</P>
      <P>"In addition to regular checks at the airport, the CDC has already demanded that
tour guides and airlines pay close attention to tourists' health (upon
arrival)," Chou said.</P>
      <P>Wong Chin-Chu, also a DPP legislator, questioned at a meeting in the Legislative
Yuan on the same day whether the government has made adequate preparations to
prevent the spread of epidemics by Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan, especially
as a current enterovirus outbreak is raging in China.</P>
      <P>Noting that 15,000 cases of enterovirus have been recorded in China at present,
Wong suggested that if the Department of Health cannot control the epidemic
situation after Chinese tourists arrive in Taiwan on July 4, the government
should postpone receiving them.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the spread of enterovirus is also becoming serious, with six young
children dying of enterovirus. An additional 183 serious cases of the disease
have been registered by the CDC to date.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, Taiwan may see an estimated 340 serious cases of enterovirus
by the end of August.</P>
      <P>Chen Tzay-Jinn, DOH deputy minister, affirmed that his agency has already made
plans for prevention of the enterovirus epidemic to prepare for the arrival of
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Lin Fang-yue, DOH minister, expressed his optimism on Wednesday about the
enterovirus epidemic, saying that the situation may be mitigated in two weeks.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Thursday for the passage of a budget bill on
increased domestic consumption, saying that it will help rev up the country's
flagging economy in the face of challenges from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's economy will improve once the budget bill is passed, in
addition to the imminent opening of direct weekend cross-strait charter flights
and of allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Passage of the budget bill and the opening of cross-strait exchanges will give
a shot in the arm to the domestic economy, particularly the service sector, " Ma
said during a meeting with a group of representatives from a national industrial
association.</P>
      <P>He told board members and advisers of the Taiwan Federation of Industry that the
administration will spare no efforts to implement various infrastructure
development projects after the budget bill is passed.</P>
      <P>Besides, he went on, with the opening of direct cross-strait weekend charter
flights and the arrival of Chinese tourists in Taiwan, bilateral exchanges and
cooperation between Taiwan and China will increase by leaps and bounds -- a
development that he envisioned will attract more foreign companies to increase
investment in Taiwan or seek joint ventures with Taiwanese firms.</P>
      <P>"All these factors will gradually help reinvigorate Taiwan's economy," Ma told
the visitors.</P>
      <P>For his part,  Taiwan Federation of Industry Chairman Lee Cheng-chia said that
both the government and the private sector are facing unprecedented challenges
from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"We are having difficulties keeping our heads above water due to a host of
problems, including increasing globalization, complicated financial situations
and soaring energy prices," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>He called for closer cooperation between the administration and the private
industrial sector to allow both sides to survive these trying times.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office protested strongly to the Japanese government Thursday
over an incident in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank early this
week after a collision with a Japanese patrol boat in disputed waters in the
East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said in a statement that the government's determination
to safeguard its sovereignty of the Tiaoyutai islands "has not changed, and will
never change."</P>
      <P>At issue was a Taiwanese sport fishing boat registered in Taipei County. The
boat, carrying three crew members and 13 customers, sank at around 3: 38 a.m.
local time Tuesday near the disputed Tiaoyutai islands after it collided with a
Japanese coast guard patrol boat.</P>
      <P>The 16 people were all rescued by the Japanese patrol vessel and taken to
Ishigaki, an island in Japan's Okinawa chain some 200 km south of the
Tiaoyutais, for medical checks and questioning. The 13 recreational fishermen
retuned to Taiwan Wednesday and two crew members were released a day later, but
the boat's captain, Ho Hung-yi, was detained by the Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi read the statement which he said was
approved by President Ma and the National Security Council.</P>
      <P>"The Tiaoyutais is the land of the Republic of China. It is geographically
connected to Taiwan with its jurisdiction falling under Toucheng township of
northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>"Our determination to insist on safeguarding the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais
has not changed, and will never change. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs
understands and abides by the stance, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>"We want to lodge strong protest over the Japanese ship ramming and sinking our
fishing boat and detaining its captain in our territorial waters," it said.</P>
      <P>"We  demand  that  Japan  release  the captain  and offer compensation, " the
statement said, adding that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has continued to
negotiate with Japan under this principle."</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters near the Tiaoyutais, which Taiwan, Japan and China all claim as
their sovereign territory,  but collisions there are rare.</P>
      <P>Legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party challenged Ma
Wednesday to adopt a firm attitude over the incident.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma, when serving as Taipei mayor in 2005, criticized then-President
Chen Shui-bian for being weak against the way Japanese vessels chased away
Taiwanese fishing ships, DPP Legislator Tsai Hung-liang said Ma should clearly
voice his stance.</P>
      <P>Wong Chin-chu, another DPP lawmaker,  said China's Foreign Ministry protested to
the Japanese government over its sinking a "fishing boat of Taiwan, China, "
immediately after the incident. In contrast, she criticized that MOFA acted
slowly, responding only with the words that China's statement is "not welcome."</P>

      <P>Two of Taiwan's favorite snacks -- steamed dumplings xiaolungbao and fried
dumplings shuijianbao -- are equally loved by some foreigners, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday by the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Held alongside the Photonics Festival at the Taipei World Trade Center
Exhibition Hall 1,  the poll was organized as a food competition, in which
foreign visitors were invited to taste the two types of dumplings, provided by a
popular local restaurant, before casting their votes to decide which one is the
tastiest.</P>
      <P>The poll was one of a series of events in The Taste of Taiwan Cuisine, a
culinary festival held by TAITRA during the month of June.</P>
      <P>"Our steamed pork dumplings are juicy and have very thin skins, with the finest-
quality pork stuffing inside," said Wu Kuo-liang, the chef and owner of a 12
-year-old dumpling restaurant in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu's dumplings, made with home-made pork jelly that adds a unique aroma, won
many foreigners over.</P>
      <P>"The dumplings really taste good, with a softness that spreads the flavors in
your month when you take a bite," said Brain Harmon, a U.S. visitor to the
photonics show.</P>
      <P>On the other side of the competition, the fried dumplings attracted an equal
number of foreigners who described them as irresistible.</P>
      <P>"The main attraction of our fried dumplings is the well-balanced amounts of
cabbage, garlic and scallions, as the strength of the scallions is softened by
the fresh taste of the cabbage, " said David Wu, the owner of another Taipei
restaurant.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA officials, Taiwanese cuisine is one of the major appeals for
foreign visitors, the number of which reached 3.71 million in 2007.</P>
      <P>Taking the opportunity of the estimated 3,000 foreign visitors to the photonics
event, the council said the food show will allow more overseas visitors to
experience Taiwan's culinary culture.</P>
      <P>"The food event could also expand the economic benefit by being held alongside
the trade show," said the council in a press release.</P>

      <P>A economic official said Thursday that the present financial crisis in Vietnam
is a short-term phenomenon and is not expected to affect Taiwanese enterprises
there.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the second-largest source of foreign investments in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Chiu Poh-ching, director-general of the Industrial Development and Investment
Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , said the ministry is in
close contact with its office in Vietnam regarding the problem and has reminded
Taiwanese entrepreneurs with operations in the Southeast Asian country to be
alert to the financial situation there.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the State Bank of Vietnam raised its
base rate from 12 percent to 14 percent Thursday in an attempt to curb double-
digit inflation.</P>
      <P>So far this year, Vietnam's stock market has dropped 60 percent, with its
currency, the dong, devaluating significantly against the U.S. dollar, prompting
many foreign investors to exchange dong for U.S. currency in order to be ready
to move their investments out of Vietnam at any time.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the MOEA has taken note of the situation, which it believes is the
result of an overheated economy in Vietnam caused by previous surges in the real
estate and stock markets.</P>
      <P>According to Chiu, most Taiwanese entrepreneurs in Vietnam are in the
manufacturing sector and export their products chiefly to Association of
Southeast Asian Nations countries, the United States and Europe. They rarely
touch the property or stock markets.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Vietnamese government is trying to control the inflation by
raising interest rates and adopting other measures, Chiu said he believes the
abnormal situation will ease in a short time.</P>
      <P>However, he warned Taiwanese entrepreneurs in Vietnam that although the drop in
the dong might be beneficial to their exports to other countries, it will cause
price hikes of imported raw materials.</P>
      <P>He added that although many Taiwan enterprises have already diversified their
investments globally to reduce risk, those in Vietnam should be alert to the
financial stability of their clients and partners.</P>

occurring at a good time for Taisugar, as it is searching for a plot of land in
Binh Phuoc Province to set up the farm.</P>
      <P>Taisugar has been operating a hog farm in Binh Duong Province which raises
60,000 pigs, Huang said. Its output is mainly sold to the local market in Binh
Duong and markets in neighboring Cambodia, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>But Taisugar is projecting to run a new hog farm in Binh Phuoc Province to
expand its production so as to meet strong local consumption in Vietnam and
Cambodia, he said, adding that the company has a plan to raise 40,000 pigs in
the new farm.</P>
      <P>However, it has been difficult for Taisugar to find a suitable piece of land in
Vietnam due to the country's skyrocketing land prices in the past few years,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Now with Vietnam dogged by acute inflation which has caused its stock market to
plunge by 60 percent and pushed its currency to depreciate by more than 20
percent against the U. S. dollar in recent months, Taisugar has come across a
good opportunity to purchase a piece of land, he explained.</P>
      <P>Taisugar is weighing the proper timing to acquire an adequate plot of land after
the Legislative Yuan has approved its budget plan, Huang said.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Taisugar's hog raising business in Vietnam has been quite
profitable thanks to the country's economy, which has been booming until
recently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls on European companies to invest in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on European companies Thursday to invest in the
i-Taiwan 12 infrastructure projects to help revitalize Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at this year's European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) dinner
celebrating the chamber's 20th anniversary in Taiwan, he also said Taiwan will
look to Europe's leading experience in cutting greenhouse gas emissions to
create a cleaner Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"To make Taiwan a more prosperous and healthy economy, we will embark on a
massive program of infrastructure -- the i-Taiwan 12 projects," said Ma in his
opening remarks. "We certainly welcome your investment in this program."</P>
      <P>Ma added that as Europe is a pioneer in the areas of cutting carbon dioxide
emissions, Taiwan would like to learn from the region, as his administration has
set an ambitious goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to the level of 2008
by the year 2020, to the level of the year 2000 by 2025, and half of the 2000
level by 2050.</P>
      <P>In response to this, Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office
in Taiwan, said that as deregulation and liberalization are keys in today's
global economy, Taiwan should increase foreign companies' access to the
government procurement market.</P>
      <P>"It is crucial that Taiwan finally joins the World Trade Organization government
procurement agreement, which will ensure that Taiwan's tax payers get the best
possible value for their money," Ledoux said.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks at the dinner, ECCT Chairman Philippe Pellegrin said
European companies are interested in lending their know-how and experience to
such projects, as they are world leaders in the construction of rapid transit
systems, airports and logistics centers, as well as in sustainable and clean
energy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma's obvious aspirations for change are very positively perceived at
the ECCT, Pellegrin, however, addressed concerns with regard to Taiwan's
competitiveness and its investment climate.</P>
      <P>He urged the Taiwan and European Union governments to begin talks on
liberalizing trade and proposed several measures that he said would bring
substantial  benefits to both the EU and Taiwan, especially at a time when
exports are being threatened by a weakening U.S. economy and inflationary
pressure from higher food and energy prices.</P>
      <P>"The ECCT would like to take this opportunity to call upon the EU and Taiwan  to
start  a dialogue  on what  could  be called competitiveness-driven trade
enhancement talks, which we hope could lead eventually to a mutually beneficial
full agreement, " Pellegrin said, adding that if trade enhancement measures --
similar to those of a free trade agreement -- could be adopted by both the EU
and Taiwan, it would increase bilateral trade annually by billions of euros.</P>
      <P>He noted that since 2000, EU investments in Taiwan increased by only 57 percent,
while they more than doubled in Singapore and South Korea, and even tripled to
53 billion euros in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The head of the ECCT also urged the government to introduce a number of reforms
to improve the investment environment in Taiwan, including tax reforms,
financial sector reforms, national health reforms and government procurement
reforms.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that a further lowering of tariffs would ease access to
European markets for Taiwanese electronics producers and increase European
exports of machinery and electronics components to Taiwan, while the removal of
restrictions for European service providers  would make cheaper services
available  to Taiwanese manufacturers and strengthen Taiwan's own
competitiveness in services.</P>
      <P>"Such measures would provide more European businesses with the opportunity to
select Taiwan as a stepping stone into Asia, " Pellegrin said.</P>
      <P>He also encouraged the government to move swiftly to normalize cross-Taiwan
Strait interactions with China, such as allowing direct cargo flights, Taiwanese
securities investment in China, and further easing of the process for the
delivery of local visas for China-based employees and customers of European
companies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Opening the Taiwan economy to China should offer European companies many new
opportunities to increase employment in Taiwan, " he said.</P>
      <P>The ECCT is the principle organization  promoting European business interests in
Taiwan. Representing close to 700 members from 420 companies and organizations,
the chamber addresses specific concerns and provides concrete recommendations to
all levels of government to facilitate improvements in the business environment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The executive director of the Committee on Japanese Affairs under the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) rendered his resignation Thursday to take
responsibility for poor decision making when dealing with a boat collision
between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels near the disputed Tiaoyutai islands.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew members and 13 customers
aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutai Islands, known in
Japan as the Senkaku islands, after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol
boat Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan Wednesday and two crew members were released
the following day, but the boat's captain, Ho Hung-yi, was detained by the
Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco Ou summoned Tadashi Ikeda, head of the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association of Japan,  which represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties, Thursday to demand that Japan release
Ho as soon as possible and reassert Taiwan's rights over the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The islands are a disputed area, with Taiwan, Japan and China all laying claim
to sovereignty. Tokyo continues to exert control over the island group and
claims sovereignty over 12 nautical miles of marine territory.</P>
      <P>Tsai told CNA that he has offered to resign to take responsibility for ordering
a Taiwanese coast guard ship not to cross the 12 nautical mile limit around the
Tiaoyutais without thorough information and instructions from higher-ranking
officials.</P>
      <P>Tsai explained that he received a call from the Interchange Association after
the incident demanding that the Taiwanese coast guard vessel delay entering the
marine territory to avoid a possible conflict.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he made the decision without the knowledge that the ship was already
some 7.8 nautical miles from the Tiaoyutais to gather evidence relating to the
collision.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that he did not give the order for the ship to leave the area,
which would have been considered an act that would compromise Taiwan's rights
over the island group.</P>
      <P>He also said that as a diplomat, he made the decision from the standpoint of
"preventive diplomacy, " in the hope of preventing a conflict between Japan and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA official, Ou had not approved the resignation as of press
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP wants no concessions in cross-strait exchanges: chairwoman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is not opposed to engagements
across the Taiwan Strait but the govenrment should not concede too much in
bilateral interactions, the party's leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Certain principles  should be upheld and should never be compromised in cross-
strait negotiations, " DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said in an interview with
CNA, adding that the government should not come to any critical decision in a
rush that could put major national interests at stake.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the current negotiations in Beijing between the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies on the two sides of the strait -- Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , Tsai derided the talks as "drama."</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, she said, technical details involved in the two major
topics of discussion -- the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights on
weekends and wider opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists -- were resolved when
the DPP was still in power.</P>
      <P>"What we are concerned about are political matters involved in those two
initiatives, " Tsai said, adding that the Kuomintang government should let the
DPP know when political details are negotiated and who represents Taiwan in such
negotiations, as well as other details of the talks.</P>
      <P>Noting that the resumption of the SEF-ARATS dialogue involves crucial national
interests, Tsai said relevant political talks should be kept transparent and
conducted under proper supervision.</P>
      <P>"While I understand that certain matters cannot be discussed completely in
public, the government's monitoring and checks and balances mechanism should not
be left dormant, " Tsai said, adding that even if the president is not
constitutionally obligated to report to the legislature on the issue, the
president's staff and the premier should respond legislative inquiries about the
issues.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a former vice premier and the top China policy planner in the former DPP
administration, said the DPP administration did not close the door on cross-
strait exchanges during its years in power.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the DPP administration never opposed cross-strait engagements and
instead supported appropriate exchanges in economic and other fields, Tsai said
the KMT adminstration should not compromise basic principles in cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>She also said professional civil servants should play leading roles in the
process  and that key negotiators  should avoid involvement  in political
affairs and forget domestic partisan bickering and biases in negotations.</P>

      <P>Ordinary Chinese citizens will be formally permitted to make pleasure trips to
Taiwan from July 18, according to an accord reached Thursday  between the two
quasi-official intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) finalized
negotiations on the opening of Taiwan to ordinary Chinese tourists Thursday
evening.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin are scheduled to
sign a formal agreement on the new open-door exchange program Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its door for group tours by certain categories of Chinese
citizens since 2002, but ordinary Chinese citizens cannot make sightseeing
visits to the island until July 18.</P>
      <P>Also to be signed Friday is an agreement on the launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights on weekends from July 4. Negotiations on this initiative were
finalized Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese tour operators originally  expected that ordinary Chinese tourists
could travel to Taiwan July 4 along with the launch of direct cross-strait
charter flights, but Taiwan negotiators said the arrival date of the first
ordinary Chinese tour group will be postponed to July 18 under a bilateral
agreement to be signed Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, ordinary Chinese tourists must come and leave in
groups and the daily ceiling on the entry of Chinese tourists is capped at 3,000
in the initial stage. The number will be adjusted in the second year in terms of
market demand.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that the tourist number of each group should fall
within the range of 10 to 40, with a maximum stay of 10 days.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegation arrived in Beijing Wednesday and is scheduled to meet with
Chinese President Hu Jintao Friday. Wang Yi, director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office of the State Council -- China's Cabinet, hosted a dinner in honor of the

      <P>Chinese carriers will be permitted to set up offices in Taiwan in six months in
line with the launch of direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait on
weekends from July 4, a Taiwanese negotiator said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said the two sides have come to terms on
allowing Taiwanese and Chinese carriers to set up offices on each other's
territory to offer more convenient services for passengers.</P>
      <P>Eyeing the potentially vast Chinese tourist market, major Taiwanese carriers,
such as China Airlines and EVA Airways, have already opened offices in noted
Chinese cities.</P>
      <P>According to an accord reached Thursday morning between the SEF and its Chinese
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
Chinese carriers will be allowed to set up preparatory offices in cities where
they will operate weekend charter flights. The preparatory offices can be
upgraded to branch offices after six months of operations.</P>
      <P>On Friday, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kun and ARATS President Chen Yulin will sign
a formal agreement on the launch of direct weekend cross-strait charter flights
July 4. Also to be signed is an agreement on opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists from July 18.</P>
      <P>Initially, up to 3,000 Chiense tourists will be allowed to enter Taiwan for
pleasure trips. It means a total of 1.09 million Chinese tourists will gain
access to Taiwan annually. The number is rather small in comparison to China's
overall annual outbound travelers which reached 55 million last year.</P>

marine territory to avoid a possible conflict.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he made the decision without the knowledge that the ship was already
some 7.8 nautical miles from the Tiaoyutais to gather evidence relating to the
collision.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that he did not give the order for the ship to leave the area,
which would have been considered an act that would compromise Taiwan's rights
over the island group.</P>
      <P>He also said that as a diplomat, he made the decision from the standpoint of
"preventive diplomacy, " in the hope of preventing a conflict between Japan and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to a MOFA official, Ou had not approved the resignation as of press
time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP wants no concessions in cross-strait exchanges: chairwoman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is not opposed to engagements
across the Taiwan Strait but the govenrment should not concede too much in
bilateral interactions, the party's leader said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Certain principles  should be upheld and should never be compromised in cross-
strait negotiations, " DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said in an interview with
CNA, adding that the government should not come to any critical decision in a
rush that could put major national interests at stake.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the current negotiations in Beijing between the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies on the two sides of the strait -- Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , Tsai derided the talks as "drama."</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, she said, technical details involved in the two major
topics of discussion -- the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights on
weekends and wider opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists -- were resolved when
the DPP was still in power.</P>
      <P>"What we are concerned about are political matters involved in those two
initiatives, " Tsai said, adding that the Kuomintang government should let the
DPP know when political details are negotiated and who represents Taiwan in such
negotiations, as well as other details of the talks.</P>
      <P>Noting that the resumption of the SEF-ARATS dialogue involves crucial national
interests, Tsai said relevant political talks should be kept transparent and
conducted under proper supervision.</P>
      <P>"While I understand that certain matters cannot be discussed completely in
public, the government's monitoring and checks and balances mechanism should not
be left dormant, " Tsai said, adding that even if the president is not
constitutionally obligated to report to the legislature on the issue, the
president's staff and the premier should respond legislative inquiries about the
issues.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a former vice premier and the top China policy planner in the former DPP
administration, said the DPP administration did not close the door on cross-
strait exchanges during its years in power.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the DPP administration never opposed cross-strait engagements and
instead supported appropriate exchanges in economic and other fields, Tsai said
the KMT adminstration should not compromise basic principles in cross-strait
negotiations.</P>
      <P>She also said professional civil servants should play leading roles in the
process  and that key negotiators  should avoid involvement  in political
affairs and forget domestic partisan bickering and biases in negotations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China sign pacts on weekend charter flights, tourism</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  13  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan and China officially sealed agreements Friday in
Beijing paving the way for the July 4 launch of weekend direct cross-Taiwan
Strait charter flights and allowing Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan from July
18.</P>
      <P>The accords  were signed on behalf  of the two sides by Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart,
Chen Yunlin of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that Chinese carriers will be allowed to set up preparatory
offices in cities where they will operate the weekend charter flights. The
preparatory offices can be upgraded to branch offices after six months.</P>
      <P>Also, Chinese tourists must arrive in Taiwan and leave in groups, with a daily
entry ceiling capped at 3,000 in the initial stage. The number will be adjusted
in the second year according to market demand.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed that the tourist number of each group should fall
within the range of 10 to 40, with a maximum stay of 10 days.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has opened its doors to group tours by certain categories of Chinese
citizens since 2002, but ordinary Chinese citizens cannot make sightseeing
visits to the island until July 18.</P>
      <P>Representatives from Taiwan and China had previously held several rounds of
negotiations on the two issues, but were not able to seal an agreement owing to
differences on some crucial provisions.</P>
      <P>The negotiations were taken over by the SEF and ARATS -- the two semi-official
intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and China, respectively, to handle cross-
strait affairs in the absence of official ties -- after Beijing finally agreed
to the resumption of dialogue between the two organizations.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two sides have been thawing in the wake of the Kuomintang
administration's May 20 inauguration. The Chiang-Chen talks that took place
Thursday in Beijing marked the first of its kind in nine years.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between the two organizations ground to a halt in 1999 when then-
Republic  of China President  Lee Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a
special state-to-state relationship. Beijing continued to refuse dialogue with
Taiwan during the eight-year administration  of  former  President  Chen  Shui-
bian  of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the so-called "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on
the meaning of "one China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei bans kids under 5 from play areas to halt enterovirus spread</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Children under the age of five have been temporarily banned from entering public
indoor play areas in seven enterovirus high-alert areas in Taipei County, the
county's Health Bureau announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Wen-kwei, the bureau's chief secretary, said the ban has been imposed as
part of efforts to halt the spread of enterovirus, which has already claimed the
lives of six children in Taiwan so far this year. There have been a total of 183
serious enterovirus infections this year to date.</P>
      <P>The seven enterovirus high-risk areas where the ban has been imposed  are all
high population  density centers --  Shulin, Hsingchuang, Lujou, Banchiao, Bali,
Hsindian and Jhonghe.</P>
      <P>Businesses with indoor kids play areas that violate the ban will be fined
between NT$60,000 (US$1,980) and NT$300,000 according to the Communicable
Disease Prevention and Control Law, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that considering the seriousness of the enterovirus outbreak and the
fact that the risk of contracting the disease usually peaks in early June, the
ban is a reasonable response measure.</P>
      <P>Huang added that a decision on the duration of the ban will be made on the basis
of data compiled by the Cabinet-level epidemic response command center that was
set up earlier this week to monitor the outbreak.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau's statistics, there had been a total of 18 suspected
cases of enterovirus infection in the county as of July 12, with eight later
confirmed as serious enterovirus cases.</P>
      <P>The latest case is a 10-month-old baby girl in Jhonghe City who was confirmed as
a serious enterovirus case by the Cabinet-level Department of Health's Centers
for Disease Control the previous day.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus is the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can cause serious
illness and death, especially in infants and people whose immune systems have
been compromised.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese tourists not the only option: pro-independence groups</HEADLINE>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several pro-independence groups said Friday in response to the imminent opening
to tourists from China that Taiwan should not focus only on attracting Chinese
tourists and overlook the consequences that could result from such a policy.</P>
      <P>"Chinese tourists are not the only option and they are certainly not the best
choice, " said Chang Hsue-yi, director of the Taiwan Society North, which held a
news conference along with Taiwan Society Hakka, Taiwan Society YouthPower,
Taiwan Young Intellectuals, and Taiwan Association of University Professors.</P>
      <P>The news conference was held in light of the signing of an agreement early
Friday by Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) on the launch of direct weekend
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights from July 4 and on the admission of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan should not be so "meek and timid" and should not make
concessions on Taiwan's sovereignty in order to fulfill President Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign promises of bringing in Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Issues such as quarantine procedures, environmental hygiene and public security
should not be overlooked, as these areas might be compromised with the influx of
large numbers of Chinese tourists, he claimed.</P>
      <P>"Frequent charter flights and large numbers of Chinese tourists will be
accompanied by the problem of quarantine and epidemic prevention, " said Chang
Yeh-sen, director of the Taiwan Society Hakka. "Such issues have great impact on
our citizen's health and safety," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003 is a
lesson that should not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>China was severely criticized for covering up its case numbers and its secretive
handling of the outbreak, which resulted in the spread of the epidemic and
caused a global panic.</P>
      <P>"The impact and damage to society and the environment caused by a full opening
to Chinese tourists might be much greater than the economic benefit, "
speculated John Chen, former director of the Department  of  Transportation  and
Communications'  Tourism Bureau Chicago Office.</P>
      <P>Japan, which opened its doors to Chinese tourists in 2002, has experienced a
great number of Chinese tourist runaways that has caused serious public security
problems, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed worry that what he claimed is the "poor behavior and bad
manners" of Chinese tourists might repel other international tourists that are
bigger spenders.</P>
      <P>He added that the Disneyland in Hong Kong serves as a good warning to Taiwan, as
it was originally set to be an international theme park but now is no more than
a local amusement park for a single nation due to low-class visitors from China.</P>
      <P>"We should broaden our vision and set our target high to international tourists
from advanced countries such as Europe and the United States," Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No delay in Ukraine stadium reconstruction: Taiwanese design group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese company that won a tender for reconstruction of an old stadium in
the Ukrainian capital of Kiev in April this year denied Friday that it has
delayed carrying out the project.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Archaisa Design Group was responding to a Reuters report filed a
day earlier that quoted a Ukrainian Soccer Federation official as claiming that
the winning bidder appears incapable of finishing the Kiev Olympic Stadium
reconstruction project in time because of a lack of materials and building
resources.</P>
      <P>"The Reuters report was false, " the spokesman said, adding that the Ukrainian
government would publish later in the day a report detailing the truth about the
issue.</P>
      <P>According to the Reuters report, Ukraine could lose the right to co-host  the
Euro 2012 soccer  tournament  due to delays  in US$300 million reconstruction of
the 80,000-seat stadium.</P>
      <P>As the project involves dismantling an adjacent shopping center, the report
said, reconstruction has been stalled over compensation disputes. Although a
deal was finally clinched to dismantle the center after months of wrangling, the
report said, there is no sign of work starting.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko has grown increasingly
concerned over the slow progress of preparations and has given the organizing
committee until June 18 to resolve key issues, the report added that Union of
European Footfall Association (UEFA) President Michel Platini has also
criticized preparations in Ukraine and is to make another visit July 1-2 to
inspect the progress.</P>
      <P>The report further said that rumors have periodically swept Kiev that UEFA
officials are drawing up contingency plans to move the event elsewhere if
demands are not met. Poland is the other co-host.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted Boris Voskresensky, a deputy head of the Ukraine Soccer
Federation, as claiming that the Taiwanese design group had agreed to a plan
under which the stadium would have a capacity of 85,000, but had since proposed
a scheme for no more than 50,000 seats.</P>
      <P>However, the Archaisa spokesman rebutted Voskresensky's remarks, saying that the
capacity demanded by the Ukrainian authorities was 73,000 and that the company
has accordingly come up with a blueprint for exactly that capacity.</P>
      <P>Noting that neither  the Ukrainian  Soccer Federation  nor Voskresensky is
tasked with the stadium reconstruction project, the spokesman said the project
is being handled by the country's sports ministry and the Euro 2012 organizing
committee.</P>
      <P>"We are working closely with the two institutes on the stadium design and
reconstruction and are preparing to furnish UEFA with a briefing on the
project," the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>UEFA is the governing body of soccer in Europe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan joined the United States and Japan Thursday in filing a World Trade
Organization (WTO) dispute against the European Union, claiming that the EU has
failed to fulfill its commitment to eliminate tariffs on certain technology
products.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation to the WTO said it sent a consultation request to its
EU counterpart, an action the U.S. and Japan took May 28.</P>
      <P>The products in question are flat panel displays, set-top boxes with a
communication function, "input or output units" and fax machines.</P>
      <P>In its consultation request, Taiwan says that according to the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA) that came into force in 1997, these products should
be duty-free, but the EU and its member states still imposes duty on them.</P>
      <P>The EU, however, maintains that certain products are taxed because they possess
additional functions and are therefore not covered by the ITA.</P>
      <P>For example, the EU argues in a May 28 statement that LCD monitors  equipped
with a Digital Visual Interface  should be classified as a video monitor rather
than a computer monitor and as such is eligible for duty.</P>
      <P>Similarly not recognized by the EU as ITA products are set-top boxes with
certain modems or with a recording device, as well as multifunctional digital
copiers.</P>
      <P>According to WTO rules, the plaintiffs can request the establishment of a panel
to rule on their claims if the differences between the two sides are not
resolved 60 days after the defendant receives the consultation request.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has in two other cases requested dispute settlement consultations.
Taiwan's WTO Ambassador Lin Yi-fu declined to predict whether the technology
product case will become the first to go to a panel since the country joined the
WTO in 2002.</P>
      <P>In the May statement responding to the U.S. action, the EU said it is willing to
reassess the current ITA product coverage to reflect new technology in a
negotiation with all ITA signatories, adding that the ITA's criteria "cannot be
made as a result of bilateral litigation."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said Friday that it is not improper for
the heads of the two cross-strait intermediary bodies to explore the possibility
of exchange liaison offices to help facilitate bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan was referring to a
consensus on exchanging offices reached in Beijing Thursday by Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen
Yunlin, president of China's intermediary body the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>"This issue was only part of the exchanges of talks between the two top
negotiators  and has nothing  to do with substantive cross-strait negotiations,
"Lai said.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks to dispel opposition concern that the SEF and ARATS "had
overstepped their authority" in negotiating the issue and reaching consensus, as
they are not the official authorities of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Noting that an exchange of SEF and ARATS offices is an issue that has been fully
discussed within the administration, Lai said Chiang had not overstepped his
authority as Taiwan's top negotiator with China by making a favorable response
to his Chinese counterpart.</P>
      <P>During the SEF-ARATS talks that took place in Beijing's Diaoyutai State
Guesthouse Thursday -- the first of their kind after a hiatus of nearly ten
years -- Chen proposed that "efforts be made to facilitate the exchanges of
liaison offices of the two intermediary bodies."</P>
      <P>Chiang offered a positive response to Chen's proposal, but told his host that
"he will return to Taipei to consult his boss -- the MAC -- over the matter, "
according to a news release from the SEF a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Lai said Chiang and his 19-member delegation were authorized to talk with the
ARATS officials on the opening of direct weekend cross-strait charter flight
services and increasing the number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Lai said the SEF and ARATS officials may exchange opinions on many
issues of mutual concern, including the possibility of the two organizations'
exchanging liaison offices in the future.</P>
      <P>During Thursday's talks, the negotiators also agreed that both intermediary
organizations -- authorized in the 1990s to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties -- will engage and push for a "normalization" of cross-
strait business, trade and cultural exchanges, the official said in the news
release.</P>
      <P>Chiang made a number of proposals during the meeting, including that the two
sides start talking soon on the opening of cross-strait shipping links, joint
exploration for undersea liquefied natural gas in the Taiwan Strait, cross-
strait crime-fighting, expansion of the "mini three links" and cooperation in
research into climate change and meteorology.</P>
      <P>A meeting between the late SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and the late ARATS President
Wang Daohan in Singapore in 1993 led to a series of systematic exchanges between
Taiwan and China, which had both avoided official contact since the Kuomintang
retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>But the exchanges ground to a halt in 1999 when then-President Lee Teng-hui
described cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship" and
Beijing continued to refuse to enter dialogue with Taiwan during the eight-year
administration of former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of
the so-called "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree to disagree on

      <P>Ho Hung-yi, the fishing boat captain who has been detained by the Japanese
government since his ship was sunk Tuesday morning, has been released and is
scheduled to arrive home Friday evening, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said.</P>
      <P>Liu announced the release during a question-and-answer session at the
Legislative Yuan, citing information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA).</P>
      <P>Ho was expected to travel from the island of Ishigaki, where he was being held,
to Okinawa, before boarding a China Airlines flight for Taipei that is expected
to arrive at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at 7:55 p.m.</P>
      <P>The recreational fishing boat captained by Ho, the "Lienho," sank some six
nautical miles off the coast of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands -- called the

      <P>One of the returning crewmen asserted that the Japanese patrol boat deliberately
rammed into the Taiwanese fishing boat. The Japanese coast guard claimed the
Taiwanese boat made an abrupt turn and hit the Japanese vessel.</P>
      <P>Before Ho's release was announced, Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco Ou said
at the Legislative Yuan that he would recall Representative to Japan Koh Se-kei,
if Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan was unable to convince the Japanese
government to let Ho go free.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a question from Legislator Justin Chou of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), who asked him what the ministry would do if Japan remained
unwilling to release the skipper, to apologize, or to provide compensation
before the end of the workday Friday.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said he agreed with Ou's decision, noting that
"recalling the representative will be the first step." He described the move as
a "very serious protest."</P>
      <P>Taiwan,  China  and Japan all claim sovereignty  over the Tiaoyutais, generally
ignored until potentially vast oil and gas reserves were discovered in waters
near the uninhabitated islands.</P>
      <P>Chou complained that over the past decade, including the last eight years under
a Democratic Progressive Party administration, 16 rounds of negotiations between
Taiwan and Japan have been held to settle the dispute, but without results.</P>
      <P>Tokyo continues to exert control over the island group and claims sovereignty
over the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters off the islands' coast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Six big hospitals found with legionnaires' disease bacteria</HEADLINE>

      <P>An inspection of water cleanliness at 12 major hospitals has found that the
drinking water and water cooling systems in six of them contain the bacteria
that causes the highly infectious legionnaires' disease, an Executive Yuan
official in charge of consumers' rights said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Cheng-hsue noted that people suffering from legionnaires usually have fever,
chills, a cough and sometimes pneumonia. Some also display symptoms such as
muscle aches, headache, tiredness, loss of appetite or body coordination, and
occasionally diarrhea and vomiting.</P>
      <P>He said the inspection was conducted by National Kaohsiung Normal University and
local health bureau officials under instructions from the Consumer Protection
Commission under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The six hospitals found with the bacterium include southern Taiwan's Tainan
Municipal Hospital in Tainan City, Chia-yi Christian Hospital in Chiayi County,
Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung County and Yuan's General Hospital in
Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The other two are Mackay Memorial Hospital in Hsinchu City and the Cathay
General Hospital in Taipei City, both in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health will supervise the six hospitals to make sure they make
improvements to their water sanitation, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The government listed legionnaires' disease as a noticeable infectious one in
1999, and about 30-50 cases are reported every year, Wu said, adding that all
cases have been community infections, except two in 2005 who were infected in
hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Protection Commission has asked the six hospitals to examine their
pneumonia patients to find out whether their diseases are related to
legionnaires, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization and several U.S. states have made the bacterium an
inspection item for hospitals' water sanitation, but Taiwan has no such
regulations, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>In order to help hospitals better control their water sanitation, the
Environmental Protection Administration will establish standards and a mechanism
for issuing licenses to inspection organizations for reference by hospitals, Wu
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services set to be launched July
4 will cover five Chinese cities in the initial stage and six more cities in the
future, according to an agreement signed Friday between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The Chinese destinations that will be opened immediately are Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing, before expanding to Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou,
Dalian, Guilin and Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the services will include eight destinations: Taoyuan, Kaohsiung,
Taichung, Taipei, Penghu, Hualien, Kinmen and Taitung.</P>
      <P>The charter services will run from Friday to Monday every week, with each side
operating 18 round-trip flights per week, or a total of 36 round-trip flights.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese carriers cannot operate more than nine round-trip flights a week to
Shanghai, while Chinese carriers are not allowed to offer more than six round-
trips a week to Taichung.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the signing of the agreement, Chinese carriers can post staff
and set up preparatory offices in Taiwan. The preparatory offices can be
upgraded to branch offices within six months.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed that they will negotiate as soon as possible on the air
route and air traffic control procedures allowing the charter flights to fly
"direct routes."</P>
      <P>Before more direct air routes are agreed upon, the charter flights will be
required to make a detour through Hong Kong's air space before heading to their
destinations, adding hours to flights to and from central and northern China.</P>
      <P>The two sides concurred that within three months after the launch of the weekend
charter flights, they will begin negotiations on the operations of cross-strait
cargo charter flights.</P>
      <P>Also, the two sides will open negotiations as soon as possible on the operations
of cross-strait regularly scheduled nonstop flights.</P>
      <P>The agreement on the arrival of Chinese tourists to Taiwan calls for a first
group to arrive in Taiwan July 4 alongside the launch of the weekend charter
flights, but Chinese citizens will only be officially allowed to visit Taiwan
for pleasure from July 18.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourists must come and leave in groups and the daily ceiling on the
entry of Chinese tourists will be capped at 3,000 in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed that there should be 10 to 40 people in each tour group,
with a maximum stay of 10 days.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed to exchange tourism offices to provide rapid, convenient and
efficient services to travelers, and set up an emergency mediation mechanism to
deal with travel-related disputes and emergencies.</P>
      <P>Also, the two sides will establish a system to facilitate the reporting of cases
in which Chinese tourists overstay their visas and to help these tourists return
home.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA rebuts report of "blue terror"</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Friday denied a report that claimed it
has requested a full investigation into officials at the ministry who have
studied or taught at a pro-Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) private institute,
and rebutted an accusation that it was trying to carrying out a so-called "blue
terror."</P>
      <P>Blue is the color for Taiwan's current governing party, the Kuomintang (KMT) .
The new administration, headed by President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT, was
inaugurated on May 20, replacing the former DPP government.</P>
      <P>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh told CNA that the report in the Liberty
Times "seriously deviated from the facts, " as Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H.L. Ou never gave any instruction to obtain such information.</P>
      <P>"The MOFA is greatly dissatisfied with and regrets the false report as well as
the accusation of the so-called 'political intention' it claimed," she said.</P>
      <P>According to the Liberty Times report, the Ketagalan Institute -- founded by
former President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP in 2003 -- received a call from the
ministry's personnel department last Thursday, requesting the institute provide
a list of MOFA officials who attended or taught at the school, in order to
establish a database.</P>
      <P>The report added that the caller indicated that the information was requested by
the foreign minister, but in order to protect its students' privacy, the
Ketagalan Institute declined such a request.</P>
      <P>The Ketagalan Institute said it seemed the MOFA was creating "blue terror" by
conducting an internal investigation to put anyone related to the institute on a
black list, according to the report.</P>
      <P>However, the foreign ministry issued a statement Friday stressing that an
inquiry was made at the institute as part of the ministry's normal procedures to
keep track of which employees completed extended education courses.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said in the statement it called the Ketagalan Institute on May 29 to
inquire about whether a MOFA official recommended by the ministry in 2007 was
accepted by the institute and completed his course, as the institute did not
notify the ministry about it and the person is currently posted in South
America.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry stressed that in line with the ministry's avocation of
lifelong learning for its employees, every year it would select and recommend
officials to pursue further education and receive  training  in domestic  and
international  schools and organizations, including the Ketagalan Institute.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the ministry has established a database to keep a record of officials
attending such programs.</P>
      <P>"Foreign Minister Ou would only evaluate MOFA officials by their professionalism
and capability instead of judging them by their political-orientation," the MOFA
press release said.</P>

      <P>The agreements reached between Taiwan and China's negotiators in Beijing ensure
that the government's two main cross-strait goals will be carried out as
projected in July, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The implementation  of direct cross-Taiwan Strait passenger charter flights will
begin July 4, while the first tourists visiting Taiwan directly from China will
begin arriving July 18, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has been making the
necessary arrangements and preparations to handle the two measures, Lai added,
during a legislative question-and-answer session Friday.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the morning, Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), inked
historic accords on the two measures and on the opening of reciprocal offices.</P>
      <P>"This is a historic juncture in advancing cross-strait relations and we must
seize the opportunity," she said.</P>
      <P>Lai also thanked the Legislative Yuan for approving an amendment Thursday
allowing the conversion of Chinese yuan in Taiwan from July in conjunction with
the direct flights and tourism initiatives.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Lai told reporters later Friday that bilateral
negotiations would be required if ARATS President Chen were to visit Taiwan and
meet with President Ma Ying-jeou and Lai herself.</P>
      <P>"Of course we are looking forward to that happening through suitable
arrangements," she said.</P>
      <P>Chiang, heading a delegation composed of officials from the SEF, MOTC and MAC,
arrived in China Wednesday for the resumption of talks with the ARATS after a
nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>At their historic meeting Thursday, Chiang invited Chen to visit Taiwan within
this year and Chen promised to do so at a "proper time."</P>
      <P>SEF-ARATS negotiations were halted in 1999 after then President Lee Teng-hui
aired his "two states" theory to describe cross-strait relations. Taiwan split
from China in 1949 at the end of a Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies responsible for dealing with cross-strait
matters in the absence of government-to-government contacts.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's relations with China have improved significantly after Ma's
inauguration as president on May 20, which ended the eight-year rule of the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

children to make gelatins containing fruit on their own, that will encourage
participating children to enjoy foods they did not like before.</P>
      <P>Chen said mothers and a child between between 9-12 years old can register

      <P>Over 10,000 Filipino workers, their friends and other local residents from

      <P>Taiwan's China Airlines and Guangdong-based China Southern Airlines (CSA) are
set to sign a strategic cooperation agreement June 23 on offering cross Taiwan-
Strait charter flights on the weekends, the Chinese airline said Friday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman (SEF) Chiang

Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), signed an accord in Beijing earlier
the same day on launching weekend direct cross-strait charter flights from July
4.</P>

airline's president, Liu Zhaoyong, will himself pilot an A-330 passenger jet on
the carrier's first cross-strait flight.</P>

flights and is ready to launch services as soon as the schedules are worked out.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Blood Services Foundation is hoping that 15,000 people under 30 will
donate blood on a regular basis to help thalassemic patients.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said that it will begin a one-month blood donor
solicitation drive starting Saturday, World Blood Donation Day, to achieve the
goal.</P>
      <P>The officials said that thalassemic patients rely heavily on high-quality blood
to survive, and they are hoping that 15,000 young men and women will answer
their call to commit themselves to donate blood on a regular basis for more than
400 thalassemic patients.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-cheng, a 30-year-old thalassemic patient who has been receiving blood
transfusions since she was three months old, said of herself and fellow
patients, "we're modern-day Draculas."</P>
      <P>"I used to think that every child has to take Desferal injection before they go
to bed, " she said, referring to the medicine taken to remove the excess iron in
the blood accumulated through repeated blood transfusions.</P>
      <P>Although nowadays the Desferal injection has been replaced by oral tablets,
Chang said that she still needs a blood transfusion of 750 cc of blood every two
weeks.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials urged more young people to join the drive, saying that
regular blood donation benefits others as well as themselves.</P>
      <P>Thalassemia is an inherited form of anemia found chiefly among people of
Mediterranean descent. The patient must receive blood transfusions
intermittently.</P>

      <P>Two officials from Taiwan's Executive Yuan appeared at a news conference called
in Beijing Friday by the Taipei-based quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) in their capacity as advisers to a SEF delegation to China.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, a vice chairman of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, and Oliver F.L. Yu, deputy minister of the Ministry of Transportation

China after the two sides split in the wake of a civil war.</P>
      <P>The SEF organized the international news conference after it struck agreements

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China described the exchanging of liaison offices
between the two sides as a "task for the distant future" Friday, with detailed
talks to begin only after Taiwan's government gives the green light.</P>
      <P>Dispelling  opposition  concern that Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and it Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) "might have reached agreement on the office
swap, " SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said Friday that the idea was proposed by
ARATS President Chen Yunlin in talks on Thursday but that no deal had been
reached.</P>
      <P>"This is a complicated issue and the SEF should bring it back to Taipei for the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to decide, " Chiang said, referring to Taiwan's
top China-policy coordinating body.</P>
      <P>Having the SEF and the ARATS swap liaison offices will be feasible only after
the MAC reaches a consensus with other government agencies, works out concrete
plans, and authorizes the SEF to formally discuss the issue with the ARATS,
Chiang said, describing it as "a task for the distant future."</P>
      <P>Chiang was speaking at an international news conference held immediately after
the two sides signed agreements Friday paving the way for the July 4 launch of
weekend direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights and allowing Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan starting July 18.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lien said that beyond a swap
of offices at the highest SEF-ARATS level, liaison offices will be established
at "many levels" to facilitate specific cross-strait tasks.</P>
      <P>For example, Kao said, the opening of weekend charter flights involves the
establishment of liaison offices among airline carriers from across the strait
and the exchange of offices between Taiwan's Cross-Strait Tourism and Travel
Association and China's Cross-strait Tourism Exchange Association.</P>
      <P>"I appeal to outsiders not to overinterpret the issue, " Kao added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MAC Vice Chairman Fu Don-cheng, who was serving as an adviser to the
visiting 19-member SEF delegation, said the SEF and ARATS negotiators agreed to
engage in further talks on the issue "at an opportune time" in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Enterovirus claims 7th fatality in Taiwan this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Enterovirus has claimed another life in Taiwan, bringing to seven the total
number of fatalities from the viral infection so far this year, the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The latest victim was an 11-month-old boy in the southern county of Chiayi, who
was hospitalized June 6 after coming down with fever and reduced appetite,
according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw.</P>
      <P>Further displaying symptoms of drowsiness and repeated jerky limb movements the
next day, the boy was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU) June 10 but
died the same day, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou said the CDC has ruled out the possibility that the boy could have
contracted the virus from his two older cousins, aged six and four,
respectively, who lived together with him.</P>
      <P>It was likely that the virus was transmitted to the boy by adult family members,
who usually have no symptoms, Chou said.</P>
      <P>As of Friday afternoon, a total of 191 severe enteroviral infections have been
recorded around Taiwan, seven of which have proven fatal, Chou said.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, almost all serious enterovirus cases this year were caused
by envirovirus type 71 (EV71) -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- and all
those infected were aged under 5, with the exception of one 14-year-old resident
of Hsinchu City who was admitted to an ICU at one point because of acute limb
paralysis but was later transferred to a regular ward after his condition
improved.</P>
      <P>Fourty-three percent of children aged 5 and under in Taiwan are not immune to
EV71, and as many as 90 percent of those aged 4 and under lack any immunity to
EV71, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a serious EV71 outbreak this year,  a Cabinet-level epidemic
response command center was activated Tuesday, the same day the fifth
enterovirus-related fatality was confirmed.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the CDC issued a directive compelling kindergartens, daycare
centers and elementary schools to close classes for 10 days whenever two or more
enterovirus infections are reported in the same class within one week.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be
serious, especially in infants.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of EV71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Another EV71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 children infected, 15 of whom died.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Boat collision incident a test for president: DPP chairwoman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A collision between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels off the coast of the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands will test the consistency of President Ma Ying-jeou's stance
on Taiwan's claim of sovereignty over the islands, the head of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party said.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese  recreational  fishing boat sank Tuesday after colliding with a
Japanese patrol vessel off the islands claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>The incident turned into a diplomatic uproar after the foreign ministry was
accused of being soft on Japan.</P>
      <P>Hoping to avoid provoking a diplomatic skirmish, a foreign ministry official
reportedly asked Taiwan's Coast Guard to pull back one of its ships out of the
Tiaoyutais 12-mile territorial waters after a nearly one-hour face-off with a
Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the government's handling of the incident, DPP Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen said Thursday in an interview with CNA that the Kuomintang government
should explain its decisions in handling the matter to Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that as the former opposition party, the KMT government should have
better understood mainstream opinion than it showed judging from the approach it
took in handling the diplomatic dilemma.</P>
      <P>Ma has repeatedly asserted that the Tiaoyutais are part of the territory of the
Republic of China, and now his attitude in handling the matter and his
determination to insist on protecting the country's sovereignty is under strict
scrutiny, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>"Although we don't expect him to act 100 percent according to what he has said
in the past, there should at least be a certain level of consistency," Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>She said the biggest challenge facing political figures is to win votes through
presenting realistic policies rather than idealistic goals.</P>
      <P>"The KMT government should know the circumstances have changed a lot over the
past eight years when it was not in power, " Tsai said, noting that the first
100 days after the KMT took office May 20 would be the toughest and the most
perilous period.</P>
      <P>"Ma should work to be a good president first before trying to write a new page
in history," she said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the resumption of talks between the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange
Foundation  and its Chinese counterpart,  the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, currently underway in Beijing, Tsai said that bilateral
negotiations should proceed step by step and warned the government not rush into
an agreement with China just to turn a new page in cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Because the DPP had eight years of experience in governance and knows the
difficulties in advancing policies, DPP legislators have not lashed out at a
range of government policies they may disagree with, Tsai suggested.</P>
      <P>But she acknowledged that the lawmakers' voices have been "a little loud, " if
only to reflect the views of their supporters, she contended.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) asked the Kuomintang (KMT)
government Friday to provide a clear explanation of reports that the United
States has temporarily frozen defensive arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP international affairs department chief Lin Cheng-wei charged that according
to information obtained by the DPP, the KMT had privately contacted the United
States and said it hoped the United States would temporarily halt its arms sales
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Saying the KMT's request was in contradiction to President Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign promise that he would do his best to defend Taiwan, Lin said he
suspected the move was linked to negotiations currently being held in Beijing
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Lin asked Ma to offer a clear explanation of whether the resumption of present
cross-Taiwan Strait talks is connected to the reported plan of the United States
to suspend sales of defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Pegging military procurement to the resumption of cross-strait talks is against
Taiwan's interests, " he argued.</P>
      <P>DPP public relations department head Cheng Wen-tsang accused the KMT government
of putting cross-strait affairs at the top of its agenda at the expense of
foreign diplomacy and military purchases.</P>
      <P>According to U. S. media reports, senior U.S. officials are freezing about US$11
billion worth of weapons sales being processed by the Pentagon,  including F-16
jet fighters, possibly until President George W. Bush departs the White House in
January next year.</P>
      <P>The Washington  Post also reported Thursday  that Taiwan's government has asked
Washington not to send approval notification to Congress for Taiwan's military
weapons purchase requests in the coming weeks at a time when Taiwan is engaged
with China in talks over direct charter flights and tourism issues.</P>
      <P>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang also asked the United States

      <P>The Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau announced Friday that it has
seized 31 kilograms of smuggled heroin at Taichung Harbor, central Taiwan, from
a container which came from Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to investigators, the seizure is the largest quantity of smuggled
drugs they have confiscated this year, with an estimated street value of NT$100
million (US$3.28 million).</P>
      <P>Taichung customs officials said they had suspected that several heroin bricks
were hidden in two teak closets imported from Thailand, but did not take action
until the three suspects, Lin Chin-yi, 33; Shu Wei-chun, 30; and Kuo Hsiu-fang,
55, came to pick up the two pieces of furniture.</P>
      <P>The investigators detained the three suspects when they showed up at the harbor
and tried to dismantle the furniture to get the heroin.</P>
      <P>Kuo is a vagrant who has a record of drug smuggling in the past.</P>
      <P>The investigators found that the drug trafficking ring from central Taiwan,
which usually hires homeless people to transport heroin and uses pseudo
companies to declare their imported goods at the customs office, has succeeded
in smuggling drugs into Taiwan several times adopting the same method.</P>
      <P>The police are still investigating the whereabouts of two other suspects
surnamed Lin and Wu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the quantity of heroin can feed the drug addictions of three million
people, which would have caused a big impact on society, the custom officials
vowed to strengthen inspections to prevent smuggled drugs from entering Taiwan
to safeguard the health of the public.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical services will become a key element in Taiwan's foreign trade in the
future as the country looks to catch up with other Asian countries in service
exports, a representative of the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a workshop focusing on the globalization of Taiwan's medical services, BOFT
Deputy Director-General Eric Chiang said that service exports in Taiwan, the
world's 16th largest trading nation, has always lagged behind merchandise
exports.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan annually runs a large trade surplus in tangible goods, it runs a
trade deficit in the service sector, even though services account for 70 percent
of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The bureau believes that medical services could help curb that deficit and
invigorate the development of international trade, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's high quality medical services are comparatively cheaper than those in
Singapore,  one of the leading medical tourism destinations in Asia that
attracts 400,000 foreign patients a year, an indication of the local sector's
export potential.</P>
      <P>Although exports are traditionally thought of as products that cross borders,
service exports include all services provided to foreigners by Taiwanese
enterprises, even if the services are offered in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The main service sectors included in this export model are tourism and medical
services.</P>
      <P>The bureau expected that the growing popularity of Taiwan's medical services
would also stimulate medical equipment exports.</P>
      <P>"By promoting Taiwan's medical services, we also hope that it can boost the sale
of medical instruments, " Chiang said, adding that Taiwan enjoys a competitive
advantage in the fabrication of medical equipment.</P>
      <P>"In addition to high technology, medical services can be another component of
Taiwan's soft power, " said Li Wei-chiang, director general of the international
medical center of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, who attended the workshop.</P>
      <P>Because China is considered a strong potential market for Taiwan's medical
services, a group of medical professionals will visit hospitals and organize
conferences in late June in Shanghai, Quanzhou and Xiamen, in southeastern China
to promote the sector, according to the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA) , the workshop's organizer.</P>

      <P>Huang Kun-huei,  chairman  of the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union, said
Friday that Taiwan has lost its predominance in the cross-Taiwan Strait talks in
Beijing by failing to include the issue of direct charter cargo flights on the
agenda as the government had promised.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan and China officially sealed agreements Friday in
Beijing paving the way for the July 4 launch of weekend direct cross-Taiwan
Strait charter passenger flights and allowing more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan beginning July 18.</P>
      <P>The accords were signed on behalf of the two sides by Taiwan's quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, Chen Yunlin of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan guaranteed before the talks that the topic of direct
cargo charter flights would be included, but the issue was not on the agenda,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan's preparation for the talks were precipitous and negotiators
deviated from the agenda, showing the government's problematic authorization to
the delegation.</P>
      <P>Huang added that the delegation failed to reassert Taiwan's sovereignty and that
the agreements signed by both sides should be examined by the government.</P>
      <P>Huang said the 1993 agreements signed by the late SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu and
the late ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan were submitted to the MAC and the Executive
Yuan before being approved by the Legislative Yuan, to ensure its legitimacy.</P>

      <P>ITRI officials said that although their cells have an energy conversion rate of
six percent, lower than the optimal 10 percent rate achieved in the laboratory,
the efficiency is still good enough for commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>ITRI's prototypes of dye-sensitized  solar cells are being presented to the
public at the three-day Taiwan Nano 2008 exhibition in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The first dye-sensitized solar cell was developed in 1991 by two Swiss-based
scientists, Michael Graetzel and Brian O'Regan at the Ecole Polytechnique
Federale de Lausanne.</P>
      <P>The cells, sometimes nicknamed Graetzel cells, use titanium dioxide-laced dye
material to capture photons. The energy in the particles can then be converted
to electrical energy.</P>
      <P>Although dye-sensitized solar cells are far less efficient in capturing energy
than conventional silicon crystal solar cells, which have conversion rates of 30
percent or more, they still have market potential because of their inexpensive
production costs -- roughly 80 to 90 percent lower than the silicon crystal
version.</P>
      <P>Dye-sensitized solar cells have yet to be marketed commercially, but ITRI
researchers said gains have been made in the development process and two patents
related to the process have been obtained in Taiwan, giving the organization
confidence that the solar cell can be commercialized as soon as 2011.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA authorized 96 boats to mine deepwater coral</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
06/13/08  21:04:33
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While many countries are trying to save their precious coral reefs, Taiwan's
former government administration appears to have taken a step backwards, as it
has been revealed that the Council of Agriculture (COA) gave licenses to 96
coral-mining boats recently.</P>
      <P>The COA made the decision during a meeting in early April, before the new
government took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>According to a regulation enacted in 1989, Taiwan's government is not supposed
to issue licenses to new coral business operators -- such as companies that
pluck corals from the sea to sell them to tourists as souvenirs or to jewelry
makers for making jewelry.</P>
      <P>Only businesses that seek to renew expired licenses would be issued a new
license, according to the regulation.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the regulation over the years has reduced the number of
licensed coral-mining boats to three in Taiwan early this year.</P>
      <P>However, a study conducted by local governments in Taiwan showed that a total of
96 fishing boats illegally exploited red coral without authorization.</P>
      <P>Taking into consideration the business operators' need to make a living and to
better manage their coral mining activities, the COA back in April amended the
regulation to allow registered fishing boats with coral-mining equipment, which
are recognized as such by the end of 2007, to mine coral.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulation put into effect since May 24, the boats can exploit
corals in five sea areas, 12 nautical miles away from the shore, with a total
surface of 7,811 square kilometers permitted for coral mining. The annual
quantity of coral exploited per boat is limited to 120 kilos.</P>
      <P>The five sea areas are located near northeastern, southern and southwestern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Coral in deep water, which grows very slowly, at a rate of about 0.1 centimeter
per year, is often used to make jewelry.</P>
      <P>Coral miners use equipment that furrow the seabed and destroy the marine
environment.</P>
      <P>"The special tackle used to mine deep water corals may seriously damage the
seabed,  " Jan Rong-quen,  research fellow of the Biodiversity center of
Taiwan's top research institution, Academia Sinica, told a CNA reporter Friday.</P>
      <P>He is also the president of the Taiwan Coral Reefs Society.</P>
      <P>Hu Sing-hwa, the COA's deputy minister, said Thursday that the council cannot
undo what has been done, but can only control the situation to prevent severe
damage to coral reefs.</P>
      <P>He added that the Fishery Agency will monitor the boats' work, and will ask
experts in marine life to do research to see if the exploitation affects marine
resources.</P>
      <P>If the licensed boats are found getting out of line, their licence, valid for
one year, will be revoked, said Hsieh Da-wen, director of the Fishery Agency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, located in a subtropical zone, enjoys rich coral reef resources, mostly
near the shore of the Hengchuen Peninsula, in its northeastern coast, and near
its off-shore islands, such as Penghu, Green Island and Lanyu.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's colorful coral reefs suffer from different threats stemming from
human behavior. In addition to mining, they are threatened by global warming,
artificial fish reefs that press on coral reefs, and industrial pollution.</P>
      <P>Jan on Friday said data about deep water corals, living 100 meters underwater,
are hard to obtain.</P>
      <P>"We cannot know how many coral reefs still exist in deep water, " said Jan.</P>
      <P>This year has been designated as an international year of the reef by the Reef
Check Foundation, an international non-profit organization  dedicated to
protecting and rehabilitating  reefs worldwide.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that the Republic of China is more than
willing to share its development experience with Saint Lucia, hoping that both
countries strengthen mutual understanding through exchanges of students and
artists.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when meeting Saint Lucia Prime Minister Stephenson King and
his delegation at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>King arrived in Taipei June 12 on an eight-day visit, the first official
delegation from Saint Lucia to visit Taiwan since the two countries resumed
diplomatic ties in April last year.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Saint Lucia have maintained  solid relations, Ma
expressed hope that the two countries expand their cooperation based on the
current foundation.</P>
      <P>During the conversation, Ma told King that Taiwan has transformed itself from an
agricultural society to a highly industrialized country, and now it is the major
producer of cell phones, and desktop and notebook computers in the world.</P>
      <P>"Being a country with limited natural resources, Taiwan depends heavily on high-

Taiwan," Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>In addition to official ties, Ma said he hoped that both countries can
strengthen civil exchanges, especially in educational and cultural spheres,
suggesting that both sides strengthen exchange programs of students and artists.</P>
      <P>For his part, King expressed gratitude to the hospitality extended  to him by
President  Ma and Taiwan's  people,  and congratulated Ma for winning the
president election in March.</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan's economic achievements can serve as a model for Saint Lucia,

    <HEADLINE>FAT's flight-operating rights to be revoked temporarily</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), Taiwan's top aviation regulator,
will temporarily suspend the debt-ridden Far Eastern Air Transport (FAT) right
to fly on June 16 if it cannot secure an injection of capital by then, CAA
Director General Billy Chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Employees of the Taipei-based airline had urged authorities to delay the
deadline for the suspension of rights in a news conference earlier in the day at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang left the airline a glimmer of hope, however, saying the carrier could
still fly some of the newly opened routes between Taiwan and China so long as it
applies to resume operations, which have been suspended since May 13.</P>
      <P>FAT's right to operate domestic flights was revoked June 2 after it failed to
solve its financial problems by the deadline set by the CAA.</P>
      <P>The regulator warned then it would strip the carrier of its international flight
rights if the same problems remained unresolved by June 15.</P>
      <P>The CAA said FAT needed to pay its employees the two months in back wages it
owed, raise operating capital, and recover the fees it is owed for leasing out
its planes to Cambodia-based Angkor Airways.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuo-liang, chairman of FAT's labor union, submitted three petitions at the
legislature on behalf of the company's employees.</P>
      <P>The second petition asked relevant authorities to provide relief measures for
FAT employees, many of whom face financial difficulties because they have not
been paid by the airline since February.</P>
      <P>"We do not need the government to spend money to save us; we are able to save
ourselves, " said Teng Feng-min, a member of the union, but he hoped the
government would loan the airline money to pay the employees the wages they are
owed.</P>
      <P>Chen said they also petitioned the government to ensure FAT has a fair
opportunity to operate cross-strait routes when weekend charter flights between
China and Taiwan begin July 4.</P>
      <P>Chen said the union was not asking the government to save FAT with an injection
of funds but by clearing legal barriers that have blocked interested investors
from injecting capital into the ailing carrier.</P>
      <P>He asked the government to organize an inter-ministerial team to help save FAT
from the biggest crisis it has faced since it was founded in 1957.</P>
      <P>The airline reportedly had debts of more than NT$10 billion when it requested
bankruptcy protection in February, a request the Taipei District Court rejected
last month.</P>
      <P>It also earned the wrath of the CAA by failing to file a financial statement for
the final quarter of 2007 or any statements in 2008, which also led to the
suspension of the trading of its shares on Taiwan's over-the-counter market Feb.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that he was "very dissatisfied" with the way
a collision between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels in disputed waters northeast
of Taiwan was handled.</P>
      <P>"The person who gave an order to a coast guard vessel heading toward the
collision site near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands to turn back will be held
responsible," the premier said.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew members and 13 customers
aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutais Tuesday morning
after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, executive director of the Committee on Japanese Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , said Thursday that he asked a Taiwanese
coast guard vessel at the scene of the incident to stay put and refrain from
entering the Tiaoyutais' 12-nautical-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who tendered his resignation to take responsibility for his decision, said
he gave the instruction without knowing the Taiwanese vessel was already locked
in a face-off with a Japanese patrol boat some 7.8 nautical miles from the
Tiaoyutais, where it was trying to gather evidence related to the collision.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party asked why
the premier ordered the coast guard vessel to retreat to waters 12 nautical
miles away from the Tiaoyutais, which Lee said was "tantamount to giving up our
claim to sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais."</P>
      <P>Lee also questioned if Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou was aware
of the decision to ask the ship to turn back.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he was told by Coast Guard Administration Minister Wang
Jinn-wang that the Committee on Japanese Affairs has been in charge of handling
similar incidents over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has asked the MOFA "to study disbanding" the Committee on Japanese
Affairs, which was set up in 2005 as a task force.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said at the time that the committee was comprised of officials in
charge of Japanese affairs under the ministry and those from the Association of
East Asian Relations, Taiwan's quasi-official organization authorized to deal
with matters with Japan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, although Taiwan believes that the island group is historically,
geographically and judicially connected to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands
in Japan, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they
fall under the jurisdiction of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held the 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
persistent disputes, and both sides agreed to held the next round of talks in
March 2006, but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters, but collisions there are rare.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China and Saint Lucia signed a cooperation agreement Friday,
with both sides vowing to strengthen bilateral ties through a more
environmentally friendly partnership.</P>
      <P>The agreement was inked by Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou and
Saint Lucia Minister for Agriculture, Lands, Forestry and Fisheries Ezechiel
Joseph in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Joseph is accompanying Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Stephenson King on an eight-
day official visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Saint Lucia is an important ally of Taiwan in the East Caribbean
region, Ou said there have been frequent exchanges between  Taiwan  and Saint
Lucia in the economic,  cultural, agricultural, educational and scientific
spheres since the two countries resumed their diplomatic ties on April 30 last
year.</P>
      <P>"Saint Lucia has transformed itself into a modern country with high tourism
potential in the Caribbean region," Ou said.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, Taiwan assisted Saint Lucia in an eco-friendly way by sending a
delegation to the country last year to help develop its ecotourism.</P>
      <P>Through the assistance of the Taiwan Sustainable Ecology Society, a Taiwanese
delegation composed of bird experts and photographers went to Saint Lucia late
last year to collect information about the Caribbean country's rare bird species
for the publication of a bird watching guide for the country.</P>
      <P>King, who was also present at the signing ceremony, extended gratitude to Taiwan
for its assistance to Saint Lucia in various sectors and hailed the eco-friendly
way in which the two countries have strengthened ties.</P>
      <P>He said the agreement signed Friday will help Saint Lucia in the development in
aquaculture and ecotourism, which is expected to offset the impact of surging
oil prices on his country's economy.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan for bringing hope to all walks of people in Saint Lucia,  King
stressed that his country's  re-establishment  of diplomatic ties with Taiwan
last year was an important decision.</P>
      <P>Saint Lucia first established diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1984, but
switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1997.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC has become an indispensable member of the world community
in an era of globalization, Ou hoped that Saint Lucia can continue supporting
Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations and World Health Organization.</P>

      <P>The government and Taiwan Fertilizer Co. will help absorb a higher percentage of
the increase in fertilizer prices, the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced
Friday, hoping to quell lingering anger among farmers over the May 30 price
hike.</P>
      <P>COA chief Chen Wu-hsiung said his agency reached an agreement with state-
controlled Taiwan Fertilizer to absorb 85 percent of the increase in fertilizer
prices needed to reflect soaring international commodity prices -- up from the
70 percent originally announced.</P>
      <P>Following the May 30 price adjustment, a 40-kilogram bag of urea was priced at
NT$520-NT$530, up from the previous level of about NT$360-NT$370.</P>
      <P>The 15 percent reduction, which took effect Friday, will lower the price to
between NT$445-NT$455 per sack.</P>
      <P>Farmers  who have purchased  fertilizer  at local farmers' associations since
May 30 can apply for a refund of the 15 percent difference, the COA chief said.</P>
      <P>The latest price adjustment is expected to cost Taiwan Fertilizer NT$660 million
(US$21.7 million), according to Chen, and the company will likely suffer another
NT$562 million in losses by the end of the year to cover higher raw material
prices, setting the company back a total of NT$1.22 billion in the next seven
months.</P>
      <P>The COA will continue keeping a close watch on the distribution and stocks of
fertilizers across the country to stamp out hoarding, Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>The COA chief announced on May 28 that from May 30, wholesale prices of
fertilizer produced by Taiwan Fertilizer would be increased by an average of 42
percent to reflect soaring raw material prices.</P>
      <P>The government, he said, needed to increase urea prices to over NT$800 per 40
kg. bag to reflect costs, but it would absorb 70 percent of the total increase.</P>
      <P>The announcement led to widespread fertilizer hoarding, sparking discontent
among farmers in central and southern Taiwan despite Chen's assurances  that
there would be no fresh increases in fertilizer prices to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>A total of 247 illegal immigration cases using false or tampered passports have
been uncovered since the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of

      <P>"The figure embodies the achievements of border police squads under the NIA, "
said Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang at an international seminar on border
security, management and control.</P>
      <P>The NIA organized the one-day seminar to discuss the latest global trends in
border control to enhance the intensity and efficiency of Taiwan's border

      <P>It is part of the government's preparations for the imminent implementation of
direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait on weekends and the arrival of
more Chinese tourists, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that major countries around the world have strengthened border security
and control since the "911" terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001,
Chien said Taiwan has much to learn from advanced countries in reinforcing its
border management.</P>
      <P>The seminar, held in English at a convention hall at Taiwan Taoyuan

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Friday that the
announcement to lower the increase in fertilizer prices was not timed to
coincide with President Ma Ying-jeou's grassroots visit to southern Taiwan
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he had promised on May 30 to discuss the original price hikes
that angered farmers with state-controlled Taiwan Fertilizer Co. within two
weeks.</P>
      <P>"Since Friday was the dateline, I had to deliver on my promise." Chen said,
stressing that the announcement was not made to create a favorable atmosphere
for Ma's upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to visit Siluo in Yunlin County and Budai in Chiayi County
Sunday to call on some of the friends in the fishery and agricultural sectors he
made during his "long stay" program when he was on campaign trail prior to the
March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>This will be the president's first grassroots tour since he took office May 20,
despite some calls that he should have visited the towns earlier to show his
concern for flooding in the area following recent heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen and two of his deputies will accompany Ma on his visit.</P>
      <P>The COA had originally pledged to absorb 70 percent of the fertilizer price
hikes needed to bring local prices in line with the soaring costs of raw
materials, with farmers paying for the remaining 30 percent.</P>
      <P>But Chen announced Friday that Taiwan Fertilizer was now willing to absorb an
additional 15 percent of the increase, which, along with the rising costs of
inputs, will cost the company an estimated NT$1.22 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, farmers will pay an average of 22.3 percent more for
fertilizers than before the price hikes were announced in late May, down from
the original 42.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The COA announced May 28 that from May 30, prices of fertilizer produced by
Taiwan Fertilizer Co. would rise between 33 percent and 70 percent to reflect
rising raw material prices in the global market.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of farmers from central and southern Taiwan gathered outside the
Legislative Yuan to protest the hikes last Friday, warning that they will stage
a larger demonstration if the government fails to respond to their requests.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that the government tighten its crackdown on fertilizer
hoarding  and price manipulation  and increase the guaranteed price paid to

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan wants international space: SEF chief tells Chinese president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  13  (CNA)
06/14/08  01:02:40
(By Chiang Chin-yeh, Chang Ming-kun and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China expressed the country's desire for
international maneuvering space during a rare meeting with Chinese President Hu
Jintao Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taipei's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF), told Hu there should be plenty of room for the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to cooperate in the international arena to expand their influence in
global affairs.</P>
      <P>Now that peace and prosperity are common goals of both sides, Chiang  said
Taiwan  should have the opportunity  to actively participate in international
activities to advance those ultimate objectives.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has for years been suppressed by Beijing on the diplomatic front,  with
no representation in many important international organizations, such as the
United Nations and all its affiliated bodies, and no official ties with nearly
all major countries in the world.</P>
      <P>As a special envoy of Taiwan's government, Chiang seized the rare opportunity of
his meeting with Hu to convey the wish of Taiwan's people to have a dignified
profile in the international community.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same Chinese race,
Chiang said Taiwan looks forward to cooperating with the mainland in the
international arena to promote their common cause and create a win-win
situation.</P>
      <P>Television footage showed Chiang addressing Hu as "Mr. President" at the
beginning of their meeting, but a report by China's official Xinhua News Agency
issued at the end of the closed-door meeting said Hu met Chiang and other
Taiwanese delegates in his capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party
of China.</P>
      <P>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has been reluctant to recognize the
existence of the Republic of China, Taiwan's official title.</P>
      <P>The 30-minute  meeting  came after Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Chen
Yunlin of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
signed historic agreements earlier in the day on launching weekend charter
flights and expanding tourism, signals of further progress in ties between the
long-estranged rivals.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Hu hailed the signing of the agreements on the basis of
the so-called "1992 Consensus, " which allows both side to agree to disagree on
the meaning of "one China."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the agreements on weekend charter flights and expansion  of
tourism  mark a good start for improvement  of cross-strait relations, Hu said
they will contribute to the eventual opening of direct trade, transportation and
postal links and progress in mutual cooperation.</P>
      <P>"The deals reached after a nine-year hiatus in bilateral contact also proved
that both sides are wise and capable enough to resolve their longstanding
disputes," he added.</P>
      <P>Hu also came up with four suggestions for future bilateral talks, including
negotiations on an equal footing, mutual respect and goodwill communications,
forging consensus and eliminating disputes, jointly seeking solution to issues
that can be resolved with pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Before delivering his brief public opening speech, Hu shook hands all members of
the SEF delegation, including two senior Taiwanese officials -- Mainland Affairs
Council Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng and Deputy Minister of Transportation and
Communications Oliver F. L. Yu.</P>
      <P>Fu and Yu were the only two Taiwanese political appointees who have ever met
with the paramount Chinese leader since the two sides split in 1949 following a
bitter Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegation,  headed by Chiang, arrived in Beijing Wednesday for a
resumption of institutionalized cross-strait dialogue that had been stalled
since 1999 when then ROC President Lee Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a
special state-to-state relationship. The description angered Beijing which
viewed it as amove to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Relations remained frozen during the ensuing years which saw the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party take the helm of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>Icy relations  gradually  thawed  after Taiwan's  March 22 presidential election
in which Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, which adopts a more China-friendly
approach, won a landslide over his DPP rival.</P>
      <P>The expansion of charter flights was a key topic for the talks that began
Thursday. Those flights are now limited to four annual traditional Chinese
festivals and are usually packed with Taiwanese residents on the mainland
returning home to visit family.</P>
      <P>The launch of weekend charter flights from July 4 and expansion of tourism mark
a huge step forward in establishing contacts and mutual trust, Chiang said after
signed the pacts at a state guesthouse in western Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiang also told reporters at a news conference held following the
signing of the accords that there is still a long way to go for normalization of
cross-strait economic and trade exchange.</P>
      <P>"There are still many issues to be discussed including expanding weekend charter
flights into regular charter flights," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has banned direct scheduled flights ever since it split from China in
1949.</P>
      <P>The new transport pact will allow for 36 charter flights to cross the Taiwan
Strait running from Friday to Monday beginning on July 4. Flights  will be
shared equally between Chinese and Taiwanese airlines, servicing routes between
the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing and
Taiwan's capital, Taipei, and seven other cities on the island. Flights would be
open to anyone carrying valid documents, a change from the past when they were
limited to just Taiwanese and Chinese.</P>
      <P>A separate tourism agreement permits up to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan each day for stays of up to 10 days. According to the pact, up to 1
million Chinese tourists will be allowed to enter Taiwan for pleasure trips
annually, well above the current level of about 80,000.</P>
      <P>The pacts were the first to be signed on Chinese soil. The previous SEF-ARATS
agreements that set the tone for systematic engagements in the 1990s were signed
in Singapore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier dissatisfied with handling of fishing boat collision</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
06/14/08  11:30:21
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that he was "very dissatisfied" with the way
a collision between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels in disputed waters northeast
of Taiwan was handled.</P>
      <P>"The person who gave an order to a coast guard vessel heading toward the
collision site near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands to turn back will be held
responsible," the premier said.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew members and 13 customers
aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutais Tuesday morning
after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, executive director of the Committee on Japanese Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) , said Thursday that he asked a Taiwanese
coast guard vessel at the scene of the incident to stay put and refrain from
entering the Tiaoyutais' 12-nautical-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who tendered his resignation to take responsibility for his decision, said
he gave the instruction without knowing the Taiwanese vessel was already locked
in a face-off with a Japanese patrol boat some 7.8 nautical miles from the
Tiaoyutais, where it was trying to gather evidence related to the collision.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party asked why
the premier ordered the coast guard vessel to retreat to waters 12 nautical
miles away from the Tiaoyutais, which Lee said was "tantamount to giving up our
claim to sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais."</P>
      <P>Lee also questioned if Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou was aware
of the decision to ask the ship to turn back.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he was told by Coast Guard Administration Minister Wang
Jinn-wang that the Committee on Japanese Affairs has been in charge of handling
similar incidents over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has asked the MOFA "to study disbanding" the Committee on Japanese
Affairs, which was set up in 2005 as a task force.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said at the time that the committee was comprised of officials in
charge of Japanese affairs under the ministry and those from the Association of
East Asian Relations, Taiwan's quasi-official organization authorized to deal
with matters with Japan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, although Taiwan believes that the island group is historically,
geographically and judicially connected to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands
in Japan, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they
fall under the jurisdiction of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held the 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
persistent disputes, and both sides agreed to held the next round of talks in
March 2006, but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters, but collisions there are rare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan inks cooperation agreement with Saint Lucia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Saint Lucia signed a cooperation agreement Friday,
with both sides vowing to strengthen bilateral ties through a more
environmentally friendly partnership.</P>
      <P>The agreement was inked by Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou and
Saint Lucia Minister for Agriculture, Lands, Forestry and Fisheries Ezechiel
Joseph in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Joseph is accompanying Saint Lucia's Prime Minister Stephenson King on an eight-
day official visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Saint Lucia is an important ally of Taiwan in the East Caribbean
region, Ou said there have been frequent exchanges between  Taiwan  and Saint
Lucia in the economic,  cultural, agricultural, educational and scientific
spheres since the two countries resumed their diplomatic ties on April 30 last
year.</P>
      <P>"Saint Lucia has transformed itself into a modern country with high tourism
potential in the Caribbean region," Ou said.</P>
      <P>According to Ou, Taiwan assisted Saint Lucia in an eco-friendly way by sending a
delegation to the country last year to help develop its ecotourism.</P>
      <P>Through the assistance of the Taiwan Sustainable Ecology Society, a Taiwanese
delegation composed of bird experts and photographers went to Saint Lucia late
last year to collect information about the Caribbean country's rare bird species
for the publication of a bird watching guide for the country.</P>
      <P>King, who was also present at the signing ceremony, extended gratitude to Taiwan
for its assistance to Saint Lucia in various sectors and hailed the eco-friendly
way in which the two countries have strengthened ties.</P>
      <P>He said the agreement signed Friday will help Saint Lucia in the development in
aquaculture and ecotourism, which is expected to offset the impact of surging
oil prices on his country's economy.</P>
      <P>Hailing Taiwan for bringing hope to all walks of people in Saint Lucia,  King
stressed that his country's  re-establishment  of diplomatic ties with Taiwan
last year was an important decision.</P>
      <P>Saint Lucia first established diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1984, but
switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1997.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC has become an indispensable member of the world community
in an era of globalization, Ou hoped that Saint Lucia can continue supporting
Taiwan's bid to participate in the United Nations and World Health Organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't helps absorb more fertilizer price hikes for farmers: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)
06/14/08  11:34:33
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government and Taiwan Fertilizer Co. will help absorb a higher percentage of
the increase in fertilizer prices, the Council of Agriculture (COA) announced
Friday, hoping to quell lingering anger among farmers over the May 30 price
hike.</P>
      <P>COA chief Chen Wu-hsiung said his agency reached an agreement with state-
controlled Taiwan Fertilizer to absorb 85 percent of the increase in fertilizer
prices needed to reflect soaring international commodity prices -- up from the
70 percent originally announced.</P>
      <P>Following the May 30 price adjustment, a 40-kilogram bag of urea was priced at
NT$520-NT$530, up from the previous level of about NT$360-NT$370.</P>
      <P>The 15 percent reduction, which took effect Friday, will lower the price to
between NT$445-NT$455 per sack.</P>
      <P>Farmers  who have purchased  fertilizer  at local farmers' associations since
May 30 can apply for a refund of the 15 percent difference, the COA chief said.</P>
      <P>The latest price adjustment is expected to cost Taiwan Fertilizer NT$660 million
(US$21.7 million), according to Chen, and the company will likely suffer another
NT$562 million in losses by the end of the year to cover higher raw material
prices, setting the company back a total of NT$1.22 billion in the next seven
months.</P>
      <P>The COA will continue keeping a close watch on the distribution and stocks of
fertilizers across the country to stamp out hoarding, Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>The COA chief announced on May 28 that from May 30, wholesale prices of
fertilizer produced by Taiwan Fertilizer would be increased by an average of 42
percent to reflect soaring raw material prices.</P>
      <P>The government, he said, needed to increase urea prices to over NT$800 per 40
kg. bag to reflect costs, but it would absorb 70 percent of the total increase.</P>
      <P>The announcement led to widespread fertilizer hoarding, sparking discontent
among farmers in central and southern Taiwan despite Chen's assurances  that
there would be no fresh increases in fertilizer prices to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>A total of 247 illegal immigration cases using false or tampered passports have
been uncovered since the National Immigration Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of
the Interior was inaugurated Jan. 2, 2007, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The figure embodies the achievements of border police squads under the NIA, "
said Vice Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang at an international seminar on border
security, management and control.</P>
      <P>The NIA organized the one-day seminar to discuss the latest global trends in
border control to enhance the intensity and efficiency of Taiwan's border
management, Chien said.</P>
      <P>It is part of the government's preparations for the imminent implementation of
direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait on weekends and the arrival of
more Chinese tourists, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that major countries around the world have strengthened border security
and control since the "911" terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001,
Chien said Taiwan has much to learn from advanced countries in reinforcing its
border management.</P>
      <P>The seminar, held in English at a convention hall at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport south of Taipei, brought together foreign diplomats
stationed in Taipei as well as local academics and foreign border management
officials and experts to talk over a range of topics.</P>
      <P>Amercian, Canadian and Australian officials posted in Taipei introduced the
latest border management measures adopted by their respective countries to form
shapeless border security mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Some experts introduced reliable automated customs inspection systems, anti-
forgery printing technologies, and the issuance of digital passports.</P>
      <P>Representatives  from Taiwan  spoke on new modes of human trafficking and the
operations of passport counterfeiting rings for the reference of foreign
participants.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said Friday that the
announcement to lower the increase in fertilizer prices was not timed to
coincide with President Ma Ying-jeou's grassroots visit to southern Taiwan
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that he had promised on May 30 to discuss the original price hikes
that angered farmers with state-controlled Taiwan Fertilizer Co. within two
weeks.</P>
      <P>"Since Friday was the dateline, I had to deliver on my promise." Chen said,
stressing that the announcement was not made to create a favorable atmosphere
for Ma's upcoming visit.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to visit Siluo in Yunlin County and Budai in Chiayi County
Sunday to call on some of the friends in the fishery and agricultural sectors he
made during his "long stay" program when he was on campaign trail prior to the
March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>This will be the president's first grassroots tour since he took office May 20,
despite some calls that he should have visited the towns earlier to show his
concern for flooding in the area following recent heavy downpours.</P>
      <P>Minister Chen and two of his deputies will accompany Ma on his visit.</P>
      <P>The COA had originally pledged to absorb 70 percent of the fertilizer price
hikes needed to bring local prices in line with the soaring costs of raw
materials, with farmers paying for the remaining 30 percent.</P>
      <P>But Chen announced Friday that Taiwan Fertilizer was now willing to absorb an
additional 15 percent of the increase, which, along with the rising costs of
inputs, will cost the company an estimated NT$1.22 billion this year.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, farmers will pay an average of 22.3 percent more for
fertilizers than before the price hikes were announced in late May, down from
the original 42.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The COA announced May 28 that from May 30, prices of fertilizer produced by
Taiwan Fertilizer Co. would rise between 33 percent and 70 percent to reflect
rising raw material prices in the global market.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of farmers from central and southern Taiwan gathered outside the
Legislative Yuan to protest the hikes last Friday, warning that they will stage
a larger demonstration if the government fails to respond to their requests.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that the government tighten its crackdown on fertilizer
hoarding  and price manipulation  and increase the guaranteed price paid to
local farmers for their crops.</P>

boarded a flight at the Beijing airport at 10: 05 a.m. Saturday to head home,
after completing a historic mission of reopening cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, head of the delegation, was given a warm send-off
by his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , at the hotel where Chiang had been

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union said Friday it welcomes the resumption of dialogue between
Taiwan and China, which it called "a significant step towards closer relations
and the establishment of trust between both sides."</P>
      <P>The message was issued in a statement by the EU Council presidency, currently
held by Slovenia, referring to the talks held June 12 in Beijing between the
chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Chiang Pin-kung,
and his counterpart, Chen Yunlin in the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Also, the EU said the arrangement agreed upon by the SEF and ARATS on weekend
cross-strait charter flights and the expanded admission  of  Chinese  tourists
to Taiwan  "will  contribute significantly to the strengthening of friendly ties
between the people of mainland China and Taiwan, and to the development of
economic, cultural and social ties."</P>
      <P>"The presidency hopes that these steps will encourage all concerned to pursue a
vision for long-term peaceful political and economic development of the region,"
the statement read.</P>
      <P>According to agreements signed between the SEF and ARATS Friday, the weekend
cross-strait charter flight services will be launched July 4 and Chinese
citizens will officially be allowed to visit Taiwan for pleasure from July 18.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing in the wake of the
Kuomintang  administration's  May 20 inauguration.  The Chiang-Chen dialogue
marked the first of its kind in nine years.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between the SEF and ARATS -- the two semi-official intermediary bodies
set up by the two sides respectively to handle cross-strait affairs in the
absence of official ties -- ground to a halt in 1999 when then-Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a special state-to-state
relationship. Beijing continued  to refuse dialogue  with Taiwan during the
eight-year administration of former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The icy relations began to warm up after the March 22 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou, who has proposed that the two sides resume dialogue on the basis of

      <P>In order to help Taiwan companies better understand  the economic  and trade
environment  abroad,  the non-governmental  Chinese  International  Economic
Cooperation Association (CIECA) will organize a delegation to attend two
commerce meetings in the United Kingdom and Spain next week, according to a
CIECA press release Saturday.</P>
      <P>From June 14-22, the 50-member business delegation led by Chairman of the Taiwan
Cement Group Leslie Koo, will take part in the 10th Joint Meeting of the Taiwan
Britain Business Council (TBBC) in Edinburgh, Scotland and the 17th Assembly
Meeting of the Taiwan-Spain Economic Commerce Cooperation Committee in Spain,
the press release stated.</P>
      <P>"The 10th Joint Meeting of the TBBC -- the most important platform for bilateral
economic and trade affairs between Taiwan and the UK -- will further improve
mutual exchanges and serve as an great opportunity for both sides to seek
business cooperation, " the CIECA added.</P>
      <P>During the meeting in Edinburgh, representatives from Taiwan and the UK will
discuss a number of important topics,  including information and communication,
infrastructure and renewable energy, and  financial  and professional  services,
in an effort  to substantially strengthen bilateral cooperation and achieve the
goal of mutual benefit, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>Koo, who has been named by Britain's Queen Elizabeth as an Officer of the Order
of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his work to promote bilateral
trade and investment between the U.K. and Taiwan, will be given the medal by
Michael Reilly, director of the British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO), at a
banquet at Edinburgh Castle hosted by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh June 16.</P>
      <P>The co-chair of the TBBC said he was totally overwhelmed by the OBE decoration.</P>
      <P>I'm truly honored and flattered to be awarded an OBE, said Koo. "I always try to
serve my role as a responsible Taiwanese investor in the UK, a business advocate
to promote Taiwanese investment in the UK, and a facilitator for better
understanding and cooperation between the business communities of Taiwan and
Britain."</P>
      <P>The BTCO said that under Koo's leadership, the TBBC has gone from strength  to
strength,  bringing  together  senior  business representatives  from Taiwan and
the UK,  identifying business opportunities  in both markets and working
together  in third countries.</P>
      <P>"Leslie's  award is tremendous  news.  It is well-deserved recognition not only
for the superb job he has done and continues to do for TBBC, but also for the
contribution TBBC makes to UK-Taiwan business cooperation and for the direct and
significant contribution he has made to the UK over the years," said Reilly.</P>
      <P>The TBBC was established in 1999 with the aim of promoting bilateral trade and
investment ties between the UK and Taiwan by encouraging closer links between
the two markets, by disseminating relevant market information and by cooperating
to remove impediments to market access.</P>
      <P>Supervised by the U.K Trade and Investment Bureau and Taiwan's Bureau of Foreign
Trade, the council meets once a year, alternatively in the UK and Taiwan, to
bring together business representatives from both sides.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that it will
meet Monday to get a briefing on the agreements reached Friday in Beijing on
launching weekend cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights and opening Taiwan to
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Under the accords signed by Taipei-based  Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF)
Chairman  Chiang  Pin-kung  and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin of the
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), weekend direct cross-
strait flights will begin July 4, while Chinese tourists will be allowed to
visit Taiwan from July 18.</P>
      <P>Acting KMT legislative caucus whip Chang Suo-wen said Saturday that the party
will invite Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan and SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Pang Chien-kuo to attend Monday's conference.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is scheduled to meet with Chiang
for a briefing on the details of the negotiations and agreements reached in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although many people have questions about whether the SEF might
have  overstepped  its powers  in the Beijing negotiations, the fact was that
the SEF acted within its authority during the talks.</P>
      <P>He noted that on any issues raised by the other side beyond the scope of the
negotiations, the SEF only listened and recorded the opinions expressed so that
they could be brought back to Taiwan for discussion.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that he is pleased to see the beginning of
a civil society taking shape in China, as 1.3 billion Chinese people became
involved in the disaster relief efforts after the Sichuan earthquake on May 12.</P>
      <P>"The emergence of a civil society is the prelude to a democratic society, " Ma
said at the launch of a book, entitled "My Hopemap, " which resulted from an
online campaign for Taiwan's new government to hear the hopes of the people.</P>
      <P>Ma said that compared to 1976 when the Chinese government completely shut off
foreign aid and any help from Taiwan in the wake of the Tangshan earthquake, the
Chinese authorities' handling of the 8.0-magnitude  Sichuan  earthquake  was
much quicker  and more transparent, and everyone in China was willing and eager
to help others.</P>
      <P>"This is the beginning of a civil society," Ma said. "Although it is nascent and
there is a long way to go, at least we have seen a first step being taken."</P>
      <P>At the news conference, the president -- who took office May 20 -- said the
"Hopemap" campaign is not only meaningful, but also serves as a great guide for
the government.</P>
      <P>"The campaign perfectly demonstrates the maturity of Taiwan's civil society and
truly reflects the heartfelt hopes of each and every citizen," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Describing these hopes as "raw material," he pledged to take them seriously and
integrate them with the government's policies, in order to realize the dream of
making Taiwan a better place.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the news conference, Rex How, the initiator of the hope campaign and
CEO of Locus Publishing Company that released the My Hopemap book, said it was
not only a successful Internet campaign but also a demonstration of civil
awareness. More than 18,000 hopes have been gathered through the online
campaign.</P>
      <P>"This is a new mechanism for dialogue between citizens and the government, " How
said. "It is the authentic voice of the people and the grassroots power of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Renowned Taiwanese author Chang Man-chuan said the campaign serves as a wake up
call for those who have forgotten how to hope and dream.</P>
      <P>"I hope that together we can make Taiwan a nation of hope and compassion," she
said.</P>
      <P>The Hopemap campaign was launched  in February before the presidential election
by a group of publishers, writers, scholars and artists to encourage people in
Taiwan to relay their hopes, opinions and suggestions to the presidential
candidates and the future president.</P>
      <P>How said that he wanted to raise the consciousness of his fellow citizens
through the online Hopemap, which is composed of digital dots of light. With the
number of participants increasing, the size and shape of the map will change, he
said.</P>
      <P>After handing over to Ma the compilation of the responses received so far as a
reference for the new Kuomintang administration, How said the government will
respond no later than Aug. 20 with policies related to the suggestions.</P>
      <P>He urged the public to log on to the Web site http: //hopemap.net to grade the
government each time it responds to the hopes expressed online, and to continue
to supervise and monitor the government by giving it a score on the Web site
each year.</P>
      <P>"This is an attempt to build a new platform for citizens to oversee and
communicate with the government they elected," How said.</P>

      <P>Business start-up loans totaling NT$2 billion (US$65.68 million) are available
for youth entrepreneurs this year, an offer that is expected to help 2,000
youths start their own businesses and create approximately 7,000 jobs, Council
of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The sum was jointly provided  by domestic  banks and the government's Sino-
American Fund for Economic and Social Development, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, the fund has provided a total of NT$7.33 billion,
including NT$1 billion this year, as start-up loans for youth entrepreneurs, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Loans totalling NT$27 billion have been granted to 30,401 young business
starters during the period, creating a total of 146,769 jobs.</P>
      <P>During the first four months of this year alone, 258 people obtained loans worth
a total of NT$199.81 million, with 937 jobs created.</P>
      <P>To encourage youth entrepreneurship, the CEPD and the National Youth Commission
on May 1 lowered the interest rate for the start-up loans, and extended the
repayment period of non-secured loans to six years and that of secured loans to
10 years.</P>
      <P>The loans are open to any persons aged 20-45 who have job experience or have
received training provided by accredited agencies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics urged the government in a forum Saturday to act firmly but
rationally in dealing with the diplomatic spat triggered by Tuesday's collision
between a Taiwan recreational fishing vessel and a Japanese patrol boat in
waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>The private think tank, Taiwan Competitiveness Forum, hosted the discussion at
the Postal Museum in Taipei City on the topic of the Tiaoyutai Islands, which
Taiwan, Japan and China all claim as their own, although Tokyo exerts control
over the island chain and claims sovereignty over the territorial waters.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan fishing vessel sank in Tuesday's collision within the 12-km exclusion
zone surrounding the islands. Both sides blamed the other for the collision.
Japanese authorities detained the crew members and captain of the vessel for
several days after the incident. Two crew menbers were released Thursday but the
skipper was not freed until Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Saturday's forum, the scholars agreed that Taiwan should take a
rational approach to handling the incident by demanding an apology as well as
compensation for the fisherman but avoiding any inflammatory remarks.</P>
      <P>Kao Chung-yun, former director of the National Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall,
said that the government should avoid emotional language in negotiations on the
matter, suggesting that lawmakers and scholars form a special task force to
assist the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure that talks with Japan are held
in a rational manner.</P>
      <P>Chen Peng-jen, head of Chinese Culture University's Graduate Institute of
Japanese Language, said the government must be prudent in the language it uses
and avoid taking a hard-line approach, adding that rash comments about war will
not help to resolve the diplomatic dispute.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peng Chin-peng, an assistant professor in National Taiwan
University's political science department, said that as Japan is a democratic
country, it is surprising that it would engage in such "unhumanitarian"  actions
as those that led to Tuesday's collision.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan must continue to stress its sovereign claim over the Tiaoyutai
Islands, send patrol vessels to protect Taiwan vessels operating near the
islands, and propose international arbitration to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Huang Tung-hsiung, former president of National Chung Hsing University, said
that mention of war serves no purpose as Taiwan does not measure up to Japan
militarily. Economic sanctions would also be impractical as Japan's economy is
much stronger than Taiwan's, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the Council of Agriculture set up a team of lawyers to
assist the fishermen in taking their case to the international court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Boat captain claims Japan treated him unfairly</HEADLINE>

06/14/08  18:53:11
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The captain of a recreational fishing boat that sank off a disputed island chain
accused Japanese authorities Saturday of treating him "unfairly" during an
interrogation over his vessel's collision with a Japanese coast guard ship
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ho Hung-yi, a resident of Taipei County, made the remarks at a press conference
held at the legislature along with two crewmen, Yang Kun-feng and Chien Yien-
hao, and Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Ho said Japan had no right to detain him. He claimed that he was "guided" to
answer questions that would only produce testimony in favor of the Japanese
side, regarding the collision. Ho's boat sank some six nautical miles off the
uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands after the collision with the Japanese coast guard
vessel.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China and Japan all claim sovereignty over the islands -- called
Senkakus in Japan. The surrounding waters have been Taiwan's traditional fishing
grounds, but the island chain has been under Japan's control since 1972.</P>
      <P>Ho claimed his statements to the Japan authorities were not accurately recorded
and that "when I said something true, they showed me an ugly face."</P>
      <P>Yang said that during the interrogation, their responses were all written in
Japanese, a language none of them speak.</P>
      <P>They were also denied the right to legal counsel and to have their statements
translated, he said.</P>
      <P>"They did not write down any statements that were favorable to us, only what was
favorable to them. They then asked us to endorse those records," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang reiterated that the Japanese patrol boat deliberately rammed the
recreational fishing boat, which had 13 amateur anglers on board.</P>
      <P>Ho also maintained that the fishing vessel did not make an abrupt turn, as the
Japanese coast guard claimed when it accused the Taiwanese vessel of causing the
incident.</P>
      <P>The Japanese patrol ship "rammed us from behind, " Ho said. "We were harmlessly
passing through the (Tiaoyutai) waters, going at a speed of 12 nautical miles
per hour."</P>
      <P>"How could we have been in their way when they were behind us? " he asked,
adding that the ramming was an "arbitrary" act by the Japanese vessel. Ho
expressed the hope that the Taiwan government would help him claim compensation
for the loss of his boat, which he said was his only means of making a living.</P>
      <P>Ho was released Friday after having been detained on the Japan-controlled island
of Ishigaki for three days. The passengers and crew of the fishing boat were
rescued by the Japanese coast guard after the fishing vessel sank. Yang and
Chien were sent home Thursday, one day after the 13 Taiwanese anglers returned
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had threatened to recall its representative to Japan if Ho was not
released.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said Saturday he will ask
marine law experts to assist Ho in his bid to obtain compensation and an apology
from Japan.</P>
      <P>Chou said he will also meet with representatives of five major fishermen's
unions in Taipei County, northern Taiwan, to discuss their members' claims of
often being treated unfairly by the Japanese government while operating in the
disputed marine zone.</P>
      <P>Chou suggested the central government handle the latest issue in a firm manner
to protect the rights and interests of local fishermen and operators of
recreational fishing boats. He said that the county government will fully
support such an approach.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is the largest administrative district in Taiwan with a population
of more than 3.8 million people.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will
invite Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung to report on his
just-concluded talks with his counterpart in China, DPP Legislator Lai Ching-te

      <P>Lai said that he hopes Chiang, who concluded his historic mission to Beijing and
returned to Taiwan Saturday, will meet with the DPP legislative caucus over
breakfast Monday at the earliest.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's four-day visit to China, he signed accords with his counterpart,
Chen Yunlin, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan

      <P>Lai said that Chiang should explain why the issue of cross-strait cargo
charters, which the DPP believes is more important and beneficial to Taiwan, was

DPP administration, but the two sides did not ink a pact because of the
unfavorable political atmosphere created by China's mistrust of the pro-
independence DPP administration. Also, the more complex negotiations on cargo
charters had not been completed, he added.</P>
      <P>"It was the DPP that sweated, but it was the KMT that harvested," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He also upbraided Chiang for "exceeding the bounds of his authority" by touching
on the issue of the SEF and ARATS setting up reciprocal representative offices.</P>
      <P>Chiang  should also explain  why the discussions  included revisions of cross-
strait flight routes and cooperation on tapping oil resources, Tsai said, adding
that talks on these subjects had not been commissioned by the Mainland Affairs
Council, Taiwan's top China policy coordinating agency.</P>
      <P>Exchanges between the SEF and the ARATS ground to a halt in 1999 after then-
President Lee Teng-hui described Taipei-Beijing relations as a "special state-
to-state" ties.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations remained chilly during the ensuing eight years when the
DPP was in power, and began to warm up again only after President Ma Ying-jeou
assumed office May 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF head returns to Taiwan after signing accords with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said on his
return to Taiwan Saturday afternoon that the two agreements signed during his
just-concluded Beijing visit were the first pacts inked in 15 years between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>"The two agreements will benefit Taiwan by contributing to its economic
development and enhancing the exchanges between the people on both sides, " said
Chiang at a press conference held at the airport upon the arrival of his
delegation at 4: 05 p.m.</P>
      <P>He was met at the airport by Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , and Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's four-day visit to Beijing, he signed two cross-strait
cooperation agreements with his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, head of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), for the launch of
weekend cross-strait charter flights and the admission of more Chinese tourists
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the first agreement, Chinese carriers will be allowed to set up site
offices in cities from which they will operate weekend charter flights. They
will be allowed to upgrade their operations to branch offices after six months.</P>
      <P>The second agreement specifies that Chinese tourists will be allowed to enter
and leave Taiwan in groups for a maximum stay of 10 days, with a daily ceiling
of 3,000 visitors, in the initial stage. The number will be adjusted in the
second year, depending on market demand.</P>
      <P>The two SEF-ARATS pacts were the first to be signed since 1993, when then SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan met in Singapore. Koo passed
away in January 2005 and Wang died in December that year.</P>
      <P>Lai congratulated Chiang on the successful completion of his mission, which she
said had opened new avenues for future positive interactions of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. She encouraged officials of the SEF and MAC to continue to
strive for the stable development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he had only been in office for 19 days, and he accredited the
historical breakthrough to those who had paved the way.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Direct flights to have limited impact on Taiwan's GDP: research</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
06/14/08  21:31:51
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming launch of direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights will save
Taiwan's industrial and commercial interests US$900 million-US$1.8 billion in
transport cost a year, which would have minimal impact on Taiwan's  overall
economy, according to an assessment released Saturday by a local economic
research institute.</P>
      <P>The figures represent a tiny share of 0.21 percent-0.42 percent of Taiwan's 2007
gross domestic product (GDP) , according to the report by the Taipei-based
Polaris Research Institute, a privately operated economic research and
consultancy group group.</P>
      <P>Citing an evaluation by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, Polaris
economists estimated that the cost of cross-strait air transportation will drop
by 40 percent thanks to the direct charter flights, and that certain
enterprises, such as traders and manufacturing of high-tech products, will
benefit from the service to begin July 4.</P>
      <P>However, in the short term, the new service is expected to produce limited
benefits within the context of Taiwan's overall economic performance because
transportation costs account for a low share of the price of goods, Polaris
said.</P>
      <P>As to the long-term impact, Polaris said the weekend flights will definitely
help boost Taiwan's economic growth because they will cut down on the travel
time between the two sides, save transportation costs, and increase the
opportunities for the two sides to forge further cooperation ties.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan and China officially sealed agreements Friday in
Beijing to launch direct cross-strait charter flights, a development that
Taiwanese businessmen operating in China have long sought.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Captain insists Japan apologize, compensate him for his losses</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The captain of a recreational fishing boat that sank recently off a disputed
island chain insisted Saturday that Japan compensate him for the loss of his
boat and offer an apology for its "unreasonable" act of sinking his vessel.</P>
      <P>"The boat was my life," said Ho Hung-yi at a meeting organized by Taipei County
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei to work out ways to help Ho, a county resident, claim
compensation.</P>
      <P>Ho, who had a cut on his face, looked weary, anxious and helpless during the
meeting. He was released Friday after being detained on the Japan-controlled
island of Ishigaki for three days.</P>
      <P>Ho's boat, the "Lienho", sank some six nautical off the coast of the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands -- called the Senkakus is Japan -- after colliding with a
Japanese patrol vessel early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the incident, Ho said in an agitated voice that the Japanese ship
deliberately rammed his boat from behind, causing the fishing vessel to sink.</P>
      <P>He was definitely not zigzagging as the Japanese coat guard claimed when it
accused the Lienho of causing the incident, Ho said, adding that the truth of
his statement can be proved by the radar charts.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ho made the same statements at a press conference held at
the Legislative Yuan. He called the ramming by a 100-ton patrol ship of his
20-ton fishing boat "arbitrary."</P>
      <P>Ho, demanding that Japan give him back a boat, said that he had used all his
savings and taken a loan from friend to purchase the used vessel "Lienho" three
years ago at a price of over NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Now it's not possible to buy a boat at that price, he said.</P>
      <P>Ho also asked Japan offer an apology and compensate him for the loss of his
clients, who were on a recreational fishing trip when the incident occurred.
"Otherwise, no Taiwanese fishing boat will dare to sail in those waters ever
again," he said.</P>
      <P>The waters surrounding the Taiyutais have been traditional fishing grounds for
Taiwan fishermen because the island chain is geographically closer to Taiwan
than to Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China and Japan all claim sovereignty over the islands in the East China
Sea, but Japan has exerted control over them since 1972 and claims sovereignty
over the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters off the islands' coast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan recalls envoy to Japan over boat collision (updated 1)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou said Saturday a Japanese
investigation report on a recent boat collision in the disputed waters near the
Tiaoyutai Islands was unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Ou said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to recall Taiwan's
representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, to learn more about Koh's negotiations with
the Japanese government over the incident in which a Taiwanese fishing boat sank
Tuesday after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel in the waters near the
disputed island group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The ministry "cannot" accept the investigation report it received Saturday, Ou
said.</P>
      <P>The report said the case has been turned over to the Okinawa Prosecutor Office.
It stated that the captain of the patrol ship, Koshiki, of the Maritime Safety
Agency of Japan, might have caused navigational hazards and damage through
negligence, while the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat might have caused
navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>But Ou said it was "unreasonable" for a big 100-ton Japanese patrol vessel to
ram a small 20-ton recreational boat.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested that Japan apologize immediately for
this inhuman behavior and compensate Captain Ho Hung-yi for his losses," he
added.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will ask the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) and other related
agencies to come up with an investigative report on the incident as soon as
possible, he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also ask the judicial authorities to provide relevant
assistance,  he said,  adding that the ministry will coordinate with Ho on
follow-up actions to seek compensation.</P>
      <P>Ou noted that a task force set up under the MOFA to deal with issues related to
the Tiaoyutais has been idle for years, but will be reactivated in view of the
latest incident.</P>
      <P>Ou also said the Committee on Japanese Affairs under the ministry, which was set
up in 2005 as a task force, will be disbanded.</P>
      <P>The committee was comprised of officials in charge of Japanese affairs under the
ministry's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and from the Association
of East Asian Relations,  a quasi-official organization authorized to deal with
Japan matters in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, executive director of the committee, said Thursday that he had
asked a CGA guard vessel at the scene of the incident to stay put and refrain
from entering the Tiaoyutais' 12-nautical-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he gave the instructions not knowing that the Taiwanese vessel was
already locked in a face-off with a Japanese patrol boat some 7.8 nautical miles
from the Tiaoyutais, where it was trying to gather evidence related to the
collision.</P>
      <P>Tsai has since resigned amid criticisms of his decision to ask the coast guard
vessel to back off.</P>
      <P>At the core of the incident is a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three
crew members and 13 customers aboard, which sank some six nautical miles
southwest of the Tiaoyutais Tuesday morning after colliding with a Japanese
coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan Wednesday, and two crew members returned
Thursday, while Ho, the last to be released, returned Friday.</P>
      <P>The incident sparked renewed discussion on the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais,
which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan. The waters around the island group
have traditionally been a fishing ground for Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972,  but Taiwan maintains  that it has historical, geographical and
judicial links to the island group.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands
in Japan, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they
fall under the jurisdiction of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve the
recurring disputes, and agreed to hold the next round of dialogue in March 2006,
but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters, but collisions there are rare.</P>

      <P>There is no need to wait until September, after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, to
begin talks on cross-strait cargo charter flights, an official of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF, said the talks
could be launched as early as July or August.</P>
      <P>Kao said that after the signing of the agreement between the SEF and its Chinese
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), on
expanding tourists from China and introducing weekend passenger charter flights,
"the top priority will be cross-strait cargo charter flights."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has high hopes for the cross-strait cargo charter flight initiative,
believing it will bring huge benefits to the country.</P>
      <P>Although the ARATS has said that the discussions could start after the Olympic
Games end, Kao said that lower-ranking officials can begin to discuss technical
aspects of the cargo charter flights before higher-ranking officials take over
the negotiations.</P>
      <P>During the talks between the SEF and ARATS in Beijing earlier in the week, both
sides agreed to discuss issues related to cargo charter flights, the flight
routes and destinations, and the possibility of increasing the number of
passenger charters within three months.</P>
      <P>Kao was one of the members of an SEF delegation that traveled to China Wednesday
for a four-day visit. He made the remarks on his return from Beijing Saturday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Saturday Taiwan has legal jurisdiction over
the collision of a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat and a Japanese coast
guard patrol vessel in the waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Tiaoyutais are the Republic of China's territory, the MOJ
said in a statement that the country has legal jurisdiction over the Tuesday
collision between the 20-ton "Lienho" boat and the 100-ton Japanese  patrol ship
"Koshiki"  in its territorial waters.</P>
      <P>As the "Lienho" sank after colliding with the "Koshiki, " the MOJ statement went
on, local prosecution authorities are eligible to look into relevant Japanese
coast guard officers' criminal responsibility if the "Lienho" skipper and owner
filed complaints in accordance with Criminal Code provisions regarding injury,
property damage or destruction through negligence.</P>
      <P>The statement further said if the skipper, crewmen and anglers abaord the sunken
Taiwanese boat file damage suits against the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency
which owns the Koshiki, the patrol vessel captain and other personnel, the ROC
government should offer all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The MOJ issued the statement after the Japanese coast guard authority released
an investigative report on the incident earlier in the day which said both the
captains of the Taiwanese and Japanese ships should be held responsible for
causing navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report said, the Japanese captain should be held accountable
for causing damage to the Taiwanese boat due to negligence. The report further
said the case has been turned over to the Okinawa Prosecutor Office for further
investigations.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the Japanese coast guard report, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs  (MOFA)  has decided  to recall  Taiwan's representative to Japan, Koh
Se-kai, to learn more about Koh's negotiations with the Japanese government over
the incident.</P>
      <P>The Japanese patrol ship rescued Taiwanese crewmen and anglers after their boat
sank and released the 13 recreational fishermen Wednesday. Two crew members were
released a day later, but the skipper, Ho Hung-yi, was not freed until Friday.
Ho sustained injuries in the incident. He vowed to seek compensation from Japan
over his physical injury and property loss, saying the ship was his only means
of making a living.</P>
      <P>Japan took control of the Tiaoyutais in 1972 when the United States returned
Okinawa to Japan along with the uninhabited island group in the East China Sea,
but Taiwan maintains that it has historical, geographical and judicial links to
the Tiaoyutais.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan said Saturday he will return to Taipei as soon
as possible now that the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to
recall him over a recent boat collision in waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands.</P>
      <P>Koh Se-kai made the remarks after receiving a directive from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) ordering his return to give a briefing on his
negotiations with the Japanese government over the incident in which a Taiwanese
recreational fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel
near the Tiaoyutais in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Koh said he will convene a meeting with staff at Taiwan's representative office
in Tokyo Sunday morning to discuss relevant affairs and will also book a home
bound flight with an early arrival time.</P>
      <P>Koh told CNA that he has prepared a detailed report on his negotiations with
Japanese authorities over the incident and that he will present some suggestions
for MOFA reference in its future handling of the case.</P>
      <P>Noting that maintaining friendly relations with Japan is crucial to Taiwan's
interest, Koh said he will urge Taiwan's government and private sector to cope
with the dispute with a cool head and rationality.</P>
      <P>Koh was attending the opening of a Taiwanese literary works exhibition at a
modern literature museum in Kanagawa Prefecture near Tokyo when he received the
MOFA's "recall" notice. Koh was reportedly shocked by the message as it came
abruptly.</P>
      <P>It was also reported that Japan's representative office in Taipei was also
shocked by Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou's announcement of
Koh's recall because Taiwan's foreign ministry didn't give it any prior notice.</P>
      <P>Ou made the announcement after Japan's Maritime Safety Agency released an
investigative report on the boat collision incident earlier in the day which
said both the captains of the Taiwanese and Japanese ships should be held
responsible for causing navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report said, the Japanese captain should be held accountable
for causing damage to the 20-ton Taiwanese boat due to negligence. The report
further said the case has been turned over to the Okinawa Prosecutor Office for

      <P>The Tiaoyutais -- known as Senkaku Islands in Japan -- are composed of eight
islets located 102 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan. They are claimed by
Taiwan, Japan and China. Japan took over control of the uninhabited island chain
in 1972 when the United States handed it the islet group along with Okinawa.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday institutionalized negotiations across the
Taiwan Strait should be accelerated to resolve many practical issues that the
public have long anticipated.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks  while meeting with Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Chiang Pin-kun who returned earlier in the day from Beijing after
singing two agreements with his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yulin of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) on expanding cross-
strait charter flights and tourism.</P>
      <P>Praising Chiang for having helped establish an institutionalized cross-strait
communication channel through his just-concluded visit, Ma said systematic
cross-strait  talks should be expanded and accelerated to meet public
expectations for increased bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ma said cross-strait talks can be carried out at different levels.
"If necessary, we can also appoint different groups of delegates to tackle
different issues in Taiwan or on the mainland simultaneously, " he exlained,
adding that such arrangements will enhance efficiency and benefit both sides..</P>
      <P>The newly signed SEF-ARATS agreements will allow for the launch of direct cross-
strait charter flights on weekends from July 4 and entry of Chinese tourists
from July 18.</P>
      <P>"The two agreements mark a big step forward in cross-strait relations, " Ma
said, adding that he looks forward to continued SEF-ARATS negotiations on many
unsolved issues, including an early launch of cross-strait cargo charter
services, opening of new cross-strait flight routes and expansion of weekend
charter flights into scheduled flights on weekdays.</P>
      <P>To save fuel costs and time, Ma said the existing cross-strait flight route that
requires a detour to pass the Hong Kong flight information zone should be
revised to allow for aircraft to fly along a more straight line.</P>
      <P>Following a nine-year hiatus in cross-strait dialogue, Ma said, many issues are
pending. "We should work out a priority list and settle all listed items as soon
as possible in order to maximize the benefits to be brought about by the opening
of weekend charter flights and expansion of tourism," he added.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan were also present at the
meeting that took place at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The SEF delegation,  headed by Chiang, arrived in Beijing Wednesday for a
resumption of institutionalized cross-strait dialogue that had been stalled
since 1999 when then ROC President Lee Teng-hui described cross-strait ties as a
special state-to-state relationship. The description angered Beijing which
viewed it as amove to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Relations remained chilly during the ensuing eight years which saw the pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party take the helm of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>Icy relations  gradually  thawed  after Taiwan's  March 22 presidential election
in which Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang, which adopts a more China-friendly
approach, won a landslide over his DPP rival.</P>
      <P>The expansion of charter flights was a key topic for the talks that began
Thursday. Those flights are now limited to four annual traditional Chinese
festivals and are usually packed with Taiwanese residents on the mainland
returning home to visit family.</P>
      <P>The launch of weekend charter flights on July 4 and expansion of tourism mark a
huge step forward in establishing contacts and mutual trust, Chiang said after
signed the pacts at a state guesthouse in western Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has banned direct scheduled flights ever since it split from China in
1949 following a bitter civil war.</P>
      <P>The new transport pact will allow for 36 charter flights to cross the Taiwan
Strait per week, running from Friday to Monday. Flights will be shared equally
between Chinese and Taiwanese airlines, servicing routes between the Chinese
cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing and Taiwan's capital,
Taipei, and seven other cities on the island. Flights would be open to anyone
carrying valid documents, a change from the past when they were limited to just
Taiwanese and Chinese.</P>
      <P>A separate tourism agreement permits up to 3,000 Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan each day for stays of up to 10 days. According to the pact, up to 1
million Chinese tourists will be allowed to enter Taiwan for pleasure trips
annually, well above the current level of about 80,000.</P>
      <P>The pacts were the first to be signed on Chinese soil. The previous SEF-ARATS
agreements that set the tone for systematic engagements in the 1990s were signed
in Singapore.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Saturday Taiwan has legal jurisdiction over
the collision of a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat and a Japanese coast
guard patrol vessel in the waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Tiaoyutais are the Republic of China's territory, the MOJ
said in a statement that the country has legal jurisdiction over the Tuesday
collision between the 20-ton "Lienho" boat and the 100-ton Japanese  patrol ship
"Koshiki"  in its territorial waters.</P>
      <P>As the "Lienho" sank after colliding with the "Koshiki, " the MOJ statement went
on, local prosecution authorities are eligible to look into relevant Japanese
coast guard officers' criminal responsibility if the "Lienho" skipper and owner
filed complaints in accordance with Criminal Code provisions regarding injury,
property damage or destruction through negligence.</P>
      <P>The statement further said if the skipper, crewmen and anglers abaord the sunken
Taiwanese boat file damage suits against the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency
which owns the Koshiki, the patrol vessel captain and other personnel, the ROC
government should offer all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The MOJ issued the statement after the Japanese coast guard authority released
an investigative report on the incident earlier in the day which said both the
captains of the Taiwanese and Japanese ships should be held responsible for
causing navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report said, the Japanese captain should be held accountable
for causing damage to the Taiwanese boat due to negligence. The report further
said the case has been turned over to the Okinawa Prosecutor Office for further
investigations.</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the Japanese coast guard report, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs  (MOFA)  has decided  to recall  Taiwan's representative to Japan, Koh
Se-kai, to learn more about Koh's negotiations with the Japanese government over
the incident.</P>
      <P>The Japanese patrol ship rescued Taiwanese crewmen and anglers after their boat
sank and released the 13 recreational fishermen Wednesday. Two crew members were
released a day later, but the skipper, Ho Hung-yi, was not freed until Friday.
Ho sustained injuries in the incident. He vowed to seek compensation from Japan
over his physical injury and property loss, saying the ship was his only means
of making a living.</P>
      <P>Japan took control of the Tiaoyutais in 1972 when the United States returned
Okinawa to Japan along with the uninhabited island group in the East China Sea,
but Taiwan maintains that it has historical, geographical and judicial links to
the Tiaoyutais.</P>

      <P>There is no need to wait until September, after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, to
begin talks on cross-strait cargo charter flights, an official of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF, said the talks
could be launched as early as July or August.</P>
      <P>Kao said that after the signing of the agreement between the SEF and its Chinese
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), on
expanding tourists from China and introducing weekend passenger charter flights,
"the top priority will be cross-strait cargo charter flights."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has high hopes for the cross-strait cargo charter flight initiative,
believing it will bring huge benefits to the country.</P>
      <P>Although the ARATS has said that the discussions could start after the Olympic
Games end, Kao said that lower-ranking officials can begin to discuss technical
aspects of the cargo charter flights before higher-ranking officials take over
the negotiations.</P>
      <P>During the talks between the SEF and ARATS in Beijing earlier in the week, both
sides agreed to discuss issues related to cargo charter flights, the flight
routes and destinations, and the possibility of increasing the number of
passenger charters within three months.</P>
      <P>Kao was one of the members of an SEF delegation that traveled to China Wednesday
for a four-day visit. He made the remarks on his return from Beijing Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan recalls envoy to Japan over boat collision (updated 1)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou said Saturday a Japanese
investigation report on a recent boat collision in the disputed waters near the
Tiaoyutai Islands was unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Ou said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to recall Taiwan's
representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, to learn more about Koh's negotiations with
the Japanese government over the incident in which a Taiwanese fishing boat sank
Tuesday after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel in the waters near the
disputed island group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The ministry "cannot" accept the investigation report it received Saturday, Ou
said.</P>
      <P>The report said the case has been turned over to the Okinawa Prosecutor Office.
It stated that the captain of the patrol ship, Koshiki, of the Maritime Safety
Agency of Japan, might have caused navigational hazards and damage through
negligence, while the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat might have caused
navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>But Ou said it was "unreasonable" for a big 100-ton Japanese patrol vessel to
ram a small 20-ton recreational boat.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested that Japan apologize immediately for
this inhuman behavior and compensate Captain Ho Hung-yi for his losses," he
added.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will ask the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) and other related
agencies to come up with an investigative report on the incident as soon as
possible, he said.</P>
      <P>The ministry will also ask the judicial authorities to provide relevant
assistance,  he said,  adding that the ministry will coordinate with Ho on
follow-up actions to seek compensation.</P>
      <P>Ou noted that a task force set up under the MOFA to deal with issues related to
the Tiaoyutais has been idle for years, but will be reactivated in view of the
latest incident.</P>
      <P>Ou also said the Committee on Japanese Affairs under the ministry, which was set
up in 2005 as a task force, will be disbanded.</P>
      <P>The committee was comprised of officials in charge of Japanese affairs under the
ministry's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs and from the Association
of East Asian Relations,  a quasi-official organization authorized to deal with
Japan matters in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-yao, executive director of the committee, said Thursday that he had
asked a CGA guard vessel at the scene of the incident to stay put and refrain
from entering the Tiaoyutais' 12-nautical-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he gave the instructions not knowing that the Taiwanese vessel was
already locked in a face-off with a Japanese patrol boat some 7.8 nautical miles
from the Tiaoyutais, where it was trying to gather evidence related to the
collision.</P>
      <P>Tsai has since resigned amid criticisms of his decision to ask the coast guard
vessel to back off.</P>
      <P>At the core of the incident is a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three
crew members and 13 customers aboard, which sank some six nautical miles
southwest of the Tiaoyutais Tuesday morning after colliding with a Japanese
coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan Wednesday, and two crew members returned
Thursday, while Ho, the last to be released, returned Friday.</P>
      <P>The incident sparked renewed discussion on the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais,
which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan. The waters around the island group
have traditionally been a fishing ground for Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972,  but Taiwan maintains  that it has historical, geographical and
judicial links to the island group.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands
in Japan, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they
fall under the jurisdiction of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve the
recurring disputes, and agreed to hold the next round of dialogue in March 2006,
but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese patrol vessels in the
disputed waters, but collisions there are rare.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Captain insists Japan apologize, compensate him for his losses</HEADLINE>

      <P>The captain of a recreational fishing boat that sank recently off a disputed
island chain insisted Saturday that Japan compensate him for the loss of his
boat and offer an apology for its "unreasonable" act of sinking his vessel.</P>
      <P>"The boat was my life," said Ho Hung-yi at a meeting organized by Taipei County
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei to work out ways to help Ho, a county resident, claim
compensation.</P>
      <P>Ho, who had a cut on his face, looked weary, anxious and helpless during the
meeting. He was released Friday after being detained on the Japan-controlled
island of Ishigaki for three days.</P>
      <P>Ho's boat, the "Lienho", sank some six nautical off the coast of the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands -- called the Senkakus is Japan -- after colliding with a
Japanese patrol vessel early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the incident, Ho said in an agitated voice that the Japanese ship
deliberately rammed his boat from behind, causing the fishing vessel to sink.</P>
      <P>He was definitely not zigzagging as the Japanese coat guard claimed when it
accused the Lienho of causing the incident, Ho said, adding that the truth of
his statement can be proved by the radar charts.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Ho made the same statements at a press conference held at
the Legislative Yuan. He called the ramming by a 100-ton patrol ship of his
20-ton fishing boat "arbitrary."</P>
      <P>Ho, demanding that Japan give him back a boat, said that he had used all his
savings and taken a loan from friend to purchase the used vessel "Lienho" three
years ago at a price of over NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Now it's not possible to buy a boat at that price, he said.</P>
      <P>Ho also asked Japan offer an apology and compensate him for the loss of his
clients, who were on a recreational fishing trip when the incident occurred.
"Otherwise, no Taiwanese fishing boat will dare to sail in those waters ever
again," he said.</P>
      <P>The waters surrounding the Taiyutais have been traditional fishing grounds for
Taiwan fishermen because the island chain is geographically closer to Taiwan
than to Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China and Japan all claim sovereignty over the islands in the East China
Sea, but Japan has exerted control over them since 1972 and claims sovereignty
over the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters off the islands' coast.</P>

      <P>The United States will not get between Taiwan and Japan to mediate in a problem
that has arisen over a recent boat collision in the disputed waters near the
Tiaoyutai Islands, American Institute in Taiwan Director Stephen Young said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"As the U.S. has good relations with both Taiwan and Japan, we do not want to
step into the problem," Young said. "I dont think that is necessary."</P>
      <P>Young made the remarks in response to reporters' question over an incident in
which a Taiwanese fishing boat carrying three crew members and 13 recreational
fishermen sank early Tuesday after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel near
a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. The 16 people on board the
fishing boat were rescued by the Japanese patrol vessel and only the Taiwanese
captain was slightly injured.</P>
      <P>The island group, called the Tiaoyutai Islands in Mandarin and Senkaku Islands
in Japanese, was seized by Japan in 1895 when it colonized Taiwan. Tokyo
continues to exert control over the islands and claims sovereignty  over the 12
nautical miles of marine territory, though both Taiwan and China each claim
rights to the island group.</P>
      <P>Young said he regrets that someone was hurt in the accident and that the
Taiwanese boat sank after the collision, but added that he was confident the
dispute could be resolved.</P>
      <P>"I think Taiwan and Japan are able to solve the problem peacefully through
dialogue as the two countries have been so closely connected in history," he
said.</P>
      <P>Since the incident occurred relations between Taiwan and Japan have been tense,
with Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) deciding Saturday to recall its
representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, in protest over Tokyo's handing of the
incident.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco Ou also said in a news conference Saturday that he
refused to accept an investigation report released by the Japan's Okinawa
Prosecutor's Office. The report stated that the captain of the patrol ship,
Koshiki, of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan, might have caused navigational
hazards and damage through negligence, while the captain of the Taiwanese
fishing boat might have caused navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>Ou said it was "unreasonable" for a big 100-ton Japanese patrol vessel to ram a

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, who has been recalled over a
fishing boat dispute, is scheduled to return to Taipei later Sunday, according

      <P>Koh was reportedly  scheduled to arrive at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
at 6: 55 p.m.. He was recalled Saturday by Taiwan's  Ministry  of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA)  to report his negotiations with the Japanese government over an
incident in which a Taiwanese sports fishing boat sank Tuesday after colliding
with a Japanese patrol vessel in the waters near the disputed Taioyutai island
group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with his colleagues in Tokyo earlier Sunday, Koh reportedly called
for the MOFA "to handle the incident rationally, " given that "maintaining good
relations with Japan is crucial to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Koh's return marks the first time in recent decades that Taiwan has recalled its
representative to Japan. Koh was appointed as Taiwan's top representative to
Japan in July 2004 by then President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou on Saturday refused to accept the Japanese

      <P>Taiwan will file a lawsuit in a local court against Japan over its mishandling
of a recent boat collision in the disputed waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, a
senior Cabinet official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan said the administration will
seek to sue Japan for bullying the captain of a Taiwan sports fishing boat by
keeping him detained for four days.</P>
      <P>The fishing boat sank after it was rammed by a Japanese patrol boat some 7.8
nautical miles from the Tiaoyutais June 10. The captain and crew of the fishing
vessel were detained by the Japanese authorities for questioning after they and
the other people onboard the boat were rescued by the Japanese coast guard.</P>
      <P>"We will help Captain Ho Hung-yi, who owns the boat, seek compensation for
losses and an apology from the Japanese government," Hsieh said during a visit
to Ho's home in Juifang, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"Since the Tiaoyutais  are part of the Republic of China territory, we will file
the suit in Taiwan, on grounds that the Japanese patrol illegally intruded into
the country's territorial waters," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, accompanied by Sha Chih-yi, director of the Fisheries Agency under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, conveyed the administration's regards to
Ho, who sustained cuts from shards of glass after his boat was rammed by the
Japanese patrol boat.</P>
      <P>Hsieh agreed to seek interest-free loans Ho and told him that the Executive Yuan
had decided to increase from three to seven the number of naval patrol vessels
assigned to protect Taiwanese fishing boats in Taiwan's territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh also confirmed that Taiwan's top representative to Japan, Koh
Se-kai, has been recalled in protest against Japan's bullying of Taiwan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Koh was expected to return to Taipei later Sunday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou on Saturday refused to accept
Japanese investigation report on the boat collision and decided to recall Koh to
gain a better understanding of the facts surrounding the incident.</P>
      <P>The Japanese report claimed that the captain of the patrol ship, Koshiki, of the
Maritime Safety Agency of Japan, might have caused navigational hazards and
damage through negligence, while the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat might
have caused navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>But Ou said it was "unreasonable" for a big 100-ton Japanese patrol vessel to

      <P>The Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, with three crew members and 13
customers aboard, sank some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutais June
10 after the ram.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan June 11 and two crew members returned June 12,

      <P>More than 7,000 workers from the Philippines gathered Sunday in Taipei's Daan
Forest Park for a cultural presentation to celebrate the 110th anniversary of
their country's independence.</P>
      <P>Philippines'  Independence  Day,  celebrated  on  June  12, commemorates the
archipelagic nation's independence in 1898 after more than three centuries of
colonization by Spain.</P>
      <P>The gala event, organized by the Department of Labor (DOL) under the Taipei City
Government, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) and the Rerum Novarum
Center, featured a parade of Philippine traditional costumes, singing, folk
dance competitions, and an exhibition of Philippine food and culture at some 30
booths.</P>
      <P>Edcel R. Benosa, 28, one of the members of "Samahang Makata International" -- a
foreign workers' association of poetry lovers founded in 1999 by a Philippine
migrant worker in Taiwan -- said that her association had set up a booth
decorated with flowers and poems written by its members to celebrate
Independence Day.</P>
      <P>Benosa, dressed in a traditional white costume decorated with rainbow ribbons,
also participated in the dance competition.</P>
      <P>However, the occasion was clouded by the alleged reluctance of some employers to
allow their Filipino workers to attend.</P>
      <P>"Our association has a total number of about 100 members in Taiwan, but
unfortunately, many of them cannot come because their employers did not permit
them to have a day off, " said Melvin Laureano, member of the association.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, there are about 94,000 Filipinos
working in Taiwan, including 8,000 in Taipei, most of whom are domestic
caretakers.</P>

      <P>German runner Thomas Dold won the 2008 Taipei 101 Run Up -- an annual event that
attracts world-class runners and jogging enthusiasts -- to claim the grand prize
of NT$ 200,000 (US$ 6,560), the organizers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Over 2,500 competitors, including professional runners, corporate teams and
individuals, joined the challenge to climb 2,046 steps --</P>
      <P>-- 390 meters up 91 floors -- in the 4th Taipei 101 Run Up to compete for cash
prizes totalling NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Dold, who also took part in the 2007 competition, defeated the 2007 champion
Italian Marco De Gasperi to win the title in the Men's Elite Group with a time
of 10 minutes 53 seconds.</P>
      <P>Apart from professional runners, dignitaries such as American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) Director Stephen Young and Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-
General Yeh Chin-chuan also participated in the race.</P>
      <P>Young and his wife, Barbara Finamore, who took part in the race for the third
consecutive year, said that they enjoyed the run up.</P>
      <P>"My wife and I are planning to climb Yushan this summer so this is a good
practice for us," Young said.</P>
      <P>Yushan, or Jade Mountain, is the tallest peak in Taiwan, towering 3,952 meters
above the sea level.</P>
      <P>The head of AIT said after the race that he was a bit more tired than last year,
as he had just come back from the United States and was still jet lagged.</P>
      <P>"But I feel that this year it was not that hot as before in the staircase and I
will definitely join the race again next year," he added.</P>
      <P>Taipei Financial Center Chairwoman Diana Chen said "the Taipei 101 Run Up has
become a well-known athletic event that is anticipated by local and foreign
sports lovers."</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 Manager Lin Hong-ming said the run up is not only a healthy event,
but also meaningful.</P>
      <P>"This year we will donate all registration fees, less the insurance premium, to
charity groups to help disadvantaged children living in remote areas," said Lin.</P>
      <P>The Taipei 101 Run Up was held for the first time in Nov. 2005 not only to
promote stair climbing competitions in the world's tallest building, but also to
encourage Taiwan residents to exercise.</P>
      <P>This is the last year that Taipei 101, which stands at 509 meters, will hold the
title as the world's tallest occupied building. The Burj Dubai in United Arab
Emirates, standing at 800 meters, is scheduled to be completed in Sep. 2009.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Environmental activist looks at the world through a camera lens</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 15 (CNA)
06/15/08  19:53:58</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On a cool rainy day in the middle of June, near the northeast coast of Taiwan, a
group of volunteers check their equipment on a rocky shore, before diving into
the water with two fagots of bamboo that would be used to create a "delivery
room" for bigfin reef squid. The marine volunteers have been doing this since
1998, with the lens of a camera constantly trained on them for the last eight
years.</P>
      <P>The 46-year-old cameraman Ke Chin-yuan is the producer of 11 environmental
documentary  films  and has been  dedicated  to environmental activities for
more than two decades.</P>
      <P>Ke, who started out as journalist, made his first documentary film in 1993 with
the hopes of portraying the environment from a perspective that differed from
that of the mainstream media.</P>
      <P>His work, which has become increasingly vital in light of the world's
environmental problems, shows his empathy for the nature.</P>
      <P>In Ke's environmental documentaries, humans play a central role, intimating that
their behavior cannot be separated from the cause and effect of all
environmental and ecological changes.</P>
      <P>As Ke said in his latest documentary film, released early this year, what people
do unconsciously on the other side of the Earth can seriously affect Magellanic
Penguins in coastal Argentina, Chile and the Falkland islands.</P>
      <P>"I prayed in silence in my heart that this scene of multitudes of penguins
wandering near the coast, will always remain in existence, " he said in one of
his documentaries that featured a voyage to the Antarctic.</P>
      <P>Ke's camera is always focused on the interaction between humans and nature,
especially on changes in primitive environments after human intervention. The
images captured are sometimes of positive actionVas in the case of the
volunteers' efforts to protect squidV but are more often negative, showing for
example people catching wild orangutans for the purpose of training the animals
to perform in TV shows..</P>
      <P>"It is almost impossible to find a balance between humans and nature. When the
two sides come into conflict, humans have to concede -- that is to say, not
reclaim land in ecologically sensitive areas, " said Ke told the CNA at a
barracks in the mountains of northeastern Taiwan that serves as a base for the
marine volunteers.</P>
      <P>In this rough shelter that lacks electricity and other basic necessities, the
group of about 10 divers and oceanology and marine life researchers gather
regularly to plan the repopulation of bigfin reef squid.</P>
      <P>Such is their passion for their work that two of the volunteers plan to get
married undersea, near the squid "delivery room."</P>
      <P>Ten years ago, some of the divers found that bigfin reef squid were spawning in
old fishing nets and trash because typhoons and artificial pollution had
destroyed their usual spawning grounds.</P>
      <P>With a plan in mind to save the squid, the divers built a " delivery room"
during the April to September spawning season, using fagots of bamboo to
simulate the environment of natural coral where the squid usually lay their
eggs.</P>
      <P>The idea proved successful, as a great number of squid came to the improvised
bamboo grounds to spawn. Since then, these marine lovers have continued every
year to construct new spawning grounds, as the bamboo deteriorates naturally
over the course of a year..</P>
      <P>On the same day that Ke was interviewed, he filmed two volunteers going
underwater to add two bamboo fagots to the "delivery room." Though Ke's
documentary "The Squid Daddy's Labor Room, " was released in 2007, his interest
in the project has not waned.</P>
      <P>Expounding on the relationship between humans and nature, Ke cited the Chingjing
Veterans Farm as example of humans gradually expanding their living place,
starting from coastal areas and plains to medium, even high elevation areas,
destroying nature in the process.</P>
      <P>The Chingjing Veterans Farm, located in Nantou County in central Taiwan at an
altitude of about 1,800 meters, is famous for its boundless grasslands and
magnificent mountain views. A popular destination for tourists, the farm is now
dotted with legally and illegally constructed hotels and homestay accomodation.</P>
      <P>Ke holds the view that when a natural disaster occurs, it is an occasion for
humans to reconsider their relationship with nature.</P>
      <P>"But what is a 'natural disaster'? It is considered a disaster only when humans
are hurt, otherwise it's seen as just a natural phenomenon," said Ke noted.</P>
      <P>He sees people's values as the fulcrum on which environment destruction turns.
For example, if people want a certain type of tourism, they would request
convenient transport and luxurious hotels, thus encouraging excessive
development, he said.</P>
      <P>Ke's response is his dedication over the past 20 years to environmental
education in local communities, through his films, speeches, and a personal blog
on which he records his observations on environmental and social issues.</P>
      <P>He said that 20 years ago, a person was seen as crazy if he or she talked about
environmental protection, but now most people understand what environmentalists
do.</P>
      <P>"Also, now the government is giving thought to practices that do less harm to
the environment when it is undertaking new construction plans, even though some
of these plans are still environmentally harmful, " he added, noting that there
has been some progress in environmental awareness in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If the viewers gain a new understanding of the environment, a better idea of
natural conservation, feel anger or joy when they look at my films, that is
rewarding for me," he said.</P>
      <P>But this does not mean that this pioneer in the environmental movement is easily
satisfied.</P>
      <P>"Now that the idea of environmental protection is generally accepted, the next
step is to create values and motivate people to take action -- then they will
give priority to nature rather than to economic development when the two come
into conflict, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese diplomat posted to Taipei paid a visit Sunday to the captain of a
Taiwan fishing boat that sank after colliding with a Japanese patrol boat near
the Tiaoyutai Islands on June 10.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association--- the de-facto Japanese embassy in Taipei---
called on the owner of the Taiwanese boat Ho Hung-yi at his home in Rueifang,
Taipei County, and expressed regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of
Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Ito said through an interpreter that the incident occurred as the Japanese
patrol boat Koshiki was carrying out its legal duties, and that it was not
intentional.</P>
      <P>Citing the findings of an investigation by Japanese prosecutors into the
accident, Ito said that both the Koshiki and the Taiwanese boat had been
negligent.</P>
      <P>He quoted a report issued by the Maritime Safety Agency in Tokyo earlier that
day that stated the Koshiki might have caused damage through negligence as it
approached the fishing boat, adding that the agency would deal with the accident
and the issue of compensation in accordance with Japanese law.</P>
      <P>Ho, who claimed that the Koshiki deliberately rammed his boat, reiterated his
requests that the Japanese authorities apologize, compensate him for his losses
and withdraw their charges against him of illegal poaching in Japanese
territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Ito said he would convey Ho's requests to the related Japanese agencies.</P>
      <P>Ho was carrying 13 Taiwanese anglers on board his boat for recreational fishing
off the coast of the Tiaoyutais when the Koshiki approached and tried to drive
the fishing vessel away from the islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and
China.</P>
      <P>Ho and his two crew members were detained briefly by Japanese authorities for
questioning after they and the 13 anglers were picked up by the Koshiki.</P>
      <P>In a related  development  Sunday,  Taiwan's  Coast  Guard Administration (CGA)
submitted its report on the accident to the Yilan Prosecutors Office for a
judicial probe, after Ho filed a criminal complaint with the Yilan office
against Japan.</P>
      <P>In the document, the CGA accused the Koshiki's captain Nobuyuki Tsutsumi of
injuring Taiwan fishermen and damaging their property.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishermen  have often been chased away by Japanese patrolling boats in
the waters near Tiaoyutais, but this would mark the first time that a Taiwan
national has attempted to bring legal action against Japan within the
jurisdiction of a Taiwan court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academic calls for end of tax incentives to specific sectors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should put an end to preferential taxes for some industries when
the Statute for Upgrading Industries expires in December 2009, an academic said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a tax reform seminar, Lin Shui-ming, an associate dean at National
Taiwan University's College of Management, suggested that the government should
provide subsidies for research and personnel training programs, which would
promote national competitiveness, instead of broadly providing preferential tax
incentives to stimulate investment in specific sectors, such as the high-tech
industry.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the tax breaks given to some industries under the statute has
resulted in a phenomenon where individual taxpayers and traditional industries
are paying taxes to subsidize some of the emerging and strategic industries.
"This is not only unfair but is also the main contributor to the formation of an
"M-shaped" society," Lin added.</P>
      <P>"If the government sets a flat income tax rate of around 15 percent, there would
no need for corporations or individuals to apply for tax breaks or exemptions,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Department of Health and
other government agencies allocate funds to subsidize research  projects and
talent training programs that could be monitored and assessed by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>As for the tax incentives for research and development provided under  the
"Biotech  and New Pharmaceutical  Development  Act" promulgated last year, Lin
said the government should require biotech and pharmaceutical companies to pay
taxes at the basic rate of 10 percent in accordance with the Income Basic Tax
Act until the biotech development act expires.</P>
      <P>Companies that enjoy other tax breaks and exemptions under law provisions aimed
at encouraging investment in public infrastructure projects should also be
subject to tax liability at the basic rate of 10 percent, Lin suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, has been recalled over a boat
collision incident, but is not being replaced, government spokeswoman Vanessa
Y.P. Shih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Shih said Koh was recalled because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wanted to
gain a better understanding of his negotiations with the Japanese side in the
wake of a collision between a 100-ton Japanese patrol boat and a 20-ton
Taiwanese sports fishing boat in the disputed waters near the Tiaoyutai island
group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Koh was recalled also to help the government in its future negotiations with
Japan over the incident, in which the recreational fishing boat sank after it
was rammed by the Japanese patrol boat June 10, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry will make appropriate decisions regarding Koh, but he is
not being replaced because of the incident," the spokeswoman reiterated.</P>
      <P>Shih made the comments after several media outlets quoted members of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party as saying Sunday that Koh's recall
"violates international practices in protecting national interests" and that
"the government is laying all the blame for its failure to protecting Taiwanese
fishing boats at Koh's feet so it can replace him."</P>
      <P>Shih added that the administration has no reason for replacing an envoy once the
diplomat is performing his or her duties professionally and impartially.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers and three crew members who were aboard the sports fishing boat
had all returned to Taiwan in different groups as of Friday. The captain
sustained cuts from shards of glass after his boat was rammed by the Japanese
patrol vessel.</P>

      <P>The median age of women in Taiwan giving birth to their first child rose to 28.5
years in 2007, compared to 26.3 years in 1997, according to data released Sunday
by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate has been decreasing, with the number of babies born in 2007
totalling 203,711, representing a sharp decrease of 37.3 percent compared to 10
years ago, and a 1.0 percent drop year-on-year, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Some 52.8 percent of the babies were the firstborn in their families, 36.5
percent were second births, and 10.7 percent were third or later children,
according to the data compiled to analyze issues related to newborns, pregnancy
and birth in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The number of third or later born children totalled 21,800 in 2007, a 8.9
percent drop compared to 1997, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>Most notably, the average age at which Taiwanese mothers had their first child
was also on the rise, reaching an all-time high of 28.5 in 2007, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>Due to a drop in the number of births and the fact that more women were giving
birth at a later age, the average birth rate 2007 in Taiwan stood at only 1.1
children, the same as in South Korea, but far behind the 2.7 recorded globally,
the 1.6 in China, and the 1.3 in Japan and Singapore, according to the DGBAS.</P>

      <P>The government is working to craft a tax reform program and will put it into law
by June 2009, as the Statute for Upgrading Industries is due to expire at the
end of 2009, according to Vice Premier Chiu Cheng- hsiung.</P>
      <P>Chiu revealed the plan Saturday during a forum on the new Kuomintang
government's tax reform plan, organized by the Chunghua Association of Public
Finance.</P>
      <P>Referring to a call by Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Chairman Morris Chang for
the government to increase taxes on the rich and cut the tax burden on the poor,
Chiu said that there is little room for tax reduction for low income individuals
or families, as they already pay very little or no taxes.</P>
      <P>Around 45 percent of the households that file tax returns are subject to the
minimum income tax rate of 6 percent, while 26 percent of the households in
Taiwan are tax exempt, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>What this means is that about 70 precent of all households are either taxed at
the minimum rate or do not pay taxes at all, which would make it very difficult
to cut income tax rates for middle- and low-income people, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun Ke-nan, an associate professor at National Taipei College of
Business, criticized a negative taxation system proposed by President Ma Ying-
jeou during his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Under Ma's proposal, low-income families will receive government subsidies to
cover basic cost of living.</P>
      <P>Sun said that if such a system is implemented, the government will suffer a loss
of tax revenue amounting to NT$25 billion to NT$30 billion per year, and will
still not succeed in bridging the rich-poor gap.</P>
      <P>Sun expressed opposition to the idea of using tax reduction measures in an
attempt to alleviate poverty or achieve equity. He suggested that the government
improve existing social welfare programs to help get rid of poverty.</P>
      <P>Sun added that if the government decides to push forward the negative taxation
system, it would need to come up with complementary measures such as combining
existing social welfare payments to avoid paying double subsidies.</P>

      <P>Japans expression of regret over a recent boat collision between Taiwans fishing
boat and Japans patrol vessel in the disputed water near the Tiaoyutai Islands
can be regarded as an apology, and the two countries should look to find a way
to solve the fishery problem, Taiwans representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, said
Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Koh made the remarks in a news conference after reporting to Foreign Minister
Francisco H.L. Ou. Koh was recalled by Ou Saturday in protest over Tokyos
handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>According to its usual practice, Japans expression of regret can be seen as an
apology,Koh said.</P>
      <P>The visit made by the Japanese diplomat posted to Taipei to the captain of the
Taiwanese fishing boat shows that Japan cherishes its relations with Taiwan and
does not want to see such relations were harmed by the incident,he added.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association -- the de-facto Japanese embassy in Taipei --
called on the owner of the Taiwanese boat Ho Hung-yi at his home in Reuifang,
Taipei County Sunday, and expressed regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety
Agency of Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Ito said through an interpreter that the incident occurred as the Japanese
patrol boat Koshiki was carrying out its legal duties, and that it was not
intentional. Ho, who claimed that the Japanese patrol vessel deliberately rammed
his boat, reiterated his requests that the Japanese authorities apologize,
compensate for his losses and withdraw their charges against him of illegally
poaching in Japanese territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Ou said that Japan has shown itsgoodwillover the incident but
he still urged the Japanese authorities to make clear apology.</P>
      <P>He, however, agreed with Koh that both Taiwan and Japan should seek to negotiate
an agreement on the fishery problem to prevent similar incident from happening
again.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat carrying three crew members and 13 recreational
fishermen sank June 10 after colliding with a Japanese patrol vessel near the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea. The 16 people on board the
fishing boat were rescued by the Japanese patrol vessel and only the Taiwanese
captain was slightly injured.</P>
      <P>Since the incident occurred, relations between Taiwan and Japan have been tense.
Ou said in a news conference Saturday that he refused to accept an investigation
report released by the Japan's Okinawa Prosecutor's Office. The report stated
that the captain of the patrol ship, Koshiki, of the Maritime Safety Agency of
Japan, might have caused navigational hazards and damage through negligence,
while the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat might have caused navigational
hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>The incident has sparked renewed discussion on the sovereignty of the
Tiaoyutais, which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan. The waters around the
island group have traditionally been a fishing ground for Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fishing boats are often chased away by Japanese vessels in the
disputed waters, but collision there are rare.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands, or called Senkaku Islands in Japanese, was
seized by Japan in 1895 when it colonized Taiwan. Tokyo continues to exert
control over the islands and claims sovereignty, though both Taiwan and China
each claim rights to the island group.</P>

      <P>A group of Taiwan protesters left "Japanese territorial waters" after sailing
around the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands early in the day, Japan's NHK television
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The protesters aboard a Taiwanese fishing boat "intruded into" Japanese
territorial waters at 5:53 a.m. (GMT 8:53 p.m. Sunday), and left the area at
8:35 a.m. (GMT 11:35 p.m. Sunday) to return to Taiwan, NHK quoted the Maritime
Safety Agency as reporting.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan fishing boat and an escort convoy of nine patrol boats from Taiwan's
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) were spotted by the Maritime Safety Agency at
3:50 a.m. when they were 76 km west-southwest of the disputed islands, NHK
reported.</P>
      <P>Japanese patrol boats issued megaphone and electronic sign warnings to the
flotilla but did not attempt to chase off the boats.</P>
      <P>The TV station quoted sources at the Maritime Safety Agency as saying that it
was the first time foreign patrol boats had intruded into Japanese waters.</P>
      <P>The sources speculated that the Taiwan activists were protesting an accident on
June 10 when a Taiwan fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese patrol
ship near the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed by Japan, Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The incident has strained ties between Tokyo and Taipei, with Taiwan recalling
its representative to Japan on Sunday in protest over Japan's claims that the
incident was a bungled attempt by the Japanese patrol ship to chase away a
Taiwan fishing boat that was poaching in Japanese territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Taipei authorities have demanded an apology and compensation from Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan protesters were members of a tiny radical group that supports its
country's territorial claims to Tiaoyutai.</P>
      <P>Although there were only 12 activists onboard the ship, they were accompanied by
30 Taiwanese journalists and were escorted by a flotilla of nine CGA patrol
boats to ensure their safety.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is aware of Tokyo's goodwill in the aftermath of an incident that
involved the collision of a Taiwan fishing boat and a Japanese patrol vessel,
but is stilling requesting an official apology, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H. L. Ou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ou made the remarks after a Japanese diplomat posted to Taipei paid a visit
earlier that day to the captain of the Taiwan fishing boat that sank after
colliding with a Japanese patrol boat near the Tiaoyutai Islands on June 10.</P>
      <P>Ou branded the visit by Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department
under the Taipei Office of the Interchange Association--- the de-facto Japanese
embassy in Taipei--- to Ho Hung-yi as a concession on the part of Japan.</P>
      <P>"However, it falls short of Taiwan authorities' expectations of of a clear
apology from Tokyo." Ou said on.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will keep working toward this," the minister
said at a new conference before his slated meeting with Taiwan's representative
to Tokyo Koh Se-kai later that day.</P>
      <P>Ito visited Ho at his home in Rueifang, Taipei County, and expressed regret on
behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Ito said through an interpreter that the incident occurred as the Japanese
patrol boat Koshiki was carrying out its legal duties, and that it was not
intentional.</P>
      <P>Citing the findings of an investigation by Japanese authorities into the
accident, Ito said that both the Koshiki and the Taiwanese boat had been
negligent.</P>
      <P>He quoted a statement issued by the Maritime Safety Agency in Tokyo earlier that
day that the agency would deal with the accident and the issue of compensation
in accordance with Japanese law.</P>
      <P>The accident took place when Ho was carrying 13 Taiwanese anglers on board his
boat on recreational fishing trip off the coast of the Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The Koshiki approached and tried to drive the fishing vessel away from the
islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Ho claimed that the Koshiki rammed into his boat deliberately and caused it to
sink.</P>
      <P>Also Sunday, the leader of a group of activists defending Taiwan's claim to the
Taioyutais said ten of its members will sail toward island group Sunday night to
demonstrate the country's sovereignty over it.</P>
      <P>In a response, the Executive Yuan's spokeswoman Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said
Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) will ensure their safety during their
demonstration.</P>
      <P>The CGA has decided to dispatch a patrol vessel to follow the boat carrying the
activists when they left from Shenao, Taipei County later Sunday.</P>

      <P>A group of activists, escorted by coast guard vessels, sailed around the
disputed island group of Tiaoyutai in the East China Sea Monday morning to
highlight Taiwan's claim to the islands, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The group of 12 people sailed from Shenao, Taipei County midnight Sunday and
arrived 3: 30 a.m. at a location about 24 nautical miles away from the
Tiaoyutais.</P>
      <P>The activists, aboard a private sports fishing boat, sailed into an area about
12 nautical miles away from the Tiaoyutais at 4: 55 a.m., under the escort of
agile CGA vessels, said CGA Deputy Minister Cheng Chang-hsiung.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese convoy circled around the uninhabited island group before
departing around 5:40 a.m., Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The boat carrying the activists was escorted by a convoy of nine CGA vessels --
four frigates and five patrol boats -- to ensure the safety of the group, Cheng
said at a news conference held at the CGA headquarters.</P>
      <P>At one point, around 5 a.m., Japanese patrol boats, including a 3,000-ton
frigate, tried to stop the Taiwanese convoy from going any further, while a
Japanese helicopter circled overhead, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>He said a CGA vessel tried to communicate with the Japanese Maritime Safety
Agency authorities to tell them that the Taiwan convoy's sail around the
disputed island group was aimed only at "protecting the territorial waters of
the Republic of China," but the Japanese patrol did not respond.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, have been
at the center of a territorial dispute among Japan, Taiwan and China over the
past decades. The waters around the island group have traditionally been a
fishing ground for Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>The demonstration by the group of activists took place five days after a
Japanese patrol vessel rammed into a Taiwan fishing boat, causing the fishing
boat to sink off the islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recalled its representative to Tokyo to protest the Japanese
authorities' claim that the accident resulted from a bungled attempt by the
Japanese patrol vessel to chase the Taiwan fishing boat away from Japan's
territorial waters and that the Taiwan boat was partly to blame.</P>

million people is unfortunate and in a way hypocritical, " he added, alluding to
the contrast between the UN's position on the issue and its stated goals and
mission.</P>
      <P>King, who is leading a high-level delegation on a state visit to Taiwan, said
St. Lucia signed a cooperation agreement with Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) last Friday for assistance in the development of the Eastern
Caribbean nation's agricultural sector.</P>
      <P>The agreement  finalized  plans for programs such as "the introduction of fish
farming, the reestablishment of St. Lucia's agriculture research station,
assistance to farmers to provide for greenhouses or sheltered agricultural
farmingKand it generally allows for the transfer of technology to our
agriculture officials and farmers in St. Lucia," the prime minister said.</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan's agricultural expertise was one the factors that made
it an attractive diplomatic partner.</P>
      <P>"We felt that our past experiences with Taiwan had proven to be quite successful
in the area of agriculture, particularly as it pertains to the promotion of
exotic crops, new techniques that were introduced in St. Lucia in terms of
production and in terms of the quality of fruit we able to realize."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's allies are often painted in the international media and elsewhere as
mostly small impoverished nations cashing in on a Taiwan-China dollar diplomacy
war, but King intimated that St. Lucia holds itself to a higher standard.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the decision by his government in 2006, under the leadership
of the late Prime Minister John Compton,  to reestablish diplomatic links with
Taiwan after a 10-year break was a principled stance.</P>
      <P>"We believe that Taiwan is a country that demonstrates its true commitment to
democracy, freedom and peace." he said. "The Freedom House report in 2006
indicated that Taiwan is probably the freest democratic nation in the Asian
regionKwe believe that Taiwan presents an example to many other nations that
believe in freedom and democracy."</P>
      <P>Freedom House is an independent non-governmental international organization that
supports the expansion of freedom and democracy in the world.</P>
      <P>The former Labor Party government of St. Lucia broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan
in favor of China shortly after it took office in 1996, but when Compton's
United Workers Party (UWP) came to power in 2006 St. Lucia reestablished links
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>King said that the move was in line with his party's philosophy on the
sovereignty of the people.</P>
      <P>"My party, my government, is a strong believer in freedom and democracy. We
believe the people must determine the government, and the direction of the
country must be determined by the people, rather than through dictatorship or
other means."</P>
      <P>King also pointed to commonalities between the two island nations as one the
reasons for the diplomatic alliance, saying that Taiwan serves as model for his
own country's development.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a perfect example of a small island state rising to the occasion of
global challenges, " he noted. "It moved from poverty to  large-scale  farming,
from  land  reform  to  high-tech industrialization. It is a shining example of
what a small island state can do."</P>
      <P>The prime  minister  indicated  that the Taiwan-St.  Lucia relationship is true
partnership in which his country brings to the table its voice and vote in the
international community and its own unique assets. He said that last year St.
Lucia voiced support in the UN for Taiwan's bid to join the world body, and he
gave the assurance that the Caribbean member state will continue to stand with
Taiwan on this issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that one of Taiwan's goals is internationalization of its people, King
said St. Lucia is well positioned to assist in that regard, as it is an English-
speaking country that is located 15 minutes away from the French territory of
Martinique and is also close to Venezuela and other Latin American countries in
the region.</P>
      <P>St. Lucia is located in the Eastern Caribbean island chain between Martinique to
the north and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to the south. Agriculture and
tourism form the backbone of its economy.</P>
      <P>The 240-square-mile nation, with a population of 168,000, drew China's ire in
2006 when it forged diplomatic links with Taiwan. China threatened to withdraw
from the Caribbean Development Bank, a financial institution that assists
Caribbean nations in financing social and economic programs. "We express
opposition and indignation, " the Chinese foreign ministry stated at the time.</P>
      <P>But some political commentators in St.  Lucia argued that Beijing's one-China
policy could not be "legally or diplomatically thrust on St. Lucia, as though
we, too, were a colony of China."</P>
      <P>King said that at the time the St. Lucian government was prepared to maintain
its links with China.</P>
      <P>"At one stage I hoped it would have worked, " the prime minister said, recalling
that Beijing however refused to accept the dual recognition approach.</P>
      <P>"St. Lucia's decision to reestablish relations with Taiwan was not to the
detriment of China," he noted.</P>
      <P>The prime minister's itinerary on his eight-day Taiwan visit included meetings
with Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan.
King also met with President Ma Ying-jeou last week for what he described as
very cordial and wide-ranging discussions.</P>
      <P>The prime minister, on his first visit to Taiwan since he took office in 2007,
was scheduled to visit some of the country's famous landmarks and to take the
high speed rail to the south of the island. He and his eight-member delegation
will depart for St. Lucia June 19.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Naval vessels will be dispatched to escort agroup of legislators on their
planned visit to the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea, military
spokeswoman Lisa Chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Navy has started planning for the proposed trip by a group of lawmakers from
the legislature's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee, led by ruling
Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang, Chi said.</P>
      <P>Lin announced earlier in the day that the trip -- slated for Wednesday -- will
be aimed at "finding facts, claiming sovereignty and protecting the rights of
Taiwan fishing boats."</P>
      <P>"It was still uncertain whether Defense Minister Chen Chao-min will accompany
the legislators on the trip to the Tiaoyutais, " Chi added.</P>
      <P>"Relevant details, such as the type of vessels, the Defense Ministry personnel
to be assigned to the mission, and question of whether the convoy will enter the
disputed 12-nautical-mile zone around the Tiaoyutais, are yet to be finalized,"
Chi added.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, have been
at the center of a territorial dispute among Japan, Taiwan and China over the
past decades. The waters around the island group have traditionally been a
fishing ground for Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the legislators are determined to make the trip Wednesday, adding
that "the decision will not be changed unless Japan apologizes and offers
compensation."</P>
      <P>Lin was referring to a recent incident, in which a Japanese patrol vessel rammed
into a Taiwan sports fishing boat in waters near the Tiaoyutais, causing the
fishing boat to sink off the islands June 10.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recalled its representative to Tokyo Sunday to protest the Japanese
authorities' claim that the accident resulted from a bungled attempt  by the
Japanese  patrol  vessel to chase the Taiwan recreational fishing boat away from
Japan's territorial waters and that the Taiwan boat was partly to blame.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should make Taiwan's economic development its central goal so as
to boost the country's competitiveness, Morris Chang, the chairman of Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the Taiwan Competitiveness Forum 2008, the founder of the worlds
largest chipmaker said the government, in a globalized market economy under a
democratic system, should follow the lead of private companies by setting a
predominant goal.</P>
      <P>"Private companies tend to have a single mindset, which is to increase their
share value, Chang said, adding that countries, like companies, should also
focus on a single direction or goal in order to achieve greater success.</P>
      <P>Recalling his conversation with Chinese President Hu Jintao two years ago when
Hu told him that China's main objective was economic development, Chang said
Taiwan should do the same by focusing on improving the economy.</P>
      <P>The TSMC head also pointed out that the rise of China's economy has made
Taiwan's seem less competitive, noting that the growth rate of gross national
product (GNP) per capita in Taiwan has slowed.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in the period 1980 to 1990 Taiwan's GNP/capita growth had more
than tripled, from US$2800 (NT$85,400) to US$8600.</P>
      <P>"But by 2000 the GNP/capita had risen to US$13,000, less than twice that of ten
years before," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in order to focus on economic development, what the government
should do is to create the right environment. "However, what the government
should not do is to try to pick winners among new industries," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that economic policies that favor certain industries are obsolete.</P>
      <P>This approach "had some merit 30 or 40 years ago, with Japan also adopting it,
but the time for that has passed," he said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the importance of education, Chang said there is not enough emphasis
in Taiwan on innovation. "Economic development in the days to come will be
driven primarily by innovation," Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>The chairman also highlighted the importance of teamwork. "The spirit of
cooperating while competing appears to be somehow lacking in Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei forum from June 16-17 and is being jointly held by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, the American Institute in Taiwan, the
American Chamber of Commerce, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research,
and the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Department of Health said Monday that the municipal government
will begin offering free funeral services from July 1 for people who sign organ-
donor cards.</P>
      <P>The department held a news conference to announce the new measure, which will
also include public citations for those who decide to donate their organs after
death.</P>
      <P>The organ-donor card signers will also receive health credits to be used for
free medical services, according to the department.</P>
      <P>It said that the measure is aimed at addressing the severe shortage of organ
donations in the city.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Organ Registry Sharing Center tallies, a total of 8,523
patients in Taipei are awaiting organ transplants, far outstripping the figure
of 77 organ donors so far this year.</P>
      <P>The department encouraged more citizens to sign organ-donor cards, saying that
doing so can make a big difference to the lives of many people.</P>
      <P>It pointed to the example of a National Taitung University student who died
tragically in a traffic accident recently. The student had signed an organ-donor
card and was able to help save the lives of seven people.</P>
      <P>The department said that it will hold a series of lectures in the coming months,
in cooperation with health centers in the city's various districts and with
medical professions associated with Taipei City Hospital, to promote the new
measure and encourage more people to become organ donors.</P>

      <P>An emergency mediation mechanism across the Taiwan Strait was activated Monday
in the wake of a traffic accident in China earlier in the day that left one
Taiwan tourist dead and 15 others injured.</P>
      <P>Liu Ke-hsin, chief of the Travel Service Department under Taiwan's quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , said the SEF telephoned its Chinese
counterpart, the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , Monday in an emergency consultation over the traffic accident
that involved a 29-member Taiwanese tour group.</P>
      <P>The SEF asked the ARATS to refer the case immediately to the ARATS office in
Heilongjiang so that the Taiwan tourists could receive emergency attention in
the wake of the accident, Liu said. The SEF will also follow up with a formal
written request to this effect, he added.</P>
      <P>"Family members of a 68-year-old man, surnamed Chu, who was killed in the
accident, and relatives of the injured Taiwan tourists are expected to depart
for Heilongjiang Tuesday at the latest, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred in China's northernmost  province of Heilongjiang Monday
morning when a bus carrying a 29-member Taiwan tour group veered off the road as
it made an abrupt turn to avoid an oncoming farm pickup. The bus fell onto a
ramp five meters below. Chu died on the spot and 15 others wounded, according to
Liu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Monday that it will submit an
assessment to the Executive Yuan on the need for building new vessels to protect
Taiwan's fishing boats operating in disputed waters.</P>
      <P>The assessment will be put to the Executive Yuan shortly in a report on the
country's need for new patrol craft, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the administration will detail its need for new
large and small boats, including patrol ships weighing between 500 tons and 700
tons, out of a comprehensive evaluation for speed, flexibility and maintenance
and repair in operations to protect Taiwan's fishery interests.</P>
      <P>The CGA currently has 14 vessels of more than 500 tons and 152 ships smaller
than 500 tons -- lagging well behind the Japanese authorities' scale, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Japan's marine defense authorities have a total of 79 boats weighing over 500
tons, 380 patrol vessels of less than 500 tons and 73 aircraft, while its
agriculture and fisheries authorities have 31 ships above 500 tons and four
planes, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>During the 2005-2007 period, Japan posted marked increases in budgets for
constructing vessels, with the figure jumping to the equivalent of more than
NT$13 billion in 2007, up from NT$4.13 billion in 2005, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>The country's need to build more vessels to protect Taiwanese fishing boats
operating on the high seas has become more urgent after a sport fishing boat
from Taipei County, the Lien Ho, collided last Tuesday  with a Japanese  coast
patrol  frigate  in disputed Japan-controlled waters near the Tiaoyutai islands.</P>
      <P>The Lien Ho sank after the collision and its skipper was held for three days by
the Japanese authorities until last Friday. The Taiwanese captain has demanded
that Japan apologize and compensate him for his losses.</P>
      <P>The waters  around  the Tiaoyutais,  some 100 miles  from northeastern Taiwan,
have for centuries been a traditional fishing ground of Taiwanese fishermen and
the Republic of China considers they are to be under the jurisdiction of the
Yilan county government.</P>
      <P>However, the United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned
Okinawa to Tokyo in 1972, although Taiwan believes that the island group belongs
to Taiwan from judicial, historical and geographic perspectives.</P>
      <P>Japan controls the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku islands in
Japanese, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, part of Okinawa Prefecture.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should create "soft power" by developing a knowledge-based economy in an
effort to enhance the nation's competitiveness, a renowned economist said at a
forum Monday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Competitiveness Forum 2008 is being held June 16-17 by the Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , the American Institute in Taiwan,
the American Chamber of Commerce, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research and the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</P>
      <P>"Soft power, corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ethics are three things
that can help boost Taiwan's competitiveness, " said Charles Kao, who is also
founder and CEO of the Taipei-based Commonwealth Publishing Group.</P>
      <P>Quoting noted academic Joseph Nye, a former dean of Harvard Kennedy School, Kao
said soft power is the ability to shape the preferences of others, adding that
Taiwan's government needs to focus on education to build a knowledge-based
economy to achieve such power, which could help the country compete with other
countries without engaging in conflict.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, in order to build Taiwan's soft power, the government must
work with China to acquire cross-Taiwan Strait peace and prosperity through the
signing of peace agreements.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the direct weekend charter flights across the strait and
opening up to 3,000 Chinese tourists, both of which are scheduled to take place
in July as the result of recent negotiations between the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Such a friendlier cross-strait situation could produce peace dividends to help
Taiwan focus on the building of soft power, " Kao said, indicating that the
government could use some of the budget appropriated for weapon purchases toward
this end.</P>
      <P>Three percent of Taiwan's national gross domestic product (GDP) is spent each
year on arms purchases, Kao said, adding that these deals are made mostly with
the United States.</P>
      <P>"Instead of buying F-16 jet fighters and submarines, we could use that money to
sponsor 30,000 local students to study abroad in the U.S. each year to learn
from America's soft powers," said Kao.</P>
      <P>Referring to the U.S. as the world's most competitive country, Kao said the key
for its outstanding economic performance is that the U.S. is an open society.</P>
      <P>"Such openness can attract high quality labor resources and capital from around
the world, thus achieving strong soft power," Kao said.</P>
      <P>As for increasing the corporate competitiveness of Taiwan, Kao said CSR and
ethics are the two main issues private companies must face.</P>
      <P>"In addition to making profit, companies must perform CSR if they want to become

      <P>Taiwan's first 'digital medical treatment touring' vehicle was launched Monday
to take high-tech health care services to villages and small towns where people
have to travel far to reach a big hospital.</P>
      <P>The vehicle, which is equipped with a digital X-ray machine, advanced ultrasound
device and pap-smear equipment as well as other state-of-the-art medical
equipment, will be used in central Taiwan's Taichung county to offer the
county's residents better quality, convenient and multifunctional health
services, Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng said.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a ceremony held outside the Taichung County hall, Huang noted that
because of changes in people's lifestyles and diets, the prevalence of chronic
diseases and cancer have gradually increased in recent years.</P>
      <P>He said the new vehicle will help in the health department's efforts to increase
early detection of diseases and to provide treatment by providing the county's
residents with more opportunities to undergo medical checkups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu Nien-feng, head of Taichung County's Health Bureau, said the new
vehicle will assist the health offices in townships and villages around the
county to provide better quality health exams, especially in more remote areas
of the county.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the country will move from compulsory
military service toward a voluntary recruiting system in four to six years.</P>
      <P>After the voluntary enlistment system is in place, the president said, "the
military will be further streamlined and a smaller, but stronger military will
be established."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during an address at a ceremony to mark the 84th founding
anniversary of the Republic of China Military Academy in Fengshan, Kaohsiung
County.</P>
      <P>The president noted that "neutrality of the military has taken root in Taiwan, "
a sign that the military will be loyal to the country rather than to a specific
party or individual.</P>
      <P>The president praised the academy, founded in Whampoa, in southern China's
Guangdong Province, in 1924, for its contributions in conflicts over the past
eight decades, including battles against China's warlords during the Northern
Expedition and during the Sino-Japanese war.</P>
      <P>The president then led the faculty in chanting the slogans "spread the Whampoa
spirit" and "long live the Republic of China." He also led a chorus of the
academy song.</P>
      <P>The song was left out of founding anniversary celebrations under the previous
Democratic Progressive Party administration because its lyrics contain the words
"party flag flying, " which refer to the then opposition Kuomintang. The late
President Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang was the first superintendent of the
academy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin urged citizens Monday to wash their hands more
frequently in an effort to prevent the spread of enterovirus around Taiwan,
noting that "hand-washing is the most crucial way to prevent the spread of the
viral disease."</P>
      <P>Enterovirus -- the most common cause of aseptic meningitis -- can cause serious
illness and death, especially in infants and people whose immune systems have
been compromised.</P>
      <P>Noting that 192 severe enterovirus infections have been recorded around Taiwan
so far this year, eight of which had proven fatal as of Monday, Hau said
everyone, especially school children, should wash their hands frequently and
thoroughly.</P>
      <P>"Society, schools, parents and children must make efforts to prevent the
enterovirus from spreading, " Hau said in a press conference organized by the
city's Department of Health (DOH) at a local elementary school.</P>
      <P>Showing the city government's determination to bring the disease under control
without any further spread, Hau announced that any classes found to contain an
infected student must be suspended for 10 days.</P>
      <P>He said a total of 852 elementary schools and nurseries had already been
sterilized and emphasized that "the DOH will also carry out disinfection of all
kindergartens and nursery schools on a weekly basis."</P>
      <P>"Through this variety of measures, the city government wants to ensure that no
more children will be infected and to ensure that the disease will not spread,"
he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level
Department of Health, almost all serious enterovirus cases this year were caused
by enterovirus type 71 (EV71) , the deadliest strain of enterovirus, and all
those infected were aged under five, with the exception of one 14- year-old
teenager from the northern city of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Type EV71 infections this year first occurred in Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung
County, Pingtung City and Pingtung County in the south, and gradually spread
northward.</P>
      <P>Forty-three percent of children aged 5 and under in Taiwan are not immune to
EV71, and as many as 90 percent of those aged 4 and under lack immunity, CDC
officials said last week.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of EV71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died. Another EV71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 infected, 15 of
whom died.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng described the cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiations held last week in Beijing as successful Monday but expressed hope
that future talks on national policies will prescribed by law.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while receiving Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , who led a 19-member delegation in
the resumption of talks with the SEF's Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>During Chiang's June 11-14 visit to Beijing, he signed two cross-strait
cooperation agreements with Chen Yunlin, head of the ARATS, on the launch of
weekend direct cross-strait charter flights and the admission of more Chinese
tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the resumption of SEF-ARATS talks after a nine-year hiatus was "an
important foundation for peace across the Taiwan Strait, " Wang said that "most
people are satisfied with the talks and the results have also met the
expectations of the public."</P>
      <P>However, he said further negotiations on direct communications across the
strait, such as direct flights and direct sea links, are related to legal
aspects that are "important national policies that must be approved by the
legislature."</P>
      <P>Citing the Act Governing Relations between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area, Wang said that "the competent authorities shall request the
consent of the Legislative Yuan before permitting direct business transactions
or direct sea or air transportation."</P>
      <P>As for a proposal raised in the Beijing talks that both Taiwan and China can set
up offices in each other's territory, Wang said the legal aspect of this matter
is also worthy of attention.</P>
      <P>Referring to the content of Article 6 of the Act Governing Relations between the
Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Wang said that matters
relating to the granting of permission for the establishment of such offices
must be prescribed by law.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Executive Yuan to draft certain acts as soon as possible to
deal with future cross-strait agreements that are expected to be signed.</P>
      <P>Expressing appreciation for the work done by the previous Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) government to "pave the way for the negotiations, " Chiang,
meanwhile, promised to continue his efforts for the benefit of Taiwan and to
advance cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The talks between the SEF and ARATS were held within the framework of the so-
called "1992 consensus" that allows both sides to agree that there is only one
China, but leaves it up to each side to interpret the term "one China."</P>
      <P>After a number of fits and starts in the 1990s, bilateral negotiations across
the Taiwan Strait were suspended in 1999, when then-President Lee Teng-hui
defined relations between Taiwan and China as "special state-to-state
relations."</P>
      <P>When the pro-independence DPP and Chen assumed power in 2000, cross-strait
relations further deteriorated.</P>
      <P>After President  Ma Ying-jeou  of the Kuomintang  won the presidential  election
March  22,  the  trend  turned  toward reconciliation and cooperation. Ma is not
opposed to unification with China but has vowed not to discuss that with China
during his term in office and has previously said China must be democratic
before the two sides can unify.</P>
      <P>Ma's election victory created new optimism in many quarters for better relations
with China, which are expected to help Taiwan's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers demand government reduce burden of fertilizer price hikes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers on the Legislative Yuan's Economics Committee resolved Monday that
state-controlled Taiwan Fertilizer Co.  absorb a higher portion of recently
announced fertilizer price hikes and that company chairman Lee Ching-lung step
down if he fails to stamp out hoarding.</P>
      <P>Voicing their anger over the company's recent fertilizer price increases and
hoarding even though it earned over NT$3 billion last year, the legislators
passed the non-binding resolution requiring the company to improve its
production  control and management  to accomplish the two objectives.</P>
      <P>According to ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers, Taiwan Fertilizer officials
recently hoarded 647 metric tons of fertilizer out of some 80,000 tons to 90,000
tons annually produced, but the hoarding was not discovered  until  prosecutors
were tipped  off and they investigated the complaint.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers blamed the Council of Agriculture (COA), which holds a
24-percent stake of Taiwan Fertilizer and controls its board, for the company's
failure to detect the hoarding.</P>
      <P>They demanded that Chairman Lee and President Lee Jen-chieh of the company step
down from their posts to assume responsibility for the mismanagement.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also insisted that the company absorb a higher percentage of the
fertilizer price increases announced at the end of May, considering that the
company earned NT$3.8 billion in 2007 despite a freeze in fertilizer prices.</P>
      <P>COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung announced on May 28 that the price of a 40-kilogram
bag of urea would have to rise from NT$360-NT$370 a bag to over NT$800 a bag to
reflect the soaring costs of raw materials.</P>
      <P>At the time, Chen said Taiwan Fertilizer would absorb 70 percent of the
necessary increase, leaving farmers to pay NT$520-NT$530 per bag beginning May
30.</P>
      <P>But after heavy protests by farmers, who complained the price hikes would drive
them off their farms, Chen announced Friday that the fertilizer company would
absorb up to 85 percent of the overall price increase, lowering the price
farmers paid per 40-kg. bag of urea to NT$445-NT$455, retroactive to May 30.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the additional price reduction will cost Taiwan Fertilizer an
estimated NT$660 million (US$21.7 million) in revenues, and higher raw material
prices will cost it another NT$562 million in expenses over the next seven
months.</P>
      <P>That would bring the total cost of the revised fertilizer pricing policy to
NT$1.22 billion by the end of 2008, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's May 28 announcement led to widespread fertilizer hoarding, sparking
discontent among farmers in central and southern Taiwan despite Chen's
assurances that there would be no fresh increases in fertilizer prices to the
end of the year.</P>

      <P>Mid- and high-level executives are in high demand in Taiwan's information and
telecommunication industries, with job openings at that level in the IT sector
accounting for 40 percent of the market, according the results of a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by 104 Job Bank, Taiwan's largest online job site, showed
that the demand for mid- and high-level executives in Taiwan increased 12-15
percentage points in the first five months of this year compared to the same
period last year.</P>
      <P>The semiconductor and electronics industry offer the largest share of the mid-
and high-level jobs -- 24.5 percent, the survey showed. Meanwhile, 40 percent of
such jobs are available in the combined industries of computer and peripheral
products, Internet and information integration, and telecommunications,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>In the last three categories, executives with research and development and
product quality control skills are in high demand, potentially absorbing 37.6
percent and 25.1 percent, respectively, the survey showed. Jobs for marketing
executives grew by 6 percentage points year-on-year, it indicated..</P>
      <P>Chin Li-ming, deputy general manager of 104 Job Bank, said the increased demand
for marketing jobs indicates that high technology in Taiwan has matured and now

      <P>The request to resign by Koh Se-kai, Taiwan's representative to Japan, will not
affect negotiations with Japan over the sinking of a Taiwanese vessel in
disputed waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, Taiwan's foreign minister said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou said Taipei will take charge of
negotiations with Tokyo over the incident -- in which a Japanese patrol boat
allegedly rammed into the Taiwanese vessel -- and that there are other staff at
Taipei's representative office in Japan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Koh, who was recalled by the ministry to report on the incident
Sunday, will return to Tokyo to continue the negotiations, Ou said "do you think
I can still ask him to conduct the talks under the circumstances?"</P>
      <P>Ou made the comment after Koh at a 1: 30 p.m. news conference said he would not
report on the incident to the Legislature because he could not tolerate being
"humiliated" by ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers. He also requested that his
resignation request be granted immediately.</P>
      <P>Koh was supposed to go to the legislature at 2: 30 p.m.to report on the
collision incident and how he dealt with the aftermath in his negotiations with
Japan.</P>
      <P>Ou said that Koh is still the nation's top envoy to Japan and that his
resignation request will be valid only after being approved by President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"Koh was appointed by the president and his resignation will be approved by the
president," Ou said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said it was "most inappropriate" for Koh to call a news
conference instead of going to the legislature, adding that he was "most
dissatisfied with" Koh's approach.</P>
      <P>KMT legislators earlier called Koh a "Taiwan traitor" for his conflicting role,
noting that he has permanent residency status in Japan and is serving as
Taiwan's top envoy to Japan.</P>
      <P>But Koh, a pro-independence advocate who was blacklisted by the then
authoritarian KMT administration decades ago, argued that his situation is
"different from other Cabinet members" who reportedly once held U.S. or Canadian
permanent residency.</P>
      <P>Koh noted that his ROC passport expired more than three decades ago and then KMT
administration declined to extend it, and that he had to either naturalize or
apply for permanent residency status to continue to stay in Japan.</P>
      <P>Koh also said that he had prepared to leave the post before the KMT took the
helm of the nation May 20 and that he tendered his resignation when the
collision took place.</P>
      <P>On June 10, a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew members and 13
customers aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutais after
colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>The 13 recreational fishermen returned to Taiwan Wednesday, and two crew members
returned Thursday, while captain Ho Hung-yi, the last to be released, returned
Friday.</P>
      <P>The captain and his crew accused Japan of deliberately ramming into their
vessel, causing it to sink, and denied accusations by the Japanese side that
they had navigated their ship in a negligent manner.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demanded that Japan issue a formal apology
and compensate Ho for the loss of his vessel.</P>
      <P>The incident sparked renewed fervor over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais,
which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei county councilor, who is a longtime Taiwan territorial rights activist,
suggested Monday that the ultimate way to protect local fishermen in disputed
waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan is to
resolve the issue of the islands' sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus and China calls the Diaoyutais, is
at the center of a row between Taipei and Tokyo which erupted after a Japanese
coast guard patrol vessel collided with a Taiwanese fishing boat on June 10.</P>
      <P>Japan detained the boat captain for three days before releasing him last Friday.
Taiwan's foreign ministry has issued statements protesting the incident and has
recalled its chief representative to Japan. Japan has expressed regret over the
incident.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county councilor, King Chieh-shou, said such incidents could happen
again.</P>
      <P>"No fishing right without sovereignty,  " said King,  who successfully landed on
the main islet of the disputed island chain in the East China Sea in 1996 to
assert Taiwan's sovereignty over the islands.</P>
      <P>The landing was one of many "Defending Tiaoyutais" campaigns King had launched
over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>The waters surrounding the Tiaoyutais -- located 186 km north of the Keelung
port and 417 km southwest of Japan's Naha airport in Okinawa -- have
traditionally been a fishing ground for Taiwanese fishermen. The islands are
much closer to Taiwan than Japan. However, over the past years Taiwanese
fishermen kept being driven away by armed Japanese patrol ships.</P>
      <P>China claims that it had known about the islands since the Ming Dynasty and
ceded the islands, along with Taiwan, to Japan under an unequal treaty in 1895,
as the weak Qing Dynasty at the time could not match the military power of the
invading Japanese. It said Japan administered the islands as part of Taiwan
between 1895 and 1945.</P>
      <P>After defeating Japan at the end of World War II, the United States took over
control of the islands, along with Okinawa. In 1972, the United States turned
over the island group to Japan when it returned Okinawa, despite protest from
China and Taiwan. China argues that it has made all "Unequal Treaties" null and
void and the islands should've been returned to China.</P>
      <P>However, the U.S. has not taken a clear position on this issue and treats the
islands only as Japan's "administrative territory".</P>
      <P>Japan claims that it had staked its claims on the uninhabited islands three
months before the treaty was signed with China in 1895, ceding Taiwan to Japan,
and thus the islands should not be treated as part of Taiwan. Japan says its
government conducted surveys of the islands beginning in 1885 confirming they
were not under Chinese control, although that is disputed by China. Japan,
however, said it did not make public its formal incorporation of the islands
until 1950.</P>
      <P>Some Chinese scholars in the law of the sea have cited the U.N.-signed 1958
Convention on Continental Shelf as saying that Japan has no jurisdiction over
the island chain which by geography is attached to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands
in Japan, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they
fall under the jurisdiction of Toucheng Township, Yilan County.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the incident last week that saw the Taiwanese fishing boat Lienho
collide with a Japanese frigate and sink in the waters near the disputed island
chain, King suggested Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration  reinforce and
regulate its protection of local fishermen's operations there.</P>
      <P>Peng Chin-peng,  an assistant professor in National Taiwan University's
political science department, has also said that Taiwan must continue to stress
its sovereign claim over the islands, send patrol vessels to protect Taiwan
vessels operating near the islands, and propose international arbitration to
settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Huang Tung-hsiung, former president of National Chung Hsing University, has
suggested that the Council of Agriculture set up a team of lawyers to assist the
fishermen in taking their case to the international court.</P>
      <P>The "Lienho" was not the only Taiwanese vessels sunk by a Japanese patrol ship
in the waters near the disputed island group.</P>
      <P>Back in June 2001, the "Teh Fa No. 38" fishing boat, registered in Suao of Yilan
County, northern Taiwan, was chased and rammed by a Japanese coast guard ship
before sinking in the waters.</P>
      <P>The then skipper Yiao Kun-ming  was arrested  by Japanese authorities, and
detained at a prison on the Japan-controlled island of Ishigaki for 107 days
before he was allowed to fight for his rights in court there.</P>
      <P>King had worked together with then Legislator Lai Shyh-bao and Fu Kuen-chen, the
then chairman of the Overseas Fisheries Development Council of the Republic of
China, to negotiate with Japanese authorities in "rescuing" Yiao home.</P>
      <P>Expressing support for King's proposal for the government to take actions to
resolve the sovereignty dispute for good, Fu, an expert in maritime laws, said
that nine years ago, a Keelung-registered fishing boat was also "attacked" by
Japanese ship in the disputed waters.</P>
      <P>"The crew was beaten up and mistreated with electric shock by Japanese coast
guard personnel, " Fu said, noting that although Taiwan had filed lawsuits
against Japanese coast guard authorities, but that "no Japanese was willing to
come to Taiwan for trial."</P>
      <P>Both sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve the
recurring disputes, and agreed to hold the next round of dialogue in March 2006,
but the talks never took place.</P>

      <P>Hong Kong movie star Jackie Chan will visit Taiwan Wednesday for a fund-raising
activity for local children in need of financial support for their education and
daily necessities.</P>
      <P>The international film star will speak on behalf of the campaign initiated by
the Taipei-based nonprofit TVBS Caring for Taiwan Foundation in 2002 to pay
school fees and other costs for children living in poverty, said a spokesman for
Jackie Chan's JC Group Taipei branch office Monday.</P>
      <P>Despite his close relations  with Taiwan after marrying a Taiwanese actress,
Chan has stopped visiting Taiwan since 2004 due to his criticism of former
President Chen Shui-bian after Chen was shot in a campaign activity a day before
he was re-elected as president in March 2004.</P>
      <P>Chan's comment that the shooting was the "biggest joke in the world" earned him
the scorn of many in Taiwan whose antipathy for the actor lingers to this day.</P>
      <P>Chan decided to publicize the annual campaign in Taiwan because the movement is
similar to a "One-Dollar Fund" program he launched to offer care for children,
the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chan wants to help Taiwanese children after learning that some 50,000 children
in Taiwan live in households incapable of paying their education fees, their
books, and other school costs, according to the TVBS charity foundation.</P>
      <P>The movie star, who has grown wealthy by acting in and directing many
blockbuster films in Hong Kong and Hollywood, is convinced education can lift
the poor out of poverty, a foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chan often recalls that he lived in poverty when he was a boy, and therefore
failed to receive a proper education. He has said "it is painful to know a
limited number of words when needed, " the campaign spokesman said.</P>

      <P>A vast majority of the employees at state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. (TSC) do not
want their future chairman to be designated by the government, according to the
results of a poll released Monday.</P>
      <P>Following the resignation of TSC Chairman Arthur Iap May 19, the sixth chairman
to vacate the post since 2000 under the administration of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), many believe the new chairman will be appointed by the
KMT administration.</P>
      <P>A poll held by TSC, however, revealed that 76 percent of the company's employees
do not favor such an arrangement, which would surely bring in an outsider to
lead the company.</P>
      <P>"Seventy-six percent of respondents expressed their rejection of a government-
appointed chairman, an indication that the previous chairmen designated by the
former government failed to win praise from the staff," TSC said in a statement
Monday.</P>
      <P>In the poll, 49 percent of respondents favored the idea that the future chairman
should be someone from within the company compared to only 1 percent who favored
bringing in an outsider.</P>
      <P>Announcing the results of the poll, conducted June 2-5, the statement said more
than 50 percent of respondents showed a lack of confidence in the leadership of
government-appointed officials.</P>
      <P>"Similar indications were seen as 56 percent of employees said the previous
chairmen  did not help the company upgrade its operations," the statement added.</P>
      <P>The company also said that the TSC labor union called on the government to end
the previous practice of appointing high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>The poll also revealed that 47 percent of respondents were against a proposal to
change the company's supervisory authority from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) to the Council of Agriculture (COA), while 41 percent were in favor of
the change.</P>
      <P>"TSC's union urged the government to negotiate with union members before making
any changes to the company's supervisory authority, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou pledged during his election campaign to place the sugar
company under the supervision of the COA to help resolve and revitalize the
company's unused land.</P>
      <P>The high cost of planting sugar cane forced the company to leave large swaths of
its land fallow, the company has said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Boat collision should not hurt trust between Taiwan, Japan: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to Japan Koh Se-kai said Monday that a recent dispute
over a collision between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels in waters to the
northeast of Taiwan should not damage the two countries' foundation of mutual
trust.</P>
      <P>Koh, in a written report to the legislature on his handling of the incident that
he didn't deliver personally, said Japan had grown less skeptical of President
Ma Ying-jeou and his reputation for being anti-Japanese and hoped the incident
would not undermine the new positive sentiment.</P>
      <P>Koh said Japan's doubts over Ma were somewhat allayed after he attended an event
in early May to mark the 66th anniversary of the death of Japanese engineer
Yoichi Hatta. Ma praised the engineer for his substantial contribution to the
construction of the Wushantou Reservoir in southern Taiwan under Japanese
colonial rule.</P>
      <P>"It represented a good start for Taiwan-Japan ties, and both countries should
make good use of the moment to strengthen bilateral relations, " Koh stressed.</P>
      <P>He urged the government and people to handle the maritime dispute rationally for
the sake of the long-term benefits that could be obtained through cordial ties
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Koh also suggested that at a time when Japan is highly concerned over growing
ties between Taiwan and China after Ma took over as president, it may
demonstrate more good will toward Taiwan to strengthen the two countries'
friendship in this delicate triangular relationship.</P>
      <P>The diplomat said the Japanese government had already shown its good will by
releasing the captain and other crew members of the Taiwanese boat within a few
days after the incident, with the help of his coordination with the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>Koh's report described his efforts in negotiating with the Japanese government
to obtain the release of the captain and two other crew members of the Taiwanese
recreational fishing boat who were detained by the Japanese government after
their boat collided with a Japanese patrol ship and sank near the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands June 10.</P>
      <P>Koh was recalled by Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou to Taipei in
a move to demonstrate the ministry's discontent with the Japanese side's
handling of the matter.</P>
      <P>Japan's Maritime Safety Agency issued a report last week saying that both the
captains of the Taiwanese and Japanese ships should be held responsible for
causing navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese captain and crew members have argued, however, that the Japanese
patrol ship deliberately rammed their vessel in an attempt to chase it away in
the waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, whose sovereignty is claimed by Japan,
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Koh reminded the Taiwanese side to consult with legal experts in filing for
damages from the Japanese government, as the captain of the Taiwanese
recreational boat may have violated local law by sailing his vessel beyond 24
nautical miles from Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>The report stressed that international disputes should be handled rationally and
that people should not resort to emotional methods.</P>
      <P>While stressing that safeguarding the country's sovereignty is necessary, Koh
urged Taiwan people to thoroughly weigh the nation's overall interests in
dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais -- known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan -- are located 102
nautical miles northeast of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai offered to resign Monday after being
called a "traitor" by a legislator over his handling of the aftermath of a boat
collision between a Japanese patrol vessel and a Taiwanese fishing boat near the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands last week.</P>
      <P>Koh announced his resignation at a news conference in Taipei City and said that
due to the unacceptable "humiliation" he had to endure, he would not report on
his negotiations with Japan to the Legislative Yuan as was scheduled.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lee Chia-chin on Monday called Koh a "traitor to
Taiwan" after legislators accused Koh of speaking favorably for Japan on the
incident, in which a Taiwanese fishing boat sank on June 10 after colliding with
a Japanese patrol vessel near the group of islands in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The 13 amateur fishermen on board the fishing boat were rescued by the Japanese
patrol vessel and returned to Taiwan on June 11, while three crew members,
including the captain Ho Hung-yi, were detained by Japan before being returned
to Taiwan late last week.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association -- the Japanese office in Taipei -- called on Ho
at his home in Taipei County Sunday and expressed regret on behalf of the
Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Koh said in Taipei that same day that Japan's expression of regret over the
collision can be regarded as an apology, and the two countries should find a way
to solve the problem of Japan and Taiwan disagreeing on whether Taiwanese
fishermen had a right to fish in the area.</P>
      <P>Legislators criticized Koh not only for speaking favorably for Japan at a time
when he was supposed to be pursuing Taiwan's national interests, but for holding
permanent residency rights in Japan.</P>
      <P>Koh was recalled from Japan on June 14 to brief the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) on his negotiations with Japan over the incident  and was expected to
report on the incident to the Legislative Yuan Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Koh said in his resignation statement that he had done his best in negotiating
with Japan over the incident and had made progress, as Japan had already
released those detained, apologized, and expressed its willingness to pay
compensation.</P>
      <P>Koh said he visited seven Japanese political heavyweights on June 10 after the
incident occurred, and they all hoped that bilateral relations would not be
harmed by the incident. They also promised to make  efforts  to urge Japan's
government  to meet  Taiwan's expectations, the envoy said.</P>
      <P>Koh also met with Japan's former Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Aso, and
Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council head Takeo Hiranuma, June 11, and
visited Masaji Takahashi, president of the Japanese Interchange Association, to
reassert Taiwan's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai Islands and ask the Japanese
government to release the detained captain, nake an apology and due
compensation.</P>
      <P>Koh said he refused to put up with the humiliation from Legislator Lee and
called on Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou to approve his resignation
immediately.</P>
      <P>MOFA's Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs Director Yu Te-sheng, who
attended the news conference to persuade Koh to attend the legislative meeting,
told Koh that the ministry recognized his efforts and achievements in
negotiating with Japan and suggested he deliver his report and defend himself at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Koh turned down Yu's suggestion, however, saying that as the MOFA was not able
to prevent him from being humiliated, he would not go to the Legislative Yuan to
invite more insult upon himself.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Japan have been tense after the incident, which has
sparked renewed debates on the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed
by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands, called Senkaku Islands by Japan, were seized
by Japan in 1895 when China ceded Taiwan to Japan in a so-called "unequal
treaty." China and Taiwan claim the islands should have been returned when Japan
lost the war in 1945 and Taiwan reverted back to China's control.</P>
      <P>However, Tokyo argues the islands were uninhabited and not under China's control
as of 1895 and that it had incorporated the islands that year before the treaty
was signed, thus making the islands separate from its colonization of Taiwan.
Japan continues to exert control over the islands.</P>
      <P>The islands are much closer to Taiwan than to Japan.</P>
      <P>China has argued that its historical texts refer to the islands, making them
part of China's territory even as far back as the Ming Dynasty. Japanese
scholars, however, dispute the notion the islands were considered by China to be
part of its territory so far back.</P>
      <P>Koh said that as Japan has shown its good will, Taiwan should wait positively
for Japan to fulfill its promises instead of compromising what has already been
achieved, in order to pursue Taiwan's real interests.</P>
      <P>Koh added that he will soon return to Japan, but he will still provide
assistance in dealing with the incident's aftermath.</P>
      <P>Koh was appointed as the representative to Japan by the previous Democratic
Progressive Party government in 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA credited for enabling boat to sail near disputed Tiaoyutais</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) played a key role in enabling a fishing
boat to sail around the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands northeast of Taiwan, the
leader of a group of activists said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsi-lin, executive director of an action alliance to protect the
Tiaoyutais, credited the CGA for making it possible for the boat taking him and
11 other activists to complete its journey to underscore Taiwan's claim of
sovereignty over the islands.</P>
      <P>"Without CGA's protection, the fate of this journey would have been uncertain, "
Huang said after returning to Rueifang, Taipei County Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Huang, a township councilman from Yonghe, Taipei County, said that he was
"deeply moved by the valiant protection of the CGA all the way."</P>
      <P>He said that since taking part in a "protecting the Tiaoyutais" campaign in
1996, he has continued similar activities for the past 12 years, although the
activists were suppressed by the previous Democratic Progressive Party
administration, making it impossible for them to approach the islands.</P>
      <P>This year, they had planned a trip to the Tiaoyutais in September after the
conclusion of the Beijing Olympics but decided to move up the trip after a June
10 incident in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew
members and 13 customers aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the
Tiaoyutais after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>"In September, there will be another sailing to the island group," he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said Monday's trip was his ninth visit to the vicinity of the Tiaoyutais,
and the "nearest to the island group in 12 years."</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwanese sport fishing boat he was in came within 0.4 nautical
miles of the main island of the Tiaoyutai archipelago but could not get any
closer due to hidden reefs and several small Japanese ships in its path.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the boat departed from Shenao, Rueifang, at 10: 30 p.m. Sunday.
Japanese patrol ships showed up on both sides of the ship when it entered within
40 nautical miles of the Tiaoyutais early Monday.</P>
      <P>When the Taiwanese ship was within 12 nautical miles of the island, the number
of Japanese patrol boats increased to around 10, including a 3,000-ton frigate,
and three helicopters also circled overhead in a bid to deter the ship from
advancing further.</P>
      <P>Japanese patrol boats repeatedly broadcast the message, "these are Japanese
territorial waters and you should leave, " and they even used water cannons and
belched black smoke to disturb the ship.</P>
      <P>Nine CGA ships rapidly came to the ship's aid whenever Japanese ships tried to
speed past it, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, have been
at the center of a territorial dispute among Japan, Taiwan and China over the
past decades.</P>

      <P>A 39-member Chinese delegation arrived in Taipei Monday to gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's tourism environment and opportunities one month before
an unprecedented number of Chinese tourists are expected to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of travel service professionals from 33 travel agencies
around China, was the first travel delegation to visit Taiwan after the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait signed agreements last Friday on the launch of direct
cross-strait charter flights on weekends and the expansion of Chinese tourist
arrivals beginning in July.</P>
      <P>"Our main mission is to check out Taiwan's tourism resources and facilities as
well as popular travel routes and relevant tour packages, " said Fan Guishan,
deputy secretary-general of the Association for Tourist Exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The group will also make extensive contacts with Taiwanese travel service
providers during its 11-day visit to forge relationships and exchange
information in preparation for organizing Chinese tour groups to Taiwan, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>The delegation visited the National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei -- home to
a large collection of ancient Chinese art treasures -- shortly after its
arrival. Starting Tuesday, the group will travel around Taiwan to see for
themselves Taiwan's tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner in honor of the Chinese visitors, Tourism Bureau Director-
General Janice Seh-Jen Lai said travel agents on both sides have reached a
consensus that quality should take precedence over quantity in organizing
Chinese tour packages.</P>
      <P>Lai gave assurances that government authorities will get involved to ensure that
unscrupulous tour groups will be unable to sabotage the cross-strait tour market
order.</P>
      <P>According to agreements signed in Beijing last Friday by the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwanese and Chinese
carriers will jointly operate 36 charter flights from Friday through Monday
every week beginning July 4 and up to 3,000 ordinary Chinese citizens will be
allowed to visit Taiwan per day for sightseeing from July 18.</P>
      <P>Prior to the agreement, nonstop charters were only operated on special holidays
and only certain categories of Chinese citizens, including those living abroad,
were allowed to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Legislators traded barbs Monday over Taiwan's top Japanese envoy's request to
resign and his refusal to go to the legislature to give a report.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator and executive director of the
KMT's Policy Committee, said that "it is wrong" for Koh Se-kai to evade the
legislature's monitoring.</P>
      <P>Koh, who was recalled by the Ministry of Foreign Ministry Sunday to report on
his handling of the aftermath of a recent boat collision between a Taiwanese
fishing boat and a Japanese patrol boat last week, called a news conference
Monday afternoon before his scheduled report on the latest developments in
Taiwan-Japan relations to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Koh said that he would not tolerate the "humiliation" of having some KMT
legislators call him a "Taiwan traitor" and asked that his resignation request
be approved immediately.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should not allow Koh to resign but should ask
him to give the report," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that Koh's written report talked mostly about his own hard work,
and devoted a small part to the collision, even terming it a "fishery dispute"
which he suggested should not be overblown so as not to undermine the basis of
mutual trust.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Ching-hua questioned Koh's stance, noting that as Taiwan's
representative to the legislature, he said to the Japanese media in 2004 that
the jurisdiction of the Tiaoyutais was "hard to say."</P>
      <P>Opposition legislator Yeh Yi-jin of the Democratic Progressive Party defended
Koh, saying his refusal to go to the legislature is because he did not want to
receive another "humiliation."</P>
      <P>Yeh defended Koh's permanent residency status in Japan, saying that he was
blacklisted decades ago by the then KMT administration and was forced to get the
status.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister  of Foreign  Affairs Andrew Hsia told the legislators that after
receiving information about Koh's refusal to go to the legislature, the ministry
reminded him that he is still Taiwan's representative to Japan.</P>
      <P>He should report to the legislature about his negotiations with Japan as
scheduled but should not take part in activities sponsored by a specific
political party and express his personal opinion, according to Hsia.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang, chairman of the legislature's Foreign and National
Defense Committee, said that the plan for lawmakers to board a Lafayette frigate
and sail to waters near the disputed Tiaoyutais has not changed.</P>
      <P>But it is impossible to land on the islands because only a small ship can make
it there, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin was ultimately forced to end the meeting due to the rows triggered by Koh's
absence.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is expected to express his views Tuesday on a recent
incident near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in which a Taiwanese recreational
fishing boat sank after allegedly being rammed by a Japanese patrol vessel,
political sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma will meet with local journalists informally Tuesday afternoon, during which
he is expected to address the boat sinking incident as the event has snowballed
into a diplomatic controversy, with Taiwan's representative to Japan, Koh Se-
kai, insisting on resigning after being accused by ruling Kuomintang lawmakers
of mishandling its aftermath.</P>
      <P>Ma has kept mum since the 20-ton Taiwanese sport fishing boat "Lienho" sank off
the Tiaoyutais June 10 after colliding with the 100-ton Japanese coast guard
patrol vessel "Koshiki." Over the past week, the Presidential Office only issued
a four-point statement reiterating the country's sovereignty over the
uninhabited island group in the East China Sea and urging Japan to apologize for
the incident and compensate the Taiwanese shipowner's losses.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)  sources confirmed that Minister of Foreign
Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou briefed Ma on the latest development of the incident
Monday evening.</P>
      <P>But the Presidential Office kept a low profile, refraining from making any
comments on relevant developments.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma would accept Koh's resignation, Presidential Office spokesman
Wang Yu-chi just said the president will deal with the issue after receiving a
formal report from the MOFA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CGA credited for enabling boat to sail near disputed Tiaoyutais</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) played a key role in enabling a fishing
boat to sail around the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands northeast of Taiwan, the
leader of a group of activists said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsi-lin, executive director of an action alliance to protect the
Tiaoyutais, credited the CGA for making it possible for the boat taking him and
11 other activists to complete its journey to underscore Taiwan's claim of
sovereignty over the islands.</P>
      <P>"Without CGA's protection, the fate of this journey would have been uncertain, "
Huang said after returning to Rueifang, Taipei County Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Huang, a township councilman from Yonghe, Taipei County, said that he was
"deeply moved by the valiant protection of the CGA all the way."</P>
      <P>He said that since taking part in a "protecting the Tiaoyutais" campaign in
1996, he has continued similar activities for the past 12 years, although the
activists were suppressed by the previous Democratic Progressive Party
administration, making it impossible for them to approach the islands.</P>
      <P>This year, they had planned a trip to the Tiaoyutais in September after the
conclusion of the Beijing Olympics but decided to move up the trip after a June
10 incident in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat with three crew
members and 13 customers aboard sank some six nautical miles southwest of the
Tiaoyutais after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>"In September, there will be another sailing to the island group," he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said Monday's trip was his ninth visit to the vicinity of the Tiaoyutais,
and the "nearest to the island group in 12 years."</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwanese sport fishing boat he was in came within 0.4 nautical
miles of the main island of the Tiaoyutai archipelago but could not get any
closer due to hidden reefs and several small Japanese ships in its path.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the boat departed from Shenao, Rueifang, at 10: 30 p.m. Sunday.
Japanese patrol ships showed up on both sides of the ship when it entered within
40 nautical miles of the Tiaoyutais early Monday.</P>
      <P>When the Taiwanese ship was within 12 nautical miles of the island, the number
of Japanese patrol boats increased to around 10, including a 3,000-ton frigate,
and three helicopters also circled overhead in a bid to deter the ship from
advancing further.</P>
      <P>Japanese patrol boats repeatedly broadcast the message, "these are Japanese
territorial waters and you should leave, " and they even used water cannons and
belched black smoke to disturb the ship.</P>
      <P>Nine CGA ships rapidly came to the ship's aid whenever Japanese ships tried to
speed past it, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, have been
at the center of a territorial dispute among Japan, Taiwan and China over the
past decades.</P>

      <P>A 39-member Chinese delegation arrived in Taipei Monday to gain a better
understanding of Taiwan's tourism environment and opportunities one month before
an unprecedented number of Chinese tourists are expected to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of travel service professionals from 33 travel agencies
around China, was the first travel delegation to visit Taiwan after the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait signed agreements last Friday on the launch of direct
cross-strait charter flights on weekends and the expansion of Chinese tourist
arrivals beginning in July.</P>
      <P>"Our main mission is to check out Taiwan's tourism resources and facilities as
well as popular travel routes and relevant tour packages, " said Fan Guishan,
deputy secretary-general of the Association for Tourist Exchanges across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The group will also make extensive contacts with Taiwanese travel service
providers during its 11-day visit to forge relationships and exchange
information in preparation for organizing Chinese tour groups to Taiwan, Fan
said.</P>
      <P>The delegation visited the National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei -- home to
a large collection of ancient Chinese art treasures -- shortly after its
arrival. Starting Tuesday, the group will travel around Taiwan to see for
themselves Taiwan's tourist attractions.</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner in honor of the Chinese visitors, Tourism Bureau Director-
General Janice Seh-Jen Lai said travel agents on both sides have reached a
consensus that quality should take precedence over quantity in organizing
Chinese tour packages.</P>
      <P>Lai gave assurances that government authorities will get involved to ensure that
unscrupulous tour groups will be unable to sabotage the cross-strait tour market
order.</P>
      <P>According to agreements signed in Beijing last Friday by the two quasi-official
intermediary bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, Taiwanese and Chinese
carriers will jointly operate 36 charter flights from Friday through Monday
every week beginning July 4 and up to 3,000 ordinary Chinese citizens will be
allowed to visit Taiwan per day for sightseeing from July 18.</P>
      <P>Prior to the agreement, nonstop charters were only operated on special holidays
and only certain categories of Chinese citizens, including those living abroad,
were allowed to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee has decided to put
off a plan to visit the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea after
Japan softened its tough stance toward Taiwan, committee co-chair Lin Yu-fang
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin, from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), said the decision was made after he
received  separate  phone calls Monday night from a high-ranking  Presidential
Office official and KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, who expected the committee to
postpone the plan to give the Ministry of Foreign Affairs more time to negotiate
with Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin said he respects the opinions of Wu and the Presidential Office and agrees
that recent actions by Taiwan's government and private sectors have successfully
changed Japan's attitude.</P>
      <P>The committee originally was scheduled to make a fact-finding tour of the island
group under the escort of naval vessels Wednesday to "claim sovereignty and
protect the rights of Taiwan fishing boats."</P>
      <P>The plan was conceived following an incident that occurred June 10 in waters
near the Tiaoyutais in which a Taiwanese boat carrying recreational fishermen
sank after allegedly being rammed by a Japanese patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Boat owner Ho Hung-yi was only released three days after being detained by
Japanese authorities on the Japan-controlled island of Ishigaki.</P>
      <P>Over the weekend, Taiwan recalled its representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, to
protest Japanese authorities' claim that the accident resulted from a bungled
attempt by the Japanese patrol vessel to chase the Taiwanese boat away from
Japan's territorial waters and that the Taiwanese boat was partly to blame.</P>
      <P>The move prompted Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under
the Taipei Office of the Interchange Association -- the de-facto Japanese
embassy in Taipei -- to call on Ho at his home in Rueifang, Taipei County,
Sunday, and express regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over
the incident.</P>
      <P>While regarding Ito's expression as a goodwill gesture, ROC Minister of Foreign
Affairs Francisco H.L.  Ou urged Japanese authorities on Sunday to make a clear
apology.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue during an interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said the government hopes to deal with the
aftermath of the incident through diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Liu was reserved about the lawmakers' original plan to visit the Tiaoyutais
under the escort of naval vessels, saying the matter should be reconsidered with
discretion.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais, located 102 nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, are
claimed by Japan, Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Reforming Taiwan's economic structure is the only way to increase productivity
in both the manufacturing and service sectors, Chen Tain-jy, the chairman of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, said Tuesday at a two-day forum.</P>
      <P>"The so-called structural reforms will lead to the improvement of the countrys
competitiveness in every respect of the economy, including the manufacturing and
service sectors, " said Chen at the Taiwan Competitiveness Forum 2008, held to
discuss ways to improve Taiwan's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Addressing the forum as the keynote speaker, Chen identified the forum's topics,
including education, the financial sector, health care, labor market efficiency,
and institutional and tax reforms, as potential objects of the reforms.</P>
      <P>Referring to the future direction needed to upgrade the economy to a higher
level, Chen said the structural reforms are probably the only way for Taiwan to
boost its productivity, and eventually transform itself from a middle-income
into a high-income country.</P>
      <P>"The government aims to boost the country's per capita income to US$30,000
(NT$924,000) by 2016, " Chen said, citing the goal as a future indicator of the
reforms' success.</P>
      <P>He was referring to one of the three of President Ma Ying-jeou's major economic
goals, dubbed "633" -- which promise economic growth of 6 percent, per capita
income of US$30,000, and an unemployment rate of 3 percent or lower.</P>
      <P>Chen also suggested that Taiwan should learn from the successful experiences of
service-based, advanced countries such as the United States.</P>
      <P>"In the previous stages of Taiwan's economic development, it had focused on the
building of infrastructure that concentrated on highways, railroads, and
factories," the CEPD head said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the new government is looking for some kind of "portfolio" for this
administration to put forward in the next four years, and hoped the forum could
help suggest some options for the government.</P>
      <P>Taking place in Taipei June 16-17, the forum is being jointly held by the CEPD,
the American Institute in Taiwan, the American Chamber of Commerce, the Chung-
Hua Institution for Economic Research, and the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research.</P>
      <P>The celebrated speakers at the forum include Morris Chang, the chairman of
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Paul A. London, former deputy
undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Charles Kao, founder and
CEO of the Commonwealth Publishing Group.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Department of Health said Tuesday that 113 classes at elementary

      <P>The department said that a total of 192 serious enterovirus cases, including 187
EV71 infections, have been confirmed in Taiwan so far this year, with seven
fatalities.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, there have been four suspected enterovirus cases to date, with
one confirmed serious enterovirus case.</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-hsiang, commissioner of the health department, said that the summer
months are the peak season for enterovirus, with no new cases expected after
September or October when the weather begins to turn cold.</P>
      <P>He added that the number of new cases is expected to drop when the school summer
vacation begins and the amount of contact between young students declines.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City government cannot sit idly by, however, waiting for the summer
break to begin and must take active measures to prevent the spread of
enterovirus, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Taipei Department of Environmental Protection began

      <P>Taipei County health officials said Tuesday that the spread of enterovirus in
the county may be more serious than people have previously thought.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that since a new measure that requires schools to report
enterovirus cases was put into effect June 5, the number of the reported cases
had surged nearly fourfold to 379 last week, compared with no more than 100
cases weekly before.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks as the nation is gearing up its battle against
the enterovirus outbreak.</P>
      <P>The Enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of aseptic
meningitis and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with
compromised immune systems.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, 26 kindergartens, daycare centers and some first-grade and
second-grade classes in elementary schools have announced temporary suspensions
of classes in a bid to stem the spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Under the newly announced measure, schools that have withheld information on
enterovirus cases from health authorities will face fines of between NT$3,000
and NT$15,000 and their names will be published.</P>
      <P>Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control under the
Department of Health, said Monday that the enterovirus outbreak will peak this
week.</P>
      <P>Chou asked all elementary schools, kindergartens and day care centers to
rigorously follow the regulations on class suspensions to prevent the spread of
the potentially lethal virus.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center has already issued directives

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who is responsible for protecting the safety and rights
of Taiwan's people, should hold firm to his stance and develop a general
strategy to solve the dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands with Japan, former
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"It seems that President Ma's administration took a hard line at first but then
became humble later in handling the incident, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"I think this is the second time the feelings and dignity of Taiwan's people
have been harmed, " Hsieh said, with the first indignity the alleged sinking of
a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat that rekindled patriotic fervor over the
uninhabited islands.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks  after paying a visit to Taiwan's representative to Japan
Koh Se-kai, who is currently in Taipei after being recalled by the foreign
minister Sunday in protest over Japan's handling of the incident.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese boat carrying recreational fishermen sank June 10 after colliding
with a Japanese patrol vessel in disputed waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands, or
Senkaku Islands in Japanese.</P>
      <P>The captain of the Taiwanese vessel contends that the Japanese vessel
deliberately rammed into his boat, while an official Japanese report has said
both the Japanese and Taiwanese ships were negligent.</P>
      <P>Hsieh  contended  that  the  president,  as the  country's commander-in-chief
and top decision-maker, should shoulder the duty to protect the country's
sovereignty and its people's property and not try to sidestep the issue.</P>
      <P>"I hope that President Ma will carry out his duty and carefully make a
comprehensive and strategic decision on the issue. Also, people in Taiwan should
be a staunch prop for him, " the former premier said.</P>
      <P>He added that President Ma should not abandon individuals or government agencies
and make irrational speeches or take irrational actions over the dispute, as
they are "as dangerous as wildfire."</P>
      <P>The government should also be more discreet and should not rashly say things
like "we are ready for war if necessary, " as such words will make Taiwan look
foolish in the international community, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The June 10 incident has led to tensions in relations between Taiwan and Japan.
The 13 amateur fishermen on board the boat were rescued by the Japanese patrol
vessel and returned to Taiwan on June 11, while the crew members, including the
captain Ho Hung- yi, were detained by Japan before being returned to Taiwan
later last week.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association -- the de-facto Japanese embassy in the absence
of diplomatic relations -- called on Ho at his home in Taipei County Sunday and
expressed regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over the
incident.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, wants Japan to officially apologize for the accident,
compensate the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat for his losses, and
withdraw its charges against Ho for illegally poaching in Japanese territorial
waters.</P>
      <P>Japan's Okinawa Prosecutor's Office released an investigation report Saturday,
which stated that the captain of the patrol ship, Koshiki, of Japan's Maritime
Safety Agency, might have caused navigational hazards and damage through
negligence, while the captain of the Taiwanese fishing boat might have caused
navigational hazards through negligence.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai Islands, which are much closer to Taiwan than Japan, were seized
by Japan in 1895 when China ceded Taiwan to Japan in a so-called "unequal
treaty." China and Taiwan claim the islands should have been returned when Japan
lost the war in 1945. However, Japan continues to exert control over the
islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China and Japan all claim sovereignty of the island group.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met Japanese business strategist Kenichi Ohmae Tuesday at
the Presidential Office, hailing Ohmae's proposal over 10 years ago to build
Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific business operations hub as visionary and helpful.</P>
      <P>"Although the proposal put forward by Ohmae 15 years ago was never implemented
due to a variety of factors, the idea has remained valuable and attractive to
the incumbent government," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Ohmae raised the proposal to now Vice President Vincent Siew
when Siew served as the chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>"I myself served as minister of justice at that time, " Ma noted, adding that
Ohmae also served as a consultant to the Taiwan government regarding the
regional business operations hub program.</P>
      <P>Although the justice minister is not involved in economic affairs, Ma said he
strongly felt at the time that the concept of transforming Taiwan into a
regional business operations center would mark a significant step for Taiwan in
moving forward on the economic, political, cross-Taiwan Strait and international
relations fronts.</P>
      <P>The president vowed to quickly put the Asia-Pacific business operations hub
project back on track so as to allow Taiwan to use its strategic location
advantage to attract multinational investment.</P>
      <P>Ma cited Federal Express Corporation (FedEx) as a company that came to Taiwan a
decade ago because of the government's plan to develop the country into an
operations hub.</P>
      <P>The international courier planned to make Taiwan its regional operations
headquarters, setting up distribution centers at the country's two main
international airports in Taoyuan and Kaohsiung, Ma said, but it pulled out of
Kaohsiung last July after its revenue dropped by a third.</P>
      <P>The president also encouraged Ohmae to make fresh suggestions to Taiwan's
government and private enterprises at a time when the country is facing severe
challenges.</P>
      <P>Ohmae is a well-known Japanese business strategist famous for his introduction
of the "M-shaped society" theory to describe the widening wealth gap in the era

      <P>The Taiwan Foundation for Democracy on Tuesday celebrated its fifth anniversary,
with President Ma Ying-jeou expressing hope that with the foundation's future
efforts, Taiwan will be able to share more of its experiences in democracy with
other countries.</P>
      <P>The foundation was founded in 2003 with the aim of playing a positive role in
consolidating Taiwan's democracy and strengthening its commitment to human
rights, as well as becoming a strong part of the world's democratic network.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan's experiences in the 228 Incident in 1947, during the "White
Terror" period from 1949-1987, and in the Kaohsiung Incident in 1979 were
regrettable but precious. He said he hopes Taiwan will share these experiences
with other democracy-loving nations.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident was an anti-government uprising that was violently suppressed
by the then Kuomintang (KMT) government and resulted in many civilian deaths.
The "White Terror" period refers to the suppression of political dissidents and
public discussion of the 228 Incident from 1949-1987 when Taiwan was under
martial law. The Kaohsiung Incident involved pro-democracy demonstrations which
the KMT authorities responded to by arresting many opposition leaders.</P>
      <P>Ma further urged everyone in Taiwan "to be humble" amid Taiwan's achievements in
democracy, especially after the March 22 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"I am not saying that we are already a very mature democracy... what we should
do is to share our experiences in how we were able to conquer the difficulties
in achieving a full constitutional democracy and liberal democracy," Ma
stressed.</P>
      <P>He was addressing the anniversary celebration which was also attended by
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Foreign Minister Francisco H. L. Ou, and
domestic and international dignitaries.</P>
      <P>Ma went on to stress that "the march of democracy will leave communism on the
ash heap of history," citing the late U.S. president Ronald Reagan who was in
office from 1981-1989.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is also the chairman of the foundation, commended the establishment of
the foundation as an "important milestone in Taiwan's democratic progress," and
hoped the foundation will continue its devotion to deepening and strengthening
democracy of the nation.</P>
      <P>Wang also hoped that the foundation will seek the realization of democratic
ideas, help enhance democracy and human rights in Asia through Taiwan's
experiences, and actively connect Taiwan with international society.</P>
      <P>"In addition to expressing appreciation for Taiwan's achievements in democracy,
I hope that the international society will stand aside Taiwan to jointly make
efforts for better the future of human beings," Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reasserted Taiwan's sovereignty claim over the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands Tuesday in his first public statement since a diplomatic row
erupted with Japan after a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat collided with a
Japanese patrol vessel off the disputed island chain last week.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese captain claimed that his craft sank after being deliberately
rammed by a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel near the islets in the East China
Sea, while Japan contended that both the Taiwanese and Japanese captains were
responsible for the collision.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an informal meeting with local journalists marking his first month
in office, Ma also said he wants to resolve the current row with Japan
"peacefully".</P>
      <P>Ma actively participated in a "protect Tiaoyutais" campaign in the 1970s after
the United States turned over control of the island chain to Japan along with
the Okinawa islands in 1972. "My attitude toward the sovereignty issue has never
changed," he said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Tiaoyutais are the Republic of China's territory and a part
of Taiwan, Ma said the island chain is now under the jurisdication of Yilan
county's Toucheng township.</P>
      <P>On the current spat with Japan, Ma said all international disputes should be
resolved through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>"This is a fundamental principle in international engagements and enshrined in
the U.N. charter, " said Ma.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recalled its representative to Japan over the sinking of the "Lienho
" sport fishing boat. It has demanded Japan make an apology for the incident and
offer damages to the boat owner, Ho Hung-yi, who was detained by Japanese coast
guard authorities before being released last Friday.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited island group, known as Senkaku Islands in Japan, is located some
100 nautical miles northeast of Taiwan. Japan administers the islands, which are
also claimed by Taiwan and China. Its surrounding waters have been a traditional
fishing ground for Taiwanese fishermen.</P>

      <P>Growth in private consumption in Taiwan is expected to reach 2.39 percent for
this year, below the figure of 2.55 percent for 2007, Taiwan Research Institute
(TRI) Vice President Wu Tsai-yi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at a forum on the economic prospects of the world's major
economies in the second half of 2008, hosted by the TRI.</P>
      <P>According to the TRI, Taiwan's economy is forecast to grow by 4.68 percent for
2008.</P>
      <P>Wu said that over the past eight years, annual growth in private consumption in
Taiwan has lagged behind economic growth by over 1 percentage point, unlike the
1990s when private consumption growth was higher than economic growth.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan's economic growth over the past eight years has relied
heavily on exports, which are not expected to perform well this year.</P>
      <P>Wu further noted that with the thawing in cross-Taiwan Strait relations since
the March 22 presidential election in Taiwan, many uncertainties with respect to
private investment have been erased.</P>
      <P>This fact, coupled with the launch of weekend cross-strait charter flights and
the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists in July, which are expected to give a
boost to Taiwan's service sector, could help increase  private consumption  as
well as consumer confidence, he added.</P>
      <P>However, because of rising consumer prices, which the TRI forecasts will
increase by 3.51 percent for 2008, real incomes in Taiwan are expected to drop
again for this year, leading to reduced spending power among low- and middle-
income earners as well as a drop in consumer confidence, he said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan branch of a Swiss-based pharmaceutical manufacturer unveiled Tuesday
the company's plan to carry out in Taiwan the third phase of clinical trials for
a vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B -- one of the causative
agents of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis.</P>
      <P>Officials at Novartis Taiwan said they hope the program will contribute to the
prevention of the potentially fatal disease.</P>
      <P>Novartis became the world's fifth largest vaccine manufacturer after it acquired
Chiron Corp. in 2005.</P>
      <P>Among all subtypes of N. meningitidis, serogroup B is the most prevalent in
Taiwan and the only one for which a vaccine is not available worldwide.</P>
      <P>Between  2000  and 2005,  the fatality  rate  of epidemic cerebrospinal
meningitis registered 18.29 percent in Taiwan. In the latest outbreak, six
students in a high school in Taipei County were reported to have contracted the
disease early this month.</P>
      <P>According to a World Health Organization fact sheet, four serogroups of N.
meningitidis -- A, B, C and W135 -- are recognized to cause epidemics.</P>
      <P>The bacteria are transmitted from person to person through droplets of
respiratory or throat secretions, with the incubation period ranging between two
and 10 days.</P>
      <P>The most common symptoms of the disease are stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity
to light, confusion, headaches and vomiting. Even when the disease is diagnosed
early and adequate therapy instituted, 5-10 percent of patients die, typically
within 24-48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</P>
      <P>Bacterial meningitis may result in brain damage, hearing loss or learning
disability in 10-20 percent of survivors.</P>

      <P>In efforts to help villages across Taiwan boost their earnings, a bureau under
the Council of Agriculture (COA) urged the public Tuesday to visit some 123
villages that it has selected as part of its village renewal campaign.</P>
      <P>The villages have been transformed to not only grow agricultural products, but
lure tourists by offering tourists attractions such as restaurants, scenic
areas, shops and DIY activities.</P>
      <P>In addition to its traditional business, officials said, the COA's Soil and
Water Conservation Bureau has devoted part of its energy in recent years to
rebuilding and transforming the villages in hopes of promoting farm tours.</P>
      <P>To effectively court the public to tour the selected villages, the bureau has
prepared 250,000 "Let's Go" tour passports which will be given away from June 19
at 1,500 locations across the country, including convenience stores, chain
coffee shops and bookstores, to people who want to tour these villages, the
officials.</P>
      <P>Members of the public who visit at least 10 of the villages, with a stamp on
their "passports" to prove they have been there, are eligible to take part in
three lucky draws which will reward participants with prizes, such as bikes, Wii
game machines and computers.</P>
      <P>The village tour campaign will last through October, according to the officials.</P>

      <P>Japan's central government  should immediately apologize for an incident in
which one of its patrol vessels rammed a Taiwanese fishing boat and for the
inhumane act of not immediately going to the rescue of the Taiwanese on board
when the boat sank, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At an international news conference, Chou, along with the 16 people who were
aboard the Taiwanese fishing boat, showed video footage and photographs that
they said would reveal the truth of the accident.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat sank early in the morning June 10 after colliding with
a Japanese patrol vessel in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, which
are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>The Maritime Safety Agency of Japan accused the Taiwanese fishing boat, Lian He,
of "weaving about on the sea" and said that the patrol vessel accidentally
bumped into the boat because the Lian He "abruptly turned to starboard."</P>
      <P>The 13 amateur fishermen on board the fishing boat were rescued by the Japanese
patrol vessel and they returned to Taiwan on June 11, while the crew members,
including the captain Ho Hung-yi, were detained by Japan authorities and they
returned to Taiwan later last week.</P>
      <P>"All the footage, radar graphics and photos shown here prove that the Japanese
lied several times to cover their unacceptable and immoral behavior," Chou said
sternly.</P>
      <P>"We ask the Japanese issue an apology at the central government level. Also,
Japan must immediately provide compensation for all the losses incurred,
including the loss of the fishing boat and fishing equipment and the
psychological distress of the people aboard the Lian He," he added.</P>
      <P>The crew members said the video footage and photographs serve as hard evidence
that the Japanese patrol vessel had rammed the Lian He on purpose, as the
100-ton patrol vessel could not have reversed as quickly as it did after hitting
the 27-ton fishing boat if the collision was not deliberate.</P>
      <P>Also, they said, the Japanese vessel did not move to rescue them immediately
after they were forced to abandon the fishing boat.</P>
      <P>"The Japanese patrol vessel dispatched a small boat to check on the sinking Lian
He, leaving us floating in a dinghy," said crew member Yang Kun-feng. "They only
came back for us about an hour later after we called out for help."</P>
      <P>Describing such actions as "cruel and immoral," Chou said Japan is more than
welcome to challenge the evidence provided, but he added that the patrol vessel
had clearly violated the International Law of the Sea.</P>
      <P>Noting that he was just doing what a local government should do to protect its
residents' rights and property, Chou urged Taiwan's central government to take a
strong stance on the incident and to put the greatest possible pressure on its
Japanese counterpart. He also called on Taiwan's international friends to
penalize Japan for what he called its violation of human rights.</P>
      <P>"Japan, you ought to be ashamed. One should apologize for one's wrongdoing,"
Chou said at the press conference, which was held under the heading, "Telling
the world about Japanese aggression: the truth about the fishing boat collision.</P>
      <P>Since the incident occurred June 10, relations between Taiwan and Japan have
been tense. Japanese authorities have expressed regret over the incident, while
Taiwan has been demanding a formal apology and compensation. Taiwan recalled its
representative to Japan last Saturday in protest over Tokyo's handling of the
incident.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai Islands, or Senkaku Islands in Japanese, are geographically closer
to Taiwan than to Japan. The island group was seized by Japan in 1895 when China
ceded Taiwan to Japan in a so-called "unequal treaty." China and Taiwan claim
the islands should have been returned when Japan lost the war in 1945. However,
Japan continues to exert control over the group of islands.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday that Japan has promised to
compensate a fishing boat captain for losses he sustained when his vessel was
sunk in a collision with a Japanese patrol boat last week.</P>
      <P>Wang made the statement after meeting with Tadashi Ikeda, head of the Taipei
Office of the Interchange Association of Japan, which represents Japanese
interests in Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Ikeda clearly said that captains of both ships were
responsible for the collision, although the captain of the Japanese patrol boat
should bear the greater responsibility.</P>
      <P>Ikeda promised that "there will be no problem of compensation, " according to
Wang.</P>
      <P>Ikeda said that a pro-Taiwan Japanese parliamentary group -- Japan-ROC
Parliamentarian Council -- has asked him to solicit Wang's assistance over the
incident, which has strained relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The meeting came after Ikeda met with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou over the matter.</P>
      <P>Although Ikeda said the Japanese side had expressed its "regret" over the
incident, that was not enough, Wang said, adding that "regret is not the same as
an apology."</P>
      <P>"If Japan only expresses regret, Taiwan cannot feel (Japan's) total and genuine
sincerity," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Ikeda promised that he would convey the view to Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Wang also asked that Japan restart fishery negotiations with Taiwan soon and
study the reasonable use of maritime resources.</P>
      <P>The June 10 boat collision  incident  has sparked renewed controversy over the
sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, which are
claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, although Taiwan believes that the island group is historically,
geographically and judicially connected to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan has currently put the uninhabited Tiaoyutais under the jurisdiction of
Ishigawa, Okinawa, while in Taiwan, they fall under the jurisdiction of Yilan
County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>Both sides held the 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
persistent disputes, and both sides agreed to held the next round of talks in
March 2006, but the talks never took place.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou has promised to help the owner of
a sunken ship seek compensation from Japan for his losses through political
channels because legal channels could take a long time, Legislator Lee Ching-hua
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee was accompanied at the meeting with Ou by Ho Hung-yi, the owner and captain
of a boat that collided with a Japanese patrol vessel and then sunk in waters
near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea June 10.</P>
      <P>The collision  has strained the usually friendly bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Japan by rekindling the two sides' dispute over sovereignty of the
islands, which are called the Senkakus in Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan recalled its representative to Japan to demonstrate its dissatisfaction
over Japan's handling of the incident, including detaining Ho for three days for
questioning and concluding in an official report that the captains of the two
ships that collided were both negligent.</P>
      <P>After returning home last Friday, Ho accused the Japanese ship of deliberately
ramming his boat to cause it to sink and demanded compensation from Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has asked Japan to pay compensation and apologize for its
coast guard frigate's "unreasonable" conduct that led to the collision.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association -- the Japanese office in Taipei -- called on Ho
at his home in Taipei County Sunday.</P>
      <P>He expressed regret on behalf of the Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over the
incident and the willingness to handle the matter of compensation based on
relevant laws.</P>
      <P>However, Ito's expression of "regret" was not considered to be the "apology"
Taiwan has demanded, and according to Lee, Ou said he would "make the effort" to
gain a formal apology.</P>
      <P>Lee said that during the meeting, Ho expressed concern that he could be
prosecuted in Japan for causing navigational hazards through negligence, after
an official Japanese investigation report said the captains of both the Japanese
coast guard patrol vessel Koshiki and the Taiwanese fishing boat might have been
negligent.</P>
      <P>Ho hoped he would not be indicted and wanted Ou's promise to negotiate the
matter diligently, Lee told reporters who were not able to witness the close-
door meeting.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said at a news conference  Tuesday  that he will approve
the resignation  of Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai, who offered to resign a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>Ma said he made the decision after exchanging views with Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
and Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou.</P>
      <P>Koh tendered his resignation over a name-calling humiliation by ruling
Kuomintang Legislator Lee Chia-chin, who called Koh a traitor for holding
Japanese permanent residency and speaking favorably for Japan in dealing with
the aftermath of a boat collision involving a Taiwanese and a Japanese vessel
near the disputed Tiaoyutai islands earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Koh was recalled from Japan by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last weekend and
was supposed to have delivered a report on the issue to the Legislative Yuan
Monday. However, he refused to do so due to his humiliation, and tendered his
resignation.</P>
      <P>Ma said Koh has contributed much to Taiwan-Japan relations and that it is a pity
Koh will leave his post when the boat collision has not been fully settled.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he regretted that Koh refused to report to the Legislative Yuan,
noting that Koh had an obligation to make his report despite the humiliation.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank June 10 after colliding with a
Japanese patrol vessel near the group of islands in the East China Sea. The 13
amateur anglers aboard the boat were rescued by the Japanese and returned to
Taiwan June 11, while three crew members, including captain Ho Hung-yi, were
detained by the Japanese authorities before being returned to Taiwan late last
week.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Japan have been tense since the incident, which has
sparked renewed debate on the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais, which are claimed
by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Koichi Ito, director of the General Affairs Department under the Taipei Office
of the Interchange Association --  the Japanese representative office in Taipei
-- called on Ho in Taipei County Sunday and expressed regret on behalf of the
Maritime Safety Agency of Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Koh said in Taipei that same day that Japan's expression of regret over the
collision can be regarded as an apology. However, Koh's interpretation did not
satisfy some KMT legislators, who criticised Koh for speaking favorably for
Japan at the time when he was supposed to be protecting Taiwan's national
interests.</P>
      <P>Koh said in his resignation statement Monday that he had done his best in
negotiating with Japan over the incident and had made progress, as Japan had
already released those detained, apologized, and expressed willingness to pay
compensation.</P>
      <P>He also defended his permanent residency, saying that it was acquired under
special circumstances more than three decades ago when his passport expired and
the then-KMT administration refused to extend it as he was a blacklisted pro-
independence advocate.</P>

teenagers, with as many as 75 percent of students using the Internet as a way to
relieve stress, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday by the
King Car Education Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation urged parents to pay more attention to the leisure activities
that their children engage in during the upcoming summer vacation and make sure
their children do not indulge themselves excessively in the cyber world.</P>
      <P>Of the 2,606 students from 18 elementary, junior high and senior high schools
who took part in the survey, 20.6 percent of them spend more than four hours per
day on the computer on weekdays, with the percentage rising to 47.24 percent on
weekends.</P>
      <P>On average, the time spent by the respondents on the computer is 2.54 hours on
weekdays and 4.6 hours on weekends.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 67 percent of respondents will feel bad or uneasy if their
Internet connection is interrupted, 47.8 percent always stay online longer than
expected, 29.6 percent will try to calm their emotions by going online, and 24.7
percent will use the Internet whenever they encounter problems.</P>
      <P>The most common purposes mentioned by the respondents for Internet use are
playing cyber games,  chatting with friends, downloading video or audio files,

      <P>Heads of private companies, government agencies and schools are liable for fines
of NT$10,000 (US$3,290) if the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PSH) act is not
implemented thoroughly within their organizations, officials of Taipei City's
Department of Social Welfare (DSW) warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that cases of sexual harassment have dropped since the introduction of
the PSH in 2006 and that more people are aware of the problem of sexual
harassment, Chang Mei-mei, director of the DSW's division of welfare services
for women and child care centers, expressed hope that not only individuals but
also employers will be concerned about the matter.</P>
      <P>"Punishing employers is not our main purpose in implementing the act... what we
would like to do is encourage everyone to observe the PSH," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In order to prevent sexual harassment in the work place, Chang further urged all
employers to pay closer attention to every reported case of unwelcome sexual
advances through investigation, while respecting the privacy of the victims.</P>
      <P>"The DSW will also provide its staff with more professional training courses and
will promote the concept of the PSH through publications and a Web site," Chang
went on, encouraging employers to ask for a CD designed to educate employers on
the prevention of sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Noting that sexual harassment can be defined in a number of ways depending on
the feelings of the individuals concerned, Luo Tsun-yin, director of the Center
for Gender Equity Education at Shih Hsin University, suggested that people who
unintentionally touch someone else should apologize immediately.</P>
      <P>"Interpersonal politeness is very important, " Luo said, adding that "bystanders
witnessing harassment should offer help to the victim."</P>
      <P>Yao Shu-wen, executive director of the Modern Women's Foundation, also urged the
public to be aware of such cases, not only in crowded places but also in quiet
areas.</P>
      <P>Services such as medical consultations, beauty treatments and massage can also
lead to sexual harassment, Yao added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to show the government's determination to counter sexual
harassment, Lu Tien-hsi, director of the Department of Detectives (DOD) under
the Taipei City Police Department Rapid Transit Division, said the DOD will
reinforce patrols to better ensure passengers' safety.</P>
      <P>He also urged passengers who encounter sexual harassment in any rapid transit
stations or trains to keep calm, remember the features of the attacker and

      <P>It is unnecessary for a semi-official Japanese organization to call for Japanese
residing in Taiwan to "exercise caution" in the wake of a diplomatic row between
the two nations over a boat collision in waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands in the East China Sea, an Executive Yuan spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, minister of the Government Information Office, said Japan
is quite within its rights to adopt measures to protect its nationals residing
in Taiwan, but added that "from the point of view of our government, the
Japanese side is worrying too much."</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people are both friendly and rational. The nation is also ruled by law
and one individual incident will not trigger a massive anti-Japanese sentiment,"
she continued.</P>
      <P>She was referring to a report by NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, that quoted
the Interchange Association of Japan, which represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties, to call for Japanese people residing
in Taiwan to refrain from taking part in political gatherings and discussing
political issues in public after the June 10 incident in which a Taiwanese
recreational fishing boat sank after colliding with a Japanese coast guard
patrol boat.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association also urged Japanese students in Taiwan to only go
out in groups.</P>
      <P>The NHK reports said that Taiwan always tilts toward Japan and that the
Interchange Association's call for Japanese "to exercise caution in their words
and deeds" for fear of possible anti-Japanese sentiment was unusual.</P>

      <P>The enterovirus epidemic situation in Taiwan seems to have reached its peak last
week, but cases could still increase in northern Taiwan, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, the deadly virus has caused 203 cases of serious illness
and seven deaths in Taiwan to date, setting a record since 1998, when the
epidemic took 78 lives.</P>
      <P>"While the epidemic situation seems to be mitigated in southern Taiwan, cases
may increase in the north," said Chou Chih-hao, CDC deputy director, noting that
five serious cases were registered last week in northern Taiwan, including one
in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Among the 203 cases, 118 occurred in southern Taiwan, 56 in central Taiwan, and
27 in the north.</P>
      <P>Chou added that so far, 90 percent of the patients of the serious cases are
children under five years of age.</P>
      <P>Even though the situation in the southern region seems to have eased, Chou said
that the epidemic is still at its peak and people should take precautionary
measures.</P>
      <P>Besides washing their hands, Chou said that people can use bleach diluted 100
times as a disinfectant to clean their home environment.</P>
      <P>In China, 191,180 cases of enterovirus have been registered as of June 1, with
74 deaths.</P>
      <P>Asked if the coming of more Chinese tourists to Taiwan beginning next month will
affect Taiwan's epidemic situation, Chou said that the CDC has ordered airlines
and tour guides to pay close attention to the health of tourists upon arrival
and during their stay.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China recently agreed to increase the number of tourists
allowed to enter Taiwan to 3,000 a day, up from approximately 1,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President to take back seat under dual-head system</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that he will abide by the dual-head
government system as stipulated in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The president told reporters at the Presidential Office that under the dual-head
government system, the Executive Yuan is responsible to the Legislative Yuan for
day-to-day business, while the president takes a back seat.</P>
      <P>On the president's relationship with the Executive Yuan, Ma said a president
delivers his campaign platforms through the Executive Yuan and also learns about
and monitors the affairs of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"This is not to say that a president will keep out of the business of the
Executive Yuan, but rather that a president must not call the shots from the
Presidential office," Ma added.</P>
      <P>He said the premier and the Cabinet will be given a free hand to demonstrate
their ability to administer, adding that "this signals a departure from past
practice and some may not get used to it."</P>
      <P>Ma said that when he assumed the presidency May 20, he vowed to abide by the
Constitution, a pledge he did not treat lightly.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that during the ruling process, the people will "learn,
respect and carry out those things stipulated in the Constitution."</P>
      <P>Nearly one month into his term, Ma said he has so far had to receive foreign
dignitaries,  decide nomination lists for such independent agencies as the
Control Yuan, which he will submit to the Legislative Yuan for approval June 23,
and familiarize himself with the national security system.</P>
      <P>This, he said, is why he cannot make grassroots visits every week as he did
during his presidential campaign, adding that "it is both impossible and
unnecessary" to make such visits.</P>
      <P>Ma made his first grassroots visit Sunday since assuming the presidency to meet
with farmers and fishermen in Yunlin and Chiayi counties in southern Taiwan to
learn about their losses after days of torrential rain. Some legislators had
called on the president to make the visit earlier to show concern for the
people.</P>

      <P>The City of San Diego, California, has designated June 16 as Taiwan Biotech
Forum Day to highlight the increasingly close biotechnology exchanges and
cooperation between Taiwan and the United States, a Taiwanese executive said
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Ping-wu, spokesman of Taiwan's Development Center of
Biotechnology (DCB), who accompanied a Taiwanese delegation to attend a
biotechnology seminar in San Diego Monday, U.S. Congressman Bob Filner made the
announcement to mark the growing technological ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The  seminar,  titled  "Taiwan  Your  Ideal  Partner  in Asia-International
Partnership with Taiwan biotechnology,  " is sponsored by several Taiwanese
organizations, including the DCB, the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI), Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), and Taiwan-America
Biotech Association (TABA).</P>
      <P>The event attracted some 150 representatives of American and Taiwan enterprises
to discuss Taiwan's advantages in biotechnology and methods to strengthen
Taiwan's biotech exchanges around the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to the seminar, the Taiwan delegation will also participate in the
2008 Bio International Convention, the largest global event for biotechnology,
to be held in San Diego from June 17-20, which is expected to attract the
participation of some 20,000 biotechnology experts from 70 countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)  encouraged  people Tuesday to
recycle glass containers, especially at this time of year when the weather is
warm and the consumption of beer usually increases.</P>
      <P>While the rate of recycling of glass in Taiwan has been on the rise, it still
remains disproportionate to the volume of glass containers being used, official
figures show.</P>
      <P>Some 230,000 tons of glass containers were used last year, while 190,000 tons
were recycled, said Lin Chien-hui, executive director of the Recycling Fund
Management Board under the EPA, at a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This means that the recycling rate of glass containers in 2007 was only 84
percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Glass is a material that is almost 100 percent reusable for various purposes,"
said Lin, pointing out that recycled glass can be used to make super-hard bricks
and tiles and art materials, or mixed into bitumen to pave roads.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, about 2.5 km of roads in Taipei are paved with bitumen mixed
with glass, including Fuxing South Road, which glitters under the headlamps of
vehicles.</P>
      <P>In addition to glass containers such as bottles, computer monitors and light
bulbs are also recyclable, and can be left at convenience stores or taken to the
garbage trucks, Lin said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Restrictions on travel via 'mini links' to be lifted June 19</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday that his Cabinet will announce June 19 a
full opening of the links for travel by sea to China via Kinmen and Matsu, with
immediate effect.</P>
      <P>The premier said that since direct cross-strait transportation links, commonly
known as the "mini links," were launched in 2001 between Taiwan's Kinmen and
Matsu islands and China's Fujian province, they have been expanded to include
businessmen operating in China and their dependents, veterans, and mainland
spouses of Taiwanese nationals.</P>
      <P>Cultural, industrial and religious groups are also permitted to use the direct
cross-strait sea route if they apply to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
which is responsible for charting the nation's China policy, on a case-by-case
basis.</P>
      <P>When the links were first opened they were limited to residents of Kinmen and
Matsu only.</P>
      <P>However, when the new measure is put in place on June 19, all Taiwan nationals
will be allowed to take the ferry service that plies the Taiwan Strait, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that after the full expansion of the mini
links, Taiwan travelers to China will have more choices than just the current
Hong Kong or Macau transit route.</P>
      <P>They will have the option of taking the weekend direct charter flights that are
scheduled to be launched July 4, "or they can take the ferries shuttling between
Kinmen and Matsu and Fujian province, under the direct cross-strait
transportation links," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao Erh-chung of the ruling Kuomintang mentioned the government's
plan to issue landing visas to people from Hong Kong and China, and asked if it
could first be put in place in Kinmen and Matsu on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>Lai responded that the matter will require further consideration, as it involves
cross-strait negotiations and as China currently places many restrictions on its
nationals visiting Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over 80% of MIS staff considering job-change: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite a healthy balance of supply and demand in the job market for management
information system (MIS) operators, the heavy challenges of the work has led
85.3 percent of these engineers to consider changing jobs, according to the
results of a recent poll released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A subset of the overall internal controls of a business covering the application
of people, documents, technologies and procedures to deal with business problems
and decision making, MIS is regarded as the key for modern enterprises to
organize their computer-based systems and explore business opportunities.</P>
      <P>"Forty-two percent of the respondents said the most challenging part of the work
is an overloading of general affairs," said Simon Juan, general manager of 104
Job Bank.</P>
      <P>Announcing the results of the poll, conducted April 17-23 among 693 MIS
engineers, Juan said too much of their time is spent dealing with general
affairs, including administrative work and paperwork.</P>
      <P>"This issue keeps MIS staff from concentrating on two of their core tasks --
streamlining the operation of MIS and company Web site management, " Juan said,
adding that these two tasks are the key performances most companies use to
evaluate MIS staff.</P>
      <P>Juan said this conflict leads to other work challenges, as 35.9 percent of
respondents said their work quality cannot be fairly assessed by their
supervisors.</P>
      <P>"The job bank suggested that these engineers discuss with their supervisors the
idea of establishing a new set of standards to better evaluate their work," Juan
said.</P>
      <P>Despite those negative aspects, he went on, the 85.3 percent of the respondents
who said they want to leave their MIS positions should think carefully before
making the move.</P>
      <P>"The local MIS job market at present holds a perfect balance of supply and
demand, as there is one job vacancy for every job seeker," said Juan.</P>
      <P>Citing MIS specialists as the vanguards in the information age, he said a rising
number of companies are creating their own Internet applications to advance
their online marketing.</P>
      <P>"For instance, MIS workers have plenty of opportunities as freelance contractors
to the outsourcing of software construction from other companies, due to the
high demand of online system upgrading," Juan noted.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted with a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of
error of 3.7 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nearly 100-year-old Alishan Forest Railway, which runs between Chiayi City
and a scenic mountain resort area in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan, will have a
new operator Thursday -- a local construction company -- despite strong protests
from local residents.</P>
      <P>The Forest Bureau will transfer the right to operate the railway to the Hungtu
Construction Co., which won a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project that was
passed in 2006 to privatize the management of the railway for the next 30 years,
officials at the Chiayi Forest District Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Unlike the national rail system administered by the Taiwan Railway
Administration, the Alishan narrow-gauge railway is managed by the Forestry
Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and takes passengers to
the Alishan forest recreation area known for its cherry blossoms and ancient
trees, some of which are reputedly thousands of years old.</P>
      <P>The officials said the protests will have no effect on the privatization, which
will be completed June 19 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT project, worth NT$1.7 billion (US$56 million) , Hungtu is
contracted to operate the railway, including the stations along the route. It
also won the contract to build a five-star hotel on 2.2 hectares of state-owned
land near Jhaoping Station, the last stop of the Alishan line, which is the main
line of the network.</P>
      <P>The private company has also the right to develop 0.9 hectares of land
surrounding Peimen Station in Chiayi City, for the construction of another
hotel.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a group of Alishan residents and members of the Alishan
Community Development Association staged a protest against the transfer at
Alishan Station.</P>
      <P>The protesters accused the Forest Bureau of carrying out the BOT project before
an environmental impact evaluation has been passed.</P>
      <P>They also questioned how a local contractor has the skill to steer, repair and
maintain trains on the railway.</P>
      <P>The protesters claimed that only nine of the many experienced drivers of the
special forest trains have been hired by Hungtu, and that other young drivers
hired by the company are unqualified for the job.</P>
      <P>The residents accused the bureau of ignoring passenger safety, for "giving
profits to a big business" and for trying to get rid of a money-losing business
that generates just NT$100 million in revenues annually but costs NT$300 million
a year to operate.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Forest Railway is an 86 km narrow gauge railway network running up
to and throughout the popular mountain resort of Alishan. It was originally
constructed by the Japanese colonial government in 1912 to facilitate the
logging of cypress and other lumber, but today the line caters mostly to
tourists.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 17 people were killed and 156 injured when a train derailed near
Alishan Station.</P>
      <P>The area attracts nearly 900,000 local and foreign visitors every year.</P>

      <P>The government should focus on the development of clinical trials as a means of
boosting the healthcare industry, as Taiwan has great potential in this regard,
a panel of experts at a two-day forum in Taipei suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Competitiveness Forum 2008 brought together officials, academics,
non-governmental organizations, and business experts from Taiwan and abroad to
discuss ways of improving Taiwan's competitiveness. The discussions were closed
to the media.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's healthcare sector, though still young, has shown potential in the area
of clinical trials, which the government should prioritize," said Wang Li-shin,
the managing director of Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Taiwan as he disclosed
some of the suggestions made during the forum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has several advantages, such as its quality medical doctors, researchers
and health management systems, that would allow for the development of excellent
clinical trials," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Clinical trials are usually conducted to collect data on the safety and efficacy
of new medicines or devices, with an aim of developing better medical cures and
products.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's medical research labs could "bring in considerable
business opportunities by offering the results of clinical trials to help
international medical institutions explore the global healthcare and
pharmaceutical market."</P>
      <P>The experts at the forum urged the government and private medical institutions
to invest more in the research and development of advanced medical technologies
and devices, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The top seven medical and pharmaceutical companies in the United States
together invested a sum of US$36.3 billion (NT$1.1 trillion) in R&amp;D in
2007," he noted.</P>
      <P>The forum also suggested that the government develop preventive medicine, which
could help save government medical spending, he said.</P>
      <P>"It costs much less to prevent fatal diseases such as cancer than to cure them,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The forum is being held jointly by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, the American Institute in Taiwan, the American Chamber of Commerce,
the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, and the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, from June 16-17.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan asked Taiwanese fishermen Tuesday to temporarily stop
operating in disputed waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands amid ripples from a
collision in the area last week between a Taiwanese sport fishing boat and a
Japanese marine defense frigate.</P>
      <P>"The government is doing its utmost to negotiate with Japan over Taiwan's
fishing rights in the waters near the Tiaoyutai Islands through diplomatic
channels," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"At this delicate time of political negotiations, the government hopes Taiwanese
fishermen will not operate in the disputed waters so that calm can be maintained
in the area and the government can be allowed to handle the issue through two-
way fisheries negotiations, " Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, "war would be considered as a last resort if all other
feasible  efforts  and methods have been exhausted."</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks while fielding questions from opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Wang Hsing-nan in a legislative session over
the Tiaoyutai incident. Wang asked the premier to clarify his earlier remarks
about "resorting to war if it were necessary to settle the issue."</P>
      <P>The premier also promised Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Chiang Lien-fu that he would
assess his proposal that coastal patrol vessels be dispatched to help protect
the delivery of letters to the uninhabited Tiaoyutai islands if his "one man,
one letter" campaign succeeds in collecting at least 10,000 letters to the
islands from the public.</P>
      <P>Chiang asked the premier to order the Coast Guard Administration to send vessels
to help the postal authorities deliver the letters to the Tiaoyutai Islands,
which have been given the area code 290 by Taiwan, as part of the government's
efforts to highlight Taiwan's sovereignty claims over the islands through
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese sports fishing ship was hit last Tuesday by a Japanese marine
defense frigate in waters near the uninhabited Tiaoyutai Islands, causing the
Taiwanese ship to sink.</P>
      <P>Ho Hung-yi, the skipper of the Taiwanese boat, was detained by the Japanese
authorities for three days and has been sued on charges of negligence, while he
has demanded that Japan apologize and compensate him for his losses.</P>
      <P>As Japan has not issued a formal apology, the incident has sparked anger in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The waters  around  the Tiaoyutais,  some 100 miles  from northeastern Taiwan,
have for centuries been a traditional fishing ground of Taiwanese fishermen and
the Republic of China considers them to be under the jurisdiction of the Yilan
county government.</P>
      <P>However, the United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned
Okinawa to Tokyo in 1972, although Taiwan believes that the island group belongs
to Taiwan from judicial, historical and geographic perspectives.</P>
      <P>Japan controls the uninhabited islands, known as the Senkaku islands in
Japanese, under the jurisdiction of Ishigawa, part of Okinawa Prefecture, while
China also claims sovereignty over the island group.</P>

Province of Quebec, Canada.</P>
      <P>The decision took effect from June 2, 2008, according to a MOFA press release.</P>
      <P>"This represents the first instance in which Taiwan and Canada will recognize

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou told local reporters at the Presidential Office Tuesday
that he has been quite satisfied with the performance of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan
in the weeks since he assumed his post May 20.</P>
      <P>Many thorny problems happened soon after Liu took over, including hikes in oil
and electricity prices, the possession of residency rights of other countries by
several Cabinet members, and the recent dispute over a collision between
Taiwanese and Japanese vessels in waters near the disputed Tiaoyutai islands.</P>
      <P>"For a person who had left the administrative branch for eight years, I am quite
satisfied with his performance in the first month," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma mentioned several issues Liu has handled extraordinarily well, including the
rapidly growing ties between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with weekend
cross-strait direct charter flights and the opening of Taiwan to Chinese
tourists to be implemented in July as scheduled.</P>
      <P>"The issues have been the expectations of many people for many years, and now
the new Cabinet has accomplished them within one month, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>He also defended the Cabinet's handling of Tiaoyutai incident, in which a
Japanese patrol ship and a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat collided in
waters near the Tiaoyutai islands, located 102 nautical miles northeast of
Taiwan, whose sovereignty is claimed by Japan, Taiwan and China. The Taiwanese
boat sank, and its captain and two crew members were detained by the Japanese
government for several days.</P>
      <P>Through the government's efforts, the Japanese government has shown its goodwill
by releasing the captain and the crew members and promising to compensate them
for their losses, Ma went on.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) also showed its
responsibility by sending several ships to escort a group of activists who
sailed around the islands after the incident to underscore country's sovereignty
over the islands, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Now the only problem is whether the Japanese government will offer a clear
apology to the Taiwanese fishermen, Ma said, adding that the Cabinet is still
negotiating with the Japanese government on this point.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), Taiwan's top aviation regulator, has
temporarily suspended the debt-ridden Far Eastern Air Transport's international
flight rights, CAA Director-General Billy Chang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the CAA made the decision because the airline failed to make
operational improvements before a June 15 deadline.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Civil Aviation Law stipulates that the airline can apply for a
resumption of its international flights within six months after it seasing to
offer them and if it does not do so, the CAA will revoke its business license
and flight rights.</P>
      <P>The carrier's spokesman, Lee You-te, told CNA that the carrier respects the
CAA's decision.</P>
      <P>With debts reported at more than NT$10 billion (US$330 million) , the airline
publicly announced bankruptcy and stopped all flights May 13 after a chain of
financial crises that began earlier this year.</P>
      <P>More than 600 of the airline's employees took to the streets June 10 to demand
that the government help save the debt-ridden company from its financial crisis
and protect the employees' work rights.</P>
      <P>The protests came after the CAA decided to officially suspend the carrier's
right to operate domestic flights, as the airline had failed to resolve its
problems by a June 2 deadline.</P>
      <P>The CAA postponed the time for suspending the carrier's international flight
rights because it said it would receive an injection of capital by June 15, but
this capital did not materialize.</P>
      <P>The CAA said the improvements that the airline has to make include paying nearly
two months of back wages owed to its more-than 1,000 employees, raising

    <HEADLINE>Japan should engage in fishery talks with Taiwan: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/08  23:23:39
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on Japan to engage in talks with Taiwan over
fishery issues and even sovereignty over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, saying
that the issues cannot be put aside indefinitely and that "the situation must
change."</P>
      <P>If the situation continues as in the past, incidents like the boat collision in
which a Taiwanese boat sank after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol
boat June 10 in waters off that disputed islands  will "occur  repeatedly"  and
"undermine  Taiwan-Japan relations," he said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during an informal gathering with local
journalists when he made his first public comment over the incident.</P>
      <P>Ma said the incident was triggered by a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat that
entered the 12-mile limit around the disputed island chain, which is claimed by
Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>"The Tiaoyutai Islands are the territory of the Republic of China, and it is
natural for its fishing boats to enter, " the president said, adding that "we
should protest if other countries interfere."</P>
      <P>Responding to Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's call for calm in dealing
with the incident, Ma said that he supports such an approach.</P>
      <P>He said his statement, issued two days after the incident, was a "calm and
rational" one in which he reaffirmed ROC sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais and
made clear that his determination to safeguard the island chain has never and
will never change.</P>
      <P>He also asked the Japanese side to compensate the captain of the Taiwanese boat
for his losses and said the Coast Guard Administration should upgrade its
equipment.</P>
      <P>He said bilateral disputes should be resolved in a "peaceful way" and that he
had asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct necessary consultations.</P>
      <P>He complained  that Japan  has been unwilling  to conduct sovereignty talks and
that the fishery talks have gone nowhere, saying that "the situation must
change."</P>
      <P>From the point of view of improved Taiwan-Japanese relations, he went on, the
issues of fishery rights and sovereignty should be addressed squarely.</P>
      <P>He noted that he supports the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, believing it has
contributed to regional stability, but he said Taiwan should not remain silent
when it has disputes with Japan over territory.</P>
      <P>Ma said that when national sovereignty  and territory are involved, the
government will not budge.</P>
      <P>"We are not provoking anyone. How can we not go there if that is our land and
our territorial sea, " the president asked, adding that Taiwan is willing to
consult with Japan in a "peaceful and rational" way in view of the bilateral
friendly relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recalled its representative to Japan over the sinking of the Lienho
sport fishing boat. It has also demanded that Japan make an apology for the
incident and offer compensation to the boat's owner.</P>
      <P>The collision sparked renewed controversy over the sovereignty of the
Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, although Taiwan believes the island group is historically,
geographically and judicially connected to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan  administers  the uninhabited  Tiaoyutais  under  the jurisdiction of
Ishigawa, Okinawa Prefecture, while in Taiwan, they fall under the jurisdiction
of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan in waters around the islands.</P>
      <P>The two sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
the dispute and both sides agreed to hold the next round of talks in March 2006,
but the talks never took place.</P>

      <P>Washington called Monday for a peaceful resolution of the dispute between Taiwan
and Japan that arose from a boat accident in the East China Sea Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We urge all claimants to exercise restraint and to ensure that this issue is

      <P>He was responding to a journalist's question about the accident in which a

10 near the Tiaoyutai Islands which is claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Gallegos said he had seen the reports on the development, adding that "our
position on this subject is well known. We have consistently maintained that any
dispute should be settled by the parties themselves through peaceful means."</P>
      <P>Taiwan recalled its representative to Tokyo Sunday after Japan ascribed  the

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has felt Japan's 'sorrow in regret': foreign ministry</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan has felt Japan's sorrow in its regret over a boat collision accident in
the East China Sea, and would continue handling the accident with Japan through
diplomatic dialogue, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press release
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the Japanese authorities do not apology to Taiwan for the accident, the
press release said the gesture of a Japanese Maritime Safety Agency official who
bowed at a televised press conference to show his sorrow for the accident and
the Japan media which described the Japan authorities were "apologizing for this
accident" made Taiwan feel their "good-will response."</P>
      <P>Now that the Taiwanese crew of the sunken boat had returned to Taiwan and the
Japanese authorities had promised to address the issue of compensation
appropriately,  the foreign ministry will keep negotiating with Japan through
diplomatic channels to resolve the issues, the press release said.</P>
      <P>The accident took place on June 10 when a Japanese patrol boat collided with a
Taiwanese fishing boat while trying to chase it away from waters around the
Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea and caused the fishing boat to sink.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan requested Japan to apologize and compensate the owner of the Taipei
fishing boat but Tokyo has only offered its regret over the incident thus far
which the Foreign Minister Francisco H. L. Ou said on June 15 fell short of
Taiwan's expectation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) members who continue to hold
government positions should launch a mass exodus to avoid becoming scapegoats
for the new Kuomintang (KMT) government's "incompetence, " DPP legislators said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the head convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said tacit
agreement has been reached since he made the suggestion a day before that all
DPP members in central government posts or serving as executives in state-run
enterprises should step down from their posts.</P>
      <P>Ker said the KMT was likely to launch a campaign to settle scores against DPP
members in key positions after the legislature begins its summer break July 18
to "divert attention from President  Ma Ying-jeou's incompetence," but the DPP
would not let it happen.</P>
      <P>"We are not that stupid to be the patsies of the KMT," Ker said.</P>
      <P>Ke made his statement after several DPP members reportedly being replaced,
including Taiwan's top representative to Japan, Koh Se-kai, and Lee Ching-lung,
chairman  of the state-controlled  Taiwan Fertilizer Corp.</P>
      <P>As to the departure of Central Election Commission Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung
-- who was appointed by former President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP as the
country's leading official in charge of election affairs -- Ker said the DPP
would not make any decision for Chang since his position involves
"constitutional,  legal and tenure issues."</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-te, another DPP legislative caucus whip, seconded Ker's opinions,
stressing that DPP government officials and executives are resigning en masse to
prevent the KMT from making them scapegoats for its incompetence.</P>

      <P>The government should focus on the development of clinical trials as a means of
boosting the healthcare industry, as Taiwan has great potential in this regard,
a panel of experts at a two-day forum in Taipei suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Competitiveness Forum 2008 brought together officials, academics,
non-governmental organizations, and business experts from Taiwan and abroad to
discuss ways of improving Taiwan's competitiveness. The discussions were closed
to the media.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's healthcare sector, though still young, has shown potential in the area
of clinical trials, which the government should prioritize," said Wang Li-shin,
the managing director of Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical Taiwan as he disclosed
some of the suggestions made during the forum.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has several advantages, such as its quality medical doctors, researchers
and health management systems, that would allow for the development of excellent
clinical trials," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Clinical trials are usually conducted to collect data on the safety and efficacy
of new medicines or devices, with an aim of developing better medical cures and
products.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Taiwan's medical research labs could "bring in considerable
business opportunities by offering the results of clinical trials to help
international medical institutions explore the global healthcare and
pharmaceutical market."</P>
      <P>The experts at the forum urged the government and private medical institutions
to invest more in the research and development of advanced medical technologies
and devices, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The top seven medical and pharmaceutical companies in the United States
together invested a sum of US$36.3 billion (NT$1.1 trillion) in R&amp;D in
2007," he noted.</P>
      <P>The forum also suggested that the government develop preventive medicine, which
could help save government medical spending, he said.</P>
      <P>"It costs much less to prevent fatal diseases such as cancer than to cure them,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The forum is being held jointly by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, the American Institute in Taiwan, the American Chamber of Commerce,
the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, and the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, from June 16-17.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Tuesday that based on the
principles of reciprocity and on relevant road and traffic regulations, the
Republic of China (ROC) agreed to recognize the driver's licenses of the

    <HEADLINE>Private company to take over Alishan forest railway</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nearly 100-year-old Alishan Forest Railway, which runs between Chiayi City
and a scenic mountain resort area in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan, will have a
new operator Thursday -- a local construction company -- despite strong protests
from local residents.</P>
      <P>The Forest Bureau will transfer the right to operate the railway to the Hungtu
Construction Co., which won a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project that was
passed in 2006 to privatize the management of the railway for the next 30 years,
officials at the Chiayi Forest District Office said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Unlike the national rail system administered by the Taiwan Railway
Administration, the Alishan narrow-gauge railway is managed by the Forestry
Bureau under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and takes passengers to
the Alishan forest recreation area known for its cherry blossoms and ancient
trees, some of which are reputedly thousands of years old.</P>
      <P>The officials said the protests will have no effect on the privatization, which
will be completed June 19 as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Under the BOT project, worth NT$1.7 billion (US$56 million) , Hungtu is
contracted to operate the railway, including the stations along the route. It
also won the contract to build a five-star hotel on 2.2 hectares of state-owned
land near Jhaoping Station, the last stop of the Alishan line, which is the main
line of the network.</P>
      <P>The private company has also the right to develop 0.9 hectares of land
surrounding Peimen Station in Chiayi City, for the construction of another
hotel.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a group of Alishan residents and members of the Alishan
Community Development Association staged a protest against the transfer at
Alishan Station.</P>
      <P>The protesters accused the Forest Bureau of carrying out the BOT project before
an environmental impact evaluation has been passed.</P>
      <P>They also questioned how a local contractor has the skill to steer, repair and
maintain trains on the railway.</P>
      <P>The protesters claimed that only nine of the many experienced drivers of the
special forest trains have been hired by Hungtu, and that other young drivers
hired by the company are unqualified for the job.</P>
      <P>The residents accused the bureau of ignoring passenger safety, for "giving
profits to a big business" and for trying to get rid of a money-losing business
that generates just NT$100 million in revenues annually but costs NT$300 million
a year to operate.</P>
      <P>The Alishan Forest Railway is an 86 km narrow gauge railway network running up
to and throughout the popular mountain resort of Alishan. It was originally
constructed by the Japanese colonial government in 1912 to facilitate the
logging of cypress and other lumber, but today the line caters mostly to
tourists.</P>
      <P>In 2003, 17 people were killed and 156 injured when a train derailed near
Alishan Station.</P>
      <P>The area attracts nearly 900,000 local and foreign visitors every year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), Taiwan's top aviation regulator, has
temporarily suspended the debt-ridden Far Eastern Air Transport's international
flight rights, CAA Director-General Billy Chang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the CAA made the decision because the airline failed to make
operational improvements before a June 15 deadline.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Civil Aviation Law stipulates that the airline can apply for a
resumption of its international flights within six months after it seasing to
offer them and if it does not do so, the CAA will revoke its business license
and flight rights.</P>
      <P>The carrier's spokesman, Lee You-te, told CNA that the carrier respects the
CAA's decision.</P>
      <P>With debts reported at more than NT$10 billion (US$330 million) , the airline
publicly announced bankruptcy and stopped all flights May 13 after a chain of
financial crises that began earlier this year.</P>
      <P>More than 600 of the airline's employees took to the streets June 10 to demand
that the government help save the debt-ridden company from its financial crisis
and protect the employees' work rights.</P>
      <P>The protests came after the CAA decided to officially suspend the carrier's
right to operate domestic flights, as the airline had failed to resolve its
problems by a June 2 deadline.</P>
      <P>The CAA postponed the time for suspending the carrier's international flight
rights because it said it would receive an injection of capital by June 15, but
this capital did not materialize.</P>
      <P>The CAA said the improvements that the airline has to make include paying nearly
two months of back wages owed to its more-than 1,000 employees, raising
operating capital and recovering the fees it is owed for leasing out its planes
to Cambodia-based Angkor Airways.</P>
      <P>It also needs to show transparency in its finances and write a thorough business
plan to ensure that a similar financial crisis does not happen again, Chang
said.</P>

      <P>More residents in Kaohsiung City have been opting for scooters over cars in
recent months amid rising fuel prices, according to Kaohsiung City's Department
of Motor Vehicles.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-fu, director of the department's license issuing office, said that in
the past, an average of about 3,000-4,000 new license plates for automobiles
were issued per month in the southern port city.</P>
      <P>However, since the start of this year, the monthly average has been less than
2,000, he said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the department's statistics show that the number of new

about 3,000 per month in the past to between 4,500-5,000 in recent months, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>For May alone, he said, a total of 5,176 new license plates for scooters were

      <P>At present, there are more than 1.185 million registered scooters on the streets

    <TEXT>
      <P>China has gained the upper hand in cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations as the
result of Taiwan's rush to sign agreements, scholars said Tuesday, and they
urged President Ma Ying-jeou to develop a comprehensive strategy for the talks
to regain the initiative.</P>
      <P>"China seemed to take the leading role at the negotiating table, as it holds all
the chips, " said Chang Wu-yue, associate professor at Tamkang University's
Institute of China Studies.</P>
      <P>"The economy is the main consideration for Taiwan, while China's major concerns
are political, " Chang said in explaining Taiwan's dilemma at a forum held by
the pro-independence Taiwan Thinktank to discuss the mid-June  talks between
Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the prospects for future
meetings.</P>
      <P>The two quasi-official bodies formally agreed to launch direct cross-strait
charter flights on weekends and an expansion of Chinese tourist arrivals in
Taiwan, beginning July 4.</P>
      <P>But the scholars argued that despite the positive atmosphere surrounding the
meeting, China was still holding bargaining chips to gain further advantage in
the talks.</P>
      <P>"Beijing will not give too much at once in order to save the chips for
negotiations later," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that China only showed good will by agreeing to launch the weekend
charter flights July 4 and to allow Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan beginning
July 18.</P>
      <P>Beijing avoided, however, discussion on issues that seemed more important to
Taipei, such as increasing flight frequencies, opening more airports to the
flights or launching charter cargo flights, Chang argued.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, chairman of Soochow University's Department of Political Science
and a member of the executive committee of Taiwan Thinktank, said Beijing wants
to keep the momentum in negotiations between Taiwan and China by offering
incentives every month, not only to demonstrate its predominance on cross-strait
issues, but also to maintain the harmonious political atmosphere that China
wishes to see.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait face pressure not to let bilateral relations go
backwards, but there are also obstacles that are hard to overcome," Lo
contended.</P>
      <P>He said sensitive issues such as sovereignty will have to be dealt with at some
point, and that point could come as soon as September when Taiwan has to decide
how to frame its bid to join the United Nations or in November when Taipei
decides who to send to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Peru.</P>
      <P>Lo said the two agreements on weekend charter flights and Chinese tourists could
help Taiwan's economy in the short term, but they could edge out Japanese
tourists, who are actually bigger spenders than Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Local tourists might also be crowded out by Chinese visitors, he suggested.</P>
      <P>"Even though the atmosphere is good, we have to balance the books some time or
other," Lo said.</P>
      <P>Participants at the seminar called on Ma not to rush to deliver on his campaign
promises  but rather  spend time formulating acomprehensive strategy on cross-
strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that the Legislative Yuan play a more active role to
supervise all agreements signed between Taiwan and China by the SEF and ARATS,
as the establishment of a verification procedure at the Legislative Yuan is not
only essential but also can increase Taiwan's leverage at the negotiating table.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) vowed Wednesday to create the conditions
needed to realize President Ma Ying-jeou's promise to promote indigenous
autonomy, starting by narrowing the many gaps between indigenous peoples and
other Taiwanese residents.</P>
      <P>Ma promised during his presidential campaign to promote autonomy for indigenous
peoples where conditions were mature.</P>
      <P>"We do not have a timetable to achieve Ma's promise. What we are stressing is to
first create an advantageous  environment for (autonomy) , " said CIP Minister
Chang Jen-hsiang, a member of the Amis, the largest single indigenous group in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang was a vice chairwoman of the ruling Kuomintang from 2006-2008 but resigned
her post before being sworn in as the CIP's chief.</P>
      <P>At her first news conference since the new government took office May 20, Chang
noted that in order to create the conditions for indigenous peoples to achieve
autonomy, her council will enhance education  in  indigenous  communities,
increase  their  job opportunities, improve basic infrastructure in their
regions and raise their social and economic status.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the gaps in standards  of living between indigenous people and
other ethnic groups in Taiwan need to be narrowed.</P>
      <P>Indigenous people have average life expectancies 13 years shorter than other
Taiwan residents, and their average annual household incomes of NT$509,000
(US$16,793) are less than half the NT$1,099,739 averaged nationally, Chang said.</P>
      <P>She added that the 4.62 percent unemployment  rate amoung indigenous people also
exceeded the 3.82 percent national average in 2007.</P>
      <P>The CIP also intends to increase funding and scholarships for underprivileged
indigenous students, promote indigenous culture, and ensure their traditions and
rights, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Fourteen tribes are officially recognized by Taiwan's government. Their combined
population of 484,000 accounts for 2.1 percent of the country's total
population,  according to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 24 out of 25 women's stockings products recently surveyed by the
Consumers'  Foundation  were suspected to be in violation of advertising  laws
for making exaggerated claims, the foundation announced in a news conference
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The foundation carried out the survey on products at nine convenience stores,
hypermarkets, health shops and other retail outlets around (Taipei City) between
May 12 and June 11.</P>
      <P>Chen Jen-hung, chairman of the foundation,  said that the packaging on 24 of the
products sampled contained exaggerated claims about the stockings, while one of
the products was unlabeled.</P>
      <P>The exaggerated claims can be broken down into five categories, namely that the
stockings can burn fat, whiten skin and preserve moisture as well as have anti-
aging qualities and antioxidant agents, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Other claims included that the stockings can help prevent muscle atrophy, reduce
swelling and prevent varicose veins.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Department  of Health  regulations  on the advertising of beauty-
care products stipulate that ads cannot use medical terms, including names of
diseases or health conditions, such as hydrophilic swelling and tissue
inflammation, in a way that can confuse or mislead the public.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged the Fair Trade Commission under the Executive
Yuan as well as the Department of Health (DOH) to immediately investigate
whether these and other products are in violation of the law for their
exaggerated claims.</P>
      <P>The foundation also reminded members of the public to only purchase products
meant for therapeutic purposes that have been approved by the DOH.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou proposed Wednesday that Taiwan discuss with China the
signing of a comprehensive economic cooperation pact to pave the way for the
normalization of cross-strait economic relations.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the establishment of such a pact would increase Taiwan's
chances of success in negotiating the signing of free trade agreements (FTAs)
with the United States and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</P>
      <P>Ma put forth the idea while addressing a conference of the Taipei-based Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce (CNAIC).</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that during a trip to the central county of Changhua last year, many
manufacturers of socks asked him when Taiwan would sign an FTA with the United
States, because they were concerned that their products would become less
competitive after South Korea signed an FTA with the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma said the questions showed that local manufacturers have begun to feel the
pressure from the South Korea-U.S. FTA, although the agreement is not expected
to take effect until next year.</P>
      <P>In the face of such strong competition from other countries, including  China
where labor costs are much cheaper,  Taiwan manufacturers must strengthen their
marketing, management and design abilities in order to continue labor-intensive
production in Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue after the conference, CNAIC Chairman Theodore Huang agreed
that the absence of an FTA between Taiwan and its major trade partners would put
Taiwanese businesses in a disadvantageous position.</P>
      <P>On the government's decision to raise electricity rates starting next month,
Huang said this seems to be an inevitable trend as many countries around the
world are also adjusting their electricity rates to cope with soaring oil and
other energy-related commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Huang predicted the hikes will have only a minor impact on local businesses as
the increase is rather moderate.</P>

      <P>A group of opposition  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers criticized
President Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday for belittling himself and eroding national
dignity by agreeing to be addressed as "Mr. Ma" in a meeting with a Chinese
official planned for later this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative  Yuan news conference,  the DPP lawmakers, led by
legislative caucus whip Lai Ching-te, said they cannot accept Ma's view of the
title he should use in talks with Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Lai accused Ma of humbling himself and damaging Taiwan's national dignity by
agreeing to call the ARATS head "Mr. Chen" and to allow Chen to address him as
"Mr. Ma" instead of "president, " the position that is the symbol of a nation.</P>
      <P>"Doing so on an equal footing will be the best way to avoid the question of
imparity and put aside disputes, " Ma told reporters during an informal

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that his administration is resolved to
intervening as little as possible in the private sector to facilitate economic
growth, saying that by exerting fewer controls, the economy will show greater
vitality.</P>
      <P>In a speech to a general assembly of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Assocation  of Industry  and Commerce,  Ma said his administration wanted to
separate politics from economic activities in pursuing cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"The less the amount of ideology, the stronger the economy will be, " he said</P>
      <P>The government signed agreements with China in Beijing earlier this month to
launch direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends and expand the number of
Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan, both measures intended to further
liberalize economic ties between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The opening of direct cross-strait air links has long been expected by Taiwanese
with business operations in China, but the previous government's efforts to open
direct charter flights on major holidays and the "mini three links" were
insufficient, Ma argued.</P>
      <P>"These limited and partial openings were not enough when close cross-strait
business and trade exchanges are taken into account, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's two-way trade with China exceeded US$120 billion in 2007
with a surplus topping US$70 billion, Ma stressed that the government should
exert less control to allow businesses to have access to more convenient
transportation and additional space in conducting economic activities.</P>
      <P>"In short, the government should keep China policy pragmatic and open while
increasingly relaxing restrictions," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president said he was told last year during a visit to a dairy farm in
Puxin, Taoyuan operated by Wei Chuan Corp. that Dingxin International Group --
Wei Chuan's major arm in China producing mostly instant noodles under the
"Kangshifu" brand -- sold a total of 8.1 billion packs of instant noodles in
China in 2006.</P>
      <P>"That means that each of China's 1.3 billion people consumes an average of six
packs of Kangshifu instant noodles a year," he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma recalled that he asked one of the Wei Chuan executives during that visit what
he could do to help the business sector if he were to be elected president.</P>
      <P>"The government should pay a little less attention to us, " the Wei Chuan
official said to him, Ma recalled.</P>
      <P>He said it is impossible for the administration to maintain a completely hands-
off policy without playing some kind of supervisory or monitoring rule, but
indicated that what the government aims to do is to allow the private sector
enough space to operate freely and efficiently to "create the biggest possible
profits and then give back to society."</P>

the 2001-2002 cycle, Taiwan climbed to sixth place between 2002 and 2006, but
dropped to 10th place for the 2006-2007 cycle.</P>
      <P>The CEPD noted that in an "experience economy" that emphasizes the creation of
positive user experience, the competitiveness of businesses depends largely on
their abilities to track the needs and lifestyle of consumers.</P>
      <P>The best examples in Taiwan of such abilities are the development of low-price
notebook computers, digital cameras, digital photo frames and smart phones by
Taiwanese manufacturers to appeal to a new rising group of price-conscious
consumers, the CEPD said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>5 Taiwanese carriers to serve 18 weekend charter flights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has granted five local airlines the
right to serve 18 flights per week to China after the July launch of direct
weekend charter flights across the Taiwan Strait, a CAA spokesman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CAA made the decision at a meeting the previous day to address the
allocation of cross-strait direct flights after it suspended all international
flights by Far Eastern Air Transport Corp for six months in light of the debt-
ridden carrier's failure to improve its financial situation.</P>
      <P>The five carriers -- Mandarin Airlines, TransAsia Airways, UNI Air, China
Airlines and EVA Airways -- will be allocated the weekly charter flights
originally allocated to FAT, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>For the first weekend, Mandarin Airlines, TransAsia Airways and UNI Air will
each provide four flights, while China Airlines and EVA Airways will each
operate three flights.</P>
      <P>For the second weekend, TransAsia Airways, UNI Air and China Airlines will each
run four flights, while EVA Airways and Mandarin Airlines will each run three
flights, with subsequent rotations continuing in that order, the spokesman
explained.</P>
      <P>Regarding the busiest Taiwan-Shanghai route, the spokesman said that as the
agreement on cross-strait direct flights stipulates that no more than nine
flights per week will be allowed on the route, the CAA agreed to grant three
carriers two weekly flights each on the route, and to grant another carrier one
weekly flight on the route, with the five carriers taking turns.</P>
      <P>Although the allocation method is somewhat complicated, it is the fairest, CAA
Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said, adding that if FAT resumes operations or
if more direct flights are added, the allocations will be adjusted.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said that airlines in Taiwan and China are required to apply for
flights and routes they want to serve 15 days before they plan to begin
operations, which means that those who want operate flights on the first weekend
should file their applications by June 19.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait direct weekend charter flights are scheduled to begin July 4 from
Friday to Monday, with 36 flights between China and Taiwan available each week.
Carriers from the two sides will each operate 18 flights.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will open eight airports to accommodate the direct flights, including
Taiwan Taoyuan international Airport and Songshan Airport in Taipei, as well as
airports in Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hualien, Magong, Kinmen and Taitung.</P>
      <P>China destinations will be Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing,
with Chengdu, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Dalian, Guilin and Shenzhen to be added
later.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hollywood star visit for charity event should be welcomed: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
06/18/08  16:54:20
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said Wednesday that
Taiwan should always greet with joy those who come to Taiwan to take part in
charity activities, describing Taiwan as a "lovely society with friendly people
who accept different opinions."</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks when asked by reporters about protests that took place at
the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport earlier in the day upon the arrival of
Hollywood movie star Jackie Chan, who is a controversial figure among Taiwanese
pro-independence advocates due to scathing remarks he made several years ago
about former President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Chan arrived aboard a private plane and was driven to the Taipei 101 skyscraper
for a press conference organized by the Taipei-based non-profit TVBS Caring for
Taiwan Foundation for its annual campaign aimed at raising funds for local
children in need of financial support for education and daily necessities.</P>
      <P>He was invited to speak on behalf of the campaign, which began in 2002 with the
aim of paying school fees and other costs for children living in poverty.</P>
      <P>At the airport, however, he faced protests from some locals who still harbored a
grudge with his public comment in 2004 on the shooting of Chen on the eve of the
2004 presidential election, which he described as "a big joke."</P>
      <P>Since that year, Chan has not set foot on Taiwan, despite being married to a
Taiwanese actress.</P>
      <P>Shih expressed hope that Taiwanese society can be magnanimous to people with
different opinions.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will be invited to attend the 45th Golden Horse Film Festival
and award ceremony, Shih noted that art and politics are two different matters
that should not be mixed.</P>
      <P>It is up to the festival organizer whether or not to invite Chan to attend the
annual event, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>Asked if she had ever watched any of his films, the official said with a smile
that she "had watched his films since I was a child."</P>
      <P>The actor, who began his career in the Hong Kong film industry, recently became
the focus of a rowdy debate among Taichung city councilors when they were
reviewing an addition to the budget for the film festival to be held Dec. 6 in
the central city.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party councilors Hsiao Chieh, Chen Fu-wen and
Wang Yue-bin, as well as the ruling Kuomintang's Ting Cheng-chia, demanded that
the city not invite the star to the country's biggest film festival. They
claimed that Chan "owes Taiwan an apology" for his comment, which according to
Hsiao was tantamount to "humiliating all of Taiwan's people."</P>
      <P>In 2004,  the then-opposition  Kuomintang alleged that the shooting, in which
Chen was slightly injured, was staged to sway the result of the hotly contested
election, but failed to provide evidence to back its claim. Chen won by a razor-
thin margin, giving him a second term in office.</P>
      <P>Chan agreed to put his face to the charity campaign in Taiwan because the
movement is similar to a "One-Dollar Fund" program he launched to offer care for
children,  according  to the TVBS foundation.</P>
      <P>Chan wants to help Taiwanese children after learning that some 50,000 of them
live in households incapable of paying their education costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Restrictions on local chiefs' visits to China to be eased</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Restrictions on elected local government officials in Taiwan will be allowed to
visit China starting July, the head of Taiwan's top China policy coordinating
body announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said the council has
crafted regulations governing visits by mayors and county magistrates to China,
adding that all heads of Taiwan's 25 cities and counties can now visit China "if
the visits are conducive to cross-strait  relations  and  beneficial  to city
and  county development."</P>
      <P>Lai made the announcement at the Legislative Yuan in response to a question
raised by ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lu Shiow-yen, who suggested that
the MAC largely ease restrictions on visits to China by Taiwan's elected local
government heads.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu is planning to board the first weekend direct cross-
strait charter flight slated for July 4 for China, Lu said.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said the MAC knows very well the pressure that mayors and
county chiefs have faced from the voters to seek economic opportunities with
China and has sensed those local governments' need to increase exchanges with
their Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>"The MAC has decided to relax restrictions on such visits, " Lai noted.</P>
      <P>She added that although her office has completed planning on the eased policy
for July, the exact date for its implementation will not be announced until
after relevant details and measures are worked out.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have been thawing in the wake of the May 20
inauguration of the KMT, which adopts a more China friendly policy than the
previous administration of the Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The KMT administration signed agreements with China in Beijing earlier this
month to launch direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends and to increase
the number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan. Both measures are
intended to further liberalize ties between Taiwan and China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen urged the central government Wednesday
to include the eastern county's  Fengnian  Airport in the first phase of the
direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight program which will kick off in July.</P>
      <P>Kuang called on the central government and the national security authorities to
consider her suggestion amid their efforts to strike a balance between local
tourism development and national security concerns.</P>
      <P>"Actually, the Taitung airport is purely a civilian facility that should be free
from national security concerns, " she said, noting that it had operated direct
charter flights to Japan and South Korea in recent years.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuomintang (KMT) government's program, Sungshan Airport and Taiwan
Taoyuan International  Airport in northern  Taiwan, Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in the south will service
direct cross-strait charter flights in the initial stages when the program is
launched in July.</P>
      <P>The direct flight initiative, along with the admission of significantly larger
numbers of tourists from China, was one of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign
promises.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, the airports on the outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands will
be opened to accommodate  the cross-strait charters, while in the third phase,
airports in the eastern counties of Taitung and Hualien counties will be
included.</P>
      <P>The central government's decision to put Fengnian Airport in the third instead
of the first phase of the program has disappointed many Taitung residents, Kuang
said.</P>

      <P>The three-in-one Food Taipei, Foodtech Taipei and Taipei Pack fair kicked off at
the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall Wednesday, with 1,077
manufacturers displaying their latest products in 2,531 booths at this year's
combined event.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  the  opening  ceremony,  Chao  Yung-chuan, secretary-general of
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , said that the number of
manufacturers taking part and the total number of booths represent increases of
19.9 percent and 3.3 percent, respectively, compared to figures for last year's
event.</P>
      <P>More than 3,000 foreign professional buyers and some 40,000 domestic
businesspeople are expected to visit this year's fair, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the fair is an important platform for domestic food producers
to make contacts with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>He added that the TAITRA decided to combine the Food Taipei, Foodtech Taipei and
Taipei Pack fairs to make it more convenient for foreign buyers visiting from
far away to learn more about all facets of Taiwan's food industry and to sign
deals.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the opening ceremony, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-
ming noted that Taiwan's food industry had a production value of NT$459 billion
(US$15.13 billion) for last year, saying that it performed well in both domestic
and overseas sales.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that since Taiwan entered the World Trade Organization in 2002,
overseas  business opportunities  for domestic  food manufacturers  have
expanded  considerably,  adding  that  the manufacturers have become more
internationalized in the process.</P>
      <P>He noted that domestic food producers' influence in foreign markets, such as
those in China and South Asian countries, has grown considerably, pointing out
that their total overseas trade value for 2007 amounted to NT$4.73 billion.</P>
      <P>After speaking at the opening ceremony,  Yiin visited the Salvadoran pavilion
and some of the 27 other national pavilions set up at this year's event.</P>
      <P>The fair is set to run until June 21, with the first two days of the event open
to foreign professional buyers and the last two days open to the general public
for an admission fee of NT$300.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min said Wednesday that a shorter, more
direct route for flights between Taiwan and China will not compromise national
security.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to questions in the Legislative Yuan on whether a shorter,
less convoluted route should be adopted for the direct weekend cross-strait
charter flights that are set to be launched July 4.</P>
      <P>Currently, flights to China are required transit in Hong Kong or Macau, but this
will not apply to the aircraft scheduled to fly the direct weekend charters.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the ruling Kuomintang called for the
charters to be allowed to take a less circuitous flight path.</P>
      <P>He said that even on a nonstop cross-strait flight, if a shorter, less intricate
route cannot be used and the aircraft still have to fly north or south in the
airspace of a third country, "this will not save time or money, considering the
rising cost of fuel."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Mainland Affairs Council, the nation's top China policy
coordinating body, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC)
will be responsible for negotiations with China on the final flight paths of the
charters.</P>
      <P>But he said that his ministry "had worked out a plan for the flight paths of the
nonstop cross-strait charters under the principle of not compromising national
security and defense."</P>
      <P>"The ministry has submitted the plan to the MOTC for reference, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Pressed by Ting on whether a more direct flight path would compromise national
security, Chen said that "there is no such problem with the plan we gave to the
MOTC."</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the MND has an agreement with the Coast Guard Administration
(CGA) to provide marine support.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Yu-feng then asked what the ministry will do if a CGA patrol
vessel goes within the 12-nautical- mile territorial waters of the disputed
Tiaoyutai Islands northeastern of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The MND will take action depending on the situation, " Chen asserted.</P>
      <P>In response to criticisms that he was being weak, Chen later said that if the
CGA asks for support, the MND "will provide escort for the patrol boat."</P>
      <P>Chen's reply came against the background of a boat accident last week in which a
Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank after colliding with a much larger
Japanese patrol vessel near the Tiaoyutais, which is claimed by Taiwan, China
and Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recalled its representative to Japan, and asked for an apology and
compensation for losses the captain of the Taiwanese ship sustained in the
incident.</P>

      <P>The police are set to strengthen a clampdown on people riding scooters without

      <P>Scooter riders caught not wearing a helmet or not wearing one properly -- for
example, leaving the buckles unhooked -- will be fined NT$500 (US$16), the

      <P>The first six Chinese tour groups to visit Taiwan after the country signed an
agreement with China on closer tourism ties last week are expected to land July
4, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese tourists, to be led by Shao Qiwei, director of China's National
Tourism Administration, will be arriving from Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen,
Guangzhou and Nanjing, Mao said during a meeting sponsored by ruling
Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Members of the tour groups will include officials, travel agency representatives
and ordinary tourists, Mao noted.</P>
      <P>"Future Chinese tour groups will not be led by officials once the program is
implemented regularly from July 18, " he added.</P>
      <P>The minister was uncertain as to which of the eight Taiwanese destinations
serving the tourists will be used for the first six groups. The airports at
Kinmen, Penghu, Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Kaohsiung, Hualien and Taitung will
all be used for the tours.</P>
      <P>"Detailed arrangements are still being made pertaining to which destinations
will be the first to welcome the Chinese tourists, " he said.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait signed agreements in Beijing June 13 on the
launch of direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends and the expansion of

      <P>According  to agreements  signed by Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits, Taiwanese and Chinese carriers will jointly operate 36 charter
flights from Friday through Monday every week beginning July 4 and up to 3,000
ordinary Chinese tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan per day from July 18.</P>
      <P>Prior to the agreement, nonstop charters were only operated on special holidays
and only certain categories of Chinese citizens, including those living abroad,

      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) Wednesday with the American Red Cross (ARC) to collaborate
on providing resources for future relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The ceremony, in which the ARC signed its first MOU with an Asian organization,
was held at Tzu Chi's Guandu Complex and was attended by executives of the
foundation's chapters in the United States, as well as by commissioners and
volunteers.</P>
      <P>Stephen Huang, CEO of Tzu Chi's Global Affairs, said that "the signing of the
MOU with the ARC symbolizes an important milestone in the history of
international relief."</P>
      <P>We at Tzu Chi have at last been officially recognized ognized by the 126-year-
old ARC, and we will make more efforts in very close cooperation with the ARC to
conduct more humanitarian aid in the future, Huang said.</P>
      <P>William Keh, chief executive officer of the foundation's U.S. headquarters, said
that through the hard work of the Tzu Chi volunteers "we can still see where the
hope is."</P>
      <P>Noting that Tzu Chi usually associates humanism with its relief work, while the
ARC is a professional organization with experience and expertise in relief work,
Keh expressed hope that the partnership will not only reduce damage or
casualties in any calamity but will also provide victims with better services.</P>
      <P>"There are many things that the Tzu Chi U.S. chapters can learn from the ARC,
and the signing of the MOU is therefore very meaningful," said Keh, who returned
to Taiwan especially for the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Commending the foundation as well as its humanitarian works, Juliet Choi, senior
director of the ARC's disaster services, said the ARC also needs to learn from
the experiences of Tzu Chi.</P>
      <P>"Even though we are 126 years old, we have so much to learn from you," Choi
said, expressing hope that the partnership between the ARC and Tzu Chi will help
"enhance bilateral coordination, cooperation and communication."</P>
      <P>Although both Tzu Chi and the ARC are charitable organizations, Choi said that
"our services, our commitment, our strength and our volunteers really do
compliment one another."</P>
      <P>"We have much more to do together, " Choi went on, noting that in the future,
the two organizations will cooperate in the aspects of preparation  for

    <HEADLINE>BTCO launches exhibition of British artist's work</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) on Wednesday launched
an exhibition of a collection of sculptures and drawings by British artist
Martyn Barratt, in what the BTCO said was a demonstration of its continued
support of British art and its commitment to developing the cultural
relationship between Taiwan and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Barratt, who has been living in Taiwan for four years, said he was greatly
inspired by the way Taiwanese artists work.</P>
      <P>"They tend to work much more directly with the shape of the wood, finding a
piece of wood and using its natural shape." Barratt said. "Buying a piece of
wood log and working on it -- there is no real relation between that and the
tree."</P>
      <P>Barratt, who was originally trained in wood and stone, now also incorporates
glass and metal into his work, which usually involves juxtaposing opposites,
black and white, rough and smooth, interior and exterior, natural and manmade,
creating balance but not always harmony.</P>
      <P>"One of the interesting things about coming here to Taiwan is that I work more
with the quality of the materials, " the 43-year-old British artist said. "I
tend to find the materials and use the innate qualities that are there for the
work to be almost created itself."</P>
      <P>He said that seeing many people in Taiwan creating their own work gave him
inspiration and new ideas and changed the way he looked at his own art.</P>
      <P>The 16 pieces of Barratt's work on display were produced during his stay in
Taiwan, though some belong to the ongoing "Seed Series" that he had been working
on since before he left England.</P>
      <P>Barratt works from his studio in Yangmingshan, dividing his time between glass
work at his kiln and creating contemporary sculptures on public and private
commissions.</P>
      <P>The exhibition of his work will be held at BTCO from June 16 to Aug. 1 and
admission is free.</P>
      <P>Describing the British creative industry as dynamic and fast growing, BTCO
Deputy Director Charles Garrett said in his opening remarks that the British
creative industry also gained its reputation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If you look at the five years between 2002 and 2007, the number of Taiwanese
students going to British design schools and art schools rose by about 50
percent, " Garrett said, adding that in the field of design alone, the number of
Taiwan students has increased by over 75 percent.</P>
      <P>"British schools are fast gaining their reputations  among Taiwanese students,
which is a very good thing for links between the two countries," Garrett said.</P>
      <P>The U.K.  design industry is large and diverse,  spanning disciplines from
branding and graphics, packaging and commercial interiors to product design,
multimedia and crafts. It consists of 4,000 commercial design consultancies  and
many independent or freelance designers. In total, the industry employs
approximately 70,000 people.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the industry's turnover was 4.6 billion British pounds (US$9 billion)
and Britain is a significant exporter of design services.</P>

      <P>Further talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on flight exchanges
will be held after the Aug. 8-24 Beijing Olympic Games, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Issues to be discussed include offering more direct cross-strait charter flights
and opening more airports in China for the flights, Mao said in his briefing on
weekend direct flights to the ruling Kuomintang's Central Standing Committee,
the party's policy-making body.</P>
      <P>Mao noted that his ministry has outlined two new routes and will put the plan on
the table for negotiations between the two sides after confirming the new air
routes will not harm Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Dialogue between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-
based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) resumed last
week after a nine-year suspension.</P>
      <P>The two semi-official intermediary bodies were founded in 1991, respectively, to
handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official links.</P>
      <P>According to SEF-ARATS agreements signed June 13, the two sides decided to
launch regular charter flights between Taiwan and China on July 4, and that
eight airports in Taiwan's Kinmen, Penghu, Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Kaohsiung,
Hualien and Taitung will be opened for the new service while China opens five
terminals in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen and Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>Mao said his ministry hopes and will make active moves to push the Chinese side
to open more terminals for the long-expected flight exchanges.</P>
      <P>Addressing their two new planned routes for the weekend flights, Mao said the
first one would see aircraft fly from Taiwan toward the north before landing in
Shanghai. The second path will begin in Xiamen, southwestern China, and make a
stop on the Taiwan-controlled outlying Penghu Islands before landing on Taiwan
proper, he noted.</P>
      <P>As to the widely-discussed cargo charter flights, Mao pointed out that the two
sides are expected to reach an agreement within the next three months to begin
the transportation links.</P>

      <P>The situation across the Taiwan Strait is likely to further improve in the
second half of this year, creating many new business opportunities for Taiwan
industry, including the trade fair and convention business, Minister of Economic
Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to mark the establishment of the Republic of China
exhibition and convention association  at the Taipei International Convention
Center, Yiin said he expects cross-strait ties to take significant steps forward
over the next six months and that this will benefit Taiwan's exhibition and
convention industry.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by the International Association of Conference Centers, Yiin
said Taiwan's global ranking in terms of hosting international conferences
advanced to 18th spot in 2007 from 40th in 2006.</P>
      <P>"This is an indication that Taiwan's exhibition and convention industry is well
backed up by activities of similar content, " he said.</P>
      <P>The minister said he is upbeat about the easing of cross-strait trade and
investment relations and added he believes that it will provide fresh and
"numerous" business opportunities "in a piecemeal fashion" for Taiwanese
industry.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will devote greater energy to training
manpower in the local exhibition and convention industry and will do its best to

    <HEADLINE>Reducing executions is trend: president</HEADLINE>

06/18/08  19:51:36
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that although a reduction of executions
will be a trend, more education and law revisions will be required to follow
this path.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received a delegation of members of the
World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, the Anti-Death Penalty Asian Network
and Amnesty International.</P>
      <P>He noted that when he served as minister of justice in 1993, he conducted the
first ever public opinion poll on whether capital punishment should be scrapped.</P>
      <P>He said he was "surprised" to find that the poll showed that 72 percent of those
polled were opposed to the scrapping of the death penalty, while 88 percent of
the judicial personnel surveyed were opposed.</P>
      <P>However, when asked "can capital punishment deter major crime, " less than half
of them thought it would be effective, Ma said, describing these as
"contradictory" views.</P>
      <P>The president said the Ministry of Justice also conducted a survey in February
this year that garnered similar results, with nearly 80 percent of the
respondents expressing opposition to the abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>If longer prison terms were adopted, or stricter conditions imposed for life
term inmates to get parole, however, 56 percent said "they would support the
abolition of capital punishment."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that during his term as justice minister, executions were still being
carried out, although the number had been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>He cited especially the "Hsichih trio" case, in which three men were convicted
in 1991 of a cold-blooded double murder in Hsichih, Taipei County. The death
sentence for the trio was not executed during his term as justice minister and
all three, who have consistently professed their innocence, are still fighting
for justice from death row.</P>
      <P>He said that at present, about 29 people are on death row awaiting execution.</P>
      <P>Ma said that incumbent Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng is known for her
promotion of human rights and has long advocated the scrapping of capital
punishment.</P>
      <P>But Wang knows that only through law revisions and public education will it be
possible to promote the abolition of the death penalty, and even then, public
consensus will be needed, Ma pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Women in Taiwan know little about cervical cancer: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost 75 percent of women in Taiwan do not have accurate knowledge of the cause
of cervical cancer, the results of survey released Wednesday showed.</P>
      <P>According to the survey conducted by the Health, Welfare and Environment
Foundation (HWE) , only 23.7 percent of the 913 women polled  knew that cervical
cancer  was caused  by the human papillomavirus (HPV.)</P>
      <P>The other respondents thought that cervical cancer occurred as a result of
lifestyle, genetics, or eating habits.</P>
      <P>The results further indicated that 52.2 percent of the women polled thought that
the purpose of a cervical or pap smear was to prevent cancer, instead of to
detect the disease.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 40.5 percent of the respondents feared that developing
cervical cancer could impact on the quality of life.</P>
      <P>As for the reasons that why they had not received physical checks for the
disease, 48.2 percent of the women polled said that they were "too shy," while
32.8 percent responded that they were "too busy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 90 percent of the women said they would support a proposal for the
government to allocate more funds to provide women with a cheaper or free
vaccine against cervical cancer.</P>
      <P>Noting that cervical cancer is the only type of cancer that can be prevented,
Legislator Yang Li-huan, who is also chairwoman of the HWE's legislative
chapter, said she hoped that the government would allocate more funds for the
prevention of the disease.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chao-shun supported Yang's point, saying she hoped that through
the efforts of the government, the HWE and the Taiwan Association of Obstetrics
and Gynecology (TAOG), "all females could be free of cervical cancer."</P>
      <P>Tsai Horng-der, president of the TAOG, further urged all women to have regular
examinations for cervical cancer, by means of pap smears, adding that he hoped
that the government would educate the public about the disease.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, a research fellow of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research
institute, urged the drug companies to drop the price of the cervical cancer
vaccine currently on the market, noting that it is too expensive, not just for
the health authorities, but also for the public.</P>
      <P>We hope that in the future the government will provide all women in the country
with free cervical cancer vaccines, said Chen, who is also a former minister of
the Cabinet-level Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The HWE was founded in 1990 by Show Chwan Health Care System to promote medical
care, social welfare, and environmental protection. It has a chapter within the
Legislative Yuan to promote health related bills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four major chain convenience stores and three supermarkets in Taipei will no
longer take the initiative to offer disposable chopsticks to customers, in an
effort to help reduce the volume of waste in the city, the Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) under the Taipei City Government said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The four chain convenience stores are 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, OK and Hi Life,
while the three supermarkets are Wellcome, Pxmart and Matsusei.</P>
      <P>Under the DEP policy, starting Wednesday, a total of 1,523 stores of these
retail chains will only provide disposable chopsticks at the request of
customers in Taipei City, the agency said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Apart from helping to save trees and bamboo, the new policy will also help to
protect people's health, as chopsticks often retain residues of chemicals,
Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>FamilyMart, which had more than 2,300 stores islandwide, provides about 10
million pairs of disposable chopsticks every year, said Esther Lin, manager of
the Corporate Communications Department of the FamilyMart.</P>
      <P>She added that her company was adopting the new policy not only in its Taipei
stores, but also nationwide, and expects to reduce the quantity of chopsticks it
provides by 25 percent annually.</P>
      <P>"The government  should consider  a charge  for disposable chopsticks, as was
introduced for plastic bags, which would be very effective (in reducing
chopstick use)," Lin suggested.</P>
      <P>According to the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) , more than 5
billion pairs of disposable chopsticks are used every year in Taiwan, which
means an average of 200 pairs used per person per year.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that its decision in 2006 to limit the use of disposable chopsticks
in government agencies and in public and private educational institutions has
proved effective.</P>

      <P>As of Wednesday noon, 204 confirmed serious enterovirus infections and seven
resulting deaths had been reported, according  to  Centers  for  Disease
Control  (CDC)  Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw.</P>
      <P>A total of 27 cases were confirmed last week and fewer than 40 confirmed cases
reported a week before, but it is too early to say whether the infection
situation is abating, as it requires one week to confirm reported cases, Chou
said.</P>
      <P>Most of the confirmed cases are infections of Enterovirus Type 71 (EV71) -- a
fatal strain that has spread to Taiwan from other Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The virus enters the body through the gastrointestinal tract, where it thrives,
and can move on to attack the nervous system. Children are more susceptible to
the infection than healthy adults.</P>
      <P>There is no vaccine for the virus, but frequent hand-washing and disinfection
are known to help prevent infection.</P>
      <P>Wu Han-ping, a pediatrician with more than 10 years experience in treating
serious enterovirus in the central county of Taichung, said that comatose sleep,
vomiting, and spasms are symptoms of milder cases turning serious.</P>
      <P>Health officials have suggested that people use diluted household bleach, which
contains chlorine, as a disinfectant, instead of ethanol-based products that do
not kill the potentially lethal virus.</P>
      <P>The disinfectant can be applied to objects that young children often touch, such
as door handles, tables, chairs, toys and books, to decrease the risk of

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government in Taipei has agreed that two of the maiden direct
weekend charters will fly from Taichung to southern China's Xiamen and Guangzhou
cities on July 4, the first day of the landmark service across the Taiwan
Strait, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu made the announcement immediately upon learning of the decision, and said
that at the carriers' request, he will try his best to attend the launch of the
two maiden charter flights that will take off directly from Taichung's
Chingchuankang Airport to China to mark the historic moment.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is considering inviting four city mayors and county magistrates from
central Taiwan to attend the launching ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, UNI Airways Corp. and Mandarin Airlines will operate the two
maiden cross-strait charter flights from Taichung to China.</P>
      <P>"Actually, the central government has given approval for three direct cross-
strait charter flights to take off from Taichung on July 4, but further
arrangements will be required to finalize the plan, " he explained.</P>
      <P>Hu had repeatedly pledged to have Chingchuankang Airport service some of the
maiden cross-strait charters on July 4.</P>
      <P>Amid uncertainties, Hu said earlier the same day that he would try hard to
attract more carriers to run direct weekend charter flights between Taichung and
destinations in China after the service is launched on July 4.</P>
      <P>"I will do my best to court more aviation companies to operate cross-strait
charter flights from Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan to major Chinese
cities such as Xiamen,  Shanghai and Guangzhou," Hu stated during an
interpellation session at the municipal council.</P>
      <P>"To date, Mandarin Airlines and UNI Airways have agreed to assess the
possibility of operating weekend charter flights from Taichung to the three
Chinese destinations," he said. "The Taichung City Government stands ready to
provide comprehensive assistance."</P>
      <P>The mayor also gave the assurance that there will be enough passengers from
Taichung to justify the three routes and voiced the hope that he could one day
lead delegations to China to introduce Taichung City to the Chinese people, if
he is permitted .</P>
      <P>Under the Kuomintang (KMT) government's program, Sungshan Airport and Taiwan
Taoyuan International  Airport in northern  Taiwan, Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in the south will service
direct cross-strait charter flights in the initial stages when the program is
launched in July.</P>
      <P>The direct flight initiative, along with the admission of significantly larger
numbers of tourists from China, was one of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign

      <P>People should file appeals within the specified time frame if they feel that
they have been taxed wrongly, and those who miss the deadline can only get tax
refunds dating back a maximum of five years, a court official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Pi-fang, spokeswoman for the Taipei High Administrative Court, made the
remarks after a noted lawyer protested a recent court ruling that rejected his
appeal for the Taipei National  Tax Administration (TNTA) to refund him all the
extra property taxes he had paid over the past 15 years as a result of the tax
office mistakenly levying business taxes on his residential property.</P>
      <P>Chen Charng-ven, a partner of Lee and Li Attorneys-at-Law who is also president
of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, said he was upset that the
TNTA would only refund him extra property taxes dating back five years, rather
than 15 years, on the grounds that the current tax law puts a five-year
backdating cap on tax refunds.</P>
      <P>Chen and his family moved into a house on Taipei's Fujin Street in 1986 where
they have lived ever since. The house has never been used for commercial
purposes, but the Taipei City tax office began in 1992 to impose a business
property tax of 3 percent, on the grounds that an eyeglass company had its
headquarters there from July 1991. Prior to that, the house had been subjected
to a property tax rate of 1.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Chen did not discover the error until last year. He then asked the tax office to
refund him the extra taxes he had paid because the house had never been used for
commercial purposes and because, contrary to the tax office's claims, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs had no record of such a company having ever existed
at his address.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Sung-fang, head of the Taipei tax office, apologized to Chen for the
mistake, but he cited tax regulations to support the office's decision to refund
Chen only five years of backdated excess taxes.</P>
      <P>Chen appealed the case in the Taipei High Administrative Court, which opened two
rounds of hearings but in the end ruled in favor of the tax office and rejected
Chen's appeal on the grounds that an ordinary citizen is not eligible to ask an
administrative agency to revoke any illegal, unlawful or mistaken decision.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's case, High Administrative Court spokeswoman Wang Pi-fang
said tax administration is a complicated and tough task that is not infallible.
"Those who want to seek administrative resolution should apply within a
specified time frame and follow procedures set forth in the existing law," she
explained.</P>
      <P>She noted that the administrative procedure law is mainly aimed at maintaining
public interests, not the personal interests of any individual. "No individual
citizen can seek recourse beyond the provisions of the law," she added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said he simply could not understand why an administrative
agency should be spared responsibility for its mistakes.</P>
      <P>"It is implausible that the government cannot be held accountable for the
bungled operation, " Chen said, adding that he was extremely disappointed over
the government's failure to admit its wrongdoing and to make a full tax refund
totaling slightly more than NT$169,000 (US$5,577.6).</P>
      <P>Chen, who used to rank among the country's top 10 taxpayers, said he will appeal
the case in the Supreme Administrative Court, and if necessary, will apply to
the Justices of the Constitutional Court for a constitutional interpretation of
the case.</P>

      <P>The government has donated 3 million yen (around US$27,540) each to the two
Japanese prefectures hardest hit by a recent earthquake, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) said in a news release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry stated that the money was donated to Iwate and Miyagi, the two
prefectures that bore the brunt of the magnitude-7.2 temblor that struck Japan
June 14.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Francisco H. L. Ou also expressed his concern via
Taiwan's representative office in Tokyo immediately after the quake, according
to the statement.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that in the spirit of humanitarian assistance and in return for
the help extended by the Japanese after the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake and 2003
SARS outbreak in Taiwan, the government had expressed concern and made the
donations. The ministry said it hoped that life would return to normal soon for
the affected residents.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the government's foreign affairs and
national security agencies will seek to institute a better information system to
deal effectively with emergency situations in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a meeting with ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union legislators.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the government had learned a lesson from a boat collision incident
near the Tiaoyutai Islands in East China Sea last week, and now has to figure
out how to acquire a fuller picture of emergency situations before making
decisions.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to the furor that arose after a June 10 incident in which a
Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank some six nautical miles southwest of
the Tiaoyutai Islands after colliding with a Japanese coast guard patrol boat.</P>
      <P>Upon  learning  of the accident,  Peter  Tsai,  the  then director-general of
MOFA's Committee on Japanese Affairs, asked a Taiwanese coast guard ship in the
area not to enter the disputed 12-nautical-mile zone around the Tiaoyutais to
avoid any possible conflict. Tsai gave the order not knowing that the ship was
already some 7.8 nautical miles from the Tiaoyutais gathering evidence relating
to the collision.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan, Japan and China all claim sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais, Tsai's
directive could have been viewed as a compromise on Taiwan part regarding its
sovereignty claim. Tsai resigned on June 12 over the incident.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after the government acquired a better understanding of the facts
surrounding  the Tiaoyutai incident,  it started negotiations with Japan,
seeking to resolve the dispute by peaceful means. Japan has promised to
compensate the Taiwanese shipowner and has expressed its sincerity in wanting to
resolve the matter, he added.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's meeting, Ma also expressed gratitude to some KMT legislators who
canceled a boat trip to the islands originally scheduled for Wednesday so as to
avoid any further confrontations and leave room for the government to negotiate
with Japan.</P>
      <P>The dispute has not yet been fully sorted out, but the government is committed
to resolving it by peaceful means, Ma said, adding that after it is settled,
negotiations with Japan on fishing rights and sovereignty issues will be
resumed.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Wednesday the city government will consider
blocking the roads to the 16th and 17th piers at the Kaohsiung Harbor in
southern Taiwan if the central government vetos its plan to turn the area into a
pop music center.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks as she joined with city government department heads, staff
and activists from environmental and cultural groups in the southern port city
in staging a sit-in as a protest against  a notice  from  the Ministry  of
Transportation  and Communications  (MOTC)  demanding the city government
continue consulting with other government agencies and wharf facilities users
before putting its pop music center project into force.</P>
      <P>The MOTC said in its message that it was conveying a request from the Cabinet-
level Council for Culture Affairs.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said she couldn't accept such a proposal since the former
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration already approved the project
and promised to assist the city government in completing necessary
administrative procedures, including some law revisions, to facilitate
realization of the project.</P>
      <P>Chen, a DPP loyalist, said the transition of the reins of the government should
not lead to an abrupt change in a major policy issue like the pop music center
program.</P>
      <P>Chen said she will report on the case at a weekly Cabinet meeting Thursday as a
last-ditch effort to win the central government's support for the project.
Wednesday's sit-in proceeded in a form of concert as organizers didn't apply for

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday that the executive branch will definitely
consult with legislators before coming up with major policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>Ma gave the assurances during his first meeting with ruling party lawmakers
since he assumed office May 20. In addition to lawmakers from the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , independent legislators and those from the Non-Partisan
Solidarity Union -- a KMT ally -- were also present at the dinner.</P>
      <P>With the ruling party and its allies controlling a three-quarter majority in the
113-seat legislature, Ma said his administration will take full responsibility
for all policy issues and administrative results.</P>
      <P>In the process, Ma said, the executive branch will fully coordinate and
cooperate with the legislative arm of the government. "Opinions expressed by
lawmakers will be an integral part of our future policy formulation," he added.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew,  Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  and Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also attended the dinner where they extensively exchanged
views.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, some KMT lawmakers advised the president not to nominate any
controversial figures to the Control Yuan posts in order to avoid worsening
political bickering between the country's two major policial camps -- the KMT-
led "pan-blue" alliance and the pro-independence "pan-green" camp headed by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers made the suggestion amid reports that two former DPP
legislators -- Shen Fu-hsiung and Lee Wen-chung -- are likely to be nominated as
Control Yuan vice president and Control Yuan member, respectively. Shen had
already renounced his DPP membership as he was not seeing eye to eye with some
DPP hardliners on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>Several KMT lawmakers also urged Ma to get to the bottom of some scandals
involving former DPP administration officials, claiming that doing so would not
be a political purge but rather a move to establish clean politics.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to refer nominations lists to the legislature June 23 for the
confirmation of Control Yuan and Examination Yuan posts, in accordance with
constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>Because of domestic political wrangling, the Control Yuan -- the country's
supreme supervisory  body tasked with monitoring and arbitrating on matters
concerning elected officials and senior civil servants -- has been left empty
since the term of office of previous members expired Jan. 31, 2005. The then-
opposition KMT-controlled legislature repeatedly rejected former President Chen
Shui-bian's nomination list.</P>
      <P>The tenure of current Examination Yuan members will expire in August this year.
Vice President Vincent Siew is scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday
afternoon during which he will introduce the nominees for the institutions in
charge of recruitment and management of the country's civil servants.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Thursday, June 19, or the 16th day of the fifth month of the Year of
the Rat according to the lunar calendar. The following is a list of important
events that have occurred on this date in the past:

1566: King James I of England and VI of Scotland is born in the Scottish capital
of Edinburgh. The son of Mary Queen of Scots, he succeeded Elizabeth I as the
first Stuart king of England. His belief in the divine rights of kings and his
attempts to keep the peace with Spain led to the English Civil War.

1623: Blaise Pascal, French philosopher and mathematician, is born. Among his
achievements are the invention of an adding machine and the development of the
modern theory of probability.

1885: The Statue of Liberty arrives in New York as a gift from France.

1924: The "Red Army" of the Chinese communists takes Lungyen and other towns in
an attempt to establish a military base in western Fukien province in southern
China.

1935: The British government overrides the Treaty of Versailles signed at the
Paris Peace Conference in 1919 by agreeing to allow Germany a massive increase
in its naval strength.

1944: The Japanese fleet attacks US ships protecting a landing at Saipan,
resulting in considerable air and sea losses for Japan.

1953: Julius Rosenberg, 35, and his wife Ethel, 37, having been convicted by the
United States of passing atom bomb secrets to the Russians, are sent to the
electric chair at Sing Sing prison.

1956: American industrialist Thomas John Watson dies of a heart attack in New
York at the age of 82. He became president of the company that later became
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in 1924. Under Watson's
leadership, it became one of the world's most successful corporations.

1960: Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek and U.S. President Dwight D.
Eisenhower issue a joint communique pledging that their governments will
"continue to stand solidly behind the Sino-US Mutual Defense Treaty in meeting

    <TEXT>
      <P>The demand for high-end mobile devices showed continued strong growth in Taiwan
despite the saturation of the overall mobile handset market, according to a
report released Thursday by the International Data Corp. (IDC).</P>
      <P>The report showed that during the first quarter of this year, 1.83 million
mobile handsets were shipped in Taiwan, an increase of a mere 5 percent quarter-
on-quarter and 2 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>However, the shipment of converged mobile devices, including PDA phones and
smart phones, rose 20 percent year-on-year, a rate that was obviously much
higher than the overall market growth, the report said.</P>
      <P>John Cheng, a market analyst with IDC Taiwan, noted that the sales of converged
devices have been maintaining a double-digit annual growth rate, with the
shipment of converged devices as a share of the total mobile handset shipment
increasing from 5 percent in 2006 to 9 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>Cheng said an improved interface, a more streamlined size, larger screen, better
shape, increased functions, better multimedia effects and larger memory are
elements supporting the growth of converged devices.</P>
      <P>However, their high prices are limiting their accessibility to consumers, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 90 percent of converged devices cost over NT$10,000, and
the shipment of products at this price range accounts for 80 percent of the
total shipment, Cheng pointed out.</P>
      <P>Cheng said sellers will have to adjust their prices to attract more buyers
before the shipment of converged devices as a share of that total mobile handset
shipment can top 10 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of communications systems, the shipment of 3G and 3.5G mobile phones
accounted for more than 40 percent of the total mobile phone shipment during the
first quarter of 2008, posting an increase of more than 90 percent compared with
the same period last year, the report said.</P>
      <P>As more and more 2G mobile phone users are switching to 3G, shipment  of  GPRS
phones  declined  more  than  25  percent quarter-on-quarter and more than 50
percent year-on-year during the first quarter of 2008, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In terms of brands, products by Nokia and Sony Ericsson together seized a share
of more than 50 percent of Taiwan's mobile handset market during the first
quarter of 2008, while products by the Korean brands of Samsung and LG together
took a 20 percent share of the market, the report showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Number of severe enteroviral infections rises to 208</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19 (CNA)
06/19/08  15:39:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed four more cases of severe
enteroviral infection Thursday, bringing the total number of such cases to 208
so far this year.</P>
      <P>The four new cases included one in the eastern county of Hualien -- the first
severe enteroviral infection recorded in the county this year, said CDC Deputy
Director-General Chou Jih-haw.</P>
      <P>Chou said all four children saw an onset of symptoms in early June, but three of
them have already recovered and have been discharged from hospital, while the
fourth is expected to be discharged soon.</P>
      <P>The CDC has confirmed seven fatalities from severe enteroviral infection so far
this year and is examining whether a boy in the southern county of Chiayi who
died Wednesday had been infected with the virus.</P>
      <P>The results of tests on the boy's specimens will be available Friday at the
earliest, Chou said.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the boy, aged two years and 10 months, fell ill Sunday and
was not taken to a local hospital until Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The boy's family later requested that he be transferred to National Cheng Kung
University Hospital in Tainan City but was told there were no beds available,
Chou said.</P>
      <P>The boy was instead taken to Chi Mei Medical Center, also in Tainan, late
Tuesday and died early Wednesday, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Chou said the child had displayed symptoms typical of severe enteroviral
infection such as hand-foot-mouth syndrome, repeated jerky limb movements and
drowsiness, but added that the CDC will have to wait for the test results to
make an accurate assessment.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, almost all serious enterovirus cases recorded this year
were caused by envirovirus type 71 (EV71) -- the deadliest type of enterovirus
-- and all those infected were aged under 5, with the exception of one 14-year-
old resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>Forty-three percent of children aged 5 and under in Taiwan are not immune to
EV71, and as many as 90 percent of those aged 4 and under lack any immunity to
EV71, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a serious EV71 outbreak this year,  a Cabinet-level epidemic
response command center was activated last week.</P>
      <P>Also last week, the CDC issued a directive stipulating that kindergartens,
daycare centers and elementary schools must close classes for 10 days whenever
two or more enteroviral infections are reported in the same class within one
week.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in infants.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of EV71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Another EV71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 children infected, 15 of whom died.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-death penalty delegation has lauded Taiwan for suspending execution of
death row inmates over the past two years and urged the country to abolish the
law soon.</P>
      <P>The international delegation praised Taiwan for having the courage to put
executions on hold, while blasting Taiwan's neighbors, Japan and China, for not
doing the same.</P>
      <P>The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution last December to urge
the world to abolish capital punishment which activists see as a violation of
human rights, the delegation noted.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which consisted of members of the World Coalition Against the
Death Penalty (WCADP) , the Anti-Death Penalty Asian Network and Amnesty
International, said that the organizations fully support Taiwan's efforts to
scrap the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The delegation made the remarks Wednesday during a meeting with Judicial Yuan
President Lai In-jaw.</P>
      <P>The members of the delegation said they very much looked forward to seeing
Taiwan abolish the death penalty soon and serve as a model for other countries
that retain capital punishment on their law books.</P>
      <P>Prior to full abolition,  Taiwan should formally  adopt a moratorium on carrying
out the death penalty, the group suggested, adding that it hoped Taiwan's
legislature will repeal the capital punishment law.</P>
      <P>They further  urged that the legislature  soon ratify the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lai told the delegation that the Judicial Yuan "welcomes and
is pleased" to see Taiwan joining a global trend toward abolition of the death
penalty.</P>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan also believes that the Ministry of Justice, which is under the
executive branch of the government, should make an effort to have the death
penalty removed from Taiwan's law books, Lai said.</P>
      <P>In response, Thomas H. Speedy Rice, one of the members of the delegation and a
WCADP commissioner, described a court judgment as a dialogue between the
judicial system and people.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, judges should express their ideas on human rights in court
judgments in an effort to educate the public.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Thursday urged the Japanese government
to reopen fishery talks with Taiwan to resolve the disputes over fishing rights
around the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Asked in a regular press briefing about the progress of the discussions between
Taiwan and Japan over a recent boat accident near the Tiaoyutais, MOFA
spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said the foreign ministry is pursuing all diplomatic
channels to negotiate with its Japanese counterpart over the incident.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese recreational fishing boat, the Lienho, sank in the waters near the
disputed Taioyutai Islands after it collided with a Japanese patrol vessel June
10.</P>
      <P>"We hope that a satisfactory result can be obtained very soon, as the Japanese
authorities have shown goodwill," Yeh said. "We also hope that the Japanese
government will offer reasonable compensation to captain Ho of the Taiwanese
fishing boat as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Japan have been tense since the incident occurred.
Taiwan has recalled its representative to Japan over Tokyo's handling of the
incident and demanded that Japan offer an official apology and compensate the
boat owner for his losses.</P>
      <P>The collision  also sparked renewed  controversy  over the sovereignty of the
Tiaoyutais, or Senkaku Islands in Japanese, which are claimed by Taiwan, Japan
and China.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais have complicated
disputes between Taiwan and Japan over fishing rights in the waters around the
islands.</P>
      <P>The two sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
the dispute and both sides agreed to engage in another round of dialogue in
March 2006, but the talks never took place.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the Japanese authorities have been apathetic about the fishery
talks ever since the last round, despite Taiwan's continued efforts to point out
the importance of such negotiations.</P>
      <P>"The accident might serve as a catalyst to the resumption of the fishery talks,"
she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will send teams of experts to China to
help upgrade Taiwanese investors'  businesses  in an effort to boost their
corporate competitiveness in face of a harsher investment environment in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Beginning July 1 to the end of this year, at least 120 of Taiwan's China- based
manufacturers are expected to receive support from the experts, who will
evaluate their business operations and give them professional advise and
suggestions on how to cope with the rising cost of doing business in China,
Berton B.C. Chiu, director- general of the MOEA's Department of Investment
Services, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chiu said China's new labor contract law, as well as its ending of preferential
tax treatment for Taiwanese  investors  could potentially raise the production
cost and enhance market competition for Taiwanese investors in China.</P>
      <P>The new labor contract law, which came into effect this January, will increase
the labor cost by hiking the pay, as well as the compensation that a worker is
entitled to when dismissed by a company, noted Chiu.</P>
      <P>"Also, China since last year has cut down export tariff rebates, which narrow
the revenue generated from exporting businesses, " he added, indicating that was
another major factor shrinking the profit of Taiwan's China-based manufacturers,
many of which operate as exporters.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chiu said China imposed the takeaway of tax incentives for foreign
investments in 2007, as the corporate income tax rate for investors in the
coastal cities has risen from 15 percent to 25 percent.</P>
      <P>The senior official said that the MOEA's new program, executed by his
department, will target Taiwanese manufacturers of traditional industries as
they are hurt the most by such changes.</P>
      <P>"Our  program  will  facilitate  them to streamline  their manufacturing by
focusing efforts on production automation, technical upgrade, and logistics
improvement, " Chiu said.</P>
      <P>"The teams of experts will arrange scores of seminars and workshops in both
China and Taiwan to discuss the emerging issues and possible solutions of
investing in China, " Chiu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the ministry will also provide legal advice on its Web pages and
publications to the business owners to help them solve investment disputes.</P>
      <P>The experts will include industry specialists from the ministry and the
Industrial Technology Research Institute, a local think tank.</P>
      <P>As for the future stages of this program, Chiu said his department will keep an
eye on the responses and demands from the Taiwanese investors who join the
program, when developing additional services to help them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that Taiwan's
representative to Brazil Chou Shu-yeh, who has permanent residency in the South
American country, tendered his resignation a few days ago.</P>
      <P>"Three of the MOFA's diplomatic representatives have permanent residency in
foreign countries. They are the representatives to Japan, Brazil and Bahrain,"
MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"Apart from the representative to Japan Koh Se-kai, who tendered his resignation
June 10, the envoy to Brazil Chou Shu-yeh also resigned a few days ago," she
added.</P>
      <P>A United Daily report claimed that an investigation by the Cabinet-level Central
Personnel Administration (CPA) found that, among the approximately 1,000
diplomatic officials posted overseas, nearly 30 have permanent foreign residency
status.</P>
      <P>However, Yeh said that number includes not only MOFA personnel, but also public
servants posted overseas by other government agencies.</P>
      <P>She said the foreign ministry has around 650 employees assigned to foreign
countries and that none of its public officials hold dual citizenship. Only one
political appointee, representative to Switzerland George Liu, has United States
citizenship, she added.</P>
      <P>The report also stated that the CPA will keep a record of the public officials
who have permanent residency in foreign countries, for the purpose of assessing
allegiance, but it does not require public officials to renounce such status.</P>
      <P>"The foreign ministry  will respect and observe the CPA's regulations," Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has come under fire from the opposition
over the foreign residency  issue,  with some legislators qeustioning the
loyalty of officials who hold permanent residency status in other countries.</P>
      <P>The issue came under the spotlight after Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou
apologized for obtaining a U.S. green card in 2005 when he was the Republic of
China ambassador to Guatemala. He said he had officially renounced that status
one month before assuming his ministerial position on May 20.</P>
      <P>The Nationality Act forbids R.O.C.  nationals with foreign citizenship from
assuming public office and stipulates that those holding such status should be
removed from their posts. The law, however, does not forbid public servants from
holding permanent resident status in foreign country.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou nominated former National Chiao Tung University President
Chang Chun-yen as president of the Examination Yuan Thursday, to fill the post
of the top official in charge of recruiting and managing the country's civil
servants.</P>
      <P>Chang's nomination is likely to raise some eyebrows as he was closely connected
with former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party and had previously served as an adviser to Chen in the run-up
of the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Ma also nominated Wu Chin-lin, a deputy secretary-general of the ruling
Kuomintang, as vice president of the Examination Yuan, and 17 other members of
the institution.</P>
      <P>The tenure of current Examination Yuan members will expire in August.</P>
      <P>Ma chose the 19 nominees from among 36 hopefuls who were short-listed by an
Examination Yuan member nomination task force that reviewed 170 recommendations
and applications for the positions.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew was scheduled to hold a news conference later in the
day to introduce the nominees for the government branch.</P>
      <P>The Examination Yuan is responsible for the civil service system in the Republic
of China. Specifically, it oversees examination, qualification screening,
security of tenure, pecuniary aid in case of death, retirement of civil
servants, and all legal matters relating to the employment, discharge,
performance evaluation, scale of salaries, promotion, transfer, commendation and
award of civil servants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Presidential Office is expected to announce within days its list
of nominees for the Control Yuan -- the country's supreme supervisory body
tasked with monitoring and arbitrating on matters concerning elected officials
and senior civil servants.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has been left empty since the term of office of previous
members expired Jan. 31, 2005 as a result of domestic political wrangling.
Former President Chen's list of Control Yuan nominations  was  repeatedly
rejected  by the  then-opposition KMT-controlled legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to refer the nomination lists to the legislature June 23 for
confirmation of the Control Yuan and Examination Yuan posts, in accordance with
constitutional provisions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Revised law allows Taiwan people to use mini links</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
06/19/08  17:56:40
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved a law amendment Thursday that allows citizens from
Taiwan proper to use the direct sea transportation links -- popularly known as
the mini links -- between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and several ports in
China's Fujian Province</P>
      <P>Residents on Taiwan proper with valid travel documents for entry to both Taiwan
and China are now permitted to travel via the mini link routes, effective from
June 19, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said at a news
conference after an Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>In the past, only Kinmen and Matsu residents and Fujian-based Taiwan businessmen
and their dependents were eligible to use the mini links.</P>
      <P>The expansion of the direct ferry service will not benefit just Kinmen and Matsu
residents, but will also provide an alternative for Taiwan people traveling to
China, in conjunction with the projected establishment of direct weekend charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait from July 4, she said.</P>
      <P>Enhancing the mini links, along with the direct flight initiative and the entry
of significantly larger numbers of tourists from China, was one of President Ma
Ying-jeou's campaign promises, and his administration  immediately  launched
assessments  and made the necessary arrangements after its inauguration May 20,
Lai said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has started upgrading the
Kinmen and Matsu ports to have them ready by Sept. 15. for the expanded
operations, while the National Security Bureau, the Ministry of National Defense
and the Coast Guard Administration have begun making related arrangements, she
explained.</P>
      <P>In the middle and long term, the MAC and relevant agencies will work on crafting
policies to further advance the mini links and complete a negotiation plan
within two months to talk with China on the policies, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Lai reported, an average number of 300,000 Taiwanese
people per year sailed to China via the mini links, while only about 37,000
people returned to Kinmen or Matsu from China via the routes each year.</P>
      <P>In view of this big gap, the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , will negotiate on the issue of seeking a balance in the two-
way passenger volumes in their next round of talks, according to the MAC
chairwoman.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese side has already responded positively to the proposal raised by SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung with ARATS President Chen Yunlin during their historic
meeting last week in Beijing, " she noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to the short-term benefits likely to be brought about by the
expansion of the mini links, Lai said, a long-term economic development plan is
being considered to better take care of the local people on the two outlying
islands.</P>
      <P>To this end, the Council for Economic Planning and Development is drafting a
comprehensive blueprint, she said.</P>
      <P>The mini links were initiated by Taiwan in January 2001 in an effort to mitigate
the impact of the lack of direct transportation connections between Taiwan
proper and China since 1949 as a result of a Chinese civil war.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou made an inspection tour Thursday of the outlying island
of Matsu, which is located closer to China than to Taiwan proper and is one of
the most important bastions of the Republic of China, according to the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>In his first offshore tour since he assumed office May 20, Ma inspected military
facilities around Matsu and was briefed on defense preparedness there.</P>
      <P>Ma told officers posted on the island that military and defense preparedness is
imperative for Taiwan though relations across the Taiwan Strait have eased.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China military will never challenge China, but it will also not
be daunted, " said Ma in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the ROC armed
forces.</P>
      <P>Noting that Matsu's tourism development can parallel the island's military role,
Ma said it is one of his administration's goals to build Matsu into a "lean and
mean" bastion that will also be a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Following his tour of Matsu's military establishments, Ma called on Magistrate
Chen Hsueh-sheng and thanked him for Matsu's staunch support of the Kuomintang
in the March 22 presidential election. The strong backing of Matsu residents
helped him to win a decisive victory  over Frank  Hsieh of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma and his running mate -- Vice President Vincent Siew -- won the highest
percentage of votes in Matsu among all the constituencies in the country in the

    <HEADLINE>Special leave urged for parents with enterovirus-infected children</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two civil groups urged the government Thursday to grant special leave with pay
to working parents to encourage them to stay home to take care of children
infected with enterovirus, as the virus continues to spread around the country.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Teachers' Association and the National Working-Class Parents
Association, which made the request, said the measure is essential to containing
the enteroviral outbreak, because by staying home, parents would not need to
send their sick children to daycare or after-school tutorial centers, where the
virus can easily spread to other children.</P>
      <P>From the start of this year until Thursday, Taiwan has recorded 208 severe
enteroviral infections, seven of which have resulted in death, according to the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>CDC data show that almost all serious enterovirus cases recorded this year were
caused by envirovirus type 71 (EV71) -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- and
all those infected were aged under 5, with the exception of one 14-year-old
resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a serious EV71 outbreak this year, the CDC issued a directive
last week stipulating that kindergartens, daycare centers and elementary schools
must suspend classes for 10 days whenever two or more enteroviral infections are
reported in the same class within one week.</P>
      <P>This poses a problem for working parents.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's Gender Equality in Employment Law allows workers to take up to
seven days of family leave per year, to take care of sick family members or cope
with other family matters, many working parents cannot afford such leave because
they are unpaid, said Tsai Yuan-chen, president of the National Working-Class
Parents Association.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, in the event of classes being canceled for as long as 10 days owing
to enteroviral infections, the number of family leave days parents can take will
be insufficient to cope with the stay-at-home children, Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Researchers find new approach to fight chronic myeloid leukemia</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical researchers at National Taiwan University (NTU) have proved that by
enhancing a specific genetic expression, the cancer cells of chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) can be suppressed, according to local news reports on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The researchers also believe that such an approach can be developed into a new
clinical therapy to control, or even cure, chronic myeloid leukemia -- a type of
cancer related to the blood and bone marrow.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level National Science Council, which is sponsoring the
project, the incidence of chronic myeloid leukemia in Taiwan is about 0.74 per
100,000 people.</P>
      <P>Even though there are many effective medications  for CML patients,  including
Gleevec --  an anti-cancer drug with few side-effects -- the cost of treatment
could be as high as NT$60,000 to NT$70,000 per month (about US$1,974 to
US$2,302) , making it unaffordable for most patients.</P>
      <P>The other drawback is that although Gleevec can extend patients' life expectancy
by up to 15 years, about 20 percent of users develop resistance to the drug.</P>
      <P>NTU's new approach could one day become an effective, yet inexpensive
alternative for treating chronic myeloid leukemia, said project participant
Chang Zee-fen, a professor at NTU's Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology.</P>
      <P>"What riveted our attention was a gene dubbed Gfi-1B (growth factor
independence-1B), " Chang said.</P>
      <P>"CML cancer cells have the ability to inhibit the apoptosis process, thus
extending their life span, " he explained. "However, when Gfi-1B's genetic
expression is enhanced, with the help of low-dosage  arsenic oxides,  CML cancer
cells will lose their anti-ageing capability and eventually die."</P>
      <P>Chang noted that with further research, this discovery could help to develop new
drugs or new treatments.</P>

      <P>Myanmar's government has agreed to allow the Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassion
Relief Tzu Chi Foundation to help reconstruct cyclone-hit areas, and has invited
the Tzu Chi to cooperate with the government in rehabilitation efforts, a
spokesman of the foundation said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar from March 2-3, had caused more than 100,000
deaths, with thousands missing and more than 1 million homeless. However, the
country's governing junta has been blocking foreign aid workers and disaster
relief teams from entering the country.</P>
      <P>The  invitation  has  made  Tzu Chi Foundation  the first nongovernmental
organization to receive official permission to conduct  humanitarian  assistance
in Myanmar,  Joe Wang,  the foundation's vice director of the Religious Culture
and Humanitarian Aid Department, said in a press conference.</P>
      <P>"As long as the locals residents or the government need our help, we at the Tzu
Chi Foundation will for sure deliver our love and concern to places hurt in any
calamity, " said Wang, who is in charge of the Tzu Chi's overseas relief work.</P>
      <P>An invitation sent to Dharma Master Cheng Yen, founder of the foundation, by the
Myanmarese Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement (MSWRR) dated
June 14 noted that alongside the ongoing rehabilitation  and reconstruction
programmes for the storm-hit region, the Myanmar government accepts Tzu Chi's
reconstruction proposal.</P>
      <P>"We welcome the cooperation of rehabilitation and reconstruction tasks and agree
in principle to your project," the letter said, with the signature of Aung Tun
Khaing, acting director general of the MSWRR.</P>
      <P>In order to conduct further relief work in the storm-hit areas, mainly the
densely populated and low-lying Irrawaddy Delta, another group of Tzu Chi relief
workers, including 34 medical doctors, nurses, architects and volunteers, is
slated to head for Myanmar Friday.</P>
      <P>The group will take 32 boxes of medicine that can be used to treat 5,000 people,
2,000 pieces of mosquito coil incense, and environmentally friend utensils to
the survivors of the cyclone, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The doctors and nurses will also treat the people in need, as well as assess
the reconstruction work to be done in the future, " he added.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Foundation is a nonprofit organization founded in 1966 by Cheng Yen
on the east coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It has been contributing to improving social and community services, medical
care, education and humanism in Taiwan and around the world based on Cheng's
firm belief that "to save the world we must begin by transforming human hearts."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taiwan scheduled to open itself to more Chinese tourists next month, the
world's tallest building, Taipei 101, is making preparations to cash in on
Chinese "big spenders" who are expected to join tours to the island.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- two quasi-
official intermediary bodies in charge of cross-strait issues -- sealed a deal
on June 13 to launch direct weekend charter flights and allow Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan beginning July 18.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA Thursday, Laser Liu, vice president of the Taipei
Financial Center Corporation -- owner of Taipei 101 -- said the landmark
building is very much looking forward to the coming of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Nearly all tourists consider Taipei 101, the tallest occupied building in the
world and landmark of Taipei, a must-visit place, Liu said.I believe we stand at
a more favorable position than other department stores to attract more Chinese
tourists, as they would come to the shopping center after visiting the top of
the world.</P>
      <P>He said the shopping mall of Taipei 101 has already started printing pamphlets
in simplified Chinese characters, training its employees to recognize such
characters which are different from the complicated Chinese characters Taiwan
uses, and to learn some idioms and phrases used by people from mainland China so
that Chinese tourists will feel more welcome.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 is a multi-functional place where you can shop for high-end brand
products or Taiwanese specialties, taste world-class gourmet food or local
delicacies and take a panoramic view of Taipei City from the observatory
platform, Liu said.You can even do banking here as we have four banks here in
the mall."</P>
      <P>The skyscraper's  shopping mall houses many luxury brands' boutiques. Some
luxury market experts believe that Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan, like those
visiting Hong Kong, will show a special interest in buying luxury goods as goods
are cheaper here due to lower tariffs compared to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the 101-floor skyscraper currently draws 3,000 tourists who visit
its observatory platform every day and he estimated the number is going to be
doubled after July.</P>
      <P>Visiting the top of the world is our best-selling point and it also separates
Taipei 101 from other department stores, as tourists are drawn specifically to
that,he saidThis is an all-in-one place to satisfy every expectation from
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 estimated that its revenue will increase by 20 percent with the
opening to Chinese tourists.  "This is even a conservative guess only,said Liu
with confidence.</P>
      <P>Inaugurated in 2004, Taipei 101 has been hailed as one of the Seven New Wonders
of the World by Newsweek magazine in 2006 and Seven Wonders of Engineering by
the Discovery Channel in 2005.</P>
      <P>Combining  tradition  and modernity  in ways  that  appear simultaneously Asian
and international, the landmark stands as an icon of Taipei and Taiwan as a
whole.</P>
      <P>It was overtaken in height on July 21, 2007 by the Burj Dubai in Dubai, United
Arab Emirates, upon the completion of that buildings 141st floor. The title
ofworlds tallest buildingstill rests with Taipei 101, though, as international
architectural standards define a building as a structure capable of being fully
occupied. The Burj Dubai is on course to claim the title once its construction
is finished in 2009.</P>

      <P>A biologist at Kenting National Park in Pingtung County has spotted an unknown
species of longhorn beetle, which is believed to have never been recorded
before, sources at the park administration said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said that the new species was first found in 2003 by Chung Yi-ting, a
researcher at the park's Houbihu Service Station, and Chung spotted the same
species for a second time early this year.</P>
      <P>Several taxonomists who had examined the specimen said this longhorn beetle of
euryclytosemia genus may be a new species. The park administration has decided
to request assistance from other experts around the world to certificate the
findings.</P>
      <P>Currently, only one species in the euryclytosemia genus have been spotted in
Taiwan. The species,  dubbed euryclytosemia nomurai hayashi, was first found by
a Japanese biologist in 1963.</P>
      <P>According to the park administration, Chung had studied the longhorn beetle for
several years before joining the park. After he was assigned to the service
station, Chung began to catalogue the longhorn beetle species in the park.</P>
      <P>To date, Chung has independently recorded more than 100 species of the longhorn
beetles, one-eighth of the total 800 kinds recorded in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>In Taiwan, many parents seeking medical services for their children who are
required to come to Taipei for treatment have problems finding accommodation and
psychological support, but some of these families have found support through
Ronald McDonald House (RMH), operated by the fast food giant.</P>
      <P>The first RMH was established in Philadelphia in the United States in 1974 by
the Ronald McDonald House Charities, with the aim of providing temporary
lodgings for families accompanying sick children to cities far from their homes
to obtain better medical services.</P>
      <P>@Many local parents of seriously ill children choose to go to Taipei for better
medical treatment, so the first RMH was set up in the city's Neihu district in
2007 to serve such families, RMH staff said at a Thursday press conference,
adding that 88 percent of the families they accommodate come from central and
southern Taiwan.@@</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the RMH in May, 67 percent of these families
earn a monthly income of less than NT$50,000 (US$1,646) , and each trip to
Taipei costs them an average of NT$20,000, putting a heavy burden on them in
addition to their medical costs, said Jesse Tsao, chief executive of RMH
Charities, Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, the RMH in Taiwan has helped more than 300 families,
providing free accommodation and transport from the house to hospitals, said RMH
staff.</P>
      <P>In addition, it also organizes various activities such as movie screenings to
ease the pressure on the parents and their children, they added.</P>
      <P>Ling, a 12-year-old girl suffering from a kidney complaint whose mother spoke at
the press conference, had previously to get on the road at 3 a.m. with her
mother from Tainan in southern Taiwan, in order to avoid spending the night in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"With RMH, not only has our economic burden been eased but we also get support

      <P>The owner of a Taipei-based trade company has been indicted for exporting
controlled high-tech items to North Korea and entering false information on the
shipping documents, according to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors office stated in its indictment that over the past two years,
Trans Merits Co., owned by Tsai Hsien-tai, delivered certain items to North
Korea, in contravention of the government's Sensitive Commodity List.</P>
      <P>The list identifies 540 items ranging from plant seeds to military weapons.
Trade companies must obtain permission from the government before exporting any

      <P>In 2006, the company exported to North Korea three sets of water filters for
electro-discharge machines (EMDs), falsely entering South Korea on the shipping
invoices as the destination. It also exported two shipments of second-hand
computers to North Korea by air in September last year.</P>
      <P>Some components of the items shipped could be used to make advanced weapons, the
indictment stated.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, Tsai was indicted for violating the Foreign Trade
Act and could face a prison sentence of up to two years, or a fine under
NT$300,000 (US$9,868).</P>
      <P>However, considering that Tsai cooperated with the investigators and does not
have a criminal record, the prosecutors have recommended a suspended sentence,
according to the indictment.</P>

      <P>The administration of newly elected President Ma Ying-jeou failed to pass the
threshold score of 60 for its first month's performance review, with a poll
conducted by the opposition party indicating only 47.8 percent of the public was
satisfied with the government.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll respondents gave the Ma administration a score of 59.6 on a
scale of 0-100, said Chen Chun-lin, director of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)'s Public Opinion Survey Center.</P>
      <P>Ma won 58 percent of the votes in the March 22 presidential election, defeating
his DPP rival Frank Hsieh by a landslide.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that 53.8 percent of the people surveyed expressed
dissatisfaction with the new government's efforts to boost the economy since it
was sworn in on May 20, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 63.3 percent said they were not happy with the Ma administration's
efforts to stabilize the prices of goods, while 44.1 percent said they were
disappointed with the government's performance on enhancing social welfare, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Another 53.7 percent were dissatisfied with the government's handling of a
controversy involving public officials holding U.S. green cards, while 59.7
percent were displeased with the government's relief efforts to help central and
southern Taiwan, which were recently hard hit by floods, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers previously accused several officials in the Ma administration of
failing to renounce their foreign citizenship or permanent residency before
taking office and harshly questioned their loyalty to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen added that 44.4 percent of the poll respondents were not happy with Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan's performance in the past 30 days, although 47.5 percent said
they were satisfied.</P>
      <P>On the overall performance of the Cabinet team, 44.2 percent gave a negative
response, compared with another 47.8 percent who expressed satisfaction, Chen
noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said those who are not happy with the new government include not only DPP
supporters, but also those who support neither party, as well as Ma's own
supporters and he described it as a warning sign for the new government.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, his party has an approval rating of roughly 23 percent in
other polls.</P>
      <P>Asked which Cabinet member performed the best so far, 5.6 percent chose
Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih, 4 percent selected
Foreign Minister Francisco H. L. Ou, while 3.3 percent opted for Justice
Minister Wang Ching-feng, the poll indicates.</P>
      <P>However, 68.4 percent did not express their opinion over the question.</P>
      <P>Asked to choose the worst Cabinet member, 13.5 percent selected Ou, 13.1 percent
chose Defense Minister Chen Chao-min, while 3.7 picked Council of Agriculture
Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung, the poll shows.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted between June 17-18. A total of 795 valid samples were
collected, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.55 percent.</P>

      <P>The 21st Century Education Association claimed at a news conference Thursday
that a majority of high school students have been suffering from the pressure of
school entrance examinations as much now as students were 10 years ago and they
urged the education authorities to reform its examination policies to improve
the quality of education.</P>
      <P>The association made the appeal following the completion of five forums held
around Taiwan over the last five months in which not only junior and high school
students but also teachers and school principals exchanged views on the
country's education policies and they difficulties they encounter.</P>
      <P>Noting that although Taiwan has introduced education reforms over the last
decade, examinations are still the biggest burden and source of stress for
students, Nancy Nee, the foundation's chairwoman, expressed hope that the
government will pay more attention to the matter.</P>
      <P>"The government should apologize for its poor education policies to the students
who have suffered from the pressure caused by examinations, " according to Nee,
who added that the authorities should also address the issue of curriculum
subjects "that are not really useful for the students."</P>
      <P>Nee said in the press conference that based on the data collected in the forums,
most of the participants believe they cannot learn what they really want or need
at school, because they have to spend most of their time preparing for exams.</P>
      <P>"Almost 75 percent of the students at the forums even feel they lack time to
exercise, " Nee said, adding that at least one school principal said in the
forums that "our education system must be changed."</P>
      <P>In order to establish a better learning environment for students, Nee suggested
that the education authorities reduce the number of examinations, adding that
teachers should also have a degree of decision-making powers to determine what
they teach.</P>
      <P>"The government, the school and the family should work closely to improve the
learning environment, " Nee reiterated, adding that the subjects taught should
be able to help students deal with their career development.</P>
      <P>The 21st Century Education Association, based in the central city of Taichung,
was established by Nee in 2003 to promote an "education revolution" to improve
the learning environment for students.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu might not be able to visit China on board a maiden
direct weekend charter flight on July 4, although the government has been
assessing an easing of restrictions on China visits by local government chiefs,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government would not have enough time to deal with Hu's application to
visit China in July as it needs time to relax relevant laws and regulations and
it won't be ready before July, " Lai said following an Executive Yuan meeting.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Hu reiterated his hope of being able to take a July 4
charter flight directly to China from Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung
County's Shalu township close to Taichung City, as the direct cross-Taiwan
Strait weekend charter flight service will be put in place that same day.</P>
      <P>Hu said he remains firm on that idea and added that he will do his best to push
the central government in Taipei to allow him to board the historic direct
cross-strait flight.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, many Taichung citizens hope that he could lead a delegation to
visit China and promote tourism there, using the opportunity of the landmark
direct weekend flights - the first since the two sides split at the end of a
civil war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Hu said he will invite four city mayors and county magistrates from central
Taiwan to accompany him on the China tour if permitted.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city mayor asserted that his project to visit China is free of
political considerations and urged the central government to back his plan.</P>
      <P>The mayor also gave assurances that there will be enough China-bound passengers
from Taichung to justify the three routes, pointing to the fact that there are
53 flights from Taichung to Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen every week.</P>
      <P>"Most Kinmen-bound travelers from Taichung usually proceed to China," he noted.</P>
      <P>Direct ferry services are maintained between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen
and Matzu and China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuomintang (KMT) government's program, Sungshan Airport and Taiwan
Taoyuan International  Airport in northern  Taiwan, Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in the south will service
direct cross-strait charter flights in the initial stages when the program is
launched early next month.</P>
      <P>The direct charter flight initiative, along with the admission of a
significantly larger number of tourists from China, was one of President Ma
Ying-jeou's campaign promises.</P>
      <P>Citing concerns among some local people that aviation companies might lack an
interest in plying direct charter flights from central Taiwan to China, Hu said
a day earlier that he would try his best to attract more carriers to run the
business between the two sides after the service is launched on July 4.</P>
      <P>"I will do my best to court more aviation companies to operate cross-strait
charter flights from Taichung City to major Chinese cities such as Xiamen,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, " Hu said at a municipal council intepellation session
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines and UNI Airways have agreed to assess the possibility of
operating weekend charter flights from Taichung to the three Chinese
destinations, he said.</P>
      <P>"The  Taichung  city government  stands  ready  to provide comprehensive
assistance," Hu said.</P>

      <P>Microsoft has launched Taiwan's first-ever Microsoft Innovation Center (MIC),
with the aim of integrating local and overseas talent, technologies and
resources to help its Taiwanese industry partners upgrade their software
engineering ability.</P>
      <P>With such initiative focusing on the development of information and
communication technology (ICT), Taiwan is on its way to becoming an innovation
center of the world, Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Yiin-Chii-ming said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The innovation center in Nangang Software Park in Taipei comes five years after
Microsoft Taiwan, the local branch company of the American software giant,
launched Taiwan's first Microsoft Technology Center in 2003.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a launching ceremony for the new center, Yiin said software
development is the key to upgrading the ICT industry, because all of the
applications in this field are based on software systems.</P>
      <P>Our ICT industry will gain more business opportunities by collaborating  with
the new MIC to develop the so-called web applications of the next generation,the
minister added.</P>
      <P>According to Microsoft Taiwan, the center was co-invested by the ministry and
the software company, though the company refused to disclose the details of the
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Taipei center is one of the biggest Microsoft research arms in the world,
according to Nigel Burton, the general manger of Developer &amp; Platform
Evangelism for the Microsoft Greater China Region.</P>
      <P>We could innovate together, Burton stressed, indicating the center will
strengthen the partnership between the multi-billion software enterprise and
Taiwans ICT companies.</P>
      <P>The new MIC is also set to form partnerships with dozens of local companies,
including ERA Digital Media, a local media company; Trend Micro, the world's
leading provider of anti-virus and Internet content; and the Institute for
Information Industry, a local think tank, according to Microsoft Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is in a unique position among many of the infrastructure technologies,
Burton noted, citing the leading status of TaiwansICT industry, which he said
tops worldwide market shares in notebook PCs, motherboards, and liquid crystal
displays (LCDs).</P>
      <P>Echoing Yiins point about building the island as the worlds innovation center,
the top officer from Microsofts Beijing office said many Asian countries could
contribute to the development of Taiwans software.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has to become great at managing people and directing teams, which may not
always be inside Taiwan,Burton said.</P>
      <P>Asked how much the new center costs, Burton responded that he is not clear about
the cost of constructing the facility, but said the brain power from the
center's lab engineers are priceless.</P>
      <P>These top Microsoft engineers are a very big investment, Burton noted.</P>
      <P>The Taipei MIC will bring together approximately 100 Microsoft engineers
worldwide, including 20 from the U.S., 50 from China, and 30 from Taiwan, said
Microsoft Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Microsoft at present has more than 100 innovation centers worldwide in as many
as 37 countries.</P>

      <P>The only graduate from a tiny elementary school on the outlying island of Penghu
was swamped by mountains of prizes and gifts on graduation day Thursday,
prompting her to smile through her tears.</P>
      <P>Chang yi-ling, 12, was the only graduate this year from the Hsiaomen Elementary
School located on Hsiaomen Islet to the west of Penghu Island, which lies about
41 km off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>Chang was the only diploma receiver at the graduation ceremony, which was
attended by scores of adults, including the principal, teachers, parents and
guests, as well as the school's eight other students.</P>
      <P>She was awarded more than 30 prizes, ranging from the Penghu Magistrate Prize,
the Principal Prize and the Township Chief Prize to the Parents Association's
Prize, as well as many others.</P>
      <P>The graduation activities commenced the day before, when a hometown tour, a
water balloon-throwing party and a diving for treasure event were launched for
Chang to celebrate her commencement.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, Chang was reduced to tears when the eight younger students at
the school sang her a farewell song.</P>
      <P>Praising her as an "outstanding" and "unforgettable" student, Chang's teacher,
Lin Tsung-teh, said she was not only exceptional academically but also performed
with excellence in other fields, including taking first prize in a county-wide
dance competition, first prize in an English speech competition involving the
whole county, and second prize in the graphic design category of Penghu's fine
arts competition.</P>
      <P>The audience roared with laughter when Lin noted that "Chang was elected the
class role model student every year."</P>
      <P>Lin said the good things about Chang's one-on-one education were that the
teaching schedule could be fully controlled and there were no barriers to
communication between the teacher and the student.</P>
      <P>The downside, he said, was the lack of competition, which meant that she could
easily have lacked motivation and could tend to ask fewer questions.</P>
      <P>For her part, Chang said she "suffered a lot of pressure as the only student in
the class," complaining that she "could not have a secret doze when I felt
sleepy. "</P>
      <P>Hsiaomen Islet is about 10 nautical miles from Penghu's capital city of Makung.
It has a population of around 200 people.</P>

      <P>Rashly withdrawing troops from outlying Kinmen Island in the name of developing
tourism would be risky, Premier Liu Chao-hsiung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Pulling the army out of Kinmen Island is not just an economic issue but would
also deeply involve national security and defense concerns, " Liu told reporters
during an informal gathering.</P>
      <P>"It would also be very risky for the government to decide the issue based on a
referendum without fully understanding the overall situation and having
comprehensive communications with the public, " he warned.</P>
      <P>The premier promised that the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) will iron out a blueprint to help the Kinmen county
government boost economic development across the board over the long term for
the island in line with the expansion of the mini links -- direct ferry services
maintained between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng broached the idea of a troop pullout to promote
tourism during a meeting with President Ma Ying-jeou June 11, out of grave
concern that the opening of direct charter flights between Taiwan proper and
China from July 4 will marginalize Kinmen's role in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Although the central government has agreed to enhance the mini links by allowing
residents from Taiwan proper to use the routes, Lee complained that
complementary measures have not been put in place, according to local media
reports.</P>
      <P>"No flights are available between Taiwan and Kinmen after 3 p.m.," Lee was
quoted as saying by a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>The speaker and the deputy speaker of the Kinmen County Council have both
expressed opposition to Lee's troop withdrawal proposal.</P>

      <P>A tropical storm that was upgraded from a low pressure system Thursday might
affect Taiwan's weather from next Monday, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
reported that same day.</P>
      <P>As of 6 p.m. Thursday, Tropical Storm Fengshen was centered about 1,600 km from

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pingtung county government is strongly opposed to the Council of Agriculture
(COA) 's recent decision to grant licenses to 96 coral-mining boats, a county
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the county government sent a written request to the COA's
Fisheries Agency asking it not to allow coral-mining boats to be based at the
southern county's ports, said Hsu Wen-chi, the county's fisheries section chief.</P>
      <P>The council's decision, made in May, will wreak havoc on marine resources, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>To protect these resources, the county government in 1995 announced a ban on
mining coral from reefs within 12 nautical miles of the county's coast, Hsu
explained.</P>
      <P>The council's decision to allow coral mining will destroy the results of the
county government's years of efforts to preserve these resources, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The county government will stick to its stance to ensure the sustainable use of
marine resources and the livelihood of fishermen in the long run, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>He also said that issuing coral-mining licenses to boats smaller than 20 tons
falls within the county government's jurisdiction and that it will not issue any
such licenses.</P>
      <P>However, it is up to the Fisheries Agency's to decide on license for boats over
20 tons, he noted.</P>
      <P>The county government is therefore urging the Fisheries Agency not to allow
coral-miners to use the county's ports as operating bases, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The Fisheries Agency's permits will give coral-mining boats an excuse to operate
in areas allowed by the COA, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations put into effect May 24, boats can exploit coral in
five areas, all of which are outwith Taiwan's 12 nautical mile limit, over a
total area of 7,811 square kilometers. The quantity of coral taken is limited to
120 kg per boat per year.</P>
      <P>The five areas are located near northeastern, southern and southwestern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The county government will crack down on any boat found mining coral within 12
nautical miles of the county's coast, in accordance with the law, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Violators could face up to three years in prison and a maximum fine of
NT$150,000 (US$4,937), according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>County officials informed COA Deputy Minister Hu Sing-hwa of the local
government's stance when he visited Pingtung a day earlier. Hu said that the COA
will hold a public hearing to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Deep-water coral, which grows a very slow rate of about 0.1 centimeter per year,
is often used to make jewelry.</P>

      <P>The Changhua county government has launched a program to recruit more volunteers
to offer services to county residents, Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cho told a news conference that he hopes the number of volunteers on a special
volunteer team could reach as many as 15,000 by the end of this year, adding
that he has decided to serve as a volunteer.</P>
      <P>According to statistics recently released by a county government agency, the
total economic value generated by the county's volunteers in 2007 alone reached
more than NT$110 million (US$3.62 million), Cho explained.</P>
      <P>He said the fact that there is a growing number of people showing strong
willingness to serve the public on a voluntary basis has prompted the county
government to organize a special volunteer team to help promote public interest.</P>
      <P>The team comprises volunteers from county government agencies, business sectors
and residential communities, as well as colleges, universities and senior high
schools, according to the county's Social Affairs Bureau officials.</P>
      <P>In an effort to entice more people to do volunteer work, the county government
has decided to encourage business sectors to offer preferential measures to
benefit their volunteers, the officials continued.</P>
      <P>The county government is also determined to help promote the rights of all
volunteers as stipulated in the Volunteer Service Law, which was passed by the
Ministry of the Interior in 2001 to better integrate available manpower at all

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed hope Thursday that the Legislative Yuan will
approve his Examination Yuan nominees to allow those selected to bring new
prospects for the civil service.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after unveiling the list of 21 nominees at the Presidential
Office.  The list will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval June
23.</P>
      <P>Ma nominated former National Chiao Tung University President Chang Chun-yen --
who has connections with former President Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party -- as president of the Examination Yuan, which is
in charge of recruiting and managing the country's civil servants.</P>
      <P>Ma said he chose Chang because of his prestigious status in technology research,
which Ma said will help create a different view in the future selection of civil
servants, as previous Examination Yuan  presidents  have tended  to have
literature  or history backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Ma also nominated Wu Chin-lin, a deputy secretary-general of the ruling
Kuomintang, as vice president of the Examination Yuan. Ma said Wu is very
familiar with operation of the Examination Yuan and will be a good partner for
Chang.</P>
      <P>The other 19 were nominated from among 36 hopefuls who were short-listed by an
Examination Yuan member nomination task force that reviewed 170 recommendations
and applications for the positions.</P>
      <P>Ma said he selected the nominees according to both their professional and moral
abilities, without consideration of their political stances, in the hope of
allowing the organization to operate independently as required and protected by
the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said at a news conference to introduce the nominees
later in the day that the nominees have professional expertise in different
fields ranging from medicine, engineering, criminology and history to public
administration.</P>
      <P>The nominees include Lee Sheuan, dean of Chung Shan Medical University's College
of Nursing, Kao Ming-chien, former People First Party legislator, and Pu Chung-
chen, director-general of the National Museum of Prehistory.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out that the nominees' average age is 58.1 and that five are women.
He added that each is believed to be able to carry out Examination Yuan duties
professionally and without political bias.</P>
      <P>In response to questions about whether the nominees have foreign nationalities
or have permanent residency of foreign countries -- issues that have received a
lot of attention recently -- Siew said each has been informed that renouncement
of any foreign nationality will be required should their nomination be approved.</P>
      <P>He added that the nomination task force did not touch upon the issue of foreign
permanent residency but will discuss how to deal with it if necessary.</P>
      <P>The tenure of the incumbent Examination Yuan members will expire Aug. 31 and the
new members are expected to assume office Sept. 1, Siew said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators of the ruling Kuomintang Thursday to reconstruct the Central
Cross-Island  Highway,  as agriculture and tourism in the region have been
seriously affected by the closure of the road in 2004.</P>
      <P>In a meeting convened by KMT Legislator Kung Wen-chi, 12 representatives from
eastern Taiwan's Taichung County, including farmers and the heads of local
villages and townships, expressed their need for the road to transport
agricultural products and develop tourism.</P>
      <P>The 192-km Central Cross-Island Highway, which used to connect Taichung County
in western Taiwan and Hualien County in the east, was the first highway to cross
the Central Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>@Opened to vehicular traffic in 1960, the highway was seriously damaged twice --
once in 1999 by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake and again in 2004 due to extensive
landslides caused by heavy rainfall brought by a typhoon -- leaving a 24.4 km
length of the road completely destroyed.@@After the rain of 2004, the Executive
Yuan decided to suspend the reconstruction for ecological reasons, which led to
complaints from residents of the region.</P>
      <P>The road was a notorious drain on central and local government resources, as the
intensive farming in the region has left the Lishan area unstable, leading to
landslides almost every year and requiring almost constant repair work on the
road, according to some environmentalists.</P>
      <P>"With the highway disconnected, farmers living in the Lishan area have to
transport their fruit and other agricultural produce via Nantou or Yilan
counties, which increases the shipping time and costs," said Kung, adding that
President Ma Ying-jeou has promised to make at least a simple and crude road
until the highway can be reconstructed.@</P>
      <P>Ma made the promise during a visit to Lishan in July 2007 during his election
campaign. Lishan was formerly a popular tourist spot well-known for its high
quality fruit.</P>
      <P>In response, Transport Minister Mao Chi-kuo, who also attended the meeting, said
the relevant agencies will try to repair the road as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>He added that NT$40 million (US$1.3 million) has been budgeted for the purpose
and that work might start next year.@@</P>
      <P>As for a complete reconstruction of the highway, James Chen, director of the
Directorate General of Highways under the MOTC, said in the meeting that the
plan will need to be reviewed and passed by the Executive Yuan.@@</P>
      <P>According to MOTC, the budget needed for a reconstruction of the highway would
reach NT$1.2 billion.@@@ (By Emmanuelle Tzeng)@</P>

      <P>A former National Security Bureau (NSB) chief will once again take over the helm
of the country's top intelligence body, the Presidential Office announced
Thursday in a press statement.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chao-ming's return to the post will take effect Friday, the statement
added.</P>
      <P>Tsai, the first native Taiwanese ever to hold the country's top intelligence
post, will succeed Shi Hwei-yow as NSB director-general. Shi resigned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Media reports said President Ma Ying-jeou chose Tsai because of his knowledge of
intelligence affairs and his belief that illegal wiretapping must not be
allowed.</P>
      <P>Tsai was first promoted to the top NSB post in 2001 by then-President  Chen
Shui-bian.  He resigned  in 2004 to take responsibility for the March 19
shooting of Chen and then-Vice President Annette Lu in Tainan City, southern
Taiwan, on the eve of their re-election.</P>
      <P>Shi confirmed Wednesday that he had tendered his resignation a day  earlier  to
facilitate  Ma's  efforts  to rearrange  his administration's lineup.</P>
      <P>Shi said in a written statement that such personnel replacements are "normal"
and he urged the public not to "speculate unnecessarily" over the matter.</P>
      <P>Shi said he did not tender his resignation until one month after Ma's
inauguration because he was waiting to carry forward his job to his successor.</P>
      <P>Shi issued the statement amid media reports about a power struggle within the
NSB ranks, with Shi coming under strong pressure from ruling party lawmakers who
have been influence-peddling over the NSB's personnel appointments since Ma's
March 22 election victory.</P>

      <P>The sovereignty dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands should not be a target for
partisan political bickering, former President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday in a
press statement.</P>
      <P>Chen's office issued the statement after a local newspaper claimed that Chen
criticized President Ma Ying-jeou during a meeting with outgoing representative
to Japan Koh Se-kai the day before as "having  taken  the wrong direction  in
handling  Taiwan-Japan relations."</P>
      <P>"The report was confusing and regrettable, " the statement said, adding that
Chen, as a retired president, has abided by his promise to refrain from making
any public criticism of the incumbent president.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Koh, the statement said, Chen recognized Koh's
contributions to the promotion of Taiwan-Japan relations during his four-year
tenure. Koh assumed his post in 2004.</P>
      <P>Koh was recalled last wekend over a June 10 incident in waters near the disputed
Tiaoyutais in which a Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank after colliding
with a much larger Japanese coast guard patrol vessel.</P>
      <P>Koh was supposed to deliver a report to the Legislative Yuan on his negotiations
with Japanese authorities over the incident, but he refused to testify before
the legislature after being branded by some ruling Kuomintang lawmakers as a
"traitor" as they claimed that Koh had spoken in favor of Japan after the
incident. Koh already tendered his resignation which Ma said Tuesday he will
soon approve.</P>
      <P>As Koh is a political appointee named by the previous DPP government, Chen said
he fully supports Koh's resignation in line with the principles of party
politics and political accountability.</P>
      <P>On recent criticism that the former DPP government was weak in handling the
Tiaoyutai sovereignty dispute, Chen said the comments were unfair. During his
eight-year stint, Chen went on, he had on many occasions reaffirmed Taiwan's

      <P>Noting that the conflicting sovereignty claims should be resolved rationally and
peacefully through diplomatic channels, Chen said inter-party partisan
squabbling could adversely affect any attempts to protect soveieignty and
resolve fishing disputes, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, although Taiwan believes the island group is historically,
geographically and judicially connected to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan  administers  the uninhabited  Tiaoyutais  under  the jurisdiction of
Ishigawa, Okinawa Prefecture, while in Taiwan, they fall under the jurisdiction
of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais have complicated

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday that local inflation triggered by hikes in
oil prices has so far been kept under control.</P>
      <P>Liu admitted, however,  that the country has witnessed an inflationary upward
spiral over the past several weeks triggered mainly by hikes in fuel prices in
one stroke in late May as a government bid to face reality and reflect
international fuel costs.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided May 28 to raise the price of imported oil, which had
been frozen for more than six months by the previous Democratic Progressive
Party administration prior to May 20, when the new Kuomintang government was
inauguated.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Liu said that a commodity price
monitoring task force under the Executive Yuan has been meeting every week to
monitor the situation and has found that the inflation has been kept under
control so far.</P>
      <P>He promised the lawmakers that the administration will try its utmost to
stabilize prices in the face of soaring global oil and other energy-related
commodity prices.</P>
      <P>He said "mild" price hikes would be more acceptable to the public when economic
stimulus measures are implemented and incomes are raised accordingly, but
pointed out that "nobody is sure" and "it is daunting" to arrest the
inflationary spiral when prices of oil and other major commodities are soaring.</P>

      <P>New National  Police Agency (NPA) Director-General Wang Cho-chiun assumed office
Friday in a changeover ceremony presided over by Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi
at the NPA headquarters in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former director-general of the Taipei City Police Department, took over
the nation's top police post from Hou Yu-ih, who has been appointed as the new
president of the Central Police University.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Liao praised Hou for his outstanding performance as
NPA chief,  noting that the public's level of satisfaction with public order
increased dramatically during his two-plus years in the post.</P>
      <P>Liao also lauded Hou's success in boosting the morale of the police force and
securing salary raises.</P>
      <P>The interior minister expressed hope that Wang will be able to build on the
foundations laid down by Hou and lead the 70,000-strong police force in making
Taiwan the "safest and healthiest" country in Asia.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang said his task as new head of the NPA will focus on the four
goals of improving human rights, boosting the police force's effectiveness,
increasing discipline and improving the force's image.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that all the nation's officers will work together to help
achieve these goals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Forestry Bureau to supervise operation of Alishan railway</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Forestry Bureau will supervise the operation of the Alishan Forest Railway,
ownership of which was transferred from the bureau to a private company
Thursday, to ensure safe and comfortable services for passengers, bureau
Director Yen Jen-te said Friday.</P>
      <P>The bureau transferred the right Thursday to operate the railway to the Hungtu
Construction Co., which won a build-operate-transfer project passed in 2006 to
privatize the management of the railway for the next 30 years.</P>
      <P>Under the project, the company is contracted to operate and maintain the
railway, including the stations along the route. It will also build a five-star
hotel near the rail network's Jhaoping Station, and develop 0.9 hectares of land
surrounding Peimen Station.</P>
      <P>A group of Alishan residents and members of the Alishan Community Development
Association staged a protest against the transfer at Alishan Station Tuesday,
accusing the bureau of carrying out the project before an environmental impact
evaluation has been passed.</P>
      <P>They also questioned the company's ability to operate the railway, claiming that
the company does not have enough experienced drivers who can safely operate the
narrow-gauge railway.</P>
      <P>The railway has had several accidents over the years. In 2003, 17 people were
killed and 156 injured when a train derailed near Alishan Station. Four other
derailings occurred in the March to May period alone this year, leaving several
injured but causing no fatalities.</P>
      <P>Yen said the Hungtu's construction projects will start after environmental
evaluations and that the bureau will make sure the company's operations meet the
relevant regulations.</P>
      <P>The nearly 100-year-old Alishan Forest Railway is an 86 km narrow gauge rail
network running up to and throughout the popular mountain resort of Alishan. It
was originally constructed by the Japanese colonial government in 1912 to
facilitate the logging industry, but now caters mainly to tourists.</P>
      <P>The area attracts nearly 900,000 visitors every year, but the railway is a
money-losing business that generates just NT$100 million (US$3.29 million) in
revenues at an operation cost of NT$300 million a year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei to hold `Lights Out Day' in tandem with Beijing, Hong Kong</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest environmental organization will launch a "Lights Out" event in
tandem with several other cities in Asia, including Beijing and Hong Kong, to
mark the June 21 summer solstice with an eco-friendly action.</P>
      <P>@On "Lights Out Day," initiated by the Society of Wildness (SOW) in 2005 and
observed each year on the summer solstice, households and business are invited
to turn off their lights and neon signs for one hour from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., in
order to save energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>This year, nine cities in Taiwan and several major cities in China, including
Hong Kong, will take part in the activity to make the summer solstice an energy-
saving movement, SOW President Lin Yao-guo said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"In addition to saving energy, people might find a new way to get along with
each other," he added.</P>
      <P>To help people discover, or rediscover, the pleasure of a night without lights,
the SOW will organize a series of outdoor activities islandwide,  including
concerts,  star  gazing,  story-telling, ecological excursions and dances.</P>
      <P>In the Daan Forest Park in Taipei, an unplugged concert and a " low-carbon"
wedding -- a real one -- will be held, in which the bride's wedding gown will be
made from recycled plastic bags and paper.</P>
      <P>Many important landmarks in Taipei have agreed to participate in the activity.
Among others, the Taipei 101 building promised to advance the time for turning
out its lights by one hour every day from June 21.</P>
      <P>Important landmarks in other Asian capitals that will also turn out their lights
for one hour include the Tokyo Tower and the Seoul Tower, as well as some
buildings around Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Participating in the event for the second time this year, Beijing
environmentalists are aiming at not only convincing people of the idea of saving
energy but also at making the event an occasion for prayer for refugees around
the world, Beijing organizer Zhang Si-ying said in a video conference.</P>
      <P>June 20 is designated as World Refugee Day by the United Nations General
Assembly.</P>
      <P>The first "Lights Out" activity in Asia was launched in Japan in 2003 with a
"candle-lit night" event in which several million people took part.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii- ming said Friday that a new round of
fuel price hikes will be announced July 1, effective from the following day.</P>
      <P>The new round of hikes is a natural effect of the floating mechanism for
adjusting local fuel prices, Yiin said during a session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yiin made the announcement in response to a question from opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Huang Wei-cheh, who inquired as to whether the
Ministry of Economic Affairs will raise prices in July ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Responding to another question from Huang about a possible increase in water
prices, Yiin said that "there are no plans for a price hike for that utility."</P>
      <P>The first  oil price  hikes  since  the Kuomintang  (KMT) administration's May
20 inauguration was announced by the Economics Ministry May 27 and implemented
May 28 -- six days earlier than expected -- a move that was aimed at preventing
hoarding.</P>
      <P>With the adjustment ranges being lower than originally expected, the price of 92
unleaded gasoline at gas stations operated by state-run oil refiner CPC Corp.
Taiwan, was raised by NT$3.9 per liter to NT$33.9; the prices of 95 unleaded and
98 unleaded were increased by the same amount to NT$34.6 per liter and NT$36.1
per liter, respectively; while premium diesel was hiked by NT$4.4 to NT$31.9 per
liter.</P>
      <P>The prices of liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas were raised by NT$3.9 per
kilo and NT$3.85 per cubic meter, respectively.</P>
      <P>The KMT administration launched the hikes at one stroke May 28 in a bid to face
reality and reflect soaring international fuel costs. Prices had been frozen for
more than six months by the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration
prior to May 20, when the KMT government was inaugurated.</P>

to create their own brands.</P>
      <P>Shih proposed using a "smiling curve" he conceived in the early 1990s to
evaluate the development of creative industries.</P>
      <P>The smile-like curve illustrates the value-added potential of different
components  of the  value  chain  in an IT-related manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Profitable businesses, Shih asserted, focused on the two ends of the curve --
research &amp; development and branding and servicing -- rather than the middle
of the curve -- manufacturing or assembly.</P>
      <P>"The business of making cultural products needs more creative powers rather than
downstream manufacturing, " said the former chairman of the world's third-
largest PC vendor.</P>
      <P>To encourage private investment in local arts and cultural businesses, Shih said
by sponsoring cultural activities, private companies could actually save on
marketing costs, as sponsoring performances or exhibitions has a strong
advertising impact.</P>
      <P>Yoshiharu Fukuhara, the honorary chairman of Japanese cosmetics giant Shiseido,
said incentives were the key to development in cultivating cultural and creative
industries.</P>
      <P>"The Japanese government provided tax incentives for companies that sponsored
art events," said Fukuhara, the keynote speaker of the forum, recalling that a
large amount of private investment was injected into the industry because
companies wanted to capitalize on the tax preferences.</P>
      <P>He said under such incentives, many companies even established art groups or
galleries of their own.</P>
      <P>Shih also urged the government to build a culturally oriented environment to
foster the cultural and creative industries, saying that the building blocks of
knowledge-based economy are inspired by culture.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the 'i-Taiwan 12 Projects, ' the new government's major pledge,
Taiwan should invest more on the cultivation of its culture, " Shih said, adding
that the investment involved not only money but the time society was willing to
devote to such endeavors. enitem/ls</P>

      <P>Most of the substandard products imported in May were goods made in China, the
Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) under the Cabinet announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The commission published a total of 66 pieces of information about unsafe
imported or foreign goods in May -- 36 of which were about China-made goods --
on a Web site, said Liu Ching-fang, a CPC section chief.</P>
      <P>The commission inaugurated the Web site in late August last year as part of its
efforts to inform local consumers about substandard products.</P>
      <P>The total number reported in May increased by 11 from the April listings, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Sixty two of the 66 pieces of information were on goods belonging to the
category of commercial products, while 20 were chemical industrial products, 11
were toys, 18 were machine electronics products and 13 were other types of
products, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>The commission's  sources of information  about substandard commercial products
came partly from the announcements made by U.S. companies when they recalled
toys, clothes for teenagers, electronic heaters, gas stoves and sleeping bags,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>Many of these recalled products are not imported into Taiwan, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The remaining four pieces of information published on the Web site belong to the
category of food products, Liu continued.</P>
      <P>The substandard food products -- imported from Vietnam, the U.S. and Thailand --
were found to contain excessive amounts of bleach and preservatives, Liu said.
adding that the figure was down from the 11 recorded last month.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) is establishing a security management
mechanism to handle an anticipated increase  in Chinese visitors to Taiwan in
July,  NIA Deputy Director-General Wu Shyun-yann said Friday.</P>
      <P>The agency will spend an estimated NT$105 million this year for extra manpower,
infrastructure, equipment and software to handle applications, review and
approve travel permits, and expedite the entry and exit process at airports, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The agency also plans to set up immigration counters to check travel documents
at the eight airports in Taiwan that will serve as gateways for weekend charter
flights to China, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The eight airports are Taipei Songshan Airport and Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung Airport in central Taiwan, Kaohsiung
International Airport in southern Taiwan, Hualien and Taitung airports in
eastern Taiwan, and Kinmen and Magong airports on Taiwan-controlled islands in
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In an effort to accelerate the application process of Chinese tour groups to
visit Taiwan, the government will also set up a service center in the cities of
Taipei in northern Taiwan, Taichung in central Taiwan, Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan and Hualien in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Measures are in place to pre-screen tourists to diminish the possibility that
they will abscond after entering Taiwan. Beijing will require applicants to
prove they have a Chinese citizen ID and at least NT$200,000 in assets and do
not have a criminal record or a record of overstaying visas before they can get
travel permits.</P>
      <P>Also, Chinese tourists must arrive in Taiwan and leave in groups, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan, it will take charge of checking documents, Wu said, adding that
the agency has organized a series of workshops and training sessions for
immigration officers to help build their professional skills.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourists are expected to come to Taiwan greater numbers after
representatives  of Taiwan  and China officially  sealed agreements last Friday
in Beijing for the July 4 launch of weekend direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights and allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan from July 18.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese visiting Taiwan will be capped at 3,000 per day in the
initial stage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic violence prevention network is fragile even though a
groundbreaking act preventing domestic violence has been in effect for nearly 10
years, the Taiwan Coalition Against Violence said at a news conference Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Feng-hsien, the president of the coalition and also a judge who promoted
passage of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, said the law raised public
awareness of domestic violence, but society and the government were not well
prepared to protect domestic violence victims.</P>
      <P>Taiwan passed the act in 1998, and implemented it in 1999, becoming the first
Asian country to provide legal protections to victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Judicial Yuan, Kao said 40 percent of
restraining order applications have been rejected since 1999, and the 33.87 days
it has taken on average to approve a request has cast doubt on the efficiency of
the restraining orders to begin with.</P>
      <P>Chou Ching-yu, an executive at the Commission on Women's Rights Promotion under
the Executive Yuan, said insufficient manpower has hampered efforts to prevent
domestic violence, with the number of people involved in the field not growing
quickly enough to meet a rapidly rising caseload.</P>
      <P>In 2006, for example, 456 social workers recruited by the government handled
66,000 cases, or a ratio of 146 cases per employee, she said.</P>
      <P>Chou called on police departments and social workers to set up teams to deal
exclusively with domestic violence cases, ideally with one staff handling 30
cases to guarantee better quality in providing counseling and assistance.</P>
      <P>She also urged the government to provide a more stable income for individuals in
the field so they can work without disturbances and worries.</P>
      <P>Lai Mei-huei, former president of the Awakening Foundation, called on the
government to budget NT$3 billion (US$98.75 million) over the next 10 years for
domestic violence prevention.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that domestic violence victims only received assistance equal to
NT$2,700 last year, which was not enough to cover the cost of their medical
care, counseling, and rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ming-chieh, an assistant professor at National Chung Cheng University,
suggested that the Ministry of Justice set up a section in charge of monitoring
domestic violence assailants, and Wang Ling-huei, secretary-general of the
Taiwan Provincial Education Association, said an inter-administerial section is
necessary to help integrate resources in domestic violence prevention and
control.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan promised Friday that he will ask the relevant government
agencies to revise the rules to facilitate visits to China by local government
chiefs.</P>
      <P>Liu agreed that the regulations should be modified in line with the recent
changes in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, in order to facilitate city mayors and
county magistrates who wish to visit China.</P>
      <P>"The Executive Yuan will ask the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the Ministry
of the Interior to address the issue as soon as possible, " the premier promised
during an intepellation session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu was eager to fly to China on board a historic
maiden nonstop charter flight from Taichung on July 4, but MAC Chairwoman Lai
Shin-yuan said Thursday that this might not be possible.</P>
      <P>"Although the central government has been considering easing the restrictions on
visits to China by local government chiefs,  the rules cannot be amended in time
to allow for Hu to make the trip  on July 4," Lai explained.</P>
      <P>Hu however remained firm on the idea, saying that he would invite four city
mayors and county magistrates from central Taiwan to accompany him on the China
tour, if he is permitted to go. He said that he will do his best to push the
central government in Taipei to allow him to travel on the landmark direct
cross-strait flight -- the first since the two sides split at the end of a civil
war in 1949.</P>
      <P>Under the Kuomintang (KMT) government's program, Songshan Airport and Taiwan
Taoyuan International  Airport in northern  Taiwan, Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan and Kaohsiung International Airport in the south will service the
direct cross-strait charter flights in the initial stages when the program is
launched July 4.</P>
      <P>The direct charter flight initiative, along with the admission of a
significantly larger number of tourists from China, was one of President Ma

      <P>Experts  from the government  and nongovernmental organizations on Friday
stressed the need for more professionals  with global perspectives and the
integration of resources to strengthen Taiwan's foreign assistance capacity.</P>
      <P>"To enhance Taiwan's ability to provide international assistance, a platform
should be established to integrate the resources of nongovernmental
organizations, " said Feng Hsiao-yuan, deputy chief of the Taipei Overseas Peace
Service (TOPS), at a workshop on promoting assistance to refugees to mark
Friday's World Refugee Day.</P>
      <P>Feng,  whose organization founded in 1980 is dedicated to providing aid around
the world, especially in Asia and Africa, said that in addition to meeting
refugees' basic needs, foreign aid groups should also help them plan their
futures and preserve their culture and dignity.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that human rights education be included as part of any aid
efforts.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-hsiu, an official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' NGO Affairs

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ma Ying-jeou administration's handling of the Tiaoyutais incident has
strained relations between Taiwan and Japan, opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was quoted as saying in a report published
Friday in the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais incident refers to the collision between a Taiwan fishing vessel
and a Japanese coastal patrol vessel June 10 in waters surrounding the island
chain over which both Taiwan and Japan claim sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Tsai reportedly told an Asahi Shimbun journalist stationed in Taipei City that
the Ma administration's handling of the diplomatic spat did not succeed in
quelling public dissatisfaction in Taiwan, and instead intensified it.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the administration's decisions to recall Taiwan's
representative to Japan and to consider sending a naval vessel to the disputed
area to strengthen Taiwan's claim were rather hard-line, even if Japan's initial
response tended to worsen the situation.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that resolving international controversies by peaceful means is a
fundamental  principal which the Ma administration eventually did come around to
embracing but only after the damage had already been done.</P>
      <P>She said that the DPP's approach to the Tiaoyutais issue during its eight years
in power was to advocate Taiwan's sovereignty over the island chain but also to
give priority to resolving fishing disputes in the area, claiming that this
approach was more rational.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairwoman claimed that a majority of the officials in Ma's
administration are academics who lack practical experience or served during the
period of Kuomintang (KMT) authoritarian rule and don't know how to respond to
complex international trends.</P>
      <P>As for the Ma administration's resumption of dialogue between Taiwan and China
after a nine-year hiatus and the recent agreements between the two sides on
launching weekend cross-strait charter flights and opening Taiwan up to Chinese
tourists, Tsai said that closer contact with China could help Taiwan's economic
development but could also harm Taiwan's sovereignty and national security in
the long term.</P>

      <P>The approval rating of the Kuomintang government, which has been in office for
one month, will improve once the administration manages to ease the impact of
rising international crude oil prices, the chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung was referring to a recent survey conducted by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which showed that President Ma Ying-jeou's
new administration fell just short of a passing score of 60, scoring 59.6 on a
scale of 0-100 points, for its first month in office.</P>
      <P>The DPP poll showed that 47.8 percent of those surveyed were satisfied with the
Ma administration's performance, and newspaper surveys indicated that its public
approval rating has fallen from 66 percent to 50 percent over the past month.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he believes that Ma's government will gain credit for an agreement
forged between Taiwan and China to launch direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flights on July 4 and to admit a larger number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan, as
these two initiatives are widely expected to boost Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>In the DPP's poll, 63.3 percent of the respondents said they were not happy with
the administration's efforts to stabilize commodity prices, which have been
fluctuating recently due to oil price hikes and a worldwide shortage of staple
grains.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a former minister of economic affairs, said that he believes the new
government will win back the people's trust once the once-frozen cross-strait
ties warm up and the economy gets a shot in the arm from expanded cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The SEF was founded in 1991 as an intermediary body to handle cross-strait
negotiations in the absence of official links.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed dissatisfaction with
the performance of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration Friday, saying the
people have been leading a hard life during the month since Ma's inauguration.</P>
      <P>According to caucus whips Lai Ching-te and Kuan Bi-ling, Ma's administration has
set six records over the past month: making the largest number of apologies,
incurring debts at the fastest speed, allowing the largest increase in consumer
prices, seeing the largest decline in the stock index, experiencing the largest
fall in the government's approval rating, and paying the most attention to
playing politics.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu noted that the Kuomintang (KMT) government raised
fuel prices immediately after its inauguration and is now ready to hike
electricity rates starting next month.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the soaring consumer prices, Taiwan's stock index plummeted by
more than 1,200 points over the past month, with the total stock value dropping
by NT$3.17 trillion and each investor losing NT$390,000 on average, Wong said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee said that while Taiwan's stock index only decreased
by 2.21 percent during the first cross-Taiwan Strait missile crisis in 1995, the
index has now lost as much as 14 percent within one month, a situation he said
proves that "a mistaken policy is more terrible than the Chinese missiles."</P>
      <P>Lee failed to note, however, that the stock market has dropped at an even more
precipitous rate in one month just within the last year under the previous
administration, when it fell by 18.5 percent, from 9,809.88 to 8,276.26, between
October 29 and November 28.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ting-fei charged that instead of fulfilling his so-called "633
policy" aimed at raising the economic growth rate to above 6 percent, lowering
the unemployment rate to below 3 percent and increasing the country's per capita
annual income to US$30,000, Ma has instead allowed "fuel prices to raise by
NT$6, the electricity rates to increase by 30 percent, and consumer prices to
jump by 30 percent. "</P>
      <P>Chen's numbers were somewhat inflated, however, as prices at the pump have
actually risen by NT$3.9 per liter, electricity rates are set to go up 12
percent in July, and inflation in May was 3.71 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Referring to the results of a survey conducted June 16-17 by the TVBS cable
network, Lai pointed out that the approval ratings of Ma and Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan registered only 41 percent and 38 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lai said the ratings, which were a far cry from the 77 percent received by
former President Chen Shui-bian and the 65 percent by former Premier Tang Fei on
the one-month anniversary of their inauguration, fully demonstrated the public's
dissatisfaction with the performance of Ma's administration.</P>
      <P>Renewing  her doubts about the allegiance  of Ma and his administrative team,
Kuan claimed that Ma himself and many officials in his administration appear
prepared to flee the country any time as they either once held permanent
residency rights of another country, still hold foreign permanent resident
status, or have applied for foreign permanent residency rights.</P>
      <P>Those  targeted  by Kuan included  Ma and Executive  Yuan Secretary-General
Hsieh Hsiang-chuan, who obtained a U.S. green card in the 1970s but argued that
they have become invalid because they did not return regularly to the U.S. as
required by American law and used U.S. tourist visas instead of their green
cards to enter the United States.</P>
      <P>Also on the list were Council of Economic  Planning  and Development Chairman
Chen Tain-jy who only renounced his U.S. green card before his May 20
inauguration, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou, who obtained a
U.S. green card in 2005 when he was the ROC ambassador to Guatemala, but
renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position.</P>
      <P>Also mentioned were Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission (OCAC) Minister Wu
Ying-yih, who applied for a U.S. green card in February but gave up the
application before his inauguration; National Security Council (NSC) adviser
Mignonne Man-jung Chan, who holds a U.S. green card and is planning to renounce
it; and Jason Yuan, the incoming Republic of China representative to the United
States, who applied for U.S. permanent residence in 2004 but officially filed
for a termination of the application process early this month.</P>
      <P>Others  named  also  included  Presidential  Office  Deputy Secretary-General
Kao Lang and NSC Deputy Secretary-General Ho Ssu-yin, who only renounced their
Canadian permanent residency rights shortly before May 20;  Environmental
Protection Administration Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen, who once held
permanent resident status in Canada; and Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai
Hsia-ling Minister,  who has applied to renounce her Canadian permanent
residency rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, OCAC Deputy Minister Hsu Chen-jung holds permanent residency rights
of the Philippines and is planning to renounce the rights.</P>

      <P>Japan's deputy representative to Taiwan presented a letter of apology to the
captain of a Taiwanese sports fishing vessel Friday over a boat accident that
occurred in the East China Sea June 10.</P>
      <P>Hitoshi Funamachi, deputy representative of the Japan Interchange Association,
the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan, presented the letter of apology written
by Hideo Nasu, head of the 11th Operational Region of the Japan Coast Guard
(JCG) to the captain of the sports fishing boat during a visit to his home
Friday.</P>
      <P>The boat Ho Hung-yi was skippering sank on June 10 after it collided with a JCG
patrol boat that was trying to chase it away from the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands.</P>
      <P>"I bow and once again offer my sincere apologies to you over the sinking of your
boat and the injuries you sustained during the collision," Funamachi said to Ho,
reading from Nasu's letter.</P>
      <P>"I hope we will begin negotiations soon on compensation, in accordance with the
law," Nasu stated in the letter.</P>
      <P>Nasu had also bowed at a televised press conference in Japan several days ago in
apology over the accident.</P>
      <P>Ho accepted Nasu's apology, saying that he was "very pleased" with the way that
the JCG official was handling the aftermath of the accident, in which Ho lost
his boat and sustained several cuts.</P>
      <P>The fishing boat sank after it collided with the Japanese patrol vessel some 7.8
nautical miles from the Tiaoyutais June 10. Ho and his two crew members were
detained by the Japanese authorities for questioning after they and the 13
anglers onboard were rescued by the Japanese coast guard.</P>
      <P>The 13 anglers returned to Taiwan June 11 and two crew members returned June 12,
while Ho, the last to be released, returned June 13.</P>
      <P>Funamachi's visit to Ho and Nasu's letter of apology Friday were seen as helping
to ease the tensions that had arisen between Taiwan and Japan over the incident.</P>
      <P>Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan said June 15 that the
administration will seek to sue Japan for having caused Ho's boat to sink,
caused him to be injured and for bullying him during the four days he was
detained.</P>
      <P>"Since the Tiaoyutais  are part of the Republic of China territory, we will file
the suit in Taiwan, on grounds that the Japanese patrol vessel illegally
intruded into the country's territorial waters," Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H. L. Ou refused to accept a Japanese
investigation report on the boat collision and recalled Taiwan's top
representative in Japan, Koh Se-kai, last weekend to gain a better understanding
of the facts surrounding the incident.</P>
      <P>The Japanese report claimed that the captain of the JCG patrol ship, Koshiki,
might have caused navigational hazards and damage through negligence, while the
skipper of the Taiwanese fishing boat might have caused navigational hazards
through negligence.</P>
      <P>Ou said it was "unreasonable" for a big 100-ton Japanese patrol vessel to ram a
small 20-ton recreational boat.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais are claimed by Taiwan, Japan and China.</P>

branch which monitors the integrity of civil servants.</P>
      <P>Ma said Wang is an upright, capable and good-hearted person whose integrity is
well known and who has been devoted to social welfare and the improvement of
elementary schooling in China for years.</P>
      <P>Ma nominated former Legislator Shen Fu- hsiung, a renal disease physician-turned
politician, to serve as Wang's deputy.</P>
      <P>Shen was formerly  a member of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party, but
he renounced his DPP membership as he was not seeing eye to eye with some DPP
hardliners on major policy issues when the DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>The nomination list also included some former Control Yuan members, like Huang
Huang-hsiung and Chao Chang-ping. Former Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator
Chien Lin Huei-chun, and People First Party Legislator Lee Fu-tien were also on
the list.</P>
      <P>Ma said most of the nominees were selected from among 46 hopefuls who were
short-listed by a nomination task force that reviewed more than 400
recommendations and applications for the positions.</P>
      <P>The president said that his choices were made based on the candidates'
professional and moral attributes, rather than on their political affiliation.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office will send the Control Yuan nomination list, along with
its list of Examination Yuan candidates, to the Legislative Yuan on June 23 for
approval.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan has been left empty since the term of office of previous
members expired Jan. 31, 2005 as a result of domestic political wrangling.
Former President Chen Shui-bian' list of Control Yuan nominations was repeatedly
rejected by the then-opposition KMT-controlled legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed the hope that his nominees will make the work of Control Yuan
effective, as it plays an important role in ensuring the integrity of the
country's civil servants and the quality of Taiwan's democratization.</P>

      <P>College graduates in Taiwan want to work at government agencies or state-run
companies, jobs described locally as "iron rice bowls" that feature guaranteed
job security and a steady income and benefits, according to the results of a
survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing a poll conducted by Cheers monthly magazine in March, the "ejob" Web site
operated by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs said the number of the
graduates seeking a career as a civil servant or at a state-run enterprise
surpassed the number of those planning to work in the private sector for the
first time in years.</P>
      <P>Thirty-nine percent of the respondents, who were to graduate from colleges and
universities in July, said they wanted to work at a government agency while 27.8
percent were hoping for a job at a state-run company.</P>
      <P>The two figures combined were higher than the 60.3 percent of those who said
want to apply for a job in the private sector after graduation, according to the
survey on graduating students from 174 colleges and universities around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The numbers surpassed 100 percent because respondents were allowed to choose
more than one answer to the question.</P>
      <P>A total of 4,200 questionnaires were mailed to the students, with 2,204 valid
samples sent back to Cheers.</P>
      <P>Ejob operations director Chen Ting-yu attributed the results to a change in
market perceptions, where wages and benefits at public agencies or state-owned
enterprises are seen as better as more secure than at private companies.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, those who seek the "iron rice bowl, " called "golden rice bowl"
recently because of the increasing difficulty in finding a public-sector job,
have to pass a national examination to qualify simply to submit an application.</P>
      <P>Ejob is Taiwan's largest government Web site offering services for job seekers
and companies looking for workers.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan pledged Friday to complete the construction of the
National Palace Museum's (NPM's) southern branch in Chiayi County, although its
direction and collections might have to be adjusted.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that when the project was first planned, it was aimed at exclusively
exhibiting Asian art.</P>
      <P>"But due to the fact that it is not easy to obtain Asian art, the government
might want to keep some room for adjustment, " Liu said during a hearing at the
Legislative Yuan in response to a question from Legislator  Chang Hwa-kuan  of
the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party about the long-stalled project.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the Executive Yuan approved the construction of the NPM
southern branch in 2003. Land was cleared for the museum in 2006 and 2007, its
foundation was scheduled to be built this year, and the construction of major
exhibition halls was scheduled for next year.</P>
      <P>The NPM southern branch was financed as part of a five-year, NT$50 billion
(US$1.64 billion) public construction expansion plan approved by the Executive
Yuan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>But she said that funding for the southern branch in 2004 and 2005 was blocked
by the then-opposition-controlled legislature, so that only NT$5 billion in
funding was appropriated for the project, a shortfall of NT$3.1 billion in the
overall construction costs.</P>
      <P>The southern branch of the National Palace Museum in southern Taiwan is being
built on a 70-hectare site. The budget for clearing the land alone was NT$450
million and covered digging an artificial lake, planting trees, and putting in
irrigation and water-release systems.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said earlier this year that despite
serious construction delays, the southern branch of the National Palace Museum
will open in 2011.</P>

      <P>Several leaders of the industrial and commercial  sectors  urged  the government
Friday  to include complementary provisions in its plan to offer allowances to
employees on parental leave, in order to minimize the impact on the business
sector.</P>
      <P>Chang Pen-tsao, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of ROC., told CNA
that the industrial and commercial sectors "dare not" oppose the government's
plan to offer an allowance of 60 percent salary for up to two years to employers
on parental leave, as this is a world trend.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said this policy will eventually affect employment among women if
it is implemented without being thoroughly evaluated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Wu-hsiung, chairman of Taipei-based Chinese National Federation
of Industries, said the industrial and trade sectors are not against the policy,
but would like first to figure out all its clauses.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government  is showing  consideration  for employees, Chen
stressed that it should, however, take into account the ability of enterprises
to survive under this policy, as he does not think that any company can afford
to leave positions vacant for two years while workers are on parental leave.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday the fundamentals of the domestic economy are
still good, and he is confident that the stock market will rebound.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while being questioned by Legislator Hsueh Ling of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party about the nearly 15 percent drop in
the stock market one month after Liu's Cabinet was sworn in.</P>
      <P>The stock market closed at 7,902.44 points Friday, compared with 9,295.2 points
on May 20, when Liu's Cabinet took office.</P>
      <P>The premier said the fall of the stock market is due in part to extrinsic
factors, some of which are beyond the control of the government.</P>
      <P>The stock market also reflects economic fundamentals, and the domestic economy
is "fundamentally good," he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the nation's
top economic planning agency, has forecast that the overall economy will grow
and consumer prices will be stabilized by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>"I have reasons to believe that the stock market will rise," he continued.</P>
      <P>Noting that NT$3 trillion (US$98.36 billion) in stock market values had
evaporated in one month, Hsueh asked whether share prices would continue to fall
in the next month.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that the government will keep an eye on the trend and maintain
market stability by reasonable methods, but it will also "respect the market
mechanism."</P>

      <P>The government will earmark NT$240 billion (US$7.9 billion) for an eight-year
sewage development plan to improve the local household sewer connection rate, an
official of the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the project is one of the 12 major infrastructure
projects promised by President Ma Ying-jeou during his electoral campaign.</P>
      <P>Citing  the World  Competitiveness  Yearbook  published  by the Switzerland-
based business school IMD, the official said the development of Taiwan's sewage
treatment systems, which is an indicator of the living standard of a country,
has been lagging behind South Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>"The situation contrasts sharply with Taiwan's economic power," the official
added.</P>
      <P>With environmental protection awareness increasing among the local people, they
are showing greater concern about their living environment -- not just economic
development, the official said.</P>
      <P>The government will start all 12 major infrastructure projects next year,
appropriating NT$30 billion each year for the improvement of sewage treatment
and household sewer connection rates.</P>
      <P>According to the official,  the government hopes that the investment will help
to increase the country's 20.47 average household sewer connection rate byat
least 3 percent annually, and will also focus on improving sewage treatment in
remote and mountainous areas.</P>

      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said Friday that the
government's plan to offer subsidies to employees on parental leave is in the
works and will not be postponed as speculated by the media.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to reports that the policy may be postponed because of
opposition from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Wang said the council expects to implement the policy in several stages, with
employees on parental leave receiving a subsidy equal to 60 percent of their
salaries for up to six months in the fist stage.</P>
      <P>Shih Fa-chi, director of the CLA's Labor Insurance Department, said the policy
is one of President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promises and the Cabinet has put it
in the priority list.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, funding for the subsidy could come from the employment

      <P>An interactive video conference project aimed at sharpening Taipei students'
English-speaking skills has proven that students can make great strides in
English through cultural exchanges with their American counterparts, according
to the schools involved in the project.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the non-profit Institute for Information Industry,
students from six schools in Taipei City have managed to take part in the
project, dubbed the "Global Multicultural Heritage Project (GMHP) , " which was
initiated by private American companies to enable students and teachers to
create online media showcases defining their own cultures and apply
communication skills with students and teachers around the Chinese-speaking
world.</P>
      <P>Students from the six schools -- Taipei Municipal Yongchun Senior High School,
Zhongzheng Senior High School, Dazhi High School, Dong Men Elementary School,
Shuanglian Elementary School and Yucheng Elementary School -- took part in the
project on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The students interacted with students and faculty from elementary and senior
high schools in five U.S. states, including New York, New Jersey and Ohio,
through video conferences to practice speaking English, the schools said.</P>
      <P>The significant progress made through the video conferences by some Shuanglian
Elementary School students who had dismal English skills showed that motivation
and autonomous learning are keys to success in learning English, according to
school teacher Huang Chao-chin.</P>
      <P>Replacing paper-based tests with interactive projects have helped students at
Zhongzheng Senior High School improve their English skills a lot, according to
English teacher Liu Chiu-jung.</P>
      <P>Zhongzheng Senior High School students chatted with students of Tascack Valley
High during a video conference June 12, and the students were all satisfied with
the interactive activity, English teacher Li Yi-ming said.</P>
      <P>Li noted that authorities at his school hoped it could establish long-term
cooperative ties with the American school to offer courses giving students on
both sides to gain a better understanding of each other's local culture.</P>
      <P>Yucheng Elementary School principal Lan Hui-mei said that the school's students
are slated to take part in a video conference in September during which they
will introduce Taiwanese-style lion dancing to their American counterparts.</P>
      <P>The GMHP was introduced by the Taipei-based Institute for Information Industry
into Taiwan to help expand Taiwanese students' global perspectives and, in
return, allow American students to gain familiarity with Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>Established  in 1979,  the institute is a non-governmental organization,
jointly sponsored by the Taiwan government  and prominent private enterprises,

      <P>A 3.8-hectare section of the Kaohsiung Software Park is set to open for new
investors and hopes to attract high-potential companies in advanced fields such
as biotechnology and information and communication, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>"This new investment promotion is part of the government's plan to balance the
regional development between northern and southern Taiwan," Jerry J.R. Ou, the
director general of the Export Processing Zone Administration under the ministry
said at a Friday news conference.</P>
      <P>Introducing the investment plan, Ou said the software park is targeting
companies in industries with most potential, including information and
communication technology (ICT) , biotechnology, and conventional industries that
are upgrading and transforming their businesses.</P>
      <P>The 3.8-hectare property is the only area that remains completely undeveloped
within the 7.9-hectare software park, which is one of Taiwan's  seven  Export
Processing  Zones  (EPZs)  that offer land and facilities to companies dedicated
to exporting.</P>
      <P>Launched in 2001, the park currently has a total investment amounting to US$400
million (NT$12.2 billion).</P>
      <P>Ou said that his administration, which is the supervisory authority of the park,
will officially take applications for new investment projects at the end of
June.</P>
      <P>"Companies must have at least NT$150 million in capital to be eligible for
applying, " Ou said, adding that the park would only welcome innovative
companies that produce value through research and development (R&amp;D).</P>
      <P>Citing the major benefits of investing in the EPZs, Ou said businesses could
import machinery and raw materials duty-free and are exempt from sales and
excise taxes on exported goods.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung Software Park, with its perfect logistical setting that combines
seaport and airport locations and rich land resources, will be the driving force
in the prosperity of industries based in southern Taiwan," Ou predicted.</P>
      <P>He was partly referring to the recent promise by manufacturing giant Foxconn
Technology Group to invest in the southern software park to develop high-tech
software  and e-business  operation platforms.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first build-own-operate (BOO) project to manufacture flu vaccines, is
entering a crucial stage after being delayed for three years, as the final deal
may be decided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and its American partner
next month, a high-ranking CDC official disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>Rodney W. Unsworth, vice president of the U.S. pharmaceutical group Schering
Plough and president of its Asia Pacific subsidiary, called on Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-ping Friday, but declined to comment after on the BOO
project.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to cooperate with the pharmaceutical giant to manufacture
enough flu vaccines in the event of a pandemic spread by a flu virus like the
H5N1.</P>
      <P>If the project succeeds, Taiwan might take the lead among developing countries
in the area of vaccine manufacturing, using the latest cell-based method.</P>
      <P>Though the project, first initiated in 2004, had been delayed due to several
obstacles, a CDC official in late April said that it was not dead and that
Schering Plough was still very interested.</P>
      <P>Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that the pharmaceutical company was
asking for a more flexible schedule, while the CDC was hoping it wouldn't have
to reopen negotiations.</P>
      <P>"The deadline (the company) gave us for an answer is July 24," the official
confirmed in a telephone interview Friday.</P>
      <P>@He added that discussions were still underway, but declined to give any further
details of the deal.</P>
      <P>@Under the original plan, the vaccine manufacturing plant should have been
completed in 2007 and become operational in 2008, producing 2.5 million doses of
flu vaccines on an annual basis. The Department of Health was committed to
purchasing NT$4 billion (US$1.3 billion) worth of vaccines.</P>
      <P>@However, with the delays that have occurred, even if the contract can be signed
this year, the earliest possible time the project can come on stream is 2011.</P>
      <P>The project was delayed mainly because of opposition from local companies and
the fact that the Dutch company with which the CDC had originally agreed to do
business was acquired by Schering Plough.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Friday he was pleased with Japan's
latest response to a collision between Taiwanese and Japanese vessels in
disputed waters that had threatened to undermine bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Ou lauded the "satisfactory result" after meeting with Tadashi Ikeda, Japan's
representative to Taiwan, who explained to Ou the nature of the apology
delivered earlier in the day to the captain of the Taiwanese boat that sank in
the incident.</P>
      <P>Ikeda said after the meeting that Japan was using its utmost sincerity and good
will to solve the incident and expressed hopes that Taiwan and Japan will
continue to develop friendly relations following the incident.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Hitoshi Funamachi, deputy representative of the Japan
Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan, presented the
letter of apology written by Hideo Nasu, head of the 11th Operational Region of
the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), to the captain of the fishing boat during a visit
to his home.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Nasu offered his "sincere apologies" and promised to start
compensation talks as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The recreational fishing boat sank on June 10 near the Tiaoyutai Islands after
being hit by a Japanese Coast Guard vessel that apparently was trying to chase
it away from waters near the disputed island chain.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan had maintained close relations throughout much of the decade
under the previous Democratic Progressive Party administration, but the recently
inaugurated President Ma Ying-jeou is viewed with suspicion by many in Japan
over his desire to foster closer relations with China.</P>
      <P>The collision threatened to reinforce those doubts, as Taiwan recalled its top
envoy to protest what it felt was Japan's refusal to apologize over the incident
and pay compensation to the captain of the sunken ship.</P>
      <P>But Ou said Friday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has felt the sincerity
of the Japanese government in resolving the incident peacefully so that
bilateral relations can advance further.</P>
      <P>He also thanked Taipei-based Japanese officials for their efforts in helping
deal with the incident.</P>
      <P>Hoping to move relations beyond the incident, Ou suggested that now was the time
to turn a crisis into an opportunity and resume long-stalled negotiations
between the two sides over fishing rights in waters near the Tiaoyutais, which
are effectively controlled by Japan but also claimed by Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that during the process of handling the incident,  there was
a lack of coordination  between relevant ministries in exchanging information.</P>
      <P>As  a  result,  the  foreign  ministry  will  convene  a cross-ministerial

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to reopen doors for Chinese journalists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to reopen its doors to journalists of China's Xinhua News
Agency and the People's Daily and allow them to be stationed in Taiwan for
limited periods to cover news events, the Executive Yuan spokeswoman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said her office has
outlined a plan that would enable the Chinese journalists to be posted here.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, which will provide Chinese reporters the same treatment that
China has offered Taiwanese journalists, the media workers of the two Beijing-
based media outlets can stay in Taiwan for three months, and are allowed to
apply for one extension to prolong their stay, Shih said.</P>
      <P>She added that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top policy
coordinator for cross-Taiwan Strait affairs -- will review the proposal on June
30.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, she said, reporters for Xinhua and the People's
Daily may arrive in Taiwan July 4, together with the first group of Chinese
tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Shih believed that MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan did not have any opinions on the
plan at present.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first accepted journalists from the two Chinese official media outlets in
2001 to come and stay for one-month periods to cover news events.</P>
      <P>Their rights to cover the news in Taiwan  were suspended indefinitely in April
2005, however, due to their biased reports after Beijing passed the so-called
Anti-Secession Law in March that year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is pleased to see the peaceful resolution of an incident
that involved the collision of a Taiwanese sporting fishing boat and a Japanese
coast guard vessel in disputed waters in the East China Sea, the Presidential
Office said in a news release Friday.</P>
      <P>The news release said President Ma saw the efforts of the Japanese side as
"positive," and that he felt it "had shown goodwill."</P>
      <P>The president wants to express appreciation for the efforts made by the
Interchange Association of Japan, the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan, the
release stated.</P>
      <P>Hitoshi Funamachi, deputy representative of the Interchange Association,
presented a letter of apology written by Hideo Nasu, head of the 11th
Operational Region of the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), to the captain of the fishing
boat Friday, during a visit to the skipper's home in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"I hope we can begin negotiations soon on compensation, in accordance with the
law," Nasu stated in the letter.</P>
      <P>The boat Ho Hung-yi was skippering sank on June 10 after it collided with a JCG
patrol boat that was trying to chase it away from the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands, which are claimed by Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office news release reaffirmed that the island chain is the
territory of the Republic of China and that the government's determination to
safeguard its sovereignty had not changed and would never change.</P>
      <P>Saying that the government attaches importance to the fishing rights of Taiwan
fishermen and the navigational safety of the country's fishing vessels, the
Presidential Office said it will ask related government agencies to start
fishery talks with Japan to ensure the rights of Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>A source at the Presidential Office said that high-level contacts from both
sides had worked out an "acceptable" resolution to the boat incident, and that
Tokyo took the initiative to offer an apology.</P>
      <P>The source also said that while Ma was on a visit to Japan two years ago, he met
with current Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who was then a senator,</P>
      <P>Ma told Fukuda at the time that cross-Taiwan Strait relations should move away
from long-term confrontation toward improvement, a view that Fukuda affirmed,
the source said.</P>
      <P>The boat collision sparked renewed controversy over the sovereignty of the
Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, but Taiwan believes that it has historical and geographical links and
legal rights to the group of islands.</P>
      <P>Japan  administers  the uninhabited  Tiaoyutais  under  the jurisdiction of
Ishigawa, Okinawa Prefecture, while in Taiwan, they fall under the jurisdiction
of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The two sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
the dispute and both sides agreed to hold another round of dialogue in March
2006, but the talks never took place.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's enterovirus epidemic claimed another victim Friday, bringing the number
of deaths caused by the viral disease to eight so far this year, according to
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The latest victim was a 3-year-old boy residing in northern Taiwan's  Taoyuan
County.  As the  boy  was an only  child, epidemiologists suspected that the boy
might have contracted the virus from adults.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Chou Jih-haw said the child fell victim to the severe strain
of enterovirus known as EV71. He first showed symptoms of the viral disease,
including fever and herpangina, a painful mouth infection, on May 22.</P>
      <P>His condition rapidly worsened and he was transferred to an intensive care unit
May 26. After nearly a month of treatment, he died Friday.</P>
      <P>Chou said 222 severe enterovirus cases had been recorded around Taiwan as of
Friday, with the infection initially occurring in the south and then spreading
northward to cover all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>Most of the patients have been young children aged under 5. The eight fatal
cases involved seven boys and one girl.</P>
      <P>As the epidemic is at its peak, Chou urged local parents to refrain from
bringing their young children to public places to reduce the risk of contracting
the sometimes fatal virus.</P>
      <P>He also reminded kindergarten and day care center operators to pay close heed to
campus hygiene and the health of children and staff members and to follow
regulations on class suspensions to help contain spread of the potentially
lethal disease.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center has already issued directives
that day care centers and any kindergarten or elementary school class in which
two confirmed cases are reported in one week must close for disinfection.</P>
      <P>Under the newly announced measure, schools that have withheld information on
enterovirus cases from health authorities will face fines of between NT$3,000
and NT$15,000 and their names will be published.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will ease the restrictions on visits to China by local government
heads and will reduce the application filing period from one month to two weeks
in advance, an official with Taiwan's China coordinating agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The new measures are expected to take effect in July, said the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan informed the
legislature  Wednesday  of a plan to revise the regulations.</P>
      <P>The announcement also came after the MAC rejected an application by Taichung
Mayor Jason Hu to travel aboard the maiden direct cross-strait charter flight
from the central city of Taichung to China.</P>
      <P>The council explained that the processing of Hu's application would take at
least one month.</P>
      <P>The official said that the plan to ease such restrictions had been in the works
for the past two years and that it was not until this week that the MAC decided
on feasible revisions.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, the council, in principle, will not prohibit travel to China
for any activity related to local government affairs, such as the promotion of
agricultural products or participation in travel fairs, the official added.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, before the relevant laws are amended, local city and county chiefs
will still be required to obtain permission from the central government to visit
China, the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will largely ease restrictions on Chinese film and television
companies shooting movies and TV programs in Taiwan by the end of the year at
the earliest, Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Shih said the office has to first consult with related sectors on opening Taiwan
to Chinese film and television producers and then coordinate with other
government agencies before existing regulations can be modified.</P>
      <P>"Although the opening is not imminent, I'm optimistic that it will take place by
the end of the year, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>She said that under the principles of "reciprocity" between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, the GIO is in favor of lifting the ban on Chinese film and
television producers as well as singers coming to Taiwan to perform.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that under existing regulations, Chinese movie companies can
only shoot films in Taiwan if two or fewer of the four leading cast members --
the leading actor and actress and supporting actor and actress -- are Chinese,
and all the others are Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Chinese TV companies are presently banned from filming TV programs in Taiwan,
and Chinese singers are also barred from performing in Taiwan or appearing on TV
shows.</P>
      <P>When the singers do visit Taiwan, they have to follow their itinerary according
to their application without changes.</P>
      <P>"To enhance cross-strait cultural, film and television exchanges, the GIO will
ease the restrictions as much as possible on matters that can be decided by the
office," Shih said.</P>
      <P>"This will help promote the development of related industries in Taiwan and
increase jobs, " Shih said, adding that she believed "the opening will not
affect related industries in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that Taiwanese singers face relatively fewer restrictions when
performing in China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is planning to reopen its doors to journalists of China's Xinhua News
Agency and the People's Daily and allow them to be stationed in Taiwan for
limited periods to cover news events, the Executive Yuan spokeswoman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said her office has
outlined a plan that would enable the Chinese journalists to be posted here.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, which will provide Chinese reporters the same treatment that
China has offered Taiwanese journalists, the media workers of the two Beijing-
based media outlets can stay in Taiwan for three months, and are allowed to
apply for one extension to prolong their stay, Shih said.</P>
      <P>She added that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top policy
coordinator for cross-Taiwan Strait affairs -- will review the proposal on June
30.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, she said, reporters for Xinhua and the People's
Daily may arrive in Taiwan July 4, together with the first group of Chinese
tourists to the island.</P>
      <P>Shih believed that MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan did not have any opinions on the
plan at present.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first accepted journalists from the two Chinese official media outlets in
2001 to come and stay for one-month periods to cover news events.</P>
      <P>Their rights to cover the news in Taiwan  were suspended indefinitely in April
2005, however, due to their biased reports after Beijing passed the so-called

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's flu vaccine project may soon get on track: CDC official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first build-own-operate (BOO) project to manufacture flu vaccines, is
entering a crucial stage after being delayed for three years, as the final deal
may be decided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and its American partner
next month, a high-ranking CDC official disclosed Friday.</P>
      <P>Rodney W. Unsworth, vice president of the U.S. pharmaceutical group Schering
Plough and president of its Asia Pacific subsidiary, called on Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-ping Friday, but declined to comment after on the BOO
project.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to cooperate with the pharmaceutical giant to manufacture
enough flu vaccines in the event of a pandemic spread by a flu virus like the
H5N1.</P>
      <P>If the project succeeds, Taiwan might take the lead among developing countries
in the area of vaccine manufacturing, using the latest cell-based method.</P>
      <P>Though the project, first initiated in 2004, had been delayed due to several
obstacles, a CDC official in late April said that it was not dead and that
Schering Plough was still very interested.</P>
      <P>Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that the pharmaceutical company was
asking for a more flexible schedule, while the CDC was hoping it wouldn't have
to reopen negotiations.</P>
      <P>"The deadline (the company) gave us for an answer is July 24," the official
confirmed in a telephone interview Friday.</P>
      <P>@He added that discussions were still underway, but declined to give any further
details of the deal.</P>
      <P>@Under the original plan, the vaccine manufacturing plant should have been
completed in 2007 and become operational in 2008, producing 2.5 million doses of
flu vaccines on an annual basis. The Department of Health was committed to
purchasing NT$4 billion (US$1.3 billion) worth of vaccines.</P>
      <P>@However, with the delays that have occurred, even if the contract can be signed
this year, the earliest possible time the project can come on stream is 2011.</P>
      <P>The project was delayed mainly because of opposition from local companies and
the fact that the Dutch company with which the CDC had originally agreed to do
business was acquired by Schering Plough.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung Software Park to welcome new investment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 3.8-hectare section of the Kaohsiung Software Park is set to open for new
investors and hopes to attract high-potential companies in advanced fields such
as biotechnology and information and communication, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>"This new investment promotion is part of the government's plan to balance the
regional development between northern and southern Taiwan," Jerry J.R. Ou, the
director general of the Export Processing Zone Administration under the ministry
said at a Friday news conference.</P>
      <P>Introducing the investment plan, Ou said the software park is targeting
companies in industries with most potential, including information and
communication technology (ICT) , biotechnology, and conventional industries that
are upgrading and transforming their businesses.</P>
      <P>The 3.8-hectare property is the only area that remains completely undeveloped
within the 7.9-hectare software park, which is one of Taiwan's  seven  Export
Processing  Zones  (EPZs)  that offer land and facilities to companies dedicated
to exporting.</P>
      <P>Launched in 2001, the park currently has a total investment amounting to US$400
million (NT$12.2 billion).</P>
      <P>Ou said that his administration, which is the supervisory authority of the park,
will officially take applications for new investment projects at the end of
June.</P>
      <P>"Companies must have at least NT$150 million in capital to be eligible for
applying, " Ou said, adding that the park would only welcome innovative
companies that produce value through research and development (R&amp;D).</P>
      <P>Citing the major benefits of investing in the EPZs, Ou said businesses could
import machinery and raw materials duty-free and are exempt from sales and
excise taxes on exported goods.</P>
      <P>"The Kaohsiung Software Park, with its perfect logistical setting that combines
seaport and airport locations and rich land resources, will be the driving force
in the prosperity of industries based in southern Taiwan," Ou predicted.</P>
      <P>He was partly referring to the recent promise by manufacturing giant Foxconn
Technology Group to invest in the southern software park to develop high-tech
software  and e-business  operation platforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ban on groups championing communism, secession 'unconstitutional'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 21 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An article in the Civil Associations Act that prohibits  citizens from
organizing  groups that advocate communism or Taiwan independence is
unconstitutional and should be scrapped  immediately,  according  to  a
constitutional  court interpretation.</P>
      <P>The Justices of the Constitutional Court (JCC) issued the ruling Friday in
response to a request by former Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen Shih-
meng to clarify the constitutionality of the Civil Associations Act (CAA)
provision.</P>
      <P>Chen filed an application with Taipei City's Department of Social Welfare in
1998 to organize a mainlanders association to promote the establishment of an
independent Taiwan republic through peaceful means.</P>
      <P>The municipal agency rejected the application on the grounds that it would
violate Article 2 of the Civil Associations Act, which reads: "Organization and
activities of civil associations may not advocate communism or claim abruption
of the country."</P>
      <P>Chen sought a constitutional interpretation by the grand justices after his
repeated petitions to the high and supreme administrative courts were rejected.</P>
      <P>The constitutional court said in its ruling that freedom of speech is a basic
human right protected by the Constitution and an indispensable mechanism to
ensure the normal development of a pluralistic democracy.</P>
      <P>Any legal restrictions on citizens' freedom of speech, the court said, must
comply with the principle of proportion.</P>
      <P>Noting that communism or secession from the country are political positions that
individuals can advocate as part of their right to freedom of speech, the court
said the Civil Associations Act's provision not only infringed upon citizens'
freedom of speech but also their freedom of association by forbidding them to
organize themselves to promote those doctrines and ideals.</P>
      <P>The court also found that the provision went beyond acceptable limitations to
personal freedoms set forth in Article 23 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The article says that all personal freedoms and rights enumerated in the
Constitution shall not be restricted by law except as necessary to prevent
infringement upon the freedoms of other persons, to avert an imminent crisis, to
maintain social order or to advance public welfare.</P>
      <P>In its ruling, the constitutional court also found Article 53 of the Civil
Associations Act unconstitutional. The article authorizes government  agencies
to reject  applications  to form private associations that violate Article 2.</P>
      <P>Upon learning of the constitutional interpretation, the Ministry of the Interior
said in a statement that it will refer to the intent of the ruling in handling
registration of political parties in the future.</P>
      <P>In the past, the ministry repeatedly rejected registration of a political party
called the "Taiwan Democratic Communist Party."</P>
      <P>From now on, the ministry said it will not deny registration of any political
party simply because  the word "communist"  or "communism" is found in its
title.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted, however, that it would adhere to the Constitution in
monitoring the behavior of political parties.</P>
      <P>Citing a provision in the Additional Articles of the Constitution which says
that any political party whose purposes or activities endanger the Republic of
China's survival or its free and democratic constitutional order should be seen
as unconstitutional, the ministry said it will refer any cases where parties are
suspected of violating the clause to the constitutional court for arbitration.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Interior (MOI) is set to launch a series of activities  from
Monday to mark the 10th anniversary of the passage of the Domestic Violence
Prevention Act.</P>
      <P>The activities will include an awards ceremony for people who have contributed
greatly to fighting domestic violence, seminars on past and future efforts to
prevent domestic violence in Taiwan, as well as other events to commemorate the
law's passage.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue, the MOI's Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Prevention
Committee said Saturday that putting an end to domestic violence and creating an
environment where nobody has to live in fear is everyone's wish and a
responsibility that the government cannot shirk.</P>
      <P>The committee said that the government has made an all-out effort on domestic
violence and sexual assault prevention by actively strengthening the domestic
violence reporting network, improving support services for victims of abuse and
raising public awareness of the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the committee, the efforts have born fruit, with more and more
victims of domestic violence mustering the courage to report abuse and seek
assistance.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, there were over 70,000 cases of domestic
violence reported last year, and that 76,755 cases have already been reported
this year, the committee noted.</P>
      <P>The committee stressed that working to prevent domestic violence is a long road
and that ceaseless efforts must be made by the government to stamp it out to
create an environment where everyone can live without fear.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's biomedical sector will not be able to compete successfully in the
global health care market without developing clinical trials, particularly phase
one clinical trials, Vice President Vincent Siew said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the International Symposium on Phase 1 Clinical Drug Development,
which was organized by the College of Medicine under National Taiwan University,
Siew said phase 1 clinical trials are the essential launching pads for new drug
development.</P>
      <P>"To maintain the prosperity and competitiveness of Taiwan's biomedical sector in
the future, the importance of clinical trails, especially phase one clinical
trials, cannot be overstated, " he said, citing such medical experiments as the
key to gaining a presence in the global health care market.</P>
      <P>Clinical trials are usually conducted to collect data on the safety and efficacy
of new medicines. Phase one trials are the first stage of testing new drugs on
humans and are designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and general
properities, or pharmacokinetics, of a drug.</P>
      <P>Phase one trials are in their early stages in Taiwan and other Asian countries,
which are better known as being traditionally considered for late phase clinical
development.</P>
      <P>Siew emphasized that the process of translating the research findings into
clinical application  requires phase one trials, followed by larger
investigations and eventually regulatory approval to facilitate widespread usage
of advanced medicines.</P>
      <P>He said the early phase trials are not well understood, and often subject to
significant misconceptions, particularly in clinical oncology research.</P>
      <P>Citing medicine as one of the next frontiers of industrial development, he said
Taiwan has found its own niche in the area, as medical schools always attract
the country's top talent.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the medical field is an ideal gateway for those who are interested
in mainland China investment, which will include biomedical investment," the
vice president noted.</P>
      <P>The symposium was joined by leading medical experts from the U.S. and a number
of European countries, who shared their experience in clinical trials research.</P>
      <P>Held as part of the celebration of the 113th anniversary of National Taiwan
University Hospital (NTUH) , the one-day symposium also marked the opening of
the hospital's new Phase 1 Center.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department  of Health confirmed
10 more cases of serious enteroviral infection Saturday morning, bringing the
total number of cases in Taiwan to 232 so far this year.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said the new confirmed cases were
spread across eight counties and cities in Taiwan, including Hsinchu, Taichung,
Tainan and Penghu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the enterovirus outbreak is still in its peak period, Chou reminded
the general public to remain vigilant in terms of their own and their children's
personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus outbreak has claimed eight lives in Taiwan to date, with the
latest fatality -- a 3-year-old boy in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County -- being
confirmed Friday night.</P>
      <P>The CDC is also conducting tests to determine whether a boy in the southern

      <P>Taiwan should not only improve its airports but also upgrade the quality of its
tourism services to cater to an anticipated influx of Chinese tourists and the
opening of weekend nonstop cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks after visiting Taipei Songshan Airport (TSA) , one of the
eight local airports that will handle the direct charter flights and tourists
from China.</P>
      <P>The launch of weekend charter flights on July 4 and arrivial of greater numbers
of Chinese tourists on July 18 were made possible by agreements  signed by
Taiwan's quasi-official  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in
Beijing on June 13.</P>
      <P>The services will initally cover five Chinese cities, including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing, and eight airports in Taiwan, including
in Taipei, Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Penghu, Hualien, Kinmen and Taitung.</P>
      <P>Noting that renovation work undertaken at Songshan Airport was proceeding
satisfactorily, Liu hoped that Taiwan would also pay attention to both the
services the country can offer and the training of those involved in the travel
industry.</P>
      <P>"We need to improve our services, not only for mainland tourists but also for
the future development of Taiwan's tourism, " Liu said, urging government
agencies and tourism operators to work together to make visitors to the ROC
"feel different."</P>
      <P>Liu further urged the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and the Department of
Health to implement a complete quarantine mechanism at local airports that will
serve Chinese tourists to ensure the health of travelers and local residents.</P>
      <P>Expressing his appreciation to the people and organizations involved in the
preparations for the influx of Chinese tourists, Liu said, "I am sure that
everyone has done their upmost on this matter, and I hope our efforts will
satisfy the people of our country."</P>
      <P>In response to criticism that the facilities of Taipei Songshan Airport are even
worse than those at North Korea's Pyongyang Airport, Civil Aeronautics
Administration Director General Billy Chang said under everyone's efforts,
"Songshan Airport will become the best airport."</P>
      <P>Efforts to renovate Songshan Airport became necessary after the SEF and ARATS
agreed to opening cross-strait flights every week from Friday to Monday.</P>
      <P>The airport served as Taiwan's main international gateway through the 1970s
until Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport opened in 1979.</P>
      <P>Since then, it has exclusively served domestic flights but has fallen into
disrepair with a decline in domestic air traffic prompted by the opening of
high-speed rail service in Taiwan's western corridor and a general falloff in
demand.</P>
      <P>The new agreement on direct charters to China, which the Ma Ying-jeou
administration hopes will one day turn into regularly scheduled flights, has
given hope to revive Taiwan's many local airports that are operating at a loss.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An organization to be formed by rice exporting countries in Southeast Asia will
further worsen the current worldwide shortage of food,  a Taiwanese economic
expert said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after Thailand's Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej proposed on
April 30 the establishment of the Organization of Rice Exporting Countries
(OREC) by 2012.</P>
      <P>The OREC -- which will also include Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar -- might
become a cartel that fixes global rice prices similar to the way the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sets oil prices, said Tu
Chaw-hsia, deputy director of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research's
Taiwan WTO Center.</P>
      <P>Tu said that the cartel would very likely affect the pricing mechanism now
driven by supply and demand in global food markets in the future.</P>
      <P>This would violate the basic principles and rules of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) aimed at promoting free trade, Tu said in her article
published in the latest issue of the institution's biweekly Chinese-language
journal.</P>
      <P>She cited many factors contributing to soaring global grain prices, including
the decreasing production of grains in some areas due to climate issues.</P>
      <P>Also contributing to higher prices, Tu said, have been moves by many countries
to turn crops into biofuel and the rising demand for grains in the emerging
markets of China and India.</P>
      <P>Global prices of grains began rising moderately in 2002, but have grown rapidly
since 2007, Tu observed.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the World Bank, Tu said that global prices of grains rose an
average of 83 percent over the past three years, substantially lowering the
ability of poor countries and low-income earners to buy the dietary staples.</P>
      <P>To resolve the food shortage at home, some countries have already banned rice
and wheat from being exported or started distributing grains and food, Tu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, grain prices might soar further as the United States and European
countries have promised to slash farm subsidies, she said.</P>
      <P>The promise was made during the ongoing Doha Round of WTO negotiations, in which
developing countries strongly criticized developed nations' use of subsidies to
prop up their higher-cost agricultural sectors, Tu said.</P>
      <P>The subsidies,  they argued,  have long kept international agricultural
commodities so cheap that developing countries cannot compete, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, worldwide food shortages have already sparked violence in dozens of
developing countries, and Tu said that the problem, if left unsolved, might
cause hunger and large-scale epidemics.</P>
      <P>The violence is also largely the result of uneven distribution of wealth and
income inequality, Tu said, describing these problems as hard to avoid in a
highly globalized and liberalized world.</P>
      <P>She said the international community now faces the challenge of working together
to enhance the development of developing countries and reduce the gap between
the rich and the poor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Songshan airport renovated for upcoming cross-strait flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Songshan Airport in the heart of Taipei City is being renovated and
transformed from a domestic hub into an international gateway that will serve
cross-Taiwan Strait routes.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport Director Shiau Deng-ke said Saturday the first terminal
building will be used for international flight operations while all domestic
flight services will be transferred to the airport's  smaller  second terminal
after the weekend  direct cross-strait charter flights begin July 4.</P>
      <P>The charter flights have been highly anticipated as a potential catalyst to
Taiwan's economy, especially among local airports serving domestic routes that
have fallen on hard times in the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>Only Taiwan's two main international gateways -- Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport and Kaohsiung International Airport -- were profitable  among  the
country's  18 airports  in 2006,  with domestic-oriented airports hurt by
declining passenger traffic.</P>
      <P>At its peak in 1997, Taipei Songshan Airport handled 15.4 million passengers and
served 10 million passengers as recently as 2001.</P>
      <P>But traffic plummeted to 6.73 million passengers in 2006 and has declined
further in the past year and a half with the opening in 2007 of a high-speed
rail line serving Taiwan's populated western corrider.</P>
      <P>With falling traffic numbers,  the airport has had little incentive to refurbish
its aging terminals, and Lien Sheng-wen, a member of the ruling Kuomintang's
policy-making Central Standing Committee, recently criticized the airport has
being even worse than North Korea's Pyongyang Airport.</P>
      <P>But Shiau said improvements are now being made in the first stage of the
airport's renovation, which includes upgrades to the airport's electrical
systems, bathrooms, and broadcasting and security systems.</P>
      <P>Shiau noted that the airport's management has prepared mid- and long-term
projects to improve the facility, which was built for military use during the
Japanese occupation era.</P>
      <P>The airport was inaugurated for solely civil aviation services in 1950 and
served as Taiwan's main international gateway until 1979, when the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport opened.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Citrus oil hopes to give dry cleaning a fresh image</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly opened dry cleaning store in Taipei is hoping that a natural citrus oil
developed by a Japanese company to replace chemical solvents will give dry
cleaning a healthier image and boost business in a difficult commercial
environment, the store's owner said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Owner Lee Cheng-yung said the store, which opened in May, is using citrus oil
and related dry cleaning agents that were developed by Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Industrial Machinery in 2005.</P>
      <P>The citrus oil, a pure natural essence oil extracted from the skins of citrus
fruits, is environmentally friendly and not harmful to people's health, unlike
traditional oil-based chemical solvents that may pose risks to the health of
both dry cleaner customers and operators, Lee said.</P>
      <P>An executive of the Japanese company, in Taiwan to provide Lee's store with
technical guidance, said that each cleaning uses only 10 grams of citrus oil and
does not leave any chemical residue on the clothes.</P>
      <P>The only drawback, Lee said, is that the cost of the citrus oil and equipment
used in the process is 10 times higher than for traditional dry cleaning agents,
resulting in dry cleaning prices that are 10-20 percent higher than the norm.</P>
      <P>He was confident, however,  that consumers will eventually appreciate the
advantages of the new solvent and support his more environmentally friendly
service.</P>
      <P>The optimistic Lee said he plans to open another 10 stores around Taiwan despite
recent weakness in the local dry cleaning sector.</P>
      <P>The Japanese executive said that after two years of promotion, the citrus oil is
now being used at 30 dry cleaning outlets in Japan despite a shrinking market
there as well.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Society should share child-raising costs: CEPD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Society as a whole should help reduce the cost of raising and educating children
to boost falling birth rates, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The council suggested in a statement that a social environment needed to be
created in which couples who wish to have children can take parental  leave
without worrying  about increasing  their companies' burdens.</P>
      <P>Without such concerns, couples will be more willing to have children, Taiwan's
top economic planner said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government should launch measures to help couples reduce day care
costs and educational expenses, the CEPD noted.</P>
      <P>The CEPD attributed  Taiwan's dropping birth rates to the increasing number of
people who are getting married and having children at an older age and a
decreasing number of women who have a spouse.</P>
      <P>The CEPD forecast that the number of newborns this year will decline to 204,000
from 270,000 in 1998 and that the average birth rate will lower to 1.1 children.</P>
      <P>Citing data released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) Thursday, the CEPD said that as of the end of 2007, 29.1
percent of men aged 30 to 44 are not married, which is higher than the 20.8
percent of unwed women in the same age group.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS figures also showed that 132,000 couples were married in 2007, down
7.7 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said that it will release a biennial forecast in August on when
Taiwan's population will stop growing and how the number of newborns and elderly
will change.</P>
      <P>The CEPD warned that dropping birth rates will also result in a smaller working
population.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate fell to 1.23 in 2003, one of the lowest in the world, the
CEPD went on.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the percentage of those 65 years old and above will rise to 10.4
percent of the total population this year from 8.3 percent in 1998, the CEPD
noted.</P>

      <P>Chiayi County in southern Taiwan celebrated the summer solstice Saturday with a
solar energy model car race among elementary and junior high students.</P>
      <P>The summer solstice marks the day when the sun is directly over the Tropic of
Cancer, which passes through Chiayi County, and also officially marks the first
day of summer in Taiwan and most of the northern hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen said the activity was aimed at
encouraging students to respect and make good use of natural resources and to
apply their knowledge of solar energy to their models.</P>
      <P>The contest was held at the county's Tropic of Cancer Solar Exploration Center,
and 110 elementary and 45 junior high school teams participated.</P>
      <P>The contest is among a series of the county's activities to celebrate the 100th
anniversary of the establishment of a monument marking the exact latitude of the
Tropic of Cancer, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipower suffers NT$23.25 billion net loss in 2007</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>State-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), Taiwan's only power distributor,
posted a net loss of NT$23.25 billion (US$762 million) in 2007 because of the
soaring cost of international energy resources, company Chairman Edward Chen
said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Last year the company spent a total of NT$4.46 trillion, NT$31.25 billion
higher than our total revenues of NT$4.15 trillion," Chen said at a shareholders
meeting where he announced the company's 2007 results.</P>
      <P>"This NT$31.25 billion deficit marked a huge increase of NT$28.42 billion
compared with the 2006 deficit of NT$2.81 billion, "he added.</P>
      <P>An income tax benefit of NT$7.98 billion helped trim the company's net loss in
2007 to NT$23.26 billion, the Taipower chairman said.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the company's woes to skyrocketing international oil and coal
prices, with electricity prices, frozen under the former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) administration since July 2006, unable to reflect the rising costs.</P>
      <P>Rapidly, rising oil and coal prices hit the company even harder in the first
five months of 2008, during which it posted a pre-tax loss of NT$ 47.9 billion,
more than three times the NT$15.5 billion pre-tax loss registered over the same
period of 2007.</P>
      <P>International prices of crude oil and coal have risen by 46 percent and 50
percent respectively since January 2008 to reach US$130.62 a barrel and US$150 a
ton. The two fuels accounted for half of the company's power generation in 2006.</P>
      <P>The 5.8 percent increase in electricity prices allowed in July 2006 were the
first hikes in 23 years, but with the soaring cost of inputs, the company has
been appealing for a new round of price increases.</P>
      <P>The new Kuomintang government has agreed to a 12.6 percent hike in electricity
prices on July 1 and another 12.6 percent increase on October 1 to reflect the
higher cost of raw materials and stem the state-run company's losses.</P>
      <P>"The company is also working on ways to boost operational efficiency, with
measures including cutting down the procurement price of fuels," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Hoping that price adjustments would be made in a more timely fashion in the
future, Chen warned that the company would not be able to construct new power-
generating facilities should it continue to run a deficit in the coming years.</P>
      <P>"The problem will also hurt the company's capital position, " he told
shareholders.</P>
      <P>To make up for the NT$23.26 billion loss, Taipower said it has used the
company's NT$1.99 billion legal surplus earned in previous years, as well as
another NT$21.26 billion from the company 's legal reserve.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of the public believes that the Kuomintang  (KMT)  government has relaxed
Taiwan's cross-strait policies too rapidly since taking office May 20,
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Huang said that when the TSU agreed to let one of its members, former legislator
Lai Shin-yuan, join the KMT government as the chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), the TSU based the decision on three conditions.</P>
      <P>The conditions were that cross-strait policy would maintain Taiwan's national
dignity, benefit the livelihoods of the average person, and highlight Taiwanese
identity, Huang said during a meeting with party members in the central county
of Changhua.</P>
      <P>But when the quasi-official bodies representing Taiwan and China held talks in
mid-June on opening direct charter flights, China dominated the negotiating
agenda, Huang contended.</P>
      <P>He further doubted if the government was really ready as it has been asserting
and questioned why the government was in a hurry to open direct cross-strait
flights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, speaking on the party's future plans, Huang said that the TSU, which
is generally seen as a strong advocate of Taiwan's separate identity, opposes
extremism.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan's two major political parties -- the ruling KMT and the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) -- as taking extreme stances,
Huang said that the TSU will seek the support of independent voters.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that the TSU will nominate as many members as possible to take
part in next year's local city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The party's influence  was curbed substantially  after its disappointing showing
in the Jan. 12 legislative elections, in which it failed to win a seat in the
113-seat body.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Saturday that the Ministry of Education (MOE)
will hire 40 full-time coaches and dispatch them to needy schools.</P>
      <P>Ma said the ministry has begun to plan the hiring of the coaches that are
expected to save the schools money that they can invest in fielding sports
teams.</P>
      <P>The president stressed the importance of sports, noting that the strength of
sports in a country is often proportional to the strength of the country.</P>
      <P>Except for a few communist countries, Ma said, "the stronger a nation is in
sport, the more powerful is the country, " and he promised that funding for
sports would increase.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he visited National Cheng Kung Commercial
&amp; Aquaculture Senior Vocational High School in Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Observing that the school's baseball team was forced to play with old bats and
baseballs, Ma donated NT$200,000 (US$6,560) to the team.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was reminded of the Hong Ye little league team four decades ago,
referring to the legendary Little League team from Hong Ye Elementary School in
a remote part of Taitung County that captured the public's imagination in 1968

    <TEXT>
      <P>A National Chengchi University assistant professor, whose controversial remarks
has prompted his school not to renew his contract, said Saturday he will begin a
hunger strike in front of the Presidential Office July 1.</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung stressed that the action will "not be a protest" but rather "an
act of contrition and soul-searching."</P>
      <P>He noted that some have faulted him for "setting a very bad example" with
remarks he made during late 2007 and early 2008, especially  those critical of
then presidential  candidate  Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>This is why he has decided to show contrition and engage in soul-searching in
front of the Presidential Office, saying that his way will be "peaceful," and
that he will not disrupt traffic or order in the area.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee of National Chengchi University decided June 18 that the
school would not renew Chuang's contract because of a series of unseemly remarks
he made during the time he served as the chief secretary of the Ministry of
Education.</P>
      <P>"His unseemly behavior has undermined the norm befitting a teacher, " the
committee said in justifying its decision, which will become valid after being
approved by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>The reason given by the university is one of those listed in the Statute
Governing the Employment of Educational Personnel that could keep Chuang from
assuming another professorial post in the future.</P>
      <P>Under the statute, if National Chengchi University officially cites Chuang's
behavior as the reason not to rehire him, he will be stripped of his
qualifications to serve in the educational field and be unable to work as a
professor for any university.</P>
      <P>Lin Bi-jaw, convener of the committee and the school's vice president, said the
intent of the committee was to "discontinue" the hiring of Chuang and not to
shut him out of other teaching jobs.</P>
      <P>The school will meet with legal experts over the matter and convene a meeting
next week, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chuang said that he has "confidence in Taiwan's judicial and educational
systems," and that he will not worry about not being able to return to academia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a pro-Taiwan independence society came to Chuang's defense Saturday.</P>
      <P>Several members of Taiwan Society North gathered at National Chengchi University
in suburban Taipei to demand that the school revoke its ruling or face a larger-
scale protest next week.</P>
      <P>Chuang became the MOE's chief secretary in August 2007 at the behest of then-
Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng.</P>
      <P>In December that year, Chuang took charge of the project to remove a plaque in
front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, which was later renamed Taiwan
Democracy Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>He became a controversial figure at the time because of his caustic remarks
about Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin and then presidential candidate Ma, such as
calling Ma a "sissy, " but he was also heralded as a hero by some in the then
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>On March 16, at a campaign rally to drum up support for DPP presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh. Chuang attacked Ma's late father for his debauchery. He
resigned as chief secretary that night after the comments were even rebuked by
members of the Hsieh campaign.</P>
      <P>His verbal gaffes -- along with those of Education Minister Tu and then
Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jyh-wey -- were believed to have
played a role in the bruising defeat of Hsieh, who lost to Ma by 17 percentage
points, or more than 2.21 million votes, in the March 22 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Penghu faces challenge of preserving 'mini' schools</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Penghu County,  Taiwan,  June 21 (CNA)
06/21/08  22:27:52
(By Kao Mao-hsiung &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou may have advised local governments to try and keep
schools in remote areas with low enrollments open on Saturday, but Penghu County
off Taiwan's western coast has a bigger challenge than most to heed his advice.</P>
      <P>The archipelago, located close to southern China, consists of 90 small islets
covering an area of 141 square kilometers. Only 18 of the islands are inhabited.</P>
      <P>Many of the residents of the county's more remote islands have left their homes
because of the lack of economic opportunity and inconvenient transportation
links to more populated centers, leading to a severe decline in the number of
school-age children -- and to schools with enrollments in the single digits.</P>
      <P>Since 1983, six elementary schools have been shut down in Penghu, leaving only
eight standing. The most recent closing was Dacang Elementary School in Baisha
township, which was closed for good in 2005, forcing its only two students to be
transferred to the county capital of Magong to continue their education.</P>
      <P>Graduation ceremonies at the schools in recent days should have been festive
occasions, but they only served to highlight the ominous clouds hovering over
their futures, and the problems students and educators face in dealing with
small class sizes.</P>
      <P>Only three students graduated from the elementary schools on Niaoyu and Huayu
islands, while only two graduated from the school on Hujingyu.</P>
      <P>Kangzi and Shiaomen elementary schools each saw off only one graduate in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-ling was the only graduate of Shiaomen Elementary School. Over the past
six years, she has been the only student in her grade,  and therefore  always
ranked at the top for academic performance.</P>
      <P>She was the only "model student" in her class and was honored at the graduation
ceremony with every award her school could offer.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chang also had the privilege of having her teachers to herself;
she had no classmates to compete with her or draw attention away.</P>
      <P>But that doesn't mean it was a perfect environment.</P>
      <P>"It's a lot of pressure when attending class alone because it was impossible to
take a nap when I was tired," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang's teacher, Lin Chung-teh, said the advantage of teaching one on one is
that he was able to control the scheduled progress of the class and had no
problems in communicating with his student.</P>
      <P>But there were also drawbacks, Lin said. Chang did not face any competition and
had nothing to compel her to learn. He also noted that students in such a
situation are also likely to be less inquisitive than when learning in a group.</P>
      <P>The mother of Chen Ai-tung, who recently graduated from Magong Elementary
School, expressed her support for the idea of closing these "mini" schools
because she believes children can only grow up with healthy and normal
characters within a group environment.</P>
      <P>Chen had studied at Dacang Elementary School before it was closed three years
ago, Chen's mother recalled, saying her daughter had been the only student when
she was in the first, second and third grades.</P>
      <P>In those days, Chen always was first -- and last -- in every exam, Chen's mother
said.</P>
      <P>To the principals, teachers and parents of students in Penghu County's "mini"
schools, the prospect of facing school closures weighs heavily.</P>
      <P>Some parents of children at Shiaomen Elementary School, which now only has nine
students, have begun a campaign to persuade parents of students in other parts
of the county to transfer their children to Shiaomen next semester and keep the
school alive.</P>
      <P>County Bureau of Education Director Hu Chung-kai admitted that there is little
the bureau can do to keep the mini schools in remote areas open because its
education resources are limited and have to be used in the most efficient way.</P>
      <P>Complicating Hu's dilemma is that it is extremely difficult to hire teachers
willing to work on a remote island, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the obstacles, though, Hu said the county has no plans to abolish any
schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>On Saturday at a graduation ceremony held by Hong Ye Elementary School in a
remote area in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, where six students graduated,
President Ma said no remote schools should be closed rashly.</P>
      <P>He believed the function of a school in a community goes beyond simply offering
a place where children can get an education, and he worried that although
closing a school could save money, the bonds developed between the schools and
their communities could never be replaced.</P>
      <P>Yet for the teachers, parents and administrators in places like Penghu County,
those bonds may still have to be sacrificed to budgetary  and  numerical
realities,  victims  of  inexorable modernization trends that show no signs of
relenting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hospitals and clinics should shut down their children's play areas
beginning next week to help prevent the further spread of the potentially lethal
enterovirus infection, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The epidemic response command center has directed city and county governments
to convey the message to medical institutions in their respective administrative
districts," said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) who concurrently serves as spokesman for the Cabinet-level
command center.</P>
      <P>Noting that children's play areas inside medical institutions could become a
hotbed for transmission or cross infection of enterovirus, Chou said their
temporary closure will contribute to control the epidemic.</P>
      <P>As some hospitals and clinics already close their play areas one or two weeks
ago, Chou said the implementation of the new ban should not be too difficult.</P>
      <P>With the epidemic now at its peak, Chou said, play areas at hospitals or clinics
should not reopen until after the command center lifts the ban.</P>
      <P>Violators will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 in
line with the current regulations, Chou added.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of aseptic
meningitis and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with
compromised immune systems.</P>
      <P>The epidemic response command center issued the order amid a continued rise in
the number of confirmed severe enterovirus cases around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday  morning,  the number of confirmed  severe enterovirus cases had
risen to 232 so far this year, eight of which were fatal, according to CDC
tallies.</P>
      <P>The CDC is also conducting tests to detrmine whether a boy in the southern
county of Chiayi who died Wednesday had been infected with the virus, Chou said,
adding that the test results are expected within the enxt two weeks.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this year and has
spread northward to cover all pats of the island. Most of the patients have been
young children aged under 5.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC, almost all serious enterovirus cases recorded this year
were caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) -- the virus' deadliest strain -- and all
those infected were aged under 5, with the exception of one 14-year-old resident
of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>As the outbreak is still in its peak period, Chou reminded the public to remain
vigilant in terms of their own and their children's personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>There are still no vaccines for the viral disease, but frequent hand-washing and
maintaining a clean living environment are believed to be the best protection
against the infection, Chou said.</P>

      <P>More than 130,000 residents around Taiwan walked out of their home Saturday
evening to lend their support for a "Lights Out Day" campaign to mark the annual
summer solstice in an eco-friendly way.</P>
      <P>Many important landmark buildings in Taipei and other major cities in Taiwan
also supported the drive by turning off their lights and neon signs for one hour
from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., in order to save energy and reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Society of Wildness (SOW) , which organized the event, said
this year's "Lights Out Day" event has helped save approximately 280,000
kilowatt-hours of electricity and reduced about 178 tons of greenhouse gas
emissions.</P>
      <P>To help people discover, or rediscover, the pleasure and beauty of a night
without lights, the SOW organized a series of outdoor activities at Taipei's
Daan Forest Par, Hsinchu City's Dong Meng Circle and Tainan City's Barclay
Memorial Park, including unplugged concerts, star gazing, story-telling,
ecological excursions and dances.</P>
      <P>In the Daan Forest Park, many noted singers, including indigenous singer Hu Teh-
fu, performed in an unplugged concert, drawing a large crowd of music fans and
environmental-conscious spectators.  A "low-carbon" wedding -- a real one -- was
held, in which the bride's wedding gown was made from recycled plastic bags and
paper.</P>
      <P>The annual "Lights Out Day" event was initiated by the SOW in 2005 and observed
each year on the summer solstice, which marks the day when the sun is directly
over the Tropic of Cancer, which passes through Taiwan's Chiayi County, and also
officially marks the first day of summer in Taiwan and most of the northern
hemisphere.</P>
      <P>This year, nine cities in Taiwan and several major cities in China, Japan and
South Korea took part in the "Lights Out Day" activities to make the summer
solstice an energy-saving movement, the SOW spokesman said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, he said, the number of participants to this year's activities
increased by about 40 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>A number of renowned Asian landmarks, such as Taipei 101 tower, HSBC Hong Kong
headquarters building, Seoul Tower and Tokyo Tower, turned off their lights for
one hour in support of the "Lights Out Day" campaign, the spokesman added.</P>

between the members of a man's family, how is it right for a man to ignore the
duties he owes to his sovereign and country?"</TEXT>

      <P>Local hospitals and clinics should shut down their children's play areas
beginning next week to help prevent the further spread of the potentially lethal
enterovirus infection, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The epidemic response command center has directed city and county governments
to convey the message to medical institutions in their respective administrative
districts," said Chou Jih-haw, deputy director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) who concurrently serves as spokesman for the Cabinet-level
command center.</P>
      <P>Noting that children's play areas inside medical institutions could become a
hotbed for transmission or cross infection of enterovirus, Chou said their
temporary closure will contribute to control the epidemic.</P>
      <P>As some hospitals and clinics already close their play areas one or two weeks
ago, Chou said the implementation of the new ban should not be too difficult.</P>
      <P>With the epidemic now at its peak, Chou said, play areas at hospitals or clinics
should not reopen until after the command center lifts the ban.</P>
      <P>Violators will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 in

    <HEADLINE>Penghu faces challenge of preserving 'mini' schools</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Penghu County,  Taiwan,  June 21 (CNA)
06/22/08  10:51:30
(By Kao Mao-hsiung &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou may have advised local governments to try and keep
schools in remote areas with low enrollments open on Saturday, but Penghu County
off Taiwan's western coast has a bigger challenge than most to heed his advice.</P>
      <P>The archipelago, located close to southern China, consists of 90 small islets
covering an area of 141 square kilometers. Only 18 of the islands are inhabited.</P>
      <P>Many of the residents of the county's more remote islands have left their homes
because of the lack of economic opportunity and inconvenient transportation
links to more populated centers, leading to a severe decline in the number of
school-age children -- and to schools with enrollments in the single digits.</P>
      <P>Since 1983, six elementary schools have been shut down in Penghu, leaving only
eight standing. The most recent closing was Dacang Elementary School in Baisha
township, which was closed for good in 2005, forcing its only two students to be
transferred to the county capital of Magong to continue their education.</P>
      <P>Graduation ceremonies at the schools in recent days should have been festive
occasions, but they only served to highlight the ominous clouds hovering over
their futures, and the problems students and educators face in dealing with
small class sizes.</P>
      <P>Only three students graduated from the elementary schools on Niaoyu and Huayu
islands, while only two graduated from the school on Hujingyu.</P>
      <P>Kangzi and Shiaomen elementary schools each saw off only one graduate in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-ling was the only graduate of Shiaomen Elementary School. Over the past
six years, she has been the only student in her grade,  and therefore  always
ranked at the top for academic performance.</P>
      <P>She was the only "model student" in her class and was honored at the graduation
ceremony with every award her school could offer.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chang also had the privilege of having her teachers to herself;
she had no classmates to compete with her or draw attention away.</P>
      <P>But that doesn't mean it was a perfect environment.</P>
      <P>"It's a lot of pressure when attending class alone because it was impossible to
take a nap when I was tired," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang's teacher, Lin Chung-teh, said the advantage of teaching one on one is
that he was able to control the scheduled progress of the class and had no
problems in communicating with his student.</P>
      <P>But there were also drawbacks, Lin said. Chang did not face any competition and
had nothing to compel her to learn. He also noted that students in such a
situation are also likely to be less inquisitive than when learning in a group.</P>
      <P>The mother of Chen Ai-tung, who recently graduated from Magong Elementary
School, expressed her support for the idea of closing these "mini" schools
because she believes children can only grow up with healthy and normal
characters within a group environment.</P>
      <P>Chen had studied at Dacang Elementary School before it was closed three years
ago, Chen's mother recalled, saying her daughter had been the only student when
she was in the first, second and third grades.</P>
      <P>In those days, Chen always was first -- and last -- in every exam, Chen's mother
said.</P>
      <P>To the principals, teachers and parents of students in Penghu County's "mini"
schools, the prospect of facing school closures weighs heavily.</P>
      <P>Some parents of children at Shiaomen Elementary School, which now only has nine
students, have begun a campaign to persuade parents of students in other parts
of the county to transfer their children to Shiaomen next semester and keep the
school alive.</P>
      <P>County Bureau of Education Director Hu Chung-kai admitted that there is little
the bureau can do to keep the mini schools in remote areas open because its
education resources are limited and have to be used in the most efficient way.</P>
      <P>Complicating Hu's dilemma is that it is extremely difficult to hire teachers
willing to work on a remote island, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the obstacles, though, Hu said the county has no plans to abolish any
schools in the near future.</P>
      <P>On Saturday at a graduation ceremony held by Hong Ye Elementary School in a
remote area in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, where six students graduated,
President Ma said no remote schools should be closed rashly.</P>
      <P>He believed the function of a school in a community goes beyond simply offering
a place where children can get an education, and he worried that although
closing a school could save money, the bonds developed between the schools and
their communities could never be replaced.</P>
      <P>Yet for the teachers, parents and administrators in places like Penghu County,
those bonds may still have to be sacrificed to budgetary  and  numerical
realities,  victims  of  inexorable modernization trends that show no signs of
relenting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to help private sector tap markets in Russia, India</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will help the private sector tap markets in Russia and India to
take advantage of surging consumption and imports in the two countries, the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will sponsor a series of workshops in July to help Taiwanese companies
and businesspeople better understand market trends and trade customs in Russia
and India and enable them to make inroads into these two growing markets, the
bureau said.</P>
      <P>Consumption in Russia has grown rapidily over the past year, spurred by soaring
international oil prices that have driven up Russia's foreign exchange reserves
dramatically.</P>
      <P>Russia is the world's second largest exporter of crude oil and the largest
exporter of natural gas.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Russia's two-way trade amounted to US$552.2 billion, with a trade
surplus totaling US$152.8 billion. Of the country's imports, machinery and
related equipment accounted for about 50 percent, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese businessmen can cash in on the Russian machinery market as a lot of
machinery and related equipment made in Taiwan is highly competitive on the
international market, " one bureau official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bureau noted that India -- another of the emerging BRICs,
comprised of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- is also a growing market,  one
that the BOFT strongly recommends  local businesses explore.</P>
      <P>The largest country in South Asia, India is blessed with a huge population and
rich natural resources, and its industrial development has flourished in recent
years, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Interested companies and individuals are welcome to contact the BOFT for the
workshops, which will be free of charge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cebu's history, natural charms growing on Taiwanese tourists</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  21  (CNA)
06/22/08  17:01:59</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exploring the streets of Cebu, the Philippines second largest city, Taiwanese
tourists are constantly reminded of home by the Chinese characters reading
"Kaohsiung City Bus Service Administration" that grace almost every public bus.</P>
      <P>But Cebu, which established sisterhood with Kaoshiung in 1970 and dubbed the
"Queen City of the South, " has plenty of its own unique charms that has made it
a popular destination not only for visitors from Taiwan, but also from Southeast
Asia, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Though less well-known to Taiwanese tourists than the capital city of Manila,
Cebu's popularity is on the rise.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese arrivals to the city grew moderately by 9.12 percent to 17,676 in
2007, but exploded in the first two months of 2008, growing 292.6 percent year-
on-year to 12,062.</P>
      <P>The oldest city in the Philippines, Cebu is located in the central part of the
Philippine archipelago, 365 miles south of Manila and 1,030 miles away from
Taipei, on a tropical island known for its coastal plains, limestone plateaus
and rugged mountains.</P>
      <P>The city's trade relations with China and Southeast Asian countries date back
3,000 years, and Cebu was a prosperous settlement before it was colonized by
Spain in 1521, when Ferdinand Magellan landed there and not only opened the area
but also a new page in Philippine history.</P>
      <P>Beyond Cebu's historical significance as the location of the first Spanish
settlement in the Philippines, its rich history has made it one of the country's
most important cultural centers, with a number of sites that visitors -- whether
traveling alone or in a group -- do not want to miss.</P>
      <P>Among them is Magellan's Cross, which was supposedly planted by Magellan after
his arrival in Cebu. The cross symbolizes the beginning of Christianity in the
Philippines and marks the spot where the first Christian Filipinos, including
Rajah Humabon, Queen Juana and about 400 of their followers, were baptized.</P>
      <P>A short walk away from the cross is an Augustinian churchVthe Basilica Minore
del Santo Nino -- which was built on the site where the image of a young Jesus
was found and where one of the Philippines' earliest churches was erected before
burning down.</P>
      <P>Another must see is Fort San Pedro, a stately reminder of a bygone era.
Initially a wooden structure in 1565 but finally built of stone in 1738 after a
number of modifications, the triangular bastion fort is the smallest and oldest
fort in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The Philippines have also been influenced by Chinese culture, and Cebu is no
exception. The Taoist Temple built in 1964 has served as a concrete reminder of
Cebu's well-established Chinese community, which has contributed significantly
to the province's development.</P>
      <P>The temple, a classic example of Chinese architecture, houses the teachings of
Lao-tzu, the 600 B.C. Chinese philosopher.</P>
      <P>Historical sites are at the foundation of Cebu's rich culture that helped to
attract 1.49 million visitors in 2007, but the area's natural beauty has also
made it a paradise for nature lovers or adventurous explorers.</P>
      <P>Cebu province's white sand beaches, lowlands and highlands are all blessed with
an abundance of interesting flora and fauna that capture the imagination of
local and foreign tourists alike.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, because the island of Cebu is surrounded by beautiful diving spots,
such as Mactan and Malapascua islands, most of the hotels and resorts along the
islands' coast have diving facilities and instructors to make Cebu a diver
friendly destination.</P>
      <P>To cater to the growing numbers of visitors to Cebu, a number of hotels and
resorts, ranging from budget accommodation to the height of luxury, have
recently opened in the region, especially along Mactan Island's long white sand
beaches.</P>
      <P>Tucked in a lush tropical landscape with a crystalline coastline, Shangri-La's
Mactan Resort and Spa,  the Philippines' premier five-star resort, has become an
exciting refuge for nature lovers and a favorite among holidaymakers, as it
combines rustic surroundings, modern conveniences and genuine Asian hospitality.</P>
      <P>The hotel's CHI spa allows visitors to enjoy the privacy and luxury of an
enchanted world of six spacious villas and eight garden suites, a private garden
patio, water pavilions, sunken tub, herbal steam room and shower.</P>
      <P>Another resort -- the Plantation Bay Resort and Spa -- is another favorite among
visitors to Cebu. Set in 11.4 hectares of secluded grounds 30 minutes from the
city, it offers one of the largest privately-owned waterways in the world, with
the clean elegance of colonial-plantation architecture.</P>
      <P>Opened in late 1996, the Plantation Bay has already accommodated over half a
million visitors from every corner of the globe, mainly from South Korea and
Japan.</P>
      <P>Li Jiang, the resort's account executive, told the Central News Agency that she
hopes more Taiwanese tourists will stay at the resort to "definitely make their
Cebu experience unforgettable."</P>
      <P>Transportation to Cebu from Taiwan is convenient. Budget airline Cebu Pacific
Air flies daily to Cebu for a one-way fare ranging from NT$2,500 to NT$4,500
(US$82 to US$148) and Mandarin Airlines also serves the destination.</P>
      <P>For those in Taiwan who enjoy experiencing different people, culture, tradition,
scenery and food, Cebu -- a mere two and a half hours away -- could be the ideal
destination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CWB closely monitoring Typhoon Fengshen</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) is closely monitoring Typhoon Fengshen as it
moves toward Taiwan after battering the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The storm, which was located about 800 kilometers south of Taiwan's southernmost
tip of Eluanbi around noon Sunday,  was weakening as it moved in a north-
northwesterly direction toward Taiwan at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour, the
bureau said.</P>
      <P>The typhoon -- the sixth storm reported in the western Pacific this year --
could be reclassified as a tropical storm or even a low pressure system within
the next 24 hours, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>If Fengshen remains a tropical storm, the bureau indicated it would issue a sea
warning for the storm on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The following 24 hours will be crucial for the weather bureau to monitor the
typhoon and decide what to do, " said Wu Teh-jung, director the CWB's Weather
Forecast Center.</P>
      <P>"There are still many variables which could alter the development of the
typhoon," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Once the typhoon enters the South China Sea over the next couple of days, its
intensity will be reduced by a "wind shear effect" that is expected to be
created by a clash between a Pacific high pressure system in the upper
atmosphere and a low pressure system in the lower atmosphere, Wu suggested.</P>
      <P>Temperatures will remain high islandwide Sunday and Monday, with the mercury
shooting up to 37 degrees Celsius in the north. The mercury will fall only after
rains brought by the storm arrive on Tuesday or Wednesday, Wu predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former national security official has denied charges reportedly made by senior
officials in the new Kuomintang (KMT) government that the former Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration failed to hand over files related to
negotiations between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>In an article published Saturday, the Chinese-language United Evening News
quoted anonymous senior government sources as saying that the National Security
Council (NSC) could not find the files because the DPP took them away and did
not put them on the handover list.</P>
      <P>However, Lin Cheng-wei, director of the DPP's Department of International
Affairs and a former NSC advisory commissioner, said that the files were handed
over to the KMT administration, which took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the NSC kept all the files.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that during former President Chen Shui-bian's second term in
office, the NSC regularly convened a cross-ministerial meeting on Taiwan-Japan
relations.</P>
      <P>Members of the meeting included heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
National Security Bureau (NSB), the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the
Mainland Affairs Council, as well as the deputy secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Incumbent Vice President Vincent Siew was also a member of the meeting in his
then capacity as convener of the Taiwan Nippon Science Technology commission,
Lin recalled.</P>
      <P>Siew stopped attending the meeting after he was nominated as the KMT's vice
presidential candidate, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin noted that the NSC kept minutes of the meetings and placed them
on the handover list, of which he also has a copy.</P>
      <P>In addition to the NSC, Lin said that the foreign ministry handled negotiations
with Japan, while the NSB was in charge of collecting and analyzing intelligence
related to Japan.</P>
      <P>He also dismissed another accusation in the report which alleged the former DPP
administration set up an illegal agency, the Committee on Japanese Affairs,
under the NSC's control to handle matters related to Japan.</P>
      <P>Lin countered that the committee is a special task force, not an illegal agency,
and that it is under the command of the foreign ministry, not the NSC.</P>

      <P>Nearly 70 percent of junior high school students said they have been taught with
alternate "reference" books in class despite a ban on such publications, a
recent poll showed.</P>
      <P>"Such a result indicates abnormalities in our education system, as
'credentialism' is still hurting Taiwan's junior high students, " Shih Ying,
chairman of the Humanistic Education Foundation, said Sunday at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Presenting the results of the foundation's survey that polled 1,433 students in
299 junior high schools nationwide, Shih said 69.94 percent  of respondents
said they have been taught with the unauthorized reference books, which present
course material in a way that makes it easier for students to prepare for tests.</P>
      <P>Such conduct by the teachers is against the law. The Ministry of Education (MOE)
has prohibited elementary and junior high school teachers from using reference
publications to teach and test students since 1989, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"In addition, an overwhelming 97.38 percent of the respondents said that their
schools were using the unauthorized books, " the chairman said.</P>
      <P>Shih attributed the high use of the reference books to an education  system
that  is too focused  on passing  entrance examinations, which Taiwanese junior
high school students must take to enter high school.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih said 89.39 percent of students indicated that their teachers
have used unauthorized test prep sheets to help students score better on the
exams.</P>
      <P>"Teachers who have violated the ban should be sacked, while the school
principals who tolerate such conduct should also leave their posts, " argued
Shih, who is also a mathematics professor at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>The foundation will invite students and their parents to organize a monitoring
group to help normalize the education system.</P>
      <P>"We will appeal to the MOE and local education bureaus to make efforts to
normalize our education system,  especially at the elementary and junior high
school level, where teaching should focus on cultivating good manners and
integrity instead of professional training, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted between May 15 and June 10, with a confidence level of 95
percent and a margin of error of plus/minus 3 percent.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has urged tourism operators at a popular vacation spot
in central Taiwan to provide top-quality service to impress Chinese tourists and
generate repeat business.</P>
      <P>Up to 3,000 Chinese tourists are expected to visit Taiwan per day beginning July
18, and some 80 percent of them are expected to visit Sun Moon Lake, in the
central county of Nantou, Liu said at a meeting with local tourism operators at
the tourist hot spot Saturday.</P>
      <P>With such high percentage of the Chinese tour groups making stops there, Liu
appealed to the businesspeople to make a strong positive impression on Chinese
visitors by offering high-quality service so they will want to visit Taiwan's
biggest lake again.</P>
      <P>Liu also urged them to demonstrate their creativity and vitality in building Sun
Moon Lake into an international vacation destination.</P>
      <P>"We should make efforts to improve the area's infrastructure not only for
Chinese tourists but also to attract the attention of tourists from around the
world," Liu said.</P>
      <P>One businessman complained to Liu that the lake area has not changed over the
years, with overlapping jurisdictions of multiple government agencies hindering
the area's development.</P>
      <P>To solve the problem, Liu said he will give local authorities the sole power to
handle related issues.</P>
      <P>Lai Cheng-i, chairman of the Shining Group, which operates Sun Moon Lake's most
upscale resort, The Lalu, suggested at the meeting that more than 100 houseboats
in the area should be preserved and become a special feature of the area.</P>
      <P>Lai also proposed organizing world-class performances on the lake on a regular
basis to attract visitors from around the globe.</P>
      <P>Liu agreed with Lai's houseboats suggestion and added that the lake should also
have religious or cultural features as well as evening shows.</P>
      <P>The premier added that holding performances on the lake is a good idea but
required careful planning to prevent them from damaging the local landscape. He
asked Lai to propose a concrete plan to the government.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Liu took a boat ride on the lake and promised that the
government will help local tour boat operators replace their diesel engines with
ones powered by clean energies to reduce the noise and pollution they generate.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should consolidate itself internally and plan effectively in preparation
for its next step in dealing with China, now that cross-strait tensions have
been eased and accords on two key issues have been reached, a Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should strengthen the success of its latest achievements to enable both
sides to continue their rapprochement to the benefit of the people,  the
official  from Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has voiced concern that the
Kuomintang (KMT) administration has relaxed Taiwan's cross-strait policies too
rapidly since taking office May 20, and many observers wonder what the
government's next step will be.</P>
      <P>The MAC official said the administration should move more quickly to finish its
administrative planning on relevant cross-strait policies and launch preparatory
negotiations with China on other important issues.</P>
      <P>"We will engage  in further  negotations  and seek deeper understanding with
China via dialogue between the two cross-strait intermediary bodies -- Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)," he noted.</P>
      <P>Authorized by the MAC, the quasi-official SEF struck agreements in Beijing June
13 with the ARATS on the launch of weekend cross-Taiwan  Strait charter flight
services and the entry of increased numbers of Chinese tourists into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The talks also helped strengthen communications between the two sides to deal
with contingencies.</P>
      <P>Taking an accident that occurred in China's Heilongjiang province involving a
29-member Taiwanese tour group as an example, the official said, the SEF and the
ARATS activated an emergency mediation mechanism across to allow the Taiwan
tourists to receive emergency attention in the wake of the accident.</P>
      <P>The contact June 16 marked the first use of the cross-strait emergency mediation
mechanism following the June 13 agreements struck in Beijing between the two
quasi-official intermediary bodies.</P>
      <P>"It symbolized that SEF-ARATS negotiations have started to become
institutionalized and that their relations have been normalized to a degree not
seen since May 1995," he said.</P>
      <P>Talks between the SEF and the ARATS were interrupted in 1995, when Beijing
abruptly shut down the communication channel in protest of then President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to the U.S.</P>
      <P>When the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party assumed power in 2000,
cross-strait relations deteriorated further, but relations began to thaw after
Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT won the presidential election on March 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Straighter routes urged for cross-strait flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although landmark nonstop weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China are
set to take off July 4, local carriers and travelers believe the flight paths of
the charters need to be straighter and more direct to fully realize the benefits
of the new measure.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement reached on the weekend flights between the two sides in mid-
June, all new charters between Taiwan and China will be required to fly over
Hong Kong or Macau flight information zones, adding more than an hour to flights
between Taiwan and central and northern China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based carriers contend, however, that "genuine" direct routes should be
adopted to effectively reduce operating costs and travel time, particularly in
view of high fuel prices.</P>
      <P>China-based Taiwanese businessmen agree. They contend that the weekend charters
should fly the straightest routes without traveling through the airspace of a
third territory or country so that they can complete a round trip between the
two sides within a day.</P>
      <P>In response to the widespread criticism, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
spokesman Liu Te-shun said recently that Taiwan and China would discuss the
"new" and "less circuitous" charter flight routes in upcoming talks.</P>
      <P>Because the adoption of new routes must be agreed upon by both sides in an
official accord, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said related
government agencies will soon authorize the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) to discuss the issue with its Chinese counterpart by the end of
this year, based on the agreements reached in their negotiations held earlier
this month in Beijing.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Lin Hsing-teh also confirmed that the administration
is aiming  for more direct  routes for future Taiwan-China charter flights.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the CAA must first obtain the consent of the Ministry of
National Defense before the MAC -- Taiwan's top China policy planning agency --
can decide on the issue.</P>
      <P>If shorter and straighter routes were adopted in line with the CAA plan, a
flight between Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Shanghai would take only
67 minutes, instead of the 150 minutes projected for the currently planned
weekend charters.</P>
      <P>A more direct Taoyuan to Beijing flight would take two and a half hours, 75
minutes less than currently planned, and a Taoyuan to Xiamen flight would only
require one hour, 30 minutes less than under the presently devised system.</P>
      <P>According to CAA officials, newly designed cross-strait flight routes should
avoid passing across the imaginary median line in the Taiwan Strait to safeguard
national security but also avoid detouring through Hong Kong or Macau flight
information zones to shorten flight distances and save travel time.</P>
      <P>To achieve that goal, Taiwan and China would have to draw up special routes in
the north and south for the exclusive use of weekend charter flights, CAA
officials explained.</P>
      <P>While many were unhappy with the more circuitous nonstop flights, EVA Airways
spokesman  Nieh Kuo-wei  lent his support to the government.</P>
      <P>"It is unfair to ask the government to open full air links across the strait
overnight in view of national security," he argued.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside concerns from lawmakers over the issue, Minister of National
Defense Chen Chao-min said in a legislative question and answer session last
week that a more direct route for flights between Taiwan and China would not
undermine the country's national security.</P>
      <P>"The national defense ministry has worked out a blueprint for the flight paths
of the nonstop charters under the principle of not compromising national
security and defense, and it has submitted the plan to the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications for reference," Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
06/22/08  20:53:27
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With fuel prices soaring and worries over global warming caused by greenhouse
gas emissions mounting, nuclear energy has regained popularity in many countries
around the world, but Taiwan's economists and environmentalists disagree as
strongly as ever over the role of nuclear power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The island country, which depends on imported energy for most of its power
generation, began to develop nuclear power in the 1970s and now operates three
nuclear power plants, with a fourth under construction.</P>
      <P>The previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, touting the idea of
a "nuclear-free homeland, " reversed the trend toward greater reliance on
nuclear energy when it took power in 2000, and suspended the construction of the
fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>But following a tense political tug-of-war that ended up being decided by
Taiwan's constitutional court, the DPP government was compelled to resume
construction of the project four months later.</P>
      <P>Yet the project, under pressure from environmentalists and cost overruns,
continued to face delays, the DPP government remained unenthusiastic about
further nuclear power expansion.</P>
      <P>That may change under the new cabinet of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, which passed
sustainable policy guidelines in early June that included nuclear power as a
potential "no-carbon-emission" energy source and also urged completion of the
fourth nuclear power plant as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The plant is currently expected to start operations in 2009.</P>
      <P>"After the Kyoto Protocol came into effect (in 2005) , the 'nuclear-free
homeland policy' gradually moved further away from the the global mainstream, "
said Liang Chi-yuan, research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of
Economics.</P>
      <P>Liang said that the fourth nuclear plant, located in Gongliao township on
Taiwan's northeastern coast, should be completed and started up on schedule, and
operations at Taiwan's three existing plants should be prolonged if their safety
can be ensured.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the government consider increasing the nuclear generator
units of the three plants.</P>
      <P>Citing the United Kingdom,  Liang said many countries are adjusting their energy
policies because of the Kyoto Protocal and soaring cost of crude oil and other
fossil fuel energy sources.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the U.K. advocated using high-efficiency electricity generation and
alternative energy in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>But, in 2006, when reviewing the policy, the U.K. expressed its doubts over
whether it could meet its goal on time, since the development of wind and solar
energy had not yet matured.</P>
      <P>Atomic Energy Council Minister Tsai Chuen-horng said Taiwan Power Company should
take action as soon as possible if it wants to prolong the operations of
Taiwan's three nuclear plants, which are scheduled to be shut down between 2018
and 2025.</P>
      <P>But will it be safe to prolong the life of the reactors and generators?</P>
      <P>"We can do better than the United States, " said Tsai, who noted that reactors
are examined every 10 years in Taiwan, while the timeframe for a nuclear power
plant license in the U.S is 40 years.</P>
      <P>Not everyone in Taiwan is so optimistic. Controversy over the issue as never
abated here, as opponents continue to raise concerns over safety issues and the
disposal of radioactive nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Branding the possibility that the government may expand nuclear power generation
to reduce carbon emissions as "ridiculous and ignorant, " Gloria Hsu, president
of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, questioned the ability of nuclear
power plants to resist earthquakes and said disposing of radioactive waste
carried excessive risks.</P>
      <P>"Why do people have to put up with the risks of radioactive waste? Why not put
them in the Office of the President or in the Ministry of Economic Affairs?"
argued Hsu.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company is expected to make public potential sites for low-
radioactivity waste storage in August, including one in Penghu and seven in
Taiwan. Most of Taiwan's spent fuel rods are currently stored on Orchid Island,
also know as Lanyu, an island off the southeastern coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu further suggested that Taiwan can learn from Germany, which has taken the
lead in carbon emission reduction by modifying architectural codes, improving
public transport systems and adjusting the structure of industry.</P>
      <P>"It is an out of date idea to repeat the experiences of the 1970s (if the
government considers developing nuclear power) , " stressed Hsu, adding that
environmentalists will strongly object to the plan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan continues, however, to rely heavily on high-emission coal-burning plants
to generate power, with 43.7 percent of its power coming from coal in 2006,
according to Taipower.</P>
      <P>One of Taiwan's coal-fired plants produces the most carbon dioxide emissions of
any power plant in the world, highlighting the dilemma Taiwan faces in
confronting its energy -- and nuclear power -- future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President suggests raising pay for medical workers in remote regions</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
06/22/08  21:07:11
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou suggested Sunday that the Department of Health (DOH)
provide incentives, such as raising subsidies, to medical workers in remote
regions to provide better and more accessible health care in those areas.</P>
      <P>Ma made the suggestion  at a meeting held in Taitung in southeastern  Taiwan
that was attended  by Deputy Presidential Secretary-General Yeh Ching-chuan,
Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen and local medical workers.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Justin Huang, who represents Taitung County, described the
challenges rural and remote communities face.</P>
      <P>"The main problems in providing health care in remote regions are the lack of
good doctors and facilities, " he said, adding that he hoped the DOH would raise
the pay level for doctors in remote regions and modify unreasonable regulations
found in the national health insurance system.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said that other than Taitung County, many remote areas face the
same plight, noting that patients in Lishan in central Taiwan have to travel to
Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan to seek treatment due to inconvenient
transportation links.</P>
      <P>Ma also suggested that the DOH consider using incentives, such as raising
subsidies, to retain medical workers who want to practice medicine in remote
regions.</P>
      <P>Yeh, himself a public health expert, added that the DOH should re-examine how it
allocates health insurance resources.</P>
      <P>In early May, several hundreds of people living in rural areas in southern
Taiwan traveled to Taipei to ask the DOH for a more equitable distribution  of
resources under the national health insurance system, arguing that local
hospitals received fewer central government subsidies than big hospitals.</P>

      <P>The sewage treatment rate rose to 40.7 percent in April, covering areas in
Taiwan with 2.34 million households,  the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"According to the latest statistics collected by the Ministry of the Interior,
the sewage treatment rate from January to the end of April has risen by 1.2
percent to 40.7 percent, " the statement said, with the coverage expected to
increase to 41 percent in May.</P>
      <P>Sewage treatment, or domestic wastewater treatment, is the process of removing
contaminants from wastewater through sewage processing facilities.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the system covered 2.34 million households in April, with 1.04
million households connected to public underground sewer systems.</P>
      <P>"Sewer systems that treat wastewater exclusively for industrial areas and
communities of more than 100 residents cover another 729,000 households," the
statement added.</P>
      <P>"Following completion of a sewer system, the government will check the facility
regularly to ensure it works normally, " the statistics bureau said.</P>
      <P>From  January  to  April,  the  Environmental  Protection Administration has
found that 17 underground sewer systems in the country failed to meet
established standards.</P>
      <P>"As for systems of industrial  wastewater  treatment,  715 facilities were found
subpar during the same period, " the statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hsinchu mayor keen to find mates for city's women</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
06/22/08  21:16:32
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsinchu City Mayor Lin Jung-tzer urged Taiwan's single males Sunday to migrate
to the city and form families there, citing a number of advantages that the city
enjoys as one of Taiwan's most livable municipalities.</P>
      <P>Lin issued the call as statistics recently compiled by the city's civil affairs
and accounting departments showed that the city had more women than men as of
late last month, the only administrative district in Taiwan where women are in
the majority.</P>
      <P>According to municipal tallies, there were 188 more female than male residents
in Hsinchu City as of the end of May after first surpassing the number of males
in March this year.</P>
      <P>Welcoming single males from the rest of the country to find their life partners
and settle down in Hsinchu City, Lin asserted that the city offers a variety of
incentives to its citizens.</P>
      <P>First, Lin said, the Hsinchu city government provides the country's highest
subsidies for child-bearing women -- NT$15,000 for their first child, NT$20,000
for the second and NT$25,000 for the third.</P>
      <P>NT$50,000 is given to mothers who give birth to twins and NT$100,000 (US$3,300)
to those who deliver triplets, he said.</P>
      <P>In all, Hsinchu City spends more than NT$50 million each year in birth subsidies
to encourage women to have more children -- a policy that he said has helped it
register the highest birth rate in Taiwan for years.</P>
      <P>As Hsinchu City boasts high-quality educational, medical, leisure and living
environments, the city is keen to encourage its residents to rear more children
to fight the trend of an aging population around the country, he explained.</P>
      <P>Lin said free nutritious lunches are also provided at local elementary and
junior high schools as part of his efforts to build good environments in which
local residents can raise their children.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed office six years ago, the mayor said, Hsinchu City's population
has grown by over 26,000 people, and the city's female labor participation rate
is the highest among Taiwan's 25 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City has the highest income level in Taiwan thanks to the establishment
of a science-based industrial park in 1978, which has helped attract large
numbers of well-educated  high technology professionals, and it has steadily
maintained its population growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Professor cancels hunger strike plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A university professor decided Sunday to cancel his plan to hold a hunger strike
in front of the Presidential Office July 1 and called for respect for the
freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Chuang Kuo-jung, an assistant professor in National Chengchi University (NCCU)
's Department of Public Administration,  said Saturday he would launch the
hunger strike after the university decided not to retain him on the grounds that
Chuang made improper remarks and violated the moral obligations of teachers.</P>
      <P>Chuang used foul language  to blast then KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
and his father at an election campaign rally March 16 when he was on leave from
the university to serve as the Ministry of Education's chief secretary.</P>
      <P>His remarks sparked strong criticism, forcing Chuang to quit his post. He later
returned to the university to teach.</P>
      <P>Chuang said Sunday that he will reflect on the improper remarks he made and
apologized for the wrong choice of words that were discriminatory against women.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he called for the respect for his freedom of speech and the
protection of his working rights.</P>
      <P>Chuang contended that NCCU violated procedural justice in making its decision
not to renew his contract. He said that because the decision would likely make
it impossible for him to teach in Taiwan for the rest of his life, he was overly
emotional a day earlier.</P>
      <P>He said he chose the Presidential Office as the place for the planned hunger
strike because his remarks at the time were related to Ma.</P>
      <P>After thinking deeply about the matter, he said he decided to cancel his plan
because the Presidential Office is a highly sensitive place and his plan might
cause an unnecessary disturbance.</P>
      <P>He added that he did not intend to stage the hunger strike to protest against
President Ma and that he also believed that Ma would not order anyone to
interfere with his case.</P>

other hand, who enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to
be right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is well
aware of that."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Conflict erupted in the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense
Committee Monday as several Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators
violently jostled Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou to stop him from leaving
after the meeting was adjourned by Kuomintang (KMT) legislators.</P>
      <P>Ou was scheduled to deliver his first report and take questions in the committee
for the first time since he assumed office May 20. However, the session turned
into a squabble when DPP legislators took over the podium, holding placards
calling for Ou's resignation. Ou, meanwhile, sat quietly and did not respond.</P>
      <P>Twelve DPP lawmakers, including Lai Ching-te, Kuan Bi-ling, and Tsai Huan-
liang, listed seven "charges" against Ou, accusing him of being unqualified for
the post, because he had obtained United States permanent residency status
during his tenure as Taiwan's ambassador to Guatemala, and of poorly handling a
recent incident that involved a collision between a Taiwanese fishing boat and
Japanese patrol vessel in the waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>"The KMT has no reason to be afraid of us questioning Ou, as it dominates the
legislature, holding three quarters of the seats," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, DPP lawmakers asked to speak before Ou delivered his report, a request
rejected by KMT committee chairman Liu Shen-liang, who citied the procedural
rules that permit only committee members to do so. Despite some dickering over
the issue and several time-out periods, the DPP and KMT legislators failed to
resolve the standoff.</P>
      <P>Brawling erupted immediately after Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John Chang
proposed a motion to adjourn the meeting and Liu concurred.</P>
      <P>Ou was surrounded and violently jostled by DPP legislators, who shouted "run
away foreign minister" and "go back to the U.S." KMT legislators and officials
from the foreign ministry also joined in the fray in an attempt to protect Ou.</P>
      <P>After ten minutes of chaos in the legislature, the 68-year-old foreign minister
finally made the way out, leaving behind a group of enraged DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>"It is so obvious that the KMT legislators are protecting the foreign minister,"
said Kuan. "How dare they adjourn the meeting that Ou was attending for the
first time in an entire month."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, at the head of a delegation of Taipei City government
officials, departed for Shanghai Monday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Hau, Taiwan's first elected municipal chief to travel to China amid a thawing of
ties between Taiwan and China since President Ma Ying-jeou's inauguration, is
visiting Shanghai mainly to witness the signing of an agreement to confirm
Taipei's participation in World Expo Shanghai 2010 slated for May 1 to Oct. 31,
2010.</P>
      <P>Hau is scheduled to meet with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng June 26 to jointly
witness the signing of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoon Terry Gou, founder of the Hon Hai Group who has promised
to build a pavilion for Taipei City at the Shanghai expo, will also join Hau and
Han at the signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Gou forged an accord with Hau the day before, under which an education
foundation under the Hon Hai Group will plan, fund, construct and operate the
pavilion. The project has a price tag of NT$300 million (US$9.87 million).</P>
      <P>During his stay in Shanghai, Hau will visit the Shanghai Wild Animals Park,
where he hopes to gain a better understanding of how the Shanghai zoo
authorities take care of rare pandas. Taipei City hopes to host two pandas that
China has promised as a gift to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hau will also visit a project aimed at developing Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport
into a multiple transportation hub, to possibly draw on Shanghai's experience in
airport development for the remodeling of Taipei's Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>Taipei City has been planning to make Songshan Airport the Taiwan counterpart to
Hongqiao Airport when direct cross-strait weekend charter flights are launched
in July.</P>
      <P>Hau will also take time to meet with Taiwan business leaders operating  in the
Greater Shanghai area to encourage them to repatriate some of their overseas
investment and to locate their R &amp; D centers and business headquarters in
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Members of Hau's entourage included Lee Yung-ping, director of the Cultural

    <TEXT>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang called on
investors Monday to have more faith in the local bourse, despite an estimated
average loss of NT$440,000 by each stock market investor in the month since the
Kuomintang (KMT) government took office.</P>
      <P>One month after the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, the weighted index,
Taiwan stock market's key barometer, on June 20 recorded a drop of 1,166 points,
from 9,068 to 7,902 points. The stock market value slid by NT$2.94 trillion, or
12 percent, from NT$23.3 trillion to NT$20.86 trillion during the same period.</P>
      <P>The share prices was trading as high as 9309 points when the market opened on
May 20, but have lost steam since.</P>
      <P>Monday's market opened at 7767.59 points, recording a drop pf another 134.85
points. The index fell 25.95 at the close Monday, continuing to slide for the
19th straight trading day since May 28.</P>
      <P>"This slide is due largely to the weak performance of global stock markets,
which have a huge impact on the Taiwan (market) and those elsewhere in Asia,"
Chang said at a legislative hearing Monday.</P>
      <P>She was referring mainly to the drop in U.S. share prices, as the Dow Jones
industrial average last Friday fell to a three-month low of 11842.69 points
after losing 220.40 on worries over rising crude oil prices and the continued
negative effects of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.</P>
      <P>Calling on investors to have confidence in the local bourse, Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung said Sunday that at present Taiwan's stock market is suitable for
long-term investment,  as many foreign investors are positive about Taiwan's
economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiu's call, Chang said that local stock market investors should have
more faith, as the foundation of Taiwan's economy remains healthy and sound.
"The anticipated improvement in cross-strait economic ties should add a more
positive factor to the prospects," she said.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan's economy is not suffering under the credit crunch as much as
many thought it would, as local banks and financial holding companies did not
lose as much as banks in the U.S. and Europe.</P>
      <P>Urging calm among investors, some of whom have obviously been dumping their
shares over the past month, Chang said they should keep in perspective the
overall economic situation in Taiwan, rather than sell or buy on the strength of
rumors.</P>
      <P>"This is not a proper way to manage stock market investment," she added.</P>
      <P>Asked if the FSC will ask the Cabinet to intervene with measures such as opening
the National Financial Stabilization Fund, Chang said the FSC and Cabinet might
evaluate such an option, if necessary.</P>
      <P>"However, right now the FSC will respect the market mechanism and stay out of
the way," she said.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has formed an inter-ministerial task force to deal with
matters concerning the arrival of more Chinese tourists in Taiwan from next
month, an official of the executive branch of the government said Monday.</P>
      <P>The task force was formed Sunday during an inter-ministerial meeting presided
over by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  to discuss complementary measures to Taiwan's
opening to more Chinese tourists and its easing of regulations to promote
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng was appointed as the convener of the
task force, which immediately began operations, the official said, adding that
Chu will be required to report regularly to the premier.</P>
      <P>Premier  Liu said that when he was president  of Soochow University, he invited
many university presidents from China to visit Taiwan. He related that most of
them told him that their deepest and most indelible impression of Taiwan was the
friendliness and good manners of its people.</P>
      <P>Stressing  that people play an important role in boosting cross-strait tourism
exchanges, Liu called on custom officials and quarantine personnel to show the
cordiality for which Taiwanese are known, when the Chinese tourists arrive at
the country's various airports. He also urged ordinary citizens to extend the
trademark Taiwanese hospitality and kindness to the Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Liu ordered the Tourism Bureau to set up a reasonable price system for products
on sale at various scenic spots and to post the list online for reference to
prevent peddlers and shop operators at tourism sites from illegally jacking up
product prices. He also urged consumer protection authorities to crackdown more
heavily on illegal pricing practices to prevent bilking of tourists and to
protect Taiwan's image.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu asked the Ministry of Finance to confirm that currency exchange
services will be ready on time at the eight airports in Taiwan that will serve
as gateways for weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourists are expected to visit Taiwan in greater numbers starting July
18, as representatives of Taiwan and China officially sealed agreements June 13
in Beijing for the launch of weekend direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights
from July 4 and to allow more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan will be capped at 3,000 per day in the
initial stages.</P>

06/23/08  15:57:17

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new round of relaxed financial policies are expected to be announced within
one or two weeks at the earliest to spur growth in the domestic economy, a
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The FSC does not exclude the possibility of announcing new, liberalized
financial measures, including opening reciprocal stock market listings of
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) between Taiwan and Hong Kong, in one or two weeks
if the FSC arrives at agreements with other relevant government agencies, said
FSC Vice Chairwoman Susan Chang during a report at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Other stimulus policies are expected to include the cancellation of a regulation
that requires in-bound funds that are set to be channeled into the Taiwan bourse
to contain no funds from China and the lifting of a ceiling on Taiwan funds
investing in stock markets in China, Hong Kong and Macau, Chang said.</P>
      <P>FSC officials are expected to talk with their counterparts from the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) and the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) on the possibility of allowing Taiwan stocks and securities firms to
invest indirectly in their Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>"The relaxed policies are expected to be announced as soon as the FSC reaches
agreements with the MAC and CEPD on the plans, " Chang reiterated.</P>
      <P>The FSC announced a previous round of liberalized financial policies in mid-
March when the then-Democratic Progressive Party administration agreed to allow
overseas subsidiaries of Taiwanese banks to invest in lenders in China in an
effort "to boost the global competitiveness of Taiwan's financial sector and
strengthen the financial services it offers to China-based Taiwanese
businessmen."</P>
      <P>Some critics believe those liberalized policies -- announced only days ahead of
the March 22 presidential election -- were merely a political gambit targeting
the hundreds of thousands of businessmen and their families living in China who
were expected to return to Taiwan to vote in the election.</P>
      <P>By comparison, the new round of relaxed financial policies laid out by Chang
were made in response to an outcry over the falling TAIEX, which has shed more
than 1,100 points, or 12 percent in value, over the past one month since the May
20 inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>

      <P>The price of kitchen leftovers, which hog farms in Taiwan use to feed their
stock, has risen to a point where some farmers in Taiwan are "stealing" slops,
an official at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) disclosed Monday.</P>
      <P>As food prices skyrocketing in the international market due to poor harvests
caused by bad weather, the price of kitchen scraps in Taiwan is now NT$1,000
(US$33) per ton compared to NT$300-NT$600 per ton in 2007, Lin Mao-yuan of the
EPA's Environmental Police Unit said.</P>
      <P>In some cities and counties, the price could go up to NT$2,000 or more, he
added.</P>
      <P>Currently the EPA collects about 1,900 tons of leftovers per day, and in 2007
the total volume collected was some 663,000 tons which was used as hog feed.
Kitchen scraps generated a production value of NT$1.8 billion last year,
according to the administration.</P>
      <P>With the price of leftover food now rising, thefts have been reported in the
central Taiwan county of Taichung and northern county of Hsinchu, where pig
farmers have been observed "cleaning up" slops collected by EPA personnel for
shipment to recycling companies, Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several lawmakers urged the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the Department of
Health (DOH) Monday to step up inspections on the local market to crack down on
mushrooms smuggled from China.</P>
      <P>The legislators, including Hsu Chung-hsiung and Lin Tsang-min of the ruling
Kuomintang and Chang Hua-kuan of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
made the call at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee
held to discuss measures to curb smuggling and help local mushroom growers.</P>
      <P>Chinese mushroom imports are banned in Taiwan, but smuggling has become rampant
in recent years due to the steep difference in prices between mushrooms grown in
China and those grown in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Coast Guard Administration (CGA) tallies, 20,103 kg of smuggled
Chinese mushrooms were seized in 2005, a figure that rose to 45,358 kg in 2006.
A total of 16,556 kg have been seized to date this year, but the figures are
believed to represent only a fraction of the total amount that ends up on the
Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Hsu claimed at the meeting that smuggled Chinese mushrooms have seriously harmed
the interests of growers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting  that  Chinese  mushrooms  cost  about  NT$200-300 (US$6.60-9.90) per
kilogram, compared to NT$600-800 for locally grown mushrooms, Hsu said Taiwanese
growers suffered a 60-percent drop in sales during the recent Dragon Boat
Festival holiday due to the availability of smuggled Chinese mushrooms.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chinese mushrooms contain excessive levels of pesticide residue,
Hsu and his colleagues urged the government to crack down on the smuggling to
ensure consumer safety, as well as local growers' livelihoods.</P>
      <P>In response, COA Deputy Minister Huang You-tsai said the main responsibility for
preventing smuggling lies with customs officials and the CGA.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, the COA, the customs
office, the CGA and local police have formed a task force to crack down on
smuggling of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The task force conducts regular spot inspections at local markets to check for
smuggled goods, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu Ai-kuo, deputy head of the Finance Ministry's Directorate General
of Customs, said that the United States has lent Taiwan three advanced X-ray
machines under its Container Security Initiative program, which are now used at
points of entry in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>He added that the Directorate General of Customs has allocated funds for the
purchase of an additional five X-ray machines to assist in the fight against
smuggling.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the task force to increase the frequency of its spot checks to more
than four times a month at retail outlets, food processing plants and storage
sites.</P>
      <P>Only in this way will consumer safety and the interests of local mushroom
farmers be protected, he said.</P>

      <P>Addressing the issue during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Health,
Environment and Labor Committee, Lin said that according to pathological trends
over the past 10 years, enterovirus infections usually begin to decline at the
start of the summer vacation and that if fewer new cases are reported this week
than last, it will mean the outbreak is moderating.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said this does not mean the outbreak is over, pointing out that it
usually takes four to six weeks before the number of new infections will drop to
a significantly lower level.</P>
      <P>He urged the public not to relax their guard on enterovirus just because the
peak is about to pass.</P>
      <P>With pathologists  having predicted that severe enterovirus infections are
likely to total more than 400 cases this year, Lin said the Department of Health
will step up preventive measures to try to keep the number below 300.</P>
      <P>From the start of this year until the end of last week, 232 severe enterovirus
infections were recorded nationwide, eight of which were fatal.</P>
      <P>Infections have been reported in 21 counties and cities around the country, with
only Kinmen, Matsu, Keelung City and Chiayi City spared.</P>
      <P>Data from the Centers for Disease Control shows that almost all serious
enterovirus  cases recorded  this year were caused by enterovirus type 71 (EV71)
-- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- and all those infected were aged under
5, with the exception of one 14-year-old resident of Hsinchu City.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a serious EV71 outbreak this year, the CDC recently issued a
directive stipulating that kindergartens, daycare centers and elementary schools
must suspend classes for 10 days whenever two or more enterovirus infections are
reported in the same class within one week.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in infants.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of EV71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Another EV71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 children infected, 15 of whom died.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng defended his idea Monday of drafting a
bill to allow lawmakers to take part in cross-Taiwan Strait talks, brushing
aside concerns that this might infringe upon the power of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"It is perfectly justified and in line with legal requirements if the
Legislative Yuan sends lawmakers to participate in cross-strait negotiations and
monitor relevant policy-making and practices, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to his idea of submitting a draft bill aimed at permitting
legislators to take part in the signing of agreements between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>After Wang recently revealed his idea of supporting legislation that would
enable  lawmakers  to play a role in cross-strait negotiations, some legislators
of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) voiced concerns that doing so would interfere
with the power of the executive branch.</P>
      <P>"It is natural that the legislature checks and balances the Cabinet's polices
and practices as the law requires -- something that is irrelevant to breaching
the executive branch's power, " he argued, adding that the bill's content must
be jointly decided by all lawmakers.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, some legislators also made similar efforts with government
officials in seeking means to help push for Taiwan's membership in the World
Health Assembly and the World Health Organization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng said Monday that whether or not a clean
politics can take root in a country depends on the example set by the national
leader.</P>
      <P>Wang cited Jon S.T. Quah, a former professor of National University of Singapore
and an expert in corruption research, as saying that Singapore has been
successful in promoting clean politics, mainly because its leaders themselves
have been models of integrity.</P>
      <P>"The new government has a responsibility to establish an integrity code of
conduct, and to request that all civil servants abide by that code," she said,
adding that "the code to govern exchanges between government officials and
businesses should also be rebuilt."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks at a scheduled monthly meeting on the subject of ethics
held at the Presidential Office and presided over by President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Judicial Yuan
President Lai Ying-jaw and Kuomintang Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung were also at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that "the trust of the people is the most important asset of the
government," Wang said "corruption is its most potent corrosive."</P>
      <P>She pointed out that in the last eight years the public lost trust and
confidence in the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government,
especially in the latter part of the DPP's second term when the administration
was plagued by a series of corruption scandals or allegations..</P>
      <P>Wang said that in a Transparency International corruption survey, Taiwan's
ranking fluctuated between the 27th and 35th over the period 2000 to 2007.</P>
      <P>In a corruption survey by the Hong Kong-based Political &amp; Economic Risk
Consultancy in March 2008, Taiwan's ranking as the least corrupt Asian country
slipped to seventh in Asia, from fifth in 2007. Taiwan ranked behind Singapore,
Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea and Malaysia this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said that up to 60 percent of local people said in a survey conducted by
the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission in late May they were
confident the new administration would build a model of clean politics.</P>
      <P>"The government must not let the public down," she said.</P>
      <P>She noted that earlier this month the Cabinet approved the establishment of a
committee to fight corruption, and that an ethics code for civil servants will
be implemented August 1.</P>
      <P>The introduction of more sunshine bills and the revision of outdated bills will
also help to combat corruption, she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of the approaching summer vacation -- a time when children tend to
spend much more time on the Internet -- several non-government organizations
launched a "Children Internet Safety Campaign" Monday in which parents are urged
to pay more attention to their children's safety in the cyber world.</P>
      <P>At a news conference to announce the launch, organizations such as the Taiwan
Internet Content Rating Promotion Foundation (TICRF) , the End Child
Prostitution Association Taiwan (ECPAT) , the Child Welfare League Foundation,
the Paper Windmill Foundation  and Microsoft Taiwan, also called on children and
teenagers to comply with five simple safety measures  to protect themselves
when corresponding on the Internet.</P>
      <P>These measures are: do not give your name; do not give out your telephone
number; do not post your photograph; do not divulge any passwords you might
have; and do not meet cyber friends without your parents' consent.</P>
      <P>"It takes efforts on the part of both parents and children to build a safe and
healthy Internet environment, " said TICRF Executive Director Beryl Chu. "They
should be aware of the dangers of the Internet in order to protect themselves,"
she added.</P>
      <P>ECPAT Executive Director Lee Li-feng said Internet safety is an issue that every
family should pay attention to.</P>
      <P>"The concept of Internet safety should be taught from a young age, just as
traffic safety is taught, " she said. According to a recent survey conducted by
the ECPAT, 578 sexual assault cases were recorded in 2007, or 1.5 cases per day,
compared to 444 cases in 2006.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 63 percent of the victims were aged between 12
and 18, indicating that people in this age group are most vulnerable to such
crimes and that urgent action needs to be taken to protect them.</P>
      <P>Alicia Wang, executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation, also
noted that as of the end of March this year, there have been 106 runaway cases,
84 percent of which involve young girls.</P>
      <P>"Apart from helping parents find their runaway children, we would like to take
precautions and educate the general public about the problem so that we can
prevent such occurrences," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Huang Yun-ling, a renowned songwriter and mother of a 13-year-old son, said at
the news conference that the Internet can be an amazing resource of knowledge
and provides hours of fun for children, but there are also a lot of traps such
as sexual infringement and violation of privacy rights.</P>
      <P>"Every parent has the obligation to know how to help their children surf the
Internet safely," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that parents can download free parental control software for Internet
filtering from the TICRF at www.ticrf.org.tw, Chu said the foundation will also
organize a series of campaign events to promote Internet safety for children.</P>

      <P>The China Times newspaper is in good shape and the Taipei city government will
not approve the local daily's massive layoff plan if it violates any law in the
process, the city's top labor official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Labor sent four officials to conduct a labor inspection
of the newspaper June 18 soon after the daily unexpectedly announced a plan to
lay off some 600 employees and found that it was in good shape, department head
Su Ying-kuei told more than 10 leaders of the paper's union during a meeting
that day.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-yung, executive director of the union, said the company recruited a
large number of print workers and reporters in mid-May and issued them with
forms on which they were to provide English names for their new business cards,
which made them believe the company was in good shape, Shih said.</P>
      <P>However, it turned out to be a company tactic to put its employees off-guard
before launching the massive layoff plan without warning, Shih claimed.</P>
      <P>Shih also claimed that on a recent occasion, he "overheard" that the Fubon
Group, a major financial group, planned to acquire the nearly 60-year-old
newspaper.</P>
      <P>However, the two sides failed to reach a deal because of disagreement over the
acquisition price, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih said the labor department should investigate whether the layoffs were part
of the plan to sell the newspaper to the Fubon Group.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen Wen-hsien, a union director, complained that the
newspaper company's management did not negotiate with the workers' union.</P>
      <P>"Every time the management representatives come to the union, they only announce
bad news and never negotiate with us, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The China Times Group has cut the number of its employees from 4,000 to 1,200 in
recent years and now wants to halve the number of remaining workers, according
to Chen.</P>
      <P>He urged that the labor department look into the management's responsibility and
said it should consider the possibility of refusing to work with the China Times
on any project or to stop subscribing to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The newspaper has suffered estimated losses of nearly NT$6 billion (US$197
million) over the past eight years due to a huge decrease in advertising income
and soaring paper costs, according to recent media reports.</P>

      <P>A campaign launched by the eastern county of Hualien to help betel nut addicts
kick the habit has succeeded in guiding 145 people to quit, out of a total of
276 people who took part in the program, the county's health bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May this year, 145 addicts had totally given up betel nuts
since the health bureau launched the drive in July last year,  bureau officials
said,  noting that this represents  a consumption reduction of 1.3 million nuts.</P>
      <P>If each betel nut is worth NT$5, each person who quit under the program could
save about NT$70,000 (US$2,302.55) per year, they calculated.</P>
      <P>Currently, the remaining 131 betel nut chewers in the program consume an average
of 4.61 nuts per day, a big drop from the  41.08 nuts in the past, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>According to an analysis conducted by the bureau from 2003-2006, 35,823 county
residents chewed the addictive nuts, with their daily consumption averaging 16.8
nuts. The county's annual consumption of betel nuts is estimated at 216.92
million nuts.</P>
      <P>To help local residents effectively quit chewing betel nuts and thus prevent
oral cancer, the health bureau launched the campaign in July 2007, the bureau

      <P>Members of a group of Chinese travel agency representatives assessing Taiwan's
tourist attractions said Monday they were taken with the beauty of the Sun Moon
Lake area in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 39-member group, comprised of travel service professionals from 33 travel
agencies throughout China, arrived at Sun Moon Lake at dusk Sunday to check out
the scenic area that was listed among the top three Taiwan  tourist  attractions
for potential  Chinese sightseers.</P>
      <P>The group had dinner at a restaurant on the banks of Sun Moon Lake and then
strolled around the lake at night.</P>
      <P>Early Monday morning, the Chinese travel service professionals boarded a cabin
cruiser to see Sun Moon Lake in the morning mist.</P>
      <P>"Sun Moon Lake is stunningly gorgeous, just as it is in the pictures in the
tourism promotion literature, " said Jia Ling, a vice president of the Beijing-
based CITIC Travel Co.</P>
      <P>"This tour is well worth my while as I've seen Sun Moon Lake at dusk and early
in the morning -- the two times of day when the lake is at its most beautiful,"
Jia said.</P>
      <P>Another visitor, who preferred not to be named, said Sun Moon Lake has a misty
beauty in the early morning, with the different shades of colors from the
surrounding mountains reflected in its mirror-like surface.</P>
      <P>"At night, the lake is so peaceful and serene that you find another kind of
charm," he said, adding that "Sun Moon Lake is true to its name."</P>
      <P>The group of Chinese travel service professionals arrived in Taiwan June 16 on
an 11-day tour to check out Taiwan's tourism resources, facilities, tour
packages and popular travel routes.</P>
      <P>The group was the first travel delegation to visit Taiwan since the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait signed agreements in Beijing June 13 on the launch of direct
cross-strait charter flights on weekends and the expansion of Chinese tourist
arrivals beginning in July.</P>
      <P>According to the agreements, Taiwanese and Chinese carriers will jointly operate
36 charter flights from Friday through Monday every week beginning July 4, and
up to 3,000 ordinary Chinese citizens will initially be allowed to visit Taiwan
per day for sightseeing from July 18.</P>
      <P>Prior to the agreement, nonstop cross-strait charters were only operated on

    <HEADLINE>MOI pledges to prevent domestic violence amid rising case numbers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Interior (MOI) celebrated Monday the 10th anniversary of the
enactment of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act (DCPA) , with both the
interior and justice ministers pledging to further safeguard women's rights amid
increasing cases of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The DCPA came into force June 24, 1998 with the aim of preventing an increase in
the number of cases of domestic violence and helping victims recover from their
physical and mental wounds.</P>
      <P>Although the DCPA has been enacted for a decade, MOI statistics show that an
average of 202 cases of domestic violence were reported per day in 2007, a 9
percent increase from the 2006 figure.</P>
      <P>Attributing the rising number of reported cases to higher public awareness that
encourages more victims to come forward and seek professional assistance,
Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi urged the public to continue efforts to prevent
domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Commending the DCPA as a model for other Asian countries, Liao expressed hope
that the DCPA can be more effective in promoting women's rights, adding that "we
have to create a more harmonious environment for women."</P>
      <P>Noting that domestic violence prevention should be carried out by the government
and the people, Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng said her ministry "will do its
utmost within the shortest time to carry out work to prevent domestic violence."</P>
      <P>Chou Chin-yu, a member of the Commission on Women's Rights Promotion under the
Executive Yuan, expressed hope that government agencies, including the MOI and
the Ministry of Justice, as well as medical and the education organizations,
should work together to counter domestic violence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a victim of domestic violence urged other victims to come forward,
adding that "we are all waiting for you."</P>

      <P>Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong proposed Monday that Taiwan's highest
academic institute be given the right to confer academic degrees, an idea that
was immediately blasted and rejected by lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT).</P>
      <P>Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu denounced the proposal as an act of "robbing and
kidnapping, " as Academic Sinica would be competing with all the country's
universities for enrollments.</P>
      <P>The institute, which is under the management of the Presidential Office rather
than the Ministry of Education, gets a much higher annual budget for research
work than any university or college and it would be unfair to allow the
institute to confer doctoral or master's degrees, Hung argued.</P>
      <P>She asked how the Academia Sinica would differ from existing universities in
Taiwan if it were allowed to confer academic degrees. At present, no scholars at
Academic Sinica are employed to serve as professors or assistant professors,
neither is the institute obliged to give regular lectures, Hung said.</P>
      <P>Wong made the proposal during a briefing on Academia Sinica operations he
delivered to the Legislature Yuan. He called for the Degree Authorization Act to
be revised to allow Academia Sinica to confer degrees on students who conduct
research at the institute.</P>
      <P>Wong said the institute has often failed to recruit talented foreign students
for its research projects due to visa problems, explaining that such students
cannot apply for a student visa because they are not considered by the
government to be students.</P>
      <P>Academia  Sinica maintains  partnerships  with all Taiwan's universities as part
of a joint goal of cultivating talent in various academic fields, Wong told the
lawmakers, declaring that competition does not exist between them.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) invited applications
Monday for the Mansion House Scholarship, which is open to Taiwanese students
and young business executives in the financial services sector, according to a
BTCO press release.</P>
      <P>The Mansion House Scholarship Scheme targets overseas students wishing to take
masters-level degree courses at British universities, as well as young business
executives or officials wishing to undertake training or work experience in the
financial services sector or in related business activities.</P>
      <P>Applications  for the scholarship will close Aug.  15 and applicants might be
required to attend an interview at the BTCO, the press release said.</P>
      <P>It  added  that  the  application  form  is available  at www.btco.org.tw, while
details of the scheme can be found at www.mansionhousescholars.org.uk.</P>
      <P>"The scheme provides an excellent opportunity to gain a better insight  into
British  business  life and underlying  cultural perceptions," according to the
press release.</P>
      <P>The scheme was established by Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols in 1997
to help build links between London -- the world's leading financial center --
and other financial centers, as he was struck during his overseas visits by the
high regard in which London is held by foreign business communities and by the
number of students who wish to study in the United Kingdom, the press release
said.</P>
      <P>Since then, it has awarded 66 scholarships to recipients from 37 countries,
including one from Taiwan. The scheme is funded primarily through donations by
business and trade groups in the City of London and awards vary in size from
5,000 pounds (US$9,822) to 7,500 pounds.</P>
      <P>"The scheme is really effective in building expertise in emerging markets," said
Chou Ming-kao, a recipient of the scholarship in 2005, who added that he was
glad to study cutting-edge risk control technologies in London and was greatly
impressed by the precision and order banks there use when managing their daily
operations and risk.</P>
      <P>Mansion House Scholarships are offered in countries the Lord Mayor visits.
Incumbent Lord Mayor of the City of London David Lewis is scheduled to visit
Taiwan this October and will award the scholarship to the successful applicant
in person. The selection of the successful applicant will be made by the lord
mayor's office on the advice of the BTCO.</P>

      <P>A five-day camp recently organized by the Buddist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 15.68 tons, the camp's
spokeswoman said Monday, and she urged the public to continue the camp's efforts
to protect the earth.</P>
      <P>The foundation, known for its global humanitarian and charitable programs, has
also made it a priority to protect the environment and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions for more than 20 years, based on the teachings of Dharma Master Cheng
Yen, who founded the organization in 1966.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Yi-chun, the spokeswoman of the camps held in Taipei County's
Sanchong and Banciao from June 19-23, 825 overseas members of Tzu Chi
participated  in the event to earn their qualifications as foundation
commissioners.</P>
      <P>To reduce emissions, the participants were required by the foundation to consume
only vegetarian food, to use non-disposable utensils, and to reuse water, not
only in the camps but also in the future, Chen said at a press conference held
at the foundation's Sanchong chapter.</P>
      <P>The camps also avoided using paper to save trees, Chen said.</P>
      <P>All of the measures used were based on criteria for reducing carbon dioxide
emissions outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), the
spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>Noting that 5-Rs -- reduce, reject, reuse, recycle and repair -- are keys to
reducing emissions, Soh Beng-teck, a member of the foundation's Kuala Lumpur
branch in Malaysia, hoped the public could live by the concepts to save more
resources in daily life.</P>
      <P>Soh said the amount of waste on his golf course in Malaysia has been greatly
reduced since he began encouraging recycling two and a half years ago.</P>
      <P>"Recycling indeed creates a win-win situation for both my business and the
environment," Soh told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Thn Peng Hong, from Malacca in Malaysia, said at the news conference that he
once took showers as often as 10 times a day. Now, however, he has not only
reduced the number of showers he takes but has also learned how to reuse water.</P>
      <P>Expressing his hope that everyone can protect the environment together, Thn
further stressed that "our earth will have a better future only when everybody
follows environmentally friendly concepts."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three civic groups have issued a joint statement urging Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) Director Yeh Cherng-maw to apologize over a recent
case in which a defense attorney was allegedly beaten by a bureau official.</P>
      <P>According to a recent news report in the Taipei-based Liberty Times, Lou Jen-
chien, an official at the bureau's outpost in Taipei City, allegedly beat and
dragged defense attorney Tseng Wen-chi out of the office May 22. At the time,
Tseng was yelling outrageously because he had not been permitted to see a
deposition given by one of his clients, and his behavior disrupted work and
order at the department, Lou claimed.</P>
      <P>The bureau officials  contended  that Lou's action was in accordance with
Investigation Bureau rules, based on the Criminal Procedure Law, to ask defense
attorneys to exercise caution when on duty and to maintain office order.</P>
      <P>But in a written statement Sunday, the civic groups -- the Judicial Reform
Foundation, the Taiwan Bar Association and the Taipei Bar Association -- pointed
out that under the Criminal Procedure Law, a defense attorney has the right to
ask to see his client's deposition to make sure it was accurately recorded.</P>
      <P>Members of the three civic groups argued that the bureau cannot irresponsibly
cite rules about maintaining order at its investigation outposts to prohibit
defense attorneys from carrying out their duties to ensure their clients'
rights.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the investigation bureau's regulation in question is "barbaric, "
the groups accused the bureau of disregarding human rights and lacking a sense
of rule by law. "This was a case of distortion of the Criminal Procedure Law" in
an attempt to ensure the investigation bureau's operations, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has no intention to concurrently serve as the chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma insists on the separation of the government and the party and "has never
thought about serving concurrently as the chairman of the Kuomintang," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>The presidential spokesman said Ma is wondering why the media has even brought
up the subject at this time.</P>
      <P>Incumbent  KMT Chairman  Wu Poh-hsiung  has made important contributions to the
party, including leading it to two major election victories -- Jan. 12
legislative elections and the March 22 presidential election -- and Ma has great
respect for him, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language United Daily News reported Monday that some grassroot KMT
members believe the new administration's barely passable performance in its
first month in office is because the KMT has not worked in tune with the
government.</P>
      <P>Some KMT congress delegates have worked privately to try to revise the party
charter to ask Ma to return to the chairmanship, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Ma assumed the KMT chairmanship July 2005 before stepping down in February 2007
after being indicted on charges of misusing his discretionary allowance during
his two terms as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006. Ma has since been found not
guilty of the charges.</P>
      <P>According to the United Evening News, Ma has set his eyes on Taoyuan County
Magistrate Chu Li-lun to be Wu's successor.</P>
      <P>Chu, who comes from an influential political family, has a fresh image, a
creditable performance in the northern Taiwan county and has worked closely with
Ma in the past.</P>
      <P>His term as a magistrate will expire at the end of 2009 and the next KMT
chairman election is scheduled for July 2009.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang also said that President Ma hopes to meet Tsai Ing-wen,
chairwoman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, to exchange views
with her on national affairs.</P>
      <P>The matter is being arranged by Chan Chuen-po, secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that both Ma and Tsai have both taught at National Chengchi
University in the past, and Ma is looking forward to a meeting.</P>
      <P>Ma believed that the ruling and opposition parties should develop a "normal
partnership relation, " and that with Tsai serving as the DPP head, it is more
likely to develop such a relationship, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that President Ma is looking forward to positive
exchanges with the DPP, and will invite Tsai and the DPP legislators again, who
have rejected a previous invitation, for a meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP to promote massive tax rebate scheme</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will push for a tax rebate
scheme to help low income earners and disadvantaged people cope with rising
consumer prices, a DPP spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent poll conducted by the DPP, 53.4 percent of
the respondents supported the idea of tax rebate, while 40.4 percent backed the
government's domestic demand expansion plan, according to DPP spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsan.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) government plans to allocate NT$58 billion (US$1.9 billion)
to finance local government infrastructure projects in an effort to increase
domestic demand.</P>
      <P>However,  Cheng criticized  the plan as a move aimed  at consolidating local
support for the ruling party.</P>
      <P>The government should instead give tax rebates to the public to prop up consumer
spending, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Also, tax rebates will reduce the financial burden on many wage earners because
they have not received pay raises but need to spend more on expenses amid high
consumer prices, Cheng contended.</P>
      <P>Many countries and places -- such as South Korea, Singapore, the United States,
Macau and Hong Kong -- have announced tax rebate plans to cope with soaring
consumer prices and stimulate the economy, Cheng went on.</P>
      <P>Describing the government's domestic demand expansion plan as not the best
solution, Cheng argued that the plan will not substantially help the economy and
could actually bring about another wave of inflation.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus will also propose a subsidy scheme for disadvantaged
people who do not pay tax, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus will submit proposals to amend relevant laws before the
legislature goes into recess July 18, he added.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after the DPP held a meeting on major issues earlier in
the day.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen instructed party officials to study
the possible impact resulting from the opening of direct weekend charter flights
between Taiwan and China and the opening of Taiwan to more Chinese tourists
after July 4, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Chinese tourists might bring many animal, plant or human
viruses to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the government does not have an effective quarantine control, foot-and-mouth
disease might reoccur in Taiwan and hit Taiwan's pork industry hard, he
speculated.</P>
      <P>The DPP will also analyze whether the new opening policies will really boost
consumption in Taiwan or whether they will pose a threat to Taiwan's national
security, Cheng said.</P>

      <P>Chinese tourists will be entitled to claim refunds for pricey items bought in
Taiwan with which they are not satisfied, Vice Minister of Transportation and
Communications Ho Nuan-hsiuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The tourists would have to claim the refund within one month of purchasing the
item they want to return.</P>
      <P>The measure is aimed at protecting the rights of Chinese shoppers and encourage
them to visit Taiwan more than once, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ho made the comments after inspecting four upscale shops in Kaohsiung City as
part of government efforts to prevent dishonest retail practices prior to an
expected influx of Chinese tourists beginning July 18.</P>
      <P>Ho made the surprise inspection accompanied by officials from the Tourism
Bureau  under  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and Communications and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs who are part of an auditing task force headed by
Ho.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, business practices at the four retail outlets -- a jewelry
store, art gallery, diamond shop and shopping mall -- often frequented by
Chinese tourists when in Kaohsiung City, are sound in principle despite some
small flaws such as unclear labeling.</P>
      <P>The four shops, all certified by the Travel Quality Assurance Association of the
ROC, promised to improve their service quality immediately, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Shops found by the task force to be violating government regulations will be
punished on the spot and will be required to make an improvement by a specific
deadline," Ho asserted.</P>
      <P>The central  government  task force has conducted  similar inspections  in
restaurants,  shops  and other  tourism-related facilities in popular tourist
destinations across the country, such as Alishan in Chiayi County and Sun Moon
Lake in Nantou County, and in major cities, including Taipei, Taichung and
Kaohsiung, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The task force launched its first inspection early this month in the Alishan
area -- a mountain resort in southern Taiwan and a must-see for Chinese tourists
coming to Taiwan -- to make sure that local hotels and inns, food quality and
service, traffic safety, and souvenir shops met government guidelines.</P>
      <P>Up to 3,000 Chinese tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan per day beginning
July 18, following an agreement signed between Taipei and Beijing on June 13
that paved the way for residents of China to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under previous regulations, 1,000 Chinese tourists were allowed to enter Taiwan
per day, but they were subject to strict eligibility requirements and the quota
was rarely met.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate in May fell by 0.03 percentage point year on year to
3.84 percent, compared with that of the same month last year, marking the lowest
rate for May since 2001, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Compared with the same month last year, 150,000 more people were employed,
representing 1.49 percent growth, " said Huang Jiann-jong, deputy director of
the Bureau of Census under the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>Presenting the bureau's latest overview of Taiwan's employment situation at a
news conference Monday, Huang said the 3.84 percent jobless rate in May was a
sign of an expanding labor market.</P>
      <P>"The total number of employed people in Taiwan in May reached 10.41 million,
rising by 18,000, or 0.17 percent, compared to April, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployed also rose in May to 416,000, 4,000 more than in April,
the report showed, but Huang said most of it was "frictional unemployment" that
is present in any economy resulting from temporary transitions by people in the
job market.</P>
      <P>"Among the unemployed, 11,000 were either first-time job seekers or people who
left their positions voluntarily, " he said.</P>
      <P>The deputy director said that with many companies opening new positions to
college graduates this summer, "some workers might be tempted to leave their
current positions in search of better ones."</P>
      <P>Touching on the country's overall economic outlook, Huang said the labor market
remains healthy and structurally unchanged, despite the rising number of people
with college and higher education degrees who are unemployed, a group that has
jumped in number from 89,000 in 1997 to 282,000 in 2007.</P>
      <P>Huang said, however, that the trend had little effect on the economy  because
most of the jobless with strong educational backgrounds were either voluntarily
unemployed or without jobs for only short periods of time.</P>
      <P>The official also said that from January to May, the number of employed people
with college or post-graduate degrees rose by 233,000 to 2.32 million year-on-
year.</P>
      <P>"This means the quality of worker in the domestic labor market is getting
better," he said.</P>

      <P>Nearly two-thirds of the public is pleased with how the Cabinet has handled the
U.S. green card issue, according to the results of a government telephone poll
released Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet previously announced that its politically appointed officials should
not have permanent residency status in a foreign country; if they did, they
would forced to step down.</P>
      <P>The announcement was part of the Cabinet's response to the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) questioning of the loyalty of several Cabinet
officials for holding or previously possessing U.S. green cards.</P>
      <P>Some 65 percent of those surveyed approved of the Cabinet's handling of the
controversy, while 56 percent of those surveyed believed that the government
should amend laws to bar anyone with permanent residency in a foreign country
from serving as a ministry head, elected representative, county or city chief,
or ambassador or overseas representative, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>The poll also indicated that nearly 49 percent of respondents were pleased with
how the Cabinet helped local farmers cope with soaring fertilizer prices.</P>
      <P>The government announced that state-controlled Taiwan Fertilizer Co. would

      <P>A two-engine Astra aircraft took off from a Taichung airport Monday as part of a
typhoon monitoring project called DOTSTAR to get a close look at tropical storm
Fengshen, which is approaching Taiwan after leaving hundreds of people dead or
missing in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The airplane, outfitted by Taiwan aviation manufacturer Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp., released 12 storm data collectors called dropsondes while
flying in a counterclockwise direction along the outer rim of storm's radius of
maximum wind.</P>
      <P>Eight of the global positioning system (GPS) dropsondes dropped at the
200-kilometer radius while the other four parachuted down at a point around 400
km northeast of the center of the storm, said Wu Chun-chieh, the chief
coordinator of the project sponsored by the National Science Council and the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The devices contain instrumentation that measures temperature, humidity, air
pressure, wind velocity and other parameters that can help in predicting the
storm's path, according to Wu, who is also a professor in National Taiwan
University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences.</P>
      <P>The data they collect is instantly transmitted to computer forecasting systems
operated by the CWB, as well as international meteorological  institutions,
assisting  them in analyzing the structure of the typhoon and predicting its
track, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Monday's sortie was the 29th air mission under DOTSTAR -- which stands for
"Dropsonde Observation for Typhoon Surveillance Near the Taiwan Region" -- since
2003, with Fengshen the 25th typhoon monitored by the project.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Fengshen left a trail of destruction when it passed through the
Philippines late last week, but has weakened and been downgraded to a tropical
storm as it approaches Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling the project a pioneer in airborne research on typhoons in the Northwest
Pacific,  Wu said the scientific  theories and forecasting applications produced
based on the project's data have been presented at many international
conferences and published in professional journals.</P>
      <P>They have also been treated as an important source in the research of many
international meteorological institutions, Wu said, noting that this year,
DOTSTAR will join the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO's) 2008 THORPEX
Pacific Asian Regional Campaign, known as T-PARC.</P>
      <P>DOTSTAR will work with researchers from countries such as the United  States,
Japan,  South Korea,  Germany  and Canada to strategically observe typhoons in
Northwest Pacific airspace with the help of four aircraft, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to the expert, T-PARC research activities are scheduled to begin on
Aug. 1. During a two-month period, observation, analysis, and research will be
conducted in the fields of typhoon formation, structural changes, tracks and
dispersions.</P>
      <P>The DOTSTAR mission targeting Typhoon Fengshen was a warm-up for the T-PRAC
activity, Wu said.</P>
      <P>THORPEX, short for Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment,  was
established  in May 2003 by the 14th  World Meteorological Congress as a 10-year
international global atmospheric research and development program under the
auspices of the WMO Commission for Atmospheric Sciences.</P>
      <P>THORPEX is a component program of the WMO World Weather Research Program.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will enter a command center to observe the nation's
annual military exercise, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Monday,
but it would not confirm when Ma will participate the simulation.</P>
      <P>According to the MND's plan for the two-stage Hankuang No. 24 military
exercises, the computerized warfare simulation will take place between June 22
and 27, while live-fire drills will be held from Sept. 22 to 26.</P>
      <P>MND spokeswoman Lisa Chi said it would be inappropriate for the ministry to
disclose when the president will enter the Hengshan Command Center in suburban
Taipei during this year's military exercises, which intend to verify the joint
warfare plan and its mechanism.</P>
      <P>MND sources said that this year's simulated war games will break away from the
past practice of anti-air, anti-sea and anti-landing drills in that order.</P>
      <P>Instead, the military will spend one day on sea warfare and four days on land
warfare, with a ground war being fought in northern Taiwan and a diversionary
battle taking place in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sensitive Hsiung Feng 2E cruise missile developed by Taiwan, which was
introduced for the first time last year, will not be included this year.</P>
      <P>The locally  built tactical  shorebased  missile  for fire suppression (TSMFS) ,
which has a range of 1,000 kilometers, is considered to be an offensive missile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's real wage growth slides to lowest level since 1980</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real wage growth from January to April fell to minus 1.92 percent, its
lowest level since 1980, overshadowing the continued rise of nominal wages
during the first fourth months of the year, a statistics official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Jiann-jong, deputy director of the Bureau of Census under the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said the problem was not regular
wages, which grew 1.66 percent year on year in the first four months of 2008,
the highest rate of growth for the same period in the last eight years.</P>
      <P>"The average monthly wage from January to April stood at NT$52,474 (US$1,720),
representing a 1.63 percent rise year-on-year, " he said, an indication of the
steady growth in pay levels in Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>Regular wages cover salary and fixed bonuses while the average monthly wage also
include unanticipated bonuses and allowances.</P>
      <P>Such gains, however, were not able to offset rising inflation, which rose at a
3.65 percent clip during the same four-month period, Huang said at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Growth in the real, or inflation-adjusted, wage therefore fell to minus 1.92
percent, the worst since Taiwan began keeping statistics for real wage growth in
1980, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Real wage growth turned negative last December, " he added, attributing the
downward trend to the recent surge in international raw material and commodities
prices.</P>
      <P>With the government having few options to counter imported inflation, Huang said
pay raises would the only way to return real wage growth to positive territory
in the near term.</P>
      <P>The pace of that growth, however, may be slow because of the rise in part-time
employment and the low profitability of local companies, the results of fiercer
competition in the increasingly globalized economy.</P>
      <P>Higher productivity would also provide a boost, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"More than 20 percent of employers said growth in the company's productivity
would be the biggest reason for pay increases," he said, citing the bureau's
2005 survey that polled 10,000 companies in the industrial and service sectors.</P>
      <P>Another 26 percent of employers in the poll responded that an increase in
company profits would be the main force behind a pay raise.</P>
      <P>"Based on those results, Taiwan's wage growth will depend on Taiwan's companies
becoming more productive and profitable, " Huang said.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin would not violate any law if he does not ink an
agreement with Chinese officials during his current Shanghai visit on bringing
pandas to Taiwan, a mainland affairs official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hau, who departed for Shanghai for a five-day visit earlier in the day, is
expected to meet with Chinese panda preservation officials to discuss how to
raise pandas in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official with the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , Taiwan's China policy
coordinator, said on condition of anonymity that pandas are internationally
protected endangered species and that sending pandas from China to Taiwan must
be in accordance with the Washington Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</P>
      <P>The convention requires exports of endangered animals to be certified by the
exporting and importing countries. Beijing has insisted, however, that the
convention would not apply because the transfer of the pandas would be a
"domestic issue."</P>
      <P>The complex subject requires negotiations between the governments on both sides
to find the most workable solution, the MAC official said.</P>
      <P>If Hau does not sign any type of document with Chinese officials over the matter
and simply exchanges ideas on how to raise pandas, he will neither infringe on
the authority of Taiwan's central government nor violate any laws, the official
said.</P>
      <P>Hau is scheduled to attend an agreement-signing ceremony June 26 for Taiwan's
capital city's participation in the Shanghai 2010 World Expo.</P>
      <P>Hau will also visit the Shanghai Zoo to learn about how to take care of pandas.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, during the zoo visit, the Shanghai city government
will arrange a meeting between Hau and four Chinese officials who take care of
pandas in a preservation area in China's Sichuan province.</P>

      <P>The first ship carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG) imported from Qatar by
state-run oil refiner CPC Corp., Taiwan will arrive in the country in early
July, the company said Monday.</P>
      <P>This vessel will be the first to transport LNG from Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural
Gas Company Limited (II) (RasGas II) , a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum
and ExxonMobil, to CPC.</P>
      <P>To diversify its LNG supply, CPC signed a 25-year contract with the RasGas II in
2005 for an annual supply of 3 million tons, starting in 2008.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Pan Wenent, who was in Qatar to see the gas loaded into the LNG
carrier, said the LNG from Qatar would stabilize Taiwan's energy supply, and
described the company's cooperation with Qatar as symbolized a turning point in
CPC's LNG diversification.</P>
      <P>In addition to importing LNG from Qatar, CPC is also looking to Australia, Iran
and the Sakhalin Islands off the eastern coast of Russia as possible LNG
sources, and has maintained close relations with its current suppliers in Japan
and South Korea for possible cooperation in the future, the company said.</P>
      <P>Qatar, which has played an important role in the global LNG market in the last
few years, surpassed Indonesia in 2006 as the largest LNG supplier in the world,
CPC said.</P>
      <P>The Middle Eastern country exported 29 million tons of LNG in 2007, accounting
for 17 percent of the world's supply, and is expected to export 77 million tons
of LNG in 2012, or 30 percent of global exports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has not received any
information about President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to meet with its chairwoman to
discuss national affairs, a party spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's information and publicity department, made
the remarks after Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi told a news
conference earlier in the day that Ma hopes to meet Tsai to exchange views on
public issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma believed that ruling and opposition parties should develop a
"normal partnership relation, " Wang said the president's chief of staff, Chan
Chuen-po, is arranging for a meeting between Ma and Tsai, both of whom have
taught at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Wang's statement was just a trial balloon, Cheng said the
Presidential  Office should not have handled  formal interaction between the
president and the top leader of a main opposition party in such a manner.</P>
      <P>"Wang need not release a trial balloon through the news media over the event, "
Cheng said. "We have not yet received any information and we will not make any
response until we have received a formal invitation."</P>
      <P>Commenting on a United Evening News report that Tsai was high on a list of
political appointees of the former DPP administration under investigation for
suspected misappropriation of their discretionary special allowances, Cheng said
Tsai had told prosecutors in detail how her special allowance funds had been
used during her tenures as head of the Mainland Affairs Council and as vice
premier.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, all of her special allowance funds were used for official
purposes and justified  with receipts or expense vouchers.</P>
      <P>As to whether Tsai would retain Sung Yao-ming as her defense lawyer in the case
as the newspaper speculated, Cheng said it's still too early to address such a
question since the case is still in the investigative stage.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Cheng said, Tsai once taught Sung at National Chengchi
University. "Tsai has sought his opinions about the special allowance fund
issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Sung defended Ma in a similar special allowance abuse case. Ma was found not
guilty of the embezzlement charges leveled against him for allegedly
misappropriating the discretionary funds during his tenure as Taipei mayor from
1998 through 2006.</P>

      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-luan on Monday described reports he is one of
the hopefuls to take over as KMT chairman in 2009 as "groundless."</P>
      <P>Chu was responding to reports that said KMT grassroots members are prodding
President Ma Ying-jeou to also serve as KMT chairman. While Ma's spokesman said
the president was not interested in taking the job, Ma could back Chu for the
job, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Not true, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>"For the KMT, the most urgent task at the moment is to improve the economy, "
Chu said, adding that "talking about all other things has no positive meaning."</P>
      <P>Chu, 47, has long been considered a rising star in politics. He taught in the
United States and National Taiwan University before being elected as a
legislator in 1999.</P>
      <P>Chu came from a political family with many of his family members serving as
local government heads or councilors. He has performed creditably during his two
terms as county magistrate and has worked closely with Ma.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said that although Chu's participation in the
KMT chairman election is yet to be confirmed, he is confident that "Chu has the
talent to do the job."</P>
      <P>If Chu decides to run, "I'll throw my weight behind him, " Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Taichung mayor, who earlier announced that he would not run for a seat on
the KMT Central Standing Committee so that he can devote all efforts to city
development, said the KMT has regained power and it would be good if the younger
generation takes control of the party.</P>
      <P>Incumbent KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's term will expire in July 2009.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has planned several measures to ensure that Chinese tourists
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan next month will get the best service.</P>
      <P>The measures were announced at a coordination meeting presided over by Minister
Without Porfolio Chu Yun-peng.</P>
      <P>Chu, at the instruction of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, convened the meeting,
inviting officials from related government  agencies, including the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Council of Agriculture (COA), the
Department of Health, the Tourism Bureau, and the National Immigration Agency to
learn about their preparations for the anticipated arrival of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The COA's plans to sell the tourists fruit has been put on hold. Chinese travel
representatives, who arrived in Taiwan last week to learn more about the local
tourism environment, reacted positively to the plums and other fruit they tasted
in Nantou County with good results, and the COA wanted to have the Chinese order
fruit in Taiwan and pick it up in China.</P>
      <P>But because of logistical issues that have yet to be negotiated, the plan, had
to be temporarily suspended, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Until then, he said, the only thing Taiwan can do is to let Chinese tourists try
as much local fruit as possible so that they will become spokesmen for Taiwan's
excellent fruit in China.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said that all
tourism brochures printed by the government will have comparisons of regular
Chinese characters and with the equivalent simplified characters that the
Chinese tourists are more familiar with to prevent confusion.</P>
      <P>Collective purchases at shops will feature reasonable prices and guaranteed
quality, and be subject to refunds, Shih also said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is at the peak of the enterovirus outbreak, incoming tourists may be
concerned about the spread of the disease, but Chu asked the DOH to take any
necessary quarantine and inspection steps.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that some local residents may have misgivings about a flock of
Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan businessmen operating in China and local travelers who tour China
take an estimated 4 million trips a year between China and Taiwan, and have
followed the same quarantine and inspection measures when returning to Taiwan,
she said.</P>

      <P>Tropical Storm Fengshen is expected to bring rains to Taiwan over the next two
days although chances are low that the storm will hit the island directly,
forecasters at the Central Weather Bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Downgraded from a typhoon Sunday after hitting the Philippines, the storm
continues to lose strength and is expected to become a tropical low pressure
system within the next 48-72 hours, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>At 2 a.m.  Tuesday,  Fengshen was centered 220 kilometers south-southwest of the
Pratas Islands, or 580 km away from Taiwan. Packing sustained winds of 83 kph,
it was moving northerly at 15 kph toward Hong Kong and China, they said.</P>
      <P>The outer edges of the storm are expected to bring rains to the southern and
southeastern parts of Taiwan starting Tuesday night and to much of the western
part of the island on Wednesday, they said.</P>
      <P>They predicted that the sultry temperatures would continue, reaching 34 degrees
Celsius in the northern region and 32-33 degrees Celsius in the central and
south.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has planned several measures to ensure that Chinese tourists
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan next month will get the best service.</P>
      <P>The measures were announced at a coordination meeting presided over by Minister
Without Porfolio Chu Yun-peng.</P>
      <P>Chu, at the instruction of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, convened the meeting,
inviting officials from related government  agencies, including the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Council of Agriculture (COA), the
Department of Health, the Tourism Bureau, and the National Immigration Agency to
learn about their preparations for the anticipated arrival of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The COA's plans to sell the tourists fruit has been put on hold. Chinese travel
representatives, who arrived in Taiwan last week to learn more about the local
tourism environment, reacted positively to the plums and other fruit they tasted
in Nantou County with good results, and the COA wanted to have the Chinese order
fruit in Taiwan and pick it up in China.</P>
      <P>But because of logistical issues that have yet to be negotiated, the plan, had
to be temporarily suspended, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Until then, he said, the only thing Taiwan can do is to let Chinese tourists try
as much local fruit as possible so that they will become spokesmen for Taiwan's
excellent fruit in China.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Vanessa Yea-ping Shih said that all
tourism brochures printed by the government will have comparisons of regular
Chinese characters and with the equivalent simplified characters that the
Chinese tourists are more familiar with to prevent confusion.</P>
      <P>Collective purchases at shops will feature reasonable prices and guaranteed
quality, and be subject to refunds, Shih also said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is at the peak of the enterovirus outbreak, incoming tourists may be
concerned about the spread of the disease, but Chu asked the DOH to take any
necessary quarantine and inspection steps.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that some local residents may have misgivings about a flock of
Chinese tourists coming to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan businessmen operating in China and local travelers who tour China
take an estimated 4 million trips a year between China and Taiwan, and have
followed the same quarantine and inspection measures when returning to Taiwan,
she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real wage growth from January to April fell to minus 1.92 percent, its
lowest level since 1980, overshadowing the continued rise of nominal wages
during the first fourth months of the year, a statistics official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Jiann-jong, deputy director of the Bureau of Census under the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said the problem was not regular
wages, which grew 1.66 percent year on year in the first four months of 2008,
the highest rate of growth for the same period in the last eight years.</P>
      <P>"The average monthly wage from January to April stood at NT$52,474 (US$1,720),
representing a 1.63 percent rise year-on-year, " he said, an indication of the
steady growth in pay levels in Taiwan's labor market.</P>
      <P>Regular wages cover salary and fixed bonuses while the average monthly wage also
include unanticipated bonuses and allowances.</P>
      <P>Such gains, however, were not able to offset rising inflation, which rose at a
3.65 percent clip during the same four-month period, Huang said at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Growth in the real, or inflation-adjusted, wage therefore fell to minus 1.92
percent, the worst since Taiwan began keeping statistics for real wage growth in
1980, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Real wage growth turned negative last December, " he added, attributing the
downward trend to the recent surge in international raw material and commodities
prices.</P>
      <P>With the government having few options to counter imported inflation, Huang said
pay raises would the only way to return real wage growth to positive territory
in the near term.</P>
      <P>The pace of that growth, however, may be slow because of the rise in part-time
employment and the low profitability of local companies, the results of fiercer
competition in the increasingly globalized economy.</P>
      <P>Higher productivity would also provide a boost, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"More than 20 percent of employers said growth in the company's productivity
would be the biggest reason for pay increases," he said, citing the bureau's
2005 survey that polled 10,000 companies in the industrial and service sectors.</P>
      <P>Another 26 percent of employers in the poll responded that an increase in
company profits would be the main force behind a pay raise.</P>
      <P>"Based on those results, Taiwan's wage growth will depend on Taiwan's companies
becoming more productive and profitable, " Huang said.</P>

      <P>According to the MND's plan for the two-stage Hankuang No. 24 military
exercises, the computerized warfare simulation will take place between June 22

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has not received any
information about President Ma Ying-jeou's plan to meet with its chairwoman to
discuss national affairs, a party spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's information and publicity department, made
the remarks after Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi told a news
conference earlier in the day that Ma hopes to meet Tsai to exchange views on
public issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma believed that ruling and opposition parties should develop a
"normal partnership relation, " Wang said the president's chief of staff, Chan
Chuen-po, is arranging for a meeting between Ma and Tsai, both of whom have
taught at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Wang's statement was just a trial balloon, Cheng said the
Presidential  Office should not have handled  formal interaction between the
president and the top leader of a main opposition party in such a manner.</P>
      <P>"Wang need not release a trial balloon through the news media over the event, "
Cheng said. "We have not yet received any information and we will not make any
response until we have received a formal invitation."</P>
      <P>Commenting on a United Evening News report that Tsai was high on a list of
political appointees of the former DPP administration under investigation for
suspected misappropriation of their discretionary special allowances, Cheng said
Tsai had told prosecutors in detail how her special allowance funds had been
used during her tenures as head of the Mainland Affairs Council and as vice
premier.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, all of her special allowance funds were used for official
purposes and justified  with receipts or expense vouchers.</P>
      <P>As to whether Tsai would retain Sung Yao-ming as her defense lawyer in the case
as the newspaper speculated, Cheng said it's still too early to address such a
question since the case is still in the investigative stage.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Cheng said, Tsai once taught Sung at National Chengchi
University. "Tsai has sought his opinions about the special allowance fund
issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Sung defended Ma in a similar special allowance abuse case. Ma was found not
guilty of the embezzlement charges leveled against him for allegedly
misappropriating the discretionary funds during his tenure as Taipei mayor from
1998 through 2006.</P>

budget, the state-owned company had forecast a loss of NT$339 million for last

program supervised by the company's board of directors and aggressively
implemented by management.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tainan city government has made a preliminary decision to persuade Falun
Gong protestors to leave a historic site where they have long maintained a
constant presence to highlight their cause.</P>
      <P>City government officials reached the decision after convening a meeting of
related agencies Monday. If their efforts to communicate with the protestors
fail, they will consider further steps, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The city was particularly concerned over the possibility of a repeat of the
dilemma it faced on June 21 as the city gears up to welcome the expected influx
of Chinese tourists next month.</P>
      <P>On that day, a delegation of Chinese travel representatives traveled to the
historic Fort Provincia in Tainan City, which was first built in 1653.</P>
      <P>Fearing that the Chinese visitors would run into the Falun Gong protestors
gathered at the fort, the city government had to move the protestors to another
spot before arranging for the representatives to enter the fort from a side
door.</P>
      <P>City government officials said that Falun Gong members have gathered in front of
the fort for a long time, which they believe has put tremendous pressure on the
city's tourism.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair has openly stated his support for freedom of speech,
and some of opposition Democratic Progressive Party city councilors have
expressed concern about the city government's handling of the Falun Gong
members.</P>
      <P>The city government's cultural and tourism chief, Hsu Keng-hsiu, said that Falun
Gong members have long maintained a presence in front of Fort Provincia and on
the sidewalk of the 300-year-old Sacrificial Martial Temple nearby.</P>
      <P>They also post signs, which he said has violated traffic regulations prohibiting
random posting of advertisements.</P>
      <P>The city government will "first persuade them to leave," and will "refrain from
forcing them to disperse for the time being," he said.</P>
      <P>As for the protestors at Anping Fort, a fort built by the Dutch in 1624 in
suburban Tainan, Hsu said that they have rented a pavilion in front of the fort,
and "are not illegitimate."</P>
      <P>The city government will not "take any action there."</P>
      <P>In 1999, China outlawed the Falun Gong, a spiritual practice introduced to the
public in China by Li Hongzhi. Li has said that Falun Gong is simply a popular
qigong activity that does not have any particular organization, let alone any
political objectives.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong protestors have since gained the spotlight in many countries to
protest against what they said has been Beijing's practice of torturing
practitioners of the movement, which is banned in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Biologists find new mechanism in DNA damage response</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
06/24/08  15:20:07
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers from Taiwan, Australia, and the United States have identified a new
mechanism in DNA damage response, which will help better understand the cause of
cancer, sources at Taiwan's top research institution Academia Sinica said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The mechanism dubbed "phospho-counting" was discovered by the team led by Tsai
Ming-daw, a distinguished research fellow at the institution's Genomics Research
Center.</P>
      <P>According to the research paper published by Molecular Cell, when DNA damage
occurs, a mechanism launches a repair response to restore the DNA sequences. If
the mechanism fails, the damaged DNA can lead to the development of cancer.</P>
      <P>Tsai explained that similar mechanisms have been discovered before; however, the
phospho-counting mechanism carried out by Rad53 kinase is the first one that is
found to function in stages.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that when Rad53 -- a key regulator in repairing DNA -- has a single
phosphate added to it, or monophosphorylated, only the Rad53 becomes active and
the subsequent repair process remains dormant.</P>
      <P>However, when Rad53 is diphosphorylated, meaning two phosphates have been added,
both the Rad53 and the repair response will be activated.</P>
      <P>Although more details related to Rad53 activity require further research, the
findings this time will help understand how cells respond to DNA damage and how
it leads to the formation of cancerous tumors, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>DNA damage is often caused by external factors such as toxins and ultraviolet
light. If left unattended, the damaged DNA will be duplicated in new cells
during the cell replication process. The faulty DNA then causes gene mutations
that lead to the development of cancer.</P>
      <P>To prevent the duplication of faulty DNA, eukaryotic cells have developed  a
mechanism of DNA repair,  which uses cell cycle checkpoints to monitor the
status of a cell. At any checkpoint, the cell will be examined for integrity;
only when the DNA sequences remain intact or the damage is repaired will
duplication be allowed.</P>
      <P>If the repairing mechanism fails to restore the DNA, the cell will then be
ordered to enter either stages of dormancy (senescence) or suicide (apoptosis) .
However, if the checkpoint mechanism fails, the damaged DNA can survive and be
duplicated.</P>

from the public Tuesday to help the political party solve its financial
difficulties.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the DPP is facing a deficit in running its daily operations,

      <P>"I hope all of society will enthusiastically join in the fundraising project to

hope everyone can extend support to the DPP through small donations."</P>
      <P>In addition to calling for small donations, the DPP will also host fundraising
banquets for the party's staff nationwide as well as for its supporters, Tsai
revealed, adding that businesses and entrepreneurs are also being targeted in
the fund-raising efforts.</P>
      <P>Refusing to say how much money the DPP needs, Tsai declared that "the DPP will
not go bankrupt but will exist forever."</P>
      <P>"The DPP will continuously play its social role vigorously, and will be
responsible for the whole society," she reiterated.</P>
      <P>The party has been suffering from financial woes recently, in part caused by the
declining popularity of then-President Chen Shui-bian in the final year of his
tenure, which dampened the enthusiasm of the party's main financial
contributors.</P>
      <P>Heavy losses in the Jan. 12 legislative elections and March 22 presidential
election have forced the party to regroup and expand its political donor base.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's bid to join WHO will be different from before: MOFA</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday it will adopt a different
approach to pitch Taiwan's bid to join international organizations such as the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, and will take the United
States' stance into consideration.</P>
      <P>"The bid for Taiwan to join international organizations will be different than
in the past, " said Harry Tseng, director-general of MOFA's Department of North
American Affairs, at a regular press briefing. "When applying for membership,
especially, Taiwan will fully consider the stance of the United States."</P>
      <P>He said, however, that details such as whether to use the name "Chinese Taipei"
to join international bodies is yet to be discussed by the MOFA's Department of
International Organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying, unsuccessfully, to become an observer in the World
Health Assembly -- the WHO's highest decision-making body -- under its official
title, the Republic of China, since 1997.</P>
      <P>Last year, it applied for full WHO membership as "Taiwan" for the first time,
but the bid failed again due to opposition by China, which claimed that Taiwan
was part of its territory and not a sovereign state eligible to obtain WHO
membership.</P>
      <P>The WHA decided May 19 not to put the Taiwan issue on the general assembly's
agenda although 17 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had submitted a motion
urging WHA to grant observer status to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both the U.S. and Japan support observer status for Taiwan in the WHA. The U.S.,
however, does not support membership for Taiwan in organizations that are
composed solely of states.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also blocked Taiwan's bid to regain U.N. membership, which the
island nation lost in 1971.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou, who assumed office May 20, said many times that
his administration will adopt the principles of "modus vivendi" and "diplomatic
truce" to improve cross-strait relations  with China while exploring ways to
expand Taiwan's participation in the international community.</P>

      <P>The Australian organizer of 2008 World Youth Day responded quickly to Taiwan's
protests and changed the use of the name "Taiwan, Province of China" in the
pulldown menu for countries on its registration Web site.</P>
      <P>According to Democratic Progressive  Party Legislator  Kuan Bi-ling, Taiwan was
listed as "Taiwan, Province of China" on the online registration link
www.xt3.com, and she urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) to deal with
the issue.</P>
      <P>As of 1 p.m. Taipei Time, the name of the island nation displayed in the menu on
the site that was belittling to Taiwan had been changed to "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh told the Central News Agency that according to the
Vatican's charge d'affaires to Taiwan Paul F. Russell, the event's official Web
site is egeria.wyd2008.org.</P>
      <P>The registration site in question, www.xt3.com, is a social networking Web site
for youngsters who wish to volunteer in the event and is not endorsed by the
Holy See, Russell said, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Tuesday at a regular press briefing, Yeh said that the foreign
ministry had enlisted the help of the Vatican to correct the name of the country
by requesting Tu Chu-sheng, MOFA's ambassador to the Vatican, to bring up the
issue with the Holy See.</P>
      <P>"The Vatican replied that it was a mistake made by the Australian organizer and
said it would contact them as soon as possible, " she said.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that Taiwan was listed as "TAIWAN" on the Vatican's official event Web
site at egeria.wyd2008.org.</P>
      <P>The 2008 World Youth Day is scheduled to be held in Sydney from July 15-20.</P>
      <P>World Youth Day, which was initiated by Pope John Paul II in 1984, is a youth
oriented Roman Catholic Church promotional event aimed at young people.</P>
      <P>Held every three years at different locations, the event brings together young
people from around the globe to celebrate and learn about their faith on a more
regular basis.</P>
      <P>This year's event will be the largest event Australia has ever hosted. It will
attract over 125,000 international visitors -- as many as for the 2000 Olympics.
World Youth Day 2008 will mark the first visit of Pope Benedict XVI to
Australia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, or the Republic of China, established diplomatic ties with the Vatican
in 1942 and the Holy See remains Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>

      <P>The Consumers' Foundation reminded the public Tuesday to be wary when buying car
tires, saying that a recent survey by its southern branch revealed wide
disparities in the quality of service and products offered by tire vendors.</P>
      <P>The survey covered 37 tire retailers in the southern city of Tainan between May
22 and June 10. Six tire dealers refused to take part.</P>
      <P>In the survey, the foundation found that although all the retailers had
expiration dates labeled on their tires, 13 sold tires with labels that did not
include the manufacturer's or consignee's contact telephone number or address.</P>
      <P>Of the 37 retailers taking part in the survey, 29 offered 1-5 year guarantees on
their tires, while eight did not, and a further five only did so if specifically
requested by the customer.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that only 25 of the retailers offered free tire
maintenance and inspection services, while 34 of the dealers also sold retreaded
tires.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five of the stores were found to stack their tires on their side,
which could have a negative effect on a tire's performance,  as opposed to the
recommended  upright position, according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation urged consumers shopping for new car tires to pay attention to
their date of manufacture as it greatly affects the price. It also said
consumers should take into consideration whether guarantees and free after-sales
services are included in the price when choosing a tire dealership.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
submitted a draft bill calling for a tax refund by the government to help the
general public fight rising product prices, caucus whip Lai Ching-te said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lai said the government's
plan to earmark NT$58.3 billion (US$1.92 billion) to stimulate the local economy
through public works projects would only fuel inflationary pressures.</P>
      <P>"In this case, it is better to spend the money by giving a tax rebate to some
2.9 million Taiwanese families that do not earn enough to make ends meet," he
argued.</P>
      <P>With the government planning a second round of fuel price hikes and an initial
increase in electricity rates in July, a tax refund of NT$20,000 to each of the
2.9 million households would benefit nearly half of Taiwan's population,
assuming each family has four members, Lai said.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin said the money should be directly given back to
taxpayers because only consumer spending can effectively boost the economy.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Twu Shiing-jer urged the government to follow the example of other
foreign governments in helping poorer people. The United States returned about
NT$18,000 in tax to each taxpayer in May, while Singapore and Hong Kong issued
tax rebates of NT$10,500 and NT$5,710 to their citizens, respectively, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a recent poll conducted by the DPP, 53.4 percent of
the respondents were in favor of the idea of a tax rebate, while 40.4 percent
supported the government's domestic demand expansion plan, DPP spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsan said Monday.</P>

      <P>An enterprise and four civic groups launched a cyber safety project Monday in an
effort to ensure the safety of children going online during the upcoming summer
vacation, as a growing number of children have been the victims of sexual
assaults by their Internet friends in recent years, the groups said.</P>
      <P>The enterprise and the four groups -- Microsoft Taiwan Corp., the Child Welfare
League Foundation, the End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism Taiwan,  the
Taiwan Internet  Content Rating Promotion Foundation, and the Paper Windmill
Foundation -- announced the project during a news conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to government figures, there were 578 cases of sexual assault
committed by cyberspace "friends" against Taiwanese children in 2007, or 1.58
cases per day, and the enterprise and groups have decided to initiate the
project to prevent childen from falling prey to sexual predators.</P>
      <P>Members of the four civil groups said the project will be organized in stages,
with the first stage aimed at promoting a "five-no" suggestion for children and
five pieces of advice for parents.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that Foreign Minister
Francisco H.L. Ou was dejected over the chaos at the legislature Monday, but is
willing to deliver his report whenever the Legislative Yuan asks him to.</P>
      <P>"Foreign Minister Ou never thought of avoiding delivering his report to the
lawmakers. He was well-prepared and ready to do so, " said MOFA spokeswoman
Phoebe Yeh at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Harry Tseng, director-general of the MOFA's Department of North American
Affairs, said at the same press briefing that all top level directors in the
foreign ministry were also prepared to report on their diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>"They all regret that things did not go as smoothly as they wanted," he said.</P>
      <P>Ou was scheduled Monday to deliver his first report and take questions in the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee for the first
time since he assumed office May 20. However, his first appearance in the
legislature ended in chaos.</P>
      <P>Some Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers asked to speak before Ou
delivered his report, a request rejected by Kuomintang (KMT) committee acting
chairman Liu Shen-liang, who citied the procedural rules that permit only
committee members to do so.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, some DPP lawmakers took the podium and listed seven "charges"
against Ou, accusing him of being unqualified for the post, because he had
obtained United States permanent residency status during his tenure as Taiwan's
ambassador to Guatemala, and of poorly handling a recent incident that involved
a collision between a Taiwanese fishing boat and Japanese patrol vessel in the
waters off the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Conflict erupted as several DPP legislators violently jostled Ou to stop him
from leaving after KMT Legislator John Chang proposed a motion to adjourn the
meeting and Liu concurred.</P>
      <P>Ou was surrounded and violently jostled by DPP legislators, who shouted "run
away foreign minister" and "go back to the U.S." KMT legislators and officials
from the foreign ministry also joined in the fray in an attempt to protect Ou.</P>
      <P>After ten minutes of chaos in the legislature, the 68-year-old foreign minister

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun may have reached a career best 71st in the latest ATP
rankings released Monday, but the milestone did little to curb his diappointment
at being knocked out of Wimbledon later the same day.</P>
      <P>"I'm very disappointed and pretty frustrated, " Lu told the Central News Agency
after falling to France's Florent Serra 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-3 in 3 hours and 13
minutes in the first round of the only grand slam played on grass.</P>
      <P>Lu had high expectations for himself entering the tournament, having won two
second-tier Challenger events and reaching the finals of three others earlier
this year to vault him up the rankings. He was also facing an opponent whose
best results had come on clay.</P>
      <P>But sluggish starts to each of the first two sets cost the 24-year-old dearly.
He was broken in the third and fifth games of the first set and in the third
game of the second set, breaks that Lu could not recover from despite pushing
the 74th-ranked Serra to deuce repeatedly in the Frenchman's service games.</P>
      <P>"I didn't play the key points well in the early part of the match, " Lu said,
lamenting a string of unforced errors that gifted Serra points at inopportune
moments. "I' m frustrated that I didn't respond to the challenge."</P>
      <P>The tide turned in the third set, however, as Lu steadied and both players held
serve to push the set to a tiebreaker. He took the last four points of the
deciding game to pull within two sets to one, and after breaking Serra to open
the fourth set, a comeback seemed possible.</P>
      <P>"I thought Serra was tiring physically and mentally and I had a good chance to
ride the momentum to get back into the match, " said Lu, playing in his fifth
Wimbledon and looking to reach the second round of the men's singles for the
third time.</P>
      <P>But serving with a 3-2 lead, Lu could not keep his steady run going and was
broken for the fourth time on the day. Completely deflated by the letdown, he
lost the final three games and the match, and his brief Wimbledon campaign came
to an end.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's highest rated men's player was dogged throughout the match by unforced
errors, committing 48 to only 28 for his opponent, and double faults.</P>
      <P>His four double faults and 12 unforced errors in the final set were perhaps
indicators that fatigue was catching up to Lu, who had already played 16
Challenger and main ATP Tour events and two Davis Cup ties this year in his
successful push to drive up his ranking and qualify for the Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>"I'm physically tired from the all the events I've played. Today, my body felt
like it was still carrying some of the lingering fatigue and I never felt
fresh," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu will now take a break to rest and prepare himself for the U.S. hardcourt
season and the Olympic tennis tournament in August.</P>
      <P>But for him to push deeper into the draws of big tournaments will be a
challenge.</P>
      <P>One of the best conditioned and hardest workers in professional tennis, Lu is
reaching a point where others have had trouble maintaining their rankings on the
fiercely competitive ATP Tour.</P>
      <P>"The peak age for professional tennis players today is 20-25," Chinese Taipei
Tennis Association Secretary-General Liu Chung-hsing said in Taipei. "Even if Lu
improves, he is going to have a lot of younger players chasing him."</P>
      <P>Liu believes that for Lu to have attained his present ranking is already
remarkable.</P>
      <P>But Liu said Lu's battles with injuries over the past few years and then the
subsequent rush to chase ranking points has made it hard for Lu to find a groove
in main ATP Tour events, in which he has had only limited success.</P>
      <P>Now riding one of the best patches of good health and not under pressure to
defend many of his ranking points this summer, however, Lu has as good a chance
as any in recent years to make an impact in ATP events.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei and Chan Yung-jan were to play in the first round of the
women's singles event on Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan AIDS Foundation will launch the first National HIV Testing Day on
June 27, in order to ensure early detection and control of the disease among
high-risk people, the foundation said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>@"The earlier the disease is detected, the easier it is to control," said Frank
Shi, chairman of the Taiwan AIDS foundation. Shi added that on average, most of
HIV-positive patients are confirmed six years after they become infected because
the virus has a long incubation period and early diagnosis is often delayed
because of fear of discrimination.</P>
      <P>@Nicholas Papp, director of the American Cultural Centre under the American
Institute in Taiwan, who attended the press conference, noted that the slogan
for HIV Testing Day in the U.S. isIt's better to know.@@</P>
      <P>"About one million people in the U.S. are HIV-positive, and 25 percent of them
do not even know, " Papp added, urging high risk people to "take the test and to
take control."@@</P>
      <P>He suggested that, in particular, teenagers, homosexuals and bisexuals should be
tested at least once a year, and that pregnant women should also be tested.@@</P>
      <P>HIV Testing Day, observed annually on June 27, was first launched in the United
States in 1995 with the goal of encouraging people to have regular HIV tests and
to raise awareness of the disease.@</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are 16,235 recorded cases of HIV infections to date, and the
number of reported cases has been increasing by 15 to 20 percent annually.
However, according to the foundation, the actual number of infected individuals
could be twice the reported cases.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control show that, as of the end of
2007, the AIDS virus had claimed 1,834 lives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first case of HIV in Taiwan was reported in late 1984, with the infected
person being a foreign traveler. The first reported case of a Taiwan national
having HIV was in 1986.</P>
      <P>HIV testing is available at public health centers, big hospitals and clinical
laboratories, the foundation said, adding that HIV antibody quick-test kits can
also be purchased at drug stores.</P>
      <P>First identified in the United States in 1981, Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) in most cases develops into Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
which eventually destroys the human immune system.</P>

      <P>Amid warming ties between Taiwan and China, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice's recent remarks were aimed at reminding the Kuomintang government that the
United States is Taiwan's leverage and main support in maintaining safety,
according to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on June 19, Rice said that although
the U.S. encourages improvements in relations between Taiwan and China, she
wanted to remind people that the U.S. also has a relationship with Taiwan, and
would like to see Taiwan have "real space" in the international community," such
as in the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said Monday that the Ma Ying-jeou administration's
tilt toward China since taking office May 20 has caused subtle changes in the
military balance in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Rice's comments  were intended  to remind  the administration that a
close Taiwan-U.S. relationship is indispensable in protecting Taiwan's status in
the region and in maintaining peace in the region and in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Rice's comments should be enough for the Ma administration to think about the
position it must take, as it involves interactions with China, Cheng said,
adding that the recent cross-strait exchanges had apparently caused grave
misunderstandings in the international community.</P>
      <P>Cheng said his party hoped the administration would hear the alarm that
Washington was sounding.</P>
      <P>Cheng also criticized a cross-strait diplomatic truce and a delay in arms
procurement  proposed  by National  Security  Council Secretary-General Su Chi
as means of creating a harmonious cross-strait atmosphere, saying that many
diplomatic allies were incredulous at the suggestion.</P>
      <P>"How can a country abandon its defense and diplomatic autonomy just for the sake
of using it as a bargaining chip on the negotiation table and creating a better
atmosphere? " Cheng asked, while reminding Ma's national security team to gain
an understanding of what the mainstream opinions are in the international
community.</P>

-- killing some 80 people and wounding 150 others. There were also two
explosions in a crowded market and a temple, while in the hills around
Darjeeling, thousands of tourists were stranded recently in that tea-growing
area after a separatist group engineered a strike to underscore its demand for
an independent state, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting  that Indian  culture  is one of the four ancient civilizations in the
world that are still flourishing, Liu said Taiwan businessmen usually diversify
their investment there and it is popular tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Liu urged local people to avoid visiting India for the time being, or if they do
visit to stay alert.</P>
      <P>Liu said Taiwan tourists can call the toll-free line 0800-211-334 provided by
the Tourist Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and Communications or
visit the commission's Web sit: www.cpc.gov.tw to file reports if they encounter
any problems while in India.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also raised the level of its
travel warning for India to yellow due to an outbreak of dengue fever there,
which usually escalates during that country's rainy season between July and
September.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials suggested that local businessmen and tourists pay
greater attention to sanitation in India, avoid contact with birds, and avoid
eating raw food while in the country.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan requested the Presidential Office Tuesday to include on the
president's list of Control Yuan and Examination Yuan nominees information
indicating whether the candidates hold foreign citizenship or permanent resident
status.</P>
      <P>The information should be provided to legislators for their reference to help
them decide whether to approve the nominations, said Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, referring to conclusions reached by legislators through inter-
party consultations.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan agreed, in its conclusions, to meet from June 27 to July 3
to review the Control Yuan nominations and to vote on them July 4.</P>
      <P>Review of the Examination Yuan nominations is scheduled for July 7-10, after
which a vote will be held July 11.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has nominated former Finance Minister Wang Chien-shien as
head of the Control Yuan -- the country's top watchdog body --  and named former
Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung as his deputy.</P>
      <P>Ma has also nominated 27 others as members of the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The list of 21 Examination Yuan nominees is led by former National Chiao Tung
University President Chang Chun-yen and ruling Kuomintang Deputy Secretary-
General Wu Chin-lin, who have been tipped, respectively, as head and deputy head
of the government branch that oversees the country's civil service system.</P>
      <P>Although the Nationality Act forbids public servants from holding foreign
citizenship but not permanent resident status, opposition DPP politicians
nevertheless claim that holding or applying for foreign permanent residency
rights calls into question the allegiance of civil servants.</P>
      <P>The issue drew much attention recently after Minister of Foreign Affairs
Francisco H.L. Ou admitted that he had obtained U.S. permanent resident status
in 2005 when he was the country's ambassador to Guatemala, but that he had
renounced the status one month before assuming his ministerial position May 20.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from the DPP, the Cabinet earlier this month asked its members to
disclose whether they had permanent resident status in any foreign country, and
wider checks revealed that several other officials still held such status.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin called Tuesday for the creation of a two-hour
"life circle" with the opening of direct flights between Taipei Songshan Airport
and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport from July 4 to boost development in
both cities.</P>
      <P>Hau made the remarks on a tour of several  major public construction projects in
Shanghai, accompanied by local Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>As a flight between the two airports takes only about 80 minutes, their
geographic proximity and key regional locations could make them transportation
hubs in the Chang Jiang Delta and the Asia-Pacific region, respectively, with
the establishment of direct air links between the two cities, he suggested.</P>
      <P>The air links between Songshan Airport and Hongquio International Airport would
closely connect the two cities and provide a boost to trade and industrial
development on the two sides, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport in Taipei, which is undergoing renovation in preparation for
the arrival of larger numbers of Chinese tourists from July 18, stands a good
chance of becoming an airport for international short-range flights, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayor said he is confident that Songshan Airport would be fully ready
in time for the influx of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hau, leading a delegation of Taipei city government officials, arrived in
Shanghai Monday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Hau was Taiwan's first elected special municipal chief to travel to China amid
improved Taiwan-China  ties since President  Ma Ying-jeou's May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>He is currently visiting Shanghai primarily to witness the signing of an
agreement on Taipei's participation in the 2010 World Expo Shanghai 2010.</P>

third quarter of this year, in contrast to some 3.9 percent that are projected
to cut jobs, the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This means that the number of employees will increase by 39,000 in the July-
September period, with the highest number of 21,000 in the manufacturing sector
and the second-highest of 7,200 in the retail sector, the results of a CLA
survey found.</P>

current size of their work forces in the coming quarter.</P>
      <P>Of the 39,000 projected jobs, 28,000 will be permanent, and 7,000 temporary,
according to the survey. It also indicated that 3,600 employees will be part
timers, while 1,200 will be outsourced workers.</P>
      <P>CLA officials forecast that the actual number of employees recruited by

      <P>Taiwanese ultramarathon runner Kevin Lin said Tuesday that he will push for an
amendment to the law to improve welfare for retired athletes and encourage more
people to work out.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, athletes in Taiwan are a disadvantaged group, compared with
their counterparts in Western countries, some of whom receive high respect.</P>
      <P>The 32-year-old urged the government to amend Taiwan's National Sports Act to
give retired athletes other career alternatives to teaching or coaching.</P>
      <P>The act provides that government agencies, organizations and enterprises should
enhance employees' sports and leisure activities, he said.</P>
      <P>The act also requires owners of companies with at least 500 employees to hire
sports professionals to help design employees' sports activities and offer
counseling, he went on.</P>
      <P>However, the act has never been put into practice, Lin observed, adding that
more exercise can actually improve employee efficiency.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has placed in several ultramarathon races in the Amazon jungle, the
Gobi desert and Antarctica, added that the amendment might encourage more people
to engage in sports, which would help produce more top athletes such as Taiwan-
born New York Yankees pitcher Wang Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Lin, who holds a master's degree in sports psychology, said he has designed a
set of training courses on self-dialogue, confidence, focus of attention, image
training and pressure management.</P>
      <P>He said he will first offer these courses to distinguished athletes and then
join them in giving lectures at local companies to help strengthen their

      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) urged the Ministry of Justice Tuesday
to investigate whether former President Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law Chao Chien-
ming set up a company in the British Virgin Islands in 2005 for the purpose of
laundering money.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in the legislature, Legislator Chiu Yi, who has earned a
reputation for blowing the whistle on corruption, presented copies of documents
showing that Chao established Ann-Ting Tech Co. in the British Virgin Islands in
the Caribbean with capital of US$2 million on Aug. 24, 2005, and that his
business associate, Yu Shih-yi, also set up a company there a week earlier, also
with US$2 million.</P>
      <P>Both Chao and Yu have been convicted by the Taipei District Court and the Taiwan
High Court of profiteering through insider trading in July 2005.</P>
      <P>Saying that he will present the documentary proof to the Ministry of Justice,
Chiu urged the Money Laundering Prevention Center under the ministry's
Investigation Bureau to investigate whether the US$4 million Chao and Yu used to
set up the two companies were profits from insider trading and whether the
companies were formed to launder money.</P>
      <P>Chiu held the press conference after showing the documentary proof on a
television broadcast a day earlier. A United Daily News report Tuesday quoted
Chiu as saying that Chao's money was from suspicious origins because as a young
doctor, he could not possibly have made NT$64 million by 2005 from practicing as
an orthopedist.</P>
      <P>Chao issued a statement later that day admitting that he set up the company in
the British Virgin Islands, but he claimed he had not remitted any money to the
company. He denied that the company was set up for money laundering and said it
was closed down in 2006.</P>
      <P>Chao was sentenced to six years in prison Dec. 27, 2006 by the Taipei District
Court for insider trading involving shares of Taiwan Development Corp. His
father, Chao Yu-chu, received eight years and four months in prison on the same
charges. The court also fined the father and son NT$30 million (US$985,700)
each.</P>
      <P>The Chaos appealed the ruling to the Taiwan High Court, but the High Court
rejected their appeal in June 2007 and increased Chao Chien-ming's sentence by
12 months to seven years in prison while lengthening the sentence to his father
by 14 months to nine years and six months in prison.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court also sentenced two other defendants -- Yu and former
Taiwan Development Corp. Chairman Su Teh-jien -- to four years and three months
in prison, but the Taiwan High Court increased their sentences to seven years
and two months and seven years and six months, respectively, while Yu was also
fined NT$60 million.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court based the lesser sentences on a decision that Chao and
his father had reaped illegal profits of NT$4.27 million through insider
trading, but the Taiwan High Court increased the sentences based on the ruling
that the illegal profits made by the Chaos and the two other codefendant's had
surpassed NT$100 million.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the peaceful resolution of a recent
collision involving a Taiwanese sport fishing boat and a Japanese coast guard
vessel in disputed waters in the East China Sea has had a positive  effect on
Taiwan-Japan relations.</P>
      <P>"The incident is helping Taiwan-Japan relations to move in a positive
direction," he said.</P>
      <P>"Both sides know they can use peaceful and diplomatic channels to resolve
disputes effectively, so that bilateral relations will not be affected but will
in fact be enhanced," he continued.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Japanese people made 1.12 million visits to Taiwan last year,
while Taiwanese people made 1.28 million visits to Japan during the same period,
both record highs.</P>
      <P>He also expressed hope that there will be more student exchanges in the future.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that Japanese is the second language most learned by students in Taiwan
after English, with more than 8,000 senior high schools students learning
Japanese in Taipei City alone.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received a delegation from Yokohama at
the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan clearly expressed its stance in its handling of the incident,
which was to maintain its fishing rights around the Tiaoyutais, located 102
nautical miles to the northeast of Taiwan, as well as its sovereignty over the
island group.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan also maintained its relations with Japan, noting that
Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura said the other day in Tokyo that
Taiwan's handling of the incident had been appropriate.</P>
      <P>The 1,000-ton Japanese Coast Guard vessel sank a 27-ton Taiwanese sport fishing
ship June 10 and the Japanese side detained the Taiwanese captain but later
decided to release him, apologize and compensate him.</P>
      <P>Hitoshi Funamachi, deputy representative of Japan's Interchange Association,
delivered a letter of apology written by Hideo Nasu, head of the 11th
Operational Region of the Japan Coast Guard (JCG), to Ho Hung-yi, the captain of
the fishing boat, last Friday. Ho accepted the apology and further coordination
on compensation is now taking place.</P>
      <P>The collision sparked renewed controversy over the sovereignty of the
Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the Tiaoyutais to Japan when it returned Okinawa
in 1972, but Taiwan believes it has historical and geographical links and legal
rights to the group of islands.</P>
      <P>Japan  administers  the uninhabited  Tiaoyutais  under  the jurisdiction of
Ishigawa, Okinawa Prefecture, while in Taiwan, they fall under the jurisdiction
of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>The conflicting claims over the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais have complicated
fishing disputes between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>The two sides held a 15th round of fishery talks in July 2005 to try to resolve
the dispute and both sides agreed to hold another round of dialogue in March
2006, but the talks never took place.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is entering a critical period this week when it will observed whether the
enterovirus epidemic is abating, Kuo Hsu-sung, director of the Centers for
Disease Control, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>To date, eight deaths and 245 serious cases of hand, foot and mouth disease
resulting from enterovirus  infections have been reported this year in the worst
enterovirus epidemic since 1998 when the disease caused 78 deaths, according to
the CDC.</P>
      <P>"This week is a critical  period to observe whether  the enterovirus epidemic
this year has peaked, " Kuo said at a press conference, adding that if fewer
infected cases are reported by the end of this week, the situation will most
likely slow down.</P>
      <P>A total of 42 confirmed cases were reported last week, most of which were
children under the age of five in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo gave assurance that there are enough hospital beds to care for sick
children, but admitted that there is problem with the coordination of resources.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a recent case in Tainan City, southern Taiwan in which a bed
could not be found in an intensive care unit for a 17-month old child with
enterovirus.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the focus of the epidemic control has currently been shifted from
prevention to medical treatment, adding that the development of an enterovirus
vaccine is necessary.</P>
      <P>He said earlier this month that an enterovirus vaccine currently being developed
by domestic biotechnological industries is expected to be ready for animal
testing next year, and for clinical testing in three years.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as a responsible member of the global health community, Taiwan has
notified and twice updated the World Health Organization (WHO) on the
enterovirus epidemic, with the latest report submitted one week ago, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>However, the WHO has not posted the information on its official Web site, he

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration announced Tuesday details of a plan to
launch historical weekend direct charter flights between Taiwan and China,
saying that the 18 flights allocated to Taiwan-based airlines for the first week
have been distributed among local carriers.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  June  13 accords  signed  by Taiwan's quasi-official Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits Foundation (ARATS) in Beijing, 36 weekend
charter flights will be launched initially between July 4 and 7, with Taiwanese
airlines and mainland carriers operating 18 each.</P>
      <P>The service will initially cover five Chinese cities -- Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing -- and eight airports in Taiwan, namely Taipei,
Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Penghu, Hualien, Kinmen and Taitung.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan's quota of 18 flights has been fully allocated to five local
airlines, only one mainland-based airline has so far applied for the service,
Lin Shinn-der, deputy director general of the CAA, said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The five Taiwanese air carriers to fly the direct cross-strait route the first
weekend are China Airlines (CAL) , EVA Airways, Mandarin Airlines, Uni Air, and
TransAsia Airways, Lin said, adding that the mainland carrier on the route is
Xiamen Airlines.</P>
      <P>Lin disclosed that CAL will operate the maiden flight, departing from Taoyuan
International Airport at 7: 30 a.m. on July 4 for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In response to criticisms that the fares for the direct charters are higher than
expected, Lin explained that flight frequency, airport operational fees, and
soaring fuel prices have contributed to the cost of the tickets.</P>
      <P>The new agreement on direct charters to China, which the Ma Ying-jeou

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will establish close contact with the new
government of Paraguay in a bid to strengthen diplomatic ties, a MOFA official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ko Shen-yeaw, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Central and South
American Affairs, made the remarks after a major newspaper in Paraguay, ABC
Color, quoted the country's incoming Foreign Minister Milda Rivarola Monday as
saying that President-elect Fernando Lugo may "review" Paraguay's diplomatic
relations with Taiwan after the new government takes office August 15.</P>
      <P>Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop who represents the Patriotic Alliance for
Change, won the Paraguay presidential election in April, ending more than six
decades of rule by the Colorado Party.</P>
      <P>Rivarola told ABC Color that it is an appropriate time to examine Paraguay's
relations with Taiwan, which have been in effect for more than five decades.</P>
      <P>However, Ko said Rivarola's remarks should not be interpreted as that South
American  country's  intention  to shift diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"If Lugo thinks some of the cooperation projects with Taiwan should be reviewed,
we would be happy to sit down with Paraguayan officials to discuss them and to
forge new agreements," Ko added.</P>
      <P>Although relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have been thawing
since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May, Ko said it still is not clear
whether China will forsake its bid to steal Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>However, Ko stressed that the MOFA will not lower its guard in this situation
and will try its best to maintain Taiwan's diplomatic ties with Paraguay, its
only diplomatic ally in South America.</P>

      <P>The quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will start arranging
follow-up talks with China as soon as the government settles its direction for
future talks, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said at a news conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , which is in charge of Taiwan's
China policies, has set up a team to make suggestions on the government's
direction on issues expected to be covered in future negotiations.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan and China officially sealed agreements in mid-June in
Beijing paving the way for the July 4 launch of weekend direct cross-Taiwan
Strait charter passenger flights and allowing more Chinese tourists to visit
Taiwan beginning July 18.</P>
      <P>The accords were signed on behalf of the two sides by Chiang and his Chinese
counterpart, Chen Yunlin of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that bilateral consensus on issues related to cargo charter
flights, more straight flight routes, other possible flight destinations and
maritime transport across the Taiwan Strait will be objectives for future talks.</P>
      <P>Other topics include cooperation on crime prevention and control, meteorology,
earthquake studies, oil exploration and expansion of the three mini links --
direct shipping and trade links maintained between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu
islands and three cities in China's Fujian Province, Chiang said, adding that
most issues are related to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>Once  the  MAC team  reaches  conclusions  and gives  its authorization, the SEF

    <HEADLINE>Opposition suggests subsidies, tax deductions to counter price hikes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should outline measures including cash subsidies and tax rebates
to help consumers and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) handle
increasing financial pressure caused by surges in both fuel and power prices,
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang Kun-huei said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has decided to hike the price of
electricity by 12.6 percent July 1, and then raise the price again by another
12.6 percent in October.</P>
      <P>With the planned adjustment expected to affect the public to a huge degree,
especially after gasoline prices were increased May 27 and will raised again
July 1,  Huang criticized  Premier Liu Chao-shiuan's energy policy, saying it
lacks strategic projects to prevent social disturbance caused by the price
hikes.</P>
      <P>Huang said he expected SMEs, as well as mid- and low-income residents, to be the
biggest victims of the price hikes.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the TSU headquarters, Huang suggested offering
SMEs tax refunds, while providing individual consumers cash subsidies of
NT$7,500 a year, plus a tax deduction of NT$7,500 per person.</P>
      <P>Huang cited a family income and spending survey report published by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) in 2006, saying
that he found the amount of money a family spends on fuel and power has little
to do with the income of the family.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that in the category of the lowest 20 percent of families in
terms of income, annual per capita spending on fuel and power consumption is
NT$7,513, while the spending in the highest 20 percent in terms of income is
NT$7,893.</P>
      <P>Huang said mid- and low-income families use more power because they have many
family members.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Liu's proposal of providing subsidies to households
whose monthly power consumption is under 110 kWh will not benefit socially
disadvantaged families, Huang argued.</P>
      <P>According to a MOEA assessment, the two rounds of adjustments to power prices
will raise average family spending by NT$1,056 each year. However, according to
DGBAS statistics each of the 1.46 million households with the lowest incomes
only saves a total of NT$183 per year.</P>
      <P>The power price adjustments will mean that each of these families will be NT$873
short at the end of the year. "Not only have they no hope of getting out of
poverty, they will actually go deeper into debt, " Huang said, demanding that
the government review the existing power price increases again.</P>
      <P>Huang  added  that his party  will hold a workshop  with representatives of SMEs
Thursday to discuss their plight and demand that the government propose concrete
measures to assist SMEs to handle the increases.</P>
      <P>If the government fails to act, Huang went on, the TSU might take to the streets
along with suffering businesses and workers who face possible  unemployment  to
protest  what he described  as the government's incompetence in handling the
price crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>partial repairs on central cross-island highway to begin next year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister  of Transportation  and Communications Mao Chi-kuo promised Tuesday to
open an access road on an earthquake-damaged section of the east-west cross-
island highway in central Taiwan to allow traffic between lower Guguan and the
Deji reservoir in Taichung County's Heping township.</P>
      <P>Answering questions from independent Legislator Yen Ching-piao during an
interpellation session, Mao said he hopes the partial repair work will begin
next year.</P>
      <P>Yen, a member of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, pointed out that one of the
promises made by President Ma Ying-jeou during his election campaign was that if
elected president, he would speed the repair work on the central cross-island
highway, which was seriously damaged by the Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Yen said that re-opening the highway -- which runs through one of the country's
most scenic mountain ranges -- will boost Taiwan's tourism industry, especially
now that the government has decided to allow tourists from China into Taiwan
from next month.</P>
      <P>Mao said his ministry is not sure that the whole central cross-island  highway
can be reopened  because the geological instability of the mountain region in
the location of the damaged road section has made the repair work extremely
difficult.</P>
      <P>He said he could only promise that a five-kilometer access road will be
completed to allow residents and farmers between lower Guguan and the Deji
reservoir to have easier access to population centers.</P>
      <P>The 194-km central cross island highway, completed in 1960, links Dongshih in
Taichung County with Taroko in Hualien County. It is a well-known construction
project in Taiwan because of the engineering difficulties imposed by the
difficult terrain through which the road passes.</P>
      <P>The Highway Bureau has estimated that it will cost at least NT$10 billion
(US$328 million) and take more than 10 years to repair the 24-km section totally
destroyed in the 1999 earthquake.</P>

      <P>Taipei County will offer free counselling services at 11 locations around the
county compared to just five venues in the past, officials of the county's
health bureau said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The county authorities decided to increase the free counselling as they were
encouraged that the number of county residents who took their own lives dropped
to 659 -- 415 males and 244 females -- in 2007, a decrease of 108 compared to
the 2006 figure, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Citing a report recently made public by the Cabinet-level Department of Health,
bureau officials said suicide ranked the sixth top killer in Taipei County --
Taiwan's largest and most populous administrative area.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the county's suicide prevention efforts since 2002, an anti-suicide
awareness has been built up among county personnel and the public, bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>Last year, the bureau received 4,013 telephone calls for help involving suicide
attempts, up from 970 calls in 2002, they noted.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,771 female county residents and 1,242 males tried to kill
themselves in 2007, with the 25-44 age group comprising the bulk, followed by
those aged between 45 and 64.</P>
      <P>Depression, family problems and economic difficulties are the main three reasons
for suicide in the county, according to the bureau officials.</P>
      <P>Since 2005, the county's health and education bureaus also began cooperating in
providing counselors at schools to assist high-risk students, as well as
teachers and parents, the officials said, adding that a comprehensive network
was also set up that same year to prevent suicide in local residential
communities.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Tuesday that the high
jobless rate among people with higher education is due to an oversupply of such
employees.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced Monday that the jobless rate in May
stood at 3.84 percent.</P>
      <P>Although it was the lowest monthly figure recorded in eight years, it was found
that the unemployment rate among university graduates and people with higher
levels of education reached 4.28 percent,  with the number of jobless people in
this category accounting for 25 percent of the total unemployed.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Ministry of Education, Lin Li-jen, a CLA
section chief, said the number of university graduates reached 228,504 in June
last year, compared to 87,421 registered in the same month of 1999.</P>
      <P>The number of new graduates with master's degrees jumped from 15,016 in June
1999 to 50,320 in June 2007, while those with doctorate degrees increased from
1,307 in 1999 to 2,847 in 2007, according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>"Because of the oversupply of people with high levels of education in the
workforce, the competition in this category is getting tougher, making it harder
for job hunters within this group to find an appropriate job," Lin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Yiing Chii-ming said Tuesday that it would be
"irresponsible" for the government to continue a freeze on gasoline price hikes
and that the floating pricing system will return in July.</P>
      <P>Yiing made the remarks in response to calls for the government to avoid dual
hikes of gasoline and electricity prices in July lest they deepen the misery of
the people, who are already reeling from rising consumer prices across the
board.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet unveiled a 12.5 percent increase in the price of gasoline late last
month and also announced that from July, fuel prices will be adjusted on a
monthly basis under a floating pricing mechanism that the state-controlled CPC
Corp. Taiwan adopted in September 2007 but stopped using in November that year
when the Ministry of Economic Affairs ordered a freeze on oil prices in an
effort to curb inflation.</P>
      <P>As the electricity rate will also be raised July 1, some lawmakers have said
that only a "stupid" government would allow simultaneous price hikes of fuel and
electricity rates.</P>
      <P>"Whether a government is stupid or smart,  it has to be responsible," Yiing
responded.</P>
      <P>Faced with the global trend of rising commodity prices, he went on, people will
simply have to adjust their lifestyles.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the government has worked out complementary measures that
will accompany the price increases in an effort to "cushion the impact of the
dual hikes."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the government will spend up to NT$210 billion (US$6.88
billion) on subsidies for fuel and electricity hikes this year, which means that
for every NT$10 the government spends this year, NT$1.1 will be used for fuel
and electricity subsidies.</P>

      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh was
acquitted in a slander case brought against him by President Ma Ying-jeou over
allegations of irregularities in the accounting for a special allowance fund,
according to a ruling handed down by the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma's lawyer, Lai Su-ju, expressed regret over the court ruling later in the day,
saying that she will study the judgment with the president to decide on an
appeal.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won a landslide victory over Hsieh in the March 22 presidential vote,
filed the case with the Taiwan Taipei District Court after Hsieh accused Ma of
using false receipts to draw on a special allowance fund, in a TV interview
Sept. 24 last year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said in the interview that Ma had wired funds from the special
allowance to his daughters who were studying overseas and used the money to pay
his national health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Hsieh to make a correction at the time, but Hsieh repeated the remarks
to the media again on Sept. 28 the same year, which prompted Ma to file the
slander case in September 2007.</P>
      <P>The court acquitted Hsieh of the slander charges on the ground that Hsieh had
made the Sept. 24 remarks based on an indictment against Ma written by Taipei
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted on Feb. 13 last year on charges of pocketing more than NT$11
million (US$361,490) of a special allowance set aside for his use in his
capacity as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.</P>
      <P>However, on April 24 this year, the Supreme Court upheld two previous not-guilty
verdicts, in the third and final judgment in the case brought against Ma.</P>
      <P>In the slander case against Hsieh, the Taipei District Court stated that its
judgment Tuesday was in accordance with the Council of Grand Justice's
Constitutional Interpretation No. 509.</P>
      <P>According to the interpretation, even if the defendant cannot prove the truth of
his remarks, once the evidence submitted proved that the defendant indeed
believed that his statement was true, that person should not be found guilty of
slander.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma was a presidential candidate at the time, and the question of
whether he was involved in corruption should have been subject to public
discussion, the judgment read.</P>
      <P>Ma had more opportunities than the average person to defend himself against the
accusations, it added.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said that the court failed to take into account the parts of
Hsieh's allegations against Ma, which were not based on the prosecutors'
indictment.</P>
      <P>She also blasted Hsieh for not fully verifying the facts before making the
statements, and she said that the court should be aware of this.</P>

      <P>Tax refunds are not a feasible method of boosting the economy as Taiwan still
has a fiscal deficit, Council of Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Tain-jy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to an appeal made earlier that same day by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus, which called for tax
refunds to ease prices hikes rather than a program to boost domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The demand-boosting program, proposed by the Executive Yuan last month, will
pump NT$103.4 billion (US$3.4 billion) into public construction in order to
increase job opportunities, improve the investment environment and eventually
the economy.</P>
      <P>Some NT$58.3 billion of the total amount will be earmarked for local governments
to help them pay their debts and fund public infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>According to DPP legislative caucus whip Lai Ching-te, the demand-boosting
program will only fuel inflation and it would be better to spend the money by
giving tax rebates to some 2.9 million families that do not earn enough to make
ends meet.</P>
      <P>Chen said there is no scope for tax refunds because the country is still mired
in a fiscal deficit. The government's deficit last year was NT$16.3 billion, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Other countries and places such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau
have carried out national tax refund measures, but unlike Taiwan, their
governments enjoy a fiscal surplus, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, although tax refunds help increase incomes, they have
limited effects on stimulating demand, as less than 80 percent of the refunds
will be used for consumption, according to economic theory.</P>
      <P>Chen said better economic effects will be created through local government
public works projects, especially when 90 percent of the projects can be
completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He said there is also a legal problem if money for the demand-boosting program
were to be used to provide tax refunds, as the budget for the demand-boosting
program comes from public bonds and the existing regulations do not allow the
use of money generated from public bonds for tax refunds.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese-American man is looking for his father in the United States, with
the lens of a camera trained on him throughout his search, Taiwanese director
Sung Ming-chieh said in Washington Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sung said his documentary film crew will spend two weeks in the U.S. shooting
footage of the man's search, which will take him into some schools and black
communities as the man's father is an African-American.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old man, Jimmy Liao Chih-lung, who works as a DJ in Taiwan and has
performed several times on TV drag shows, told the CNA that his parents met in
Taiwan in 1974 when his father was serving in the American Air Force during the
Vietnam War.</P>
      <P>Liao said his Taiwanese mother lost contact with his father, known by his middle
name Morgan and the surname Steward or Stewart, since he left Taiwan one month
before Liao was born in 1975.</P>
      <P>Liao also carries the English name James Morgan Steward and is known by the
dimunitive Jimmy. He is not sure whether his father's last name is Stewart or
Steward.</P>
      <P>Director Sung expressed the hope that Liao and the film crew could obtain help
from people who might have some clues to the ex-soldier's whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Liao said his father is probably in his 60s, and that he only wants to know
whether he is well. Liao said he has no wish to disturb his father's life.</P>
      <P>The documentary is a sequel to an earlier film produced in 2004, entitled "Hey
Jimmy," which features Liao's setbacks and frustrations living in Taiwan as a
person of mixed race without a father. The film became popular and was screened
at several local and international film festivals, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Sung said that in the sequel he wants to further discuss the race issue in
Taiwan, as well as family values. The documentary is being subsidized by the

      <P>The fares on the soon-to-be-implemented direct weekend cross-Taiwan Strait
charter flights will not be lower than those of existing regular cross-strait
flights via a third place because they have yet to reach an economy of scale, an
official with Taiwan's top aviation regulator said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remarks came amid public disappointment about the lack of a sizeable price
difference between the direct charter flights slated to be launched July 4
between Taiwan and China, and existing flights via Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>The prices of existing flights are relatively low because they do not reflect
the soaring oil prices, said Lin Hsin-te, deputy director of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>There has been a 20 percent-30 percent rise in the prices of international
flights to the United States and Europe since the end of last year, Lin
observed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, despite a 40-percent increase in aviation fuel prices since mid-
February, the prices of the new weekend charter flights are the same as those of
this year's Lunar New Year holiday charter flights that mainly served China-
based Taiwanese businessmen, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Local travel agents said the prices of the weekend charter flights "will of
course not be low" at the beginning because demand will be very high.</P>
      <P>However, they speculated that the prices of the existing regular flights which
fly across the Taiwan Strait via a third place might drop to prevent losing too

      <P>It would be overkill to deprive a National Chengchi University professor of his
profession for the rest of his life because he hurled verbal abuse at the
president and his late father during the presidential election campaign,
President Ma Ying-jeou indicated though a spokesman Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential  Office  spokesman  Wang Yu-chi  conveyed  the president's concern
over a decision by the university's evaluation committee not to extend the
contract of Chuang Kuo-jung, an assistant professor, because of "conduct
unbecoming of a professor" while serving as chief secretary of the Ministry of
Education.</P>
      <P>Although the president respects the university's decision not to rehire Chuang,
he is concerned that the reasons given for not extending Chuang's contract might
result in total blacklisting of the professor in the future, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"If Chuang is not allowed to teach for the rest of his life, the punishment
would be disproportionate to his error. The society should give him another
chance," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Education Cheng Jei-cheng, former National Chengchi
University president, said ministry officials in charge of personnel affairs
have discussed the matter with Chengchi University executives and reminded them
that the reason they gave for not rehiring Chuang could make it impossible for
him to find a teaching job anywhere in Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it would be better if the university revised its reasons for not
rehiring Chuang.</P>
      <P>Chuang had made highly offensive remarks about then presidential candidate Ma
and his late father during late 2007 and early 2008 while serving as general
secretary of the education ministry. He had subsequently apologized, and the
apology was accepted by Ma.</P>
      <P>An advisory committee of National Chengchi University decided June 18 that the
school would not renew Chuang's contract because of the series of unseemly
remarks he made against Ma and his father.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh was
acquitted in a slander case brought against him by President Ma Ying-jeou over
allegations of irregularities in the accounting for a special allowance fund,
according to a ruling handed down by the Taipei District Court Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma's lawyer, Lai Su-ju, expressed regret over the court ruling later in the day,
saying that she will study the judgment with the president to decide on an
appeal.</P>
      <P>Ma, who won a landslide victory over Hsieh in the March 22 presidential vote,
filed the case with the Taiwan Taipei District Court after Hsieh accused Ma of
using false receipts to draw on a special allowance fund, in a TV interview
Sept. 24 last year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said in the interview that Ma had wired funds from the special
allowance to his daughters who were studying overseas and used the money to pay
his national health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Hsieh to make a correction at the time, but Hsieh repeated the remarks
to the media again on Sept. 28 the same year, which prompted Ma to file the
slander case in September 2007.</P>
      <P>The court acquitted Hsieh of the slander charges on the ground that Hsieh had
made the Sept. 24 remarks based on an indictment against Ma written by Taipei
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted on Feb. 13 last year on charges of pocketing more than NT$11
million (US$361,490) of a special allowance set aside for his use in his
capacity as Taipei mayor between 1998 and 2006.</P>
      <P>However, on April 24 this year, the Supreme Court upheld two previous not-guilty
verdicts, in the third and final judgment in the case brought against Ma.</P>
      <P>In the slander case against Hsieh, the Taipei District Court stated that its
judgment Tuesday was in accordance with the Council of Grand Justice's
Constitutional Interpretation No. 509.</P>
      <P>According to the interpretation, even if the defendant cannot prove the truth of
his remarks, once the evidence submitted proved that the defendant indeed
believed that his statement was true, that person should not be found guilty of
slander.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ma was a presidential candidate at the time, and the question of
whether he was involved in corruption should have been subject to public
discussion, the judgment read.</P>
      <P>Ma had more opportunities than the average person to defend himself against the
accusations, it added.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai said that the court failed to take into account the parts of
Hsieh's allegations against Ma, which were not based on the prosecutors'
indictment.</P>
      <P>She also blasted Hsieh for not fully verifying the facts before making the
statements, and she said that the court should be aware of this.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tax refund not feasible for boosting economy: economic official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 24 (CNA)
06/25/08  10:31:38
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tax refunds are not a feasible method of boosting the economy as Taiwan still
has a fiscal deficit, Council of Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen
Tain-jy said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to an appeal made earlier that same day by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus, which called for tax
refunds to ease prices hikes rather than a program to boost domestic demand.</P>
      <P>The demand-boosting program, proposed by the Executive Yuan last month, will
pump NT$103.4 billion (US$3.4 billion) into public construction in order to
increase job opportunities, improve the investment environment and eventually
the economy.</P>
      <P>Some NT$58.3 billion of the total amount will be earmarked for local governments
to help them pay their debts and fund public infrastructure projects.</P>
      <P>According to DPP legislative caucus whip Lai Ching-te, the demand-boosting
program will only fuel inflation and it would be better to spend the money by
giving tax rebates to some 2.9 million families that do not earn enough to make
ends meet.</P>
      <P>Chen said there is no scope for tax refunds because the country is still mired
in a fiscal deficit. The government's deficit last year was NT$16.3 billion, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Other countries and places such as Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and Macau
have carried out national tax refund measures, but unlike Taiwan, their
governments enjoy a fiscal surplus, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, although tax refunds help increase incomes, they have
limited effects on stimulating demand, as less than 80 percent of the refunds
will be used for consumption, according to economic theory.</P>
      <P>Chen said better economic effects will be created through local government
public works projects, especially when 90 percent of the projects can be
completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He said there is also a legal problem if money for the demand-boosting program
were to be used to provide tax refunds, as the budget for the demand-boosting
program comes from public bonds and the existing regulations do not allow the
use of money generated from public bonds for tax refunds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-U.S. man looking for father in America</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese-American man is looking for his father in the United States, with
the lens of a camera trained on him throughout his search, Taiwanese director
Sung Ming-chieh said in Washington Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sung said his documentary film crew will spend two weeks in the U.S. shooting
footage of the man's search, which will take him into some schools and black
communities as the man's father is an African-American.</P>
      <P>The 33-year-old man, Jimmy Liao Chih-lung, who works as a DJ in Taiwan and has
performed several times on TV drag shows, told the CNA that his parents met in
Taiwan in 1974 when his father was serving in the American Air Force during the
Vietnam War.</P>
      <P>Liao said his Taiwanese mother lost contact with his father, known by his middle
name Morgan and the surname Steward or Stewart, since he left Taiwan one month
before Liao was born in 1975.</P>
      <P>Liao also carries the English name James Morgan Steward and is known by the
dimunitive Jimmy. He is not sure whether his father's last name is Stewart or
Steward.</P>
      <P>Director Sung expressed the hope that Liao and the film crew could obtain help
from people who might have some clues to the ex-soldier's whereabouts.</P>
      <P>Liao said his father is probably in his 60s, and that he only wants to know
whether he is well. Liao said he has no wish to disturb his father's life.</P>
      <P>The documentary is a sequel to an earlier film produced in 2004, entitled "Hey
Jimmy," which features Liao's setbacks and frustrations living in Taiwan as a
person of mixed race without a father. The film became popular and was screened
at several local and international film festivals, Sung said.</P>
      <P>Sung said that in the sequel he wants to further discuss the race issue in
Taiwan, as well as family values. The documentary is being subsidized by the
Government Information Office.</P>

      <P>Chinese tourists spend more on average than any other nationality except for the
Japanese when vacationing in Taiwan and may become the biggest spenders after
they begin arriving in greater numbers here in July, the Tourism Bureau said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Average spending per day by all Chinese visitors (including business travelers)
ranked second behind that for South Korean visitors and marginally higher than
spending by the Japanese, a survey conducted by the Tourism Bureau has revealed.</P>
      <P>It showed, however, that among tourists who come to Taiwan on vacation or for
sightseeing, the Japanese ranked at the top with spending US$304.50 per person
per day, with Chinese tourists second at US$293.08.</P>
      <P>"But after the expansion of Chinese tourist arrivals beginning in July, it is
very possible that visitors from China will overtake Japanese tourists as the
biggest spenders," a Tourism Bureau official involved in preparations to welcome
Chinese tourists told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan attracted 3.72 million foreign visitors in 2007, and the survey,
conducted by the Tourism Bureau from Jan.-Dec. 2007 at Taiwan's main
international airports in Taoyuan and Kaohsiung, found they spent an average of
US$215.21 per day, generating US$5.2 billion in tourism revenue, an increase of
1.52 percent compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>Among the 3.7 million foreign visitors -- including tourists, businessmen or
those came to visit relatives and friends -- the 225,814 Koreans were the
biggest spenders, averaging US$287.05 per person per day.</P>
      <P>The 81,834 Chinese visitors to Taiwan came in second with average spending of
US$258.14 per day while 1,166,380 Japanese visitors spent an average of
US$257.45 per day.</P>
      <P>According  to an agreement  signed in Beijing June 13 by quasi-official bodies
representing Taiwan and China, up to 3,000 ordinary Chinese citizens will be
allowed to visit Taiwan per day for sightseeing from July 18.</P>
      <P>Prior to the agreement, only certain categories of Chinese citizens, including
those living abroad, were eligible to make pleasure trips to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey, which had 5,504 valid responses, found that the "friendly Taiwanese
people" was cited most often as Taiwan's biggest selling point in attracting
foreign visitors while its "scenery" and "cuisine" had the most potential in
terms of tourism marketing.</P>
      <P>Night markets, the National Palace Museum and Taipei 101 ranked as the top three
tourist attractions in Taiwan, the survey showed, and 40 percent of the
respondents said their favorite attraction was Taroko National Park.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that the Internet plays a significant role -- along with
television advertising, newspapers and magazines, and international tourism
shows -- in promoting tourism. Three-quarters of the foreign visitors surveyed
said they had seen ads for tourism in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei, Shanghai to exchange rare animal conservation plans</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  June 25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities from Taipei and Shanghai are expected to forge a pact later
Wednesday on exchanges related to rare animal conservation, including swapping
animals as gifts and know-how in animal raising and reproduction.</P>
      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin will pay a visit to the Shanghai Wild Animals
Park later Wednesday  to gain a better understanding of how the Shanghai Zoo
takes care of rare pandas.</P>
      <P>During that visit, Taipei Zoo officials, who are accompanying Hau on a five-day
visit in Shanghai, are expected to strike an agreement on rare animal
conservation exchanges between the two cities.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement -- expected to take effect in 2009 -- Taipei plans to give
orangutans, white-handed gibbons and sun bears to Shanghai as gifts, while
Shanghai will reciprocate with snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese alligators and lesser
pandas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Lin Hua-ching, director of Taipei Zoo's Wildlife
Conservation Research Center, the two giant pandas that China has promised as
gifts to Taiwan -- known as "Tuan Tuan" and "Yuan Yuan" -- are not expected to
arrive in September as previously hoped.</P>
      <P>Lin said that several factors are holding back the transfer of the rare animals,
including that China's giant panda reserve in Wolong, Sichuan province, is still
recuperating from the deadly 8.0-magnitude earthquake that struck Sichuan May
12.</P>
      <P>He also said the weather would be too hot for the delicate pandas to travel to
and resettle in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the two Sichuan pandas are more likely to arrive in Taiwan in
November or December this year.</P>
      <P>Lin also denied media speculation that officials from the Wolong Giant Panda
Reserve will meet the mayor and Taipei Zoo officials in Shanghai to "make a
decision on Wolong's giving the two animals to Taipei City."</P>
      <P>He added that many cities around Taiwan have expressed a strong interest to host
"Tuan Tuan" and "Yuan Yuan" and that it's up to the relevant Chinese agencies to
decide which city in Taiwan will host the two pandas.</P>
      <P>"China will assess which city is the most suitable to play host to the two
pandas -- based on the environment, the host's facilities and other conditions,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Hau and the delegation of Taipei City government officials and city councilors
arrived in Shanghai Monday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>The mayor, Taiwan's first elected municipal chief ever to travel to China, is in
Shanghai mainly to witness the signing of an agreement to confirm Taipei's
participation in World Expo Shanghai 2010, slated for May 1 to Oct. 31, 2010.</P>
      <P>He is scheduled to meet with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng Thursday to jointly
witness the signing of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan business tycoon Terry Gou, founder of the Hon Hai Group who has promised
to build a pavilion for Taipei City at the Shanghai Expo, will also join Hau and
Han at the signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Gou forged an accord with Hau in Taipei June 22, under which an education
foundation under the Hon Hai Group will plan, fund, construct and operate the
pavilion. The project has a price tag of NT$300 million (US$9.87 million).</P>
      <P>During his stay in Shanghai, Hau has visited a project aimed at developing
Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport into a multiple transportation hub to possibly draw
on Shanghai's experience in airport development for the remodeling of Taipei's
Songshan Airport.</P>
      <P>Taipei City has been planning to make Songshan Airport the Taiwan counterpart to
Hongqiao Airport when direct cross-strait weekend charter flights are launched
in July.</P>

(By Steve Bercic)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus called
Wednesday for Department of Health (DOH) Minister Lin Fang-yue to step down if
the enterovirus outbreak that has claimed eight lives so far this year is not
brought under control quickly.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference attended by several DPP lawmakers, caucus whip Yeh
Yi-jin requested that the Executive Yuan set up an epidemic emergency response
center immediately to coordinate efforts around the country to fight the
outbreak.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, a total of 245 serious enterovirus cases, including eight
fatalities, had been reported around Taiwan so far this year. Most of the
patients have been children under the age of five.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet activated an epidemic emergency response command center on June 10
to deal with the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Yeh quoted the DOH head as saying two weeks ago that if the enterovirus cannot
be controlled, all that is left to do is pray.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei said that the age of people effected by the
outbreak could begin expanding, and she urged Lin "not to pray anymore and to
begin making major decisions" to handle the situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh, noting that the enterovirus has been spreading, called for
President Ma Ying-jeou not to disregard the threat that the outbreak poses to
the health of Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tien Chiu-chin claimed that as Ma's kids live outside Taiwan, he
hasn't had to personally worry about the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Chen made the same claim of Lin and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, saying that because
neither has children under the age of 5, they cannot understand the worries that
parents of young children in Taiwan are experiencing.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher noted that the DOH head said Monday that the
enterovirus outbreak was beginning to subside and questioned whether the fact
that no new cases were reported over the weekend had anything to do with the
fact that staff working on epidemic control had the weekend off.</P>
      <P>If this is the case, the DOH should give a clear explanation of the situation
immediately, he said.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this year and has
since spread northward to cover all parts of the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Ching-an was blasted Wednesday for not
authorizing local prosecutors to seek assistance from the United States in
investigating if she has U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee said that allegations that she is a U.S. citizen should be determined by the
law and that she will not respond to criticism made by some opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers who have "repeatedly used political
mudslinging to cloud the issue."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Nationality Act forbids a local national who holds foreign citizenship
from serving in the government.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came after a report in the Chinese-language daily China Times
quoted Taipei district prosecutors as saying they had asked Lee to offer a
letter of authorization to help them request assistance in the investigation
from United States authorities.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors expressed regret Tuesday over a statement issued by Lee, who did
not agree to give the authorization.</P>
      <P>Without such authorization, the U.S. government will not release Lee's personal
information to the prosecutors, the report said.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors will continue to negotiate with the lawmaker on the matter and
urge her to cooperate with the investigation, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors told the daily they will respect Lee's decision if she does not
agree to give her authorization, and will find other ways to investigate the
case.</P>
      <P>It has been more than three months since the prosecutors received the case to
investigate Lee's alleged dual citizenship.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiu Yi-ying criticized Lee Wednesday for serving as one of
Taiwan's lawmakers but using U.S. law to protect herself.</P>
      <P>Lee had promised on May 30 that she would cooperate with authorities in the
investigation and expressed support for such an investigation.</P>
      <P>The citizenship controversy erupted following a recent Next magazine report
accusing Lee of holding U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>Lee has claimed that she forfeited her U.S. citizenship when she was sworn in as
Taipei City councilor in 1994, but has yet to produce any related documents to
prove her claim.</P>
      <P>Lee will be required to give up her seat in the legislature if she is found to
be holding U.S. citizenship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Calling time error gives Chunghwa Telecom extra profits: foundation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
06/25/08  14:52:56
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A small error in how Chunghwa Telecom Co. calculates the duration of calls made
by cell phone users may be adding NT$400 million (US$13 million) per year to the
bottom line of Taiwan's biggest telecom operator, the Consumers' Foundation said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The foundation raised the issue at a news conference after receiving a complaint
from a Chunghwa Telecom cell phone subscriber who discovered that Chuanghwa
Telecom charged her for longer than her calls lasted.</P>
      <P>After comparing the call duration records on her cell phone and her monthly
phone bill, the subscriber found that the duration of 52 of the 66 calls she
made in May were calculated differently, said Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-
hung.</P>
      <P>A close analysis of the phone bill shows that there was one extra second in 47
calls and two extra seconds in five other calls in Chunghwa Telecom's bill,
Cheng said, adding that the extra seconds calculated on the bill cost the
subscriber an extra NT$3.97 in May.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom has 8.75 million cell phone users and if it charges every user
an additional NT$4 per month, it could earn at least NT$400 million more per
year, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom acknowledged that the time of each call does not end until its
machine receives the signal from the users' cell phones and therefore there is
"a minor difference," he said.</P>
      <P>But Cheng was not satisfied with the explanation. He blasted the telecom
operator for continuing to charge its subscribers for extra time even when it
was fully aware of the problem rather than working to solve it.</P>
      <P>The company's subscribers will need to foot even higher bills when they make
longer calls or international calls, he argued.</P>
      <P>Cheng urged the National Communications Commission (NCC) , the country's telecom
regulator, to ask all local telecom operators to calibrate their machines and
offer refunds to their subscribers for the extra charges.</P>
      <P>The NCC should also set up a unit to help those consumers who have doubts about
the duration of their calls re-examine the durations they have been charged for
to protect their rights, Cheng suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ban on sale of mercury thermometers takes effect July 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 25 (CNA)
06/25/08  15:10:35
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will begin banning the sale of
mercury thermometers to individual consumers and non-medical institutions on
July 1, with violators facing fines of up to NT$6,000 (US$197).</P>
      <P>Businesses  will  also be prohibited  from giving  mercury thermometers as gifts
to the public.</P>
      <P>The measure was devised in March to reduce the toxic element's harm to people's
health and the environment, EPA officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mercury is commonly used in thermometers, barometers, manometers,
sphygmomanometers, float valves and other scientific instruments and devices.</P>
      <P>The element's toxicity, however, has led to the phasing out of mercury
thermometers  and blood pressure  units,  in favor of alcohol-filled, digital,
or thermistor-based instruments.</P>
      <P>It's now the right time to impose the ban with electronic devices growing more
common, the EPA said.</P>
      <P>According  to the administration,  reinforcing  controls on mercury-contained
products is a global trend. Countries including Sweden, Denmark and Holland, as
well as some states in the United States, have either imposed restrictions or
outright bans on sales of mercury thermometers.</P>
      <P>The EPA said recycling mercury thermometers is problematics, because the small
amount of element found in thermometers -- 1.2 grams -- is difficult to recycle.</P>
      <P>Businesses will still be allowed to sell traditional thermometers to medical
institutions until July 1 in 2011, according to the EPA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislators question new labor insurance pension system</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
06/25/08  15:20:05
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus and the Council of Labor Affairs
(CLA) may have agreed earlier this week on parameters for Taiwan's new pension
system, but some lawmakers argued Wednesday that the new system neglected
workers' rights.</P>
      <P>The CLA and KMT decided to set the labor insurance premium rate for the new
pension system at 7.5 percent, which will raise premiums for both employees  and
employers,  while pegging  the income substitution factor at 1.55 percent.</P>
      <P>Under this system, workers will have the option of accepting their retirement
benefits as a monthly annuity, beginning at the age of 60, in addition to the
previous option of collecting their pension in one lump sum.</P>
      <P>Those opting for the monthly payment will receive an amount equaling the number
of years they have participated in the labor insurance system times their
monthly salary (calculated by taking the average of a workers' 60 highest
monthly salaries) times the income substitution factor.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lai Ching-te argued in a committee hearing that the CLA should
not raise the premium rate, saying it was a concession to the "party-state
system."</P>
      <P>KMT legislators, including Chung Shao-Ho and Huang Ho Tsai-Feng, also questioned
the higher premium rate, with Huang Ho saying that the CLA is treating workers
as its own "ATMs."</P>
      <P>CLA Minister  Wang Ju-hsuan responded,  however,  that the parameters chosen
were fiscally prudent.</P>
      <P>"We have tried to find a balance between ensuring workers' rights and the labor
insurance fund's finances," she stressed, saying that a higher income
substitution factor or a lower premium rate could lead to serious pension system
deficits.</P>
      <P>The new system, still under review in the Legislative Yuan, is expected to be
passed soon and implemented next year.</P>
      <P>It was mapped out by the CLA to ensure that workers would have a steady income
in retirement, especially with Taiwan entering a period of an aging population
with fewer working-age adults and children to support the elderly.</P>
      <P>The council worried that those who take a lump sum retirement payment would see
its value eroded by inflation or be quickly exhausted because of bad investments
and has said that workers will earn more in benefits by accepting a monthly
annuity than if they take a lump sum payment.</P>

      <P>In view of the growing popularity of pets, passengers will also be allowed to

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has been working to solidify the
administration's plans to offer subsidies to employees on parental leave and
extend unemployment benefits to specific groups of people, CLA Minister Wang Ju-
hsuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Wang said the council expects to
implement a policy to offer people who take parental leave a subsidy equal to 60
percent of the candidates' salaries for up to six months.</P>
      <P>Wang said the CLA is also planning to extend the period over which middle-aged
or senior jobless people can claim unemployment benefits from the current six
months to nine months.</P>
      <P>Wang denied a media report that a previous plan offering subsidies equal to 50
percent of the salaries of the employees on parental leave for up to six months
was halted "due to opposition from the private sector."</P>
      <P>She stressed that the parental leave program will not be postponed as speculated
by the media, adding that the CLA is committed to amending the employment
protection law in two months to pave the way for the new initiative's
implementation.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the amendment  can be referred to the legislature for approval
when the next legislative session opens, " she said.</P>
      <P>Wang said that funding for the subsidy could come from the employment insurance
fund or the government's main budget.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind President Ma Ying-jeou's campaign promise to "offer 60 percent
of the salary of employees on parental leave for two years" if elected, Wang
said the subsidy program for employees on parental leave will be implemented in
several stages.</P>
      <P>The first stage will provide parental leave benefits for up to six months, she
said.</P>
      <P>Six months after the policy is put in place, the council will weigh its impact
on local businesses and the employment of women before determining whether the
policy should begin targeting its mid- and long-term goals, namely allowing
employees on parental leave to receive subsidies for up to two years, Wang
added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Wednesday that Taiwan will maintain its
established relations with the United States and earmark defense funds to
procure defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Speaking with a delegation headed by former U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Perry at the Presidential Office, Ma pointed out that he said in his May 20
inaugural speech that Taiwan will maintain its security cooperation with the
U.S. and that arms procurements will be aimed at demonstrating Taiwan's will to
defend itself.</P>
      <P>Ma told the delegation that Taiwan will be a "peacemaker, " putting countries in

19 interview with Wall Street Journal that the U.S. has been encouraging China
and Taiwan to improve relations, but she also mentioned that the U.S. also has a
relationship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taiwan will start by improving its economic ties with China before
gradually moving on to discuss Taiwan's international space and a possible
signing of a cross-strait peace agreement.</P>
      <P>China claims  sovereignty  over self-ruled  Taiwan and has repeatedly blocked
the country's efforts to join the United Nations and other international
organizations that require statehood as a membership prerequisite over the
years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China resumed long-suspended talks in mid-June and reached a historic
agreement at a meeting in Beijing on the opening of weekend direct cross-strait
charter flights and increasing the number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit
Taiwan. Both are slated to begin in July.</P>
      <P>Ma said that cross-strait talks had been suspended for nearly 10 years and that
the resumption of the talks carries a greater significance than the actual
results of the talks.</P>
      <P>He added that both sides acknowledge that while there are quite a few
differences between them, there are also mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Therefore, both sides should set aside their disputes and focus on similarities
rather than differences  to create a win-win situation, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Galactic cannibalism' identified in Seyfert galaxy, its neighbor</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese astrophysicists have proved for the first time that a Seyfert galaxy
will devour its neighboring galaxies, indicating that a black hole may exist
inside the Seyfert galaxy, according to local news reports Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Seyfert galaxy, a class of galaxy named after its founder Carl Keenan
Seyfert, is distinguished for its extremely bright nucleus. Astronomers have
long hypothesized that there should be a black hole near the core of a Seyfert
galaxy and that the bright light is emitted by the substances consumed by the
black hole.</P>
      <P>However, there has not been enough evidence to prove the hypothesis before the
team led by Jeremy Lim, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica's
Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, presented its finding in the June issue
of The Astrophysical Journal.</P>
      <P>In the research paper, the researchers stated that when using the Very Large
Array radio telescope of the U.S.-based National Science Foundation, they found
that atomic hydrogen gas had been sucked into the center of a Seyfert galaxy,
coded AKN 539.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, when another galaxy coded PGC 23700360 collided with AKN 539, the
hydrogen gas of PGC 23700360 was also drawn to AKN 539, indicating the Seyfert
galaxy had been feeding on its counterpart. The movement of the gaseous mass to
AKN 539 was observed to form a "bridge" between the two galaxies.</P>
      <P>And, as the body of AKN 539 is disturbed by PGC 23700360, substances are more
prone to be subject to the gravitational attraction of the Seyfert galaxy.</P>
      <P>Researchers said that previous research using visible-light telescopes had only
partially observed the phenomenon, usually nicknamed "galactic cannibalism" as
the galaxies appear to be eating each other, and that only by using radio
telescopes and focusing on the changes in hydrogen gas can the whole picture of
galactic cannibalism be revealed.</P>
      <P>"Our results show that images of the hydrogen gas are a powerful tool for
revealing otherwise invisible gravitational interactions among galaxies," Jeremy
Lim was quoted as saying in an Academia Sinica statement.</P>
      <P>"This is a welcome advance in our understanding of these objects, made possible
by the best and most extensive survey ever made of hydrogen in Seyferts," Lim
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's property market slowing down</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's real estate market continued to show signs of a slowdown with
monitoring  indicators flashing yellow-blue in the first quarter of 2008,
according to a quarterly report released Wednesday by the Architecture and
Building Research Institute (ABRI) under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>This marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which a yellow-blue light had
appeared, indicating sluggishness in the property market, the report said.</P>
      <P>The overall monitoring score dropped to 8 in the first quarter, the lowest level
recorded since the first quarter of 2002, the report showed.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer of the market's outlook
in the coming two quarters -- stood at 101.51 in the first quarter, down 0.88
percent from the fourth quarter of 2007.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the index of coincident indicators, which represents the current
situation, declined 1.66 percent to 99.11.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted May 10-31 by the ABRI among businesses involved
in the real estate sector, 59.69 percent of respondents thought the property
market situation in the first quarter was worse than the previous quarter, while
only 12.4 percent thought the situation was better.</P>
      <P>However, 24 percent of respondents predicted the situation will improve in the
second quarter and 48 percent predicted it will be better in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-o, a professor at National Chengchi University's Department of Land
Economics, noted that rising fuel prices and electricity rates are eroding the
public's real earnings, which has weakened their purchasing power and their
ability to buy homes.</P>
      <P>While home purchases have been widely believed to provide a hedge against
inflation, rising interest rates are lowering the public's desire to buy homes,
because real estate is less effective as an inflation hedge when home buyers are
required to spend more on mortgage payments, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the fact that the monitoring indicators have signaled a slowdown
despite mostly positive news about the real estate market in the first quarter
shows that the market is returning  to fundamentals and making a slight downward
correction.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen, deputy chief of the ABRI, said the positive news released in the
first quarter included the possible launch of direct cross-Taiwan Strait
transport links after the election of Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-
jeou,  the growth in commercial property transactions, and a sharp rise in
consumer confidence in the property market.</P>
      <P>Negative news that appeared during the same period included the increase of the
average housing price to 7.5 times local residents' annual income and an
increase in home buyers' spending on mortgage payments, which accounted for 33.1
percent of their income in the first quarter, Yeh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met world famous American investment master Jim Rogers at
the Presidential Office Wednesday and both men expressed great confidence in the
future of Asia, including Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Ma said Rogers' visit to Taiwan at this juncture carries great significance for
the country, which witnessed its second power transfer May 20 and which is set
to embrace totally different roles in Asia and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>"Such a change is very meaningful to Taiwan itself and to the region, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president expressed hope that improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
greater government investment in the domestic market will help his
administration to cope with the adverse impact of growing inflation,
particularly at a time when the local bourse has been continuously falling since
late last month.</P>
      <P>"The government is poised to create a new environment suitable for cross-strait
development, such as the establishment of direct weekend charter flights between
Taiwan and China and Taiwan's wider opening to Chinese tourists from early
July," he said.</P>
      <P>Although doing so also carries an element of risk, Ma, however, said he is
convinced this is the right path to fallow.</P>
      <P>Japan and the United States have expressed positive sentiments about peaceful
development across the strait -- a region that is viewed as one of the world's
potential flash points, Ma said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Rogers said he has begun purchasing Taiwanese stocks after seeing
the start of a new era between Taiwan and China and in Asia in general.</P>
      <P>Describing the 21st Century as the "Asian era," Rogers said China and Taiwan
also stand a good chance for broader advancement.</P>
      <P>Rogers, who founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros, is one of the world's
most famous investment pundits.</P>

      <P>The Rabbit Pencil company, whose products have remained popular among elementary
school students over six decades, opened its factory to visitors Wednesday in a
novel move to ensure its survival.</P>
      <P>Rabbit Pencils will allow visitors to learn about the history of pencils and
pencil-making, in addition to giving them the opportunity to have their own
personalized pencils made on the spot.</P>
      <P>The company, established in 1947 in Taipei by three brothers surnamed Tang from
Shanghai, is offering opportunities for visitors to have their names and email
addresses printed on their pencils to be used as business cards; for newlyweds
to have their names printed on pairs of pencils as a wedding souvenir; or to
have personal designs printed on pencils.</P>
      <P>The "pencil museum" will be opened to groups of 10 people or more. Reservations
must be made for admission, which costs NT$150 per head for the general public
and NT$100 per head for Yilan residents, according to Tang Chin-chuan, a second-
generation CEO of the company.</P>
      <P>The Tangs began their business in Taiwan as a trading company, dealing mainly in
the business of wax and ink paper sheets for duplication. The company produced
Taiwan's first ballpoint pen in 1966, followed soon afterward by the production
of Rabbit pencils. The company relocated its manufacturing  operations to
Wuchieh township in Yilan County in 1971, according to Tang Chin-chuan.</P>
      <P>As times have changed and Taiwan's environment for stationery production has
altered, many big-named pencil makers have moved out of Taiwan to China or
Southeast Asia to survive global competition, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Rabbit Pencils, however, has stubbornly kept its roots in Taiwan, insisting that
Taiwanese, particularly youngsters, will continue to be provided with quality
pencils carrying the "Made in Taiwan" mark, he added.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Tang went on, the company's payroll has shrunk from 550
people in its prime to only a few dozen today.</P>
      <P>"When we decided to open our Wuchieh factory to tourists, many people were
surprised to be reminded that Rabbit Pencils is still operating" Tang noted.</P>
      <P>Rabbit Pencils is one of the 11 companies in Yilan to have joined an initiative
launched by the Yilan county government earlier this year to turn factories into
"tourist attractions" in a bid to rekindle the county's economy.</P>
      <P>The 10 other companies include a rice noodle processing plant, a crayon-making
factory, a preserved fruit and confectionery factory, a biotechnology plant and
a canned food company, according to Yilan county government officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>40 percent cap on China-bound investment to be relaxed soon: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 25 (CNA)
06/25/08  17:45:37
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Yiin Chii-ming said at a legislative hearing
Wednesday that the current 40 percent limit on China-bound investment is
scheduled to be relaxed in August and that the formula for capping investments
will be revised.</P>
      <P>"The ministry plans to change the regulations that currently specify three
different investment ceilings based company capital, and introduce instead a
single cap," Yiin said.</P>
      <P>He however did not disclose the planned level the of the single investment
limit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current regulations governing company investment in China specifies
three tiers -- 20 percent, 30 percent and 40 percent of capital. Companies with
bigger net capitals are limited to a lower percentage, and those with NT$20
billion or more in capital are permitted to invest a maximum of 27.5 percent of
the total in China.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that before the end of July the MOEA will lay out the details of the
planned revision, after which the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will examine
the proposals and then forward them to the Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>"Although my ministry is not fully responsible for the administrative processing
of the plan, it is hoped that the revisions will take effect before the end of
August," Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers at the hearing noted that under the former Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) administration, the MAC, which is the supervisory authority on
China-bound investment issues, had prevented many local companies from expanding
their businesses in China.</P>
      <P>"Now, they will not be blocked by the MAC anymore," Yiin said, adding that the
new Kuomintang (KMT) government will however need to put complementary measures
in place before relaxing the investment cap.</P>
      <P>"There are some worries that raising the investment ceiling will hurt local
industries, and the government needs to allay these fears," he said.</P>
      <P>Yiin also said that the expanded  and simpler  investment regulations will offer
Taiwan's industries a more open environment to conduct global business. "Taiwan
companies will be more inclined to base their operations at home," he added.</P>
      <P>International companies will also benefit from working with Taiwan's China-based
companies to further explore the Chinese market, as "the new regulations will
allow for easier inflow and outflow of capital across the strait," he said.</P>

      <P>Rising consumer prices have posed the biggest risk to Taiwan's economic
development this year and the government has to adopt "aggressive and timely
measures" to tackle the problem, the nation's top economic planner said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
also said that in terms of checking the rise in consumer prices, Taiwan has been
doing well compared with other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after attending a meeting of a task force on stabilizing
consumer prices presided over by Vice Premier Paul Chiu.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Cabinet has listed 10 basic goods -- rice, flour, toilet
tissues, milk powder and fresh milk, cooking oil, soy sauce, eggs, instant
noodle, shampoo and soap -- as observation indexes, and keeps close watch on
their changing prices.</P>
      <P>Taking the consumer price index (CPI) last week as an example, he said that
Taiwan's fluctuation was second-lowest in Asia after Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Cabinet has listed the 10 basic goods to ensure that the public
will have access to them, noting that several supermarkets have worked closely
with the government policy in providing own-brand versions of these goods at
relatively low prices.</P>
      <P>"To some extent, the measure has proved effective in curbing the consumer price
increases," he said.</P>
      <P>The performance of Taiwan's consumer prices "is acceptable, " he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Huei-ching, head of the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, said that after the announcement of gasoline and diesel oil price hikes
last month, the sales of oil products of two companies -- state-owned CPC Corp.
Taiwan and the private FPCC -- dropped.</P>
      <P>The two companies' gasoline sales dropped by 11.7 percent in June compared to
March, while sales of diesel dropped by 21.5 percent, which Yeh described as
evidence that the government's call for energy conservation was being answered.</P>
      <P>Rising fuel prices have also caused the public to shift to public transport, he
added.</P>
      <P>Citing Taipei City as an example, Yeh said the use of the MRT system in the
first half of June increased by 9.7 percent from the same period of last year,
while bus use increased by 4.5 percent June 1-15 compared with the same period
of last year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Hsieh Su-wei advanced beyond the first round of the women's singles
event at Wimbledon for the first time in her career Tuesday, while Chan Yung-jan
was again snakebitten by a tough draw at the grasscourt event.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who stunned the tennis world when she reached the round of 16 at the
Australian Open in January, had not won a singles match in a main women's tour
event since then.</P>
      <P>But she once again raised her game on a big stage, committing only 15 unforced
errors and being broken only once despite serving erratically to whip France's
Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-3, 6-2 in just over an hour.</P>
      <P>Rarely troubled by the Frenchwoman, the 116th-ranked Hsieh took command of the
first set when she broke Cohen-Aloro in the sixth game and never looked back,
showing no signs of the injuries that have plagued her since her unforgettable
run in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>With the victory, Su become the first Taiwanese female player to advance to the
second round of the tournament since Wang Shi-ting reached the same stage of the
event in 1997 and 1998, but if she wants to advance further, she'll have to get
by French Open finalist Dinara Safina of Russia, not an easy task.</P>
      <P>Just ask Chan Yung-ran.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top-ranked singles player, who drew second seed Maria Sharapova at
Wimbledon last year, was once again paired with a top 10 seed, and she
eventually succumbed to the ninth-seeded Safina 7-6 (8), 6-2 in 84 minutes.</P>
      <P>Chan told the Central News Agency that she felt confident and relaxed against
her friend and occasional doubles partner, knowing that aside from her serve and
determination, Safina does not have any big weapons. Play her best, Chan
figured, and she would keep the match close.</P>
      <P>That's exactly what happened in the first set when neither player faced a break
point as the set went to a pressure-filled tiebreaker, which Safina won 10-8
after fighting off two Chan set points at 6-5 and 8-7.</P>
      <P>The Russian, the sister of men's tennis star Marat Safin, quickly took control
of the second set, playing far more aggessively and keeping Chan on the
defensive.</P>
      <P>She broke Chan in the second and seventh games in winning the set in only 26
minutes, thwarting the Taiwanese 18-year-old's hopes of advancing to the second
round of a grand slam singles event for the first time in her career.</P>
      <P>"I was very satisfied with the way I played in the first set, " Chan would say
later, "but in the second set, Safina went on the attack. I tried to counter her
shots but was always under pressure and couldn't turn the situation around."</P>
      <P>Chan and regular doubles partner Chuang Chia-jung, who have qualified for this
year's Olympic Games and may be the top seeds there, open their doubles campaign
at Wimbledon Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chan clearly has one eye on Beijing, where the doubles final falls on her
birthday, August 17.</P>
      <P>"I'm excited and honored (to have qualified for the Olympics), " Chan said. "I
really want to hold on to the final so I can play on my birthday when I will
definitely have the most luck."</P>

      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Penghu County Council, Wang said that
Penghu does not want just casinos. Rather, it has envisioned developing some
areas into multi-faceted tourist complexes that would include casino resorts,
theme parks, shopping malls, conference centers and exhibition sites.</P>
      <P>Liu-Chen said that President Ma promised publicly during his "thank you" tour of
Penghu April 9 that once the offshore island's residents reach a consensus on
the casino issue, the central government will help to facilitate the plan,
pending legislative approval.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she said, Ma's seemed to have reneged on his promise last week,
when the Council of Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) decided to postpone
the proposed development of casino-related tourism on Penghu, citing a need for
physical planning and assessment.</P>
      <P>"The CEPD's decision not only breaks Ma's campaign promise, it smashes the
dreams of Penghu residents and nullifies their long-term efforts to prepare
Penghu for that type of development, " Liu-Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The Penghu people can't wait any longer!" Liu-Chen shouted.</P>
      <P>In a 2003 referendum that drew a turnout rate of 21 percent, some 57 percent of
the offshore county's residents backed the idea of turning Penghu into a casino-
tourism resort.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over six in 10 toddlers partial to certain foods: study</HEADLINE>

      <P>Six or seven in 10 children between ages 1 and 4 are partial to certain kinds of
foods and they dislike chewy meat and vegetables, among other dishes, according
to a study conducted by the Linkuo Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan
County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pediatrician Chao Shun-chin at the hospital's gastroenterology department said
Wednesday that in a clinical study, it was found that 10-20 percent of toddlers
ages 1-2 tend to eat only what they like.</P>
      <P>Among children ages 2-3, the tendency to show a distinct preference for some
foods was 30-40 percent, while among 3- to 4-year-olds, it was 60-70 percent.</P>
      <P>However, only 50-60 percent of children over 7 years old were were found to be
particular about what they ate, Chao said, concluding that children in the age
group 1 to 4 are more selective about food.</P>
      <P>The research into the diet and growth of 300 children at the hospital, ages 2-4,
showed that the number of those who ate only foods they liked, and were
therefore below average weight, was twice the number of children who were not
particular about what they ate and but were still below average weight.</P>
      <P>The children who were picky eaters were also found to eat more slowly, to be
growing slower and to be less in interested in food than those who were less
particular, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Chao said the study also showed that children under the age of 4 do not like
chicken, beef and the vegetables that require much chewing, and that by the time
they reach 7 years old they have already developed a fixed preference for
certain foods.</P>
      <P>In another study of the dietary habits of 148 children and their parents, the
hospital found that parents who do not observe a balanced diet, who lack
knowledge of proper nutrition and have low incomes often feed their children
snacks or force them to eat foods that lead to poor eating habits.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said at a Wednesday legislative
hearing that there are no regulations prohibiting  Taiwanese  manufacturers
from operating technology licensing in China.</P>
      <P>"Companies that have developed their own technologies and have therefore
acquired technology patents can license such technology to makers in China, "
Yiin said, adding that "such conduct is a purely business activity that will not
suffer interference  from the government."</P>
      <P>His statement was in direct contradiction, however, to complaints from some
lawmakers who pointed out that a number of Taiwanese companies said they have
been blocked from engaging in licensing business with companies in China.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers at the hearing urged the MOEA to deregulate cross-Taiwan Strait
business activities, especially the licensing business in the high-tech industry
that is one of Taiwan's strengths.</P>
      <P>Citing high-tech licensing as a good way of operating business in China, Yiin
said companies could profit from royalties from Chinese companies  who buy
patent  licenses  to facilitate  their own manufacturing.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's administration at present has no regulations governing the
practice of cross-strait licensing.</P>
      <P>Touching on the only exception to such trading, Yiin said companies that develop
technologies with support from the ministry must wait for two years before
investing and trading overseas using such technologies.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the ministry's  Technology Development Program,  which
subsidizes the technology development of local industries</P>
      <P>"The ministry will try to understand the situation and figure out a solution,"
Yiin said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government's failure to include the Kaohsiung International Airport
for the first day of weekend direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services
has disappointed many people in southern Taiwan, Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor
Chiu Tai-san said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu asked why the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) did not arrange for
Kaohsiung's airport to service the charter flights slated to kick off early next
month from the very first day, and accused the CAA of falling short of
delivering on Ma's campaign promise to heed the people's interests in southern
regions.</P>
      <P>Ma promised to make Kaohsiung City a southern Taiwan hub to service returning
Taiwanese businessmen and Chinese tourists, as well as to set up direct shipping
and air transport links between Kaohsiung and major Chinese cities.</P>
      <P>"It is understandable that carriers will have a greater interest in plying the
direct China-bound flights from Taipei or Taoyuan out of concern of operating
costs. However, it is a disappointment for southern Taiwan residents that the
CAA did not include the Kaohsiung International Airport on the first day of the
project," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the tourism advantages, he said, cross-strait weekend charters will
also be useful for allowing the many China-based Taiwanese businessmen to return
home more economically and faster.</P>
      <P>"The CAA's failure to include Kaohsiung City's well-equipped airport in the
cross-strait charter flight service is extremely unfair to the city and people
in southern Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is Taiwan's second-largest city and will start having the direct
charter flights approximately one week later than the other Taiwanese airports
serving the links.</P>
      <P>As the cross-strait weekend charter flights are set to take off July 4, Taiwan-
based aviation companies are keen to operate the charter flights to major
destinations in China such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Nanjing.</P>
      <P>On the first weekend from July 4-July 7, there will be 16 flights from the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to China, 13 flights from Taipei Songshan
Airport and three from Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan, while Hualien
Airport in eastern Taiwan and Makung Airport on the outlying island county of
Penghu will have one flight and three flights, respectively, departing for China
on that day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian's son-in law Chao Chien-ming demanded Wednesday
that a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker apologize over his claim that Chao set
up a company overseas in 2005 for the purpose of laundering money.</P>
      <P>Making the demand through his lawyer, Ku Li-hsiung, Chao said he will take legal
action against Legislator Chiu Yi unless Chiu retracts his unfactual statement
immediately.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Chiu claimed that Chao remitted US$2 million to the British
Virgin Islands in 2005 to establish a company there and that his business
associate, Yu Shih-yi, also set up a company there with US$2 million in the same
year.</P>
      <P>Both companies were disbanded Nov. 24, 2006, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>With both Chao and Yu having been convicted by the Taipei District Court and the
Taiwan High Court of profiteering through insider trading of Taiwan Development
Corp. shares in July 2005, Chiu said he suspects the remittances could have been
illicit gains from the trading.</P>
      <P>However, while admitting that Chao did set up a company in the British Virgin
Islands in 2005 with authorized capital of US$2 million, Ku said the company
actually had only an issued share capital of US$1, meaning Chao had never
remitted the US$2 million overseas as Chiu claimed.</P>
      <P>Ku said Chao had originally intended to invest in a biotechnology business
through the company but decided to close it down the following year after his
indictment in the insider trading case.</P>
      <P>Ku said Chiu's statement was not grounded on facts and has seriously blemished
the reputation of Chao and other members of the former first family.</P>
      <P>In response, Chiu argued Wednesday that it proves his statement was true, since
Chao admitted that he did establish a company in the British Virgin Islands in
2005.</P>
      <P>Chao's claim that he "never remitted US$2 million overseas" is only an excuse to
cover up his guilt, according to Chiu.</P>

      <P>Lin Hwai-min, the founder of the world renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theatre,
announced Wednesday that a tour of his latest work, titled Whisper of Flowers --
the most colorful work of the modern dance group -- will have its global premier
in September in southern Taiwan's Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>@On the same occasion, Lin received the French Literature and Art Cavalier medal
from Jean-Pierre Poimboeuf, director of the Institut Francais de Taipei, on
behalf of the French Ministry of Culture, in recognition of his outstanding
contributions to dance.</P>
      <P>@@Lin said the honor is for all the members, sponsors and audiences of Cloud
Gate, without whom he could not have accomplished the work.</P>
      <P>@@He further described the medal as praise for Taiwanese society for its efforts
in pursuing artistic and cultural life. Whisper of Flowers, which marks Cloud
Gate's 35th anniversary, is a kind of twin story presented along with Moon
Water, a dance first performed in 1998.@</P>
      <P>Whisper of Flowers, described as colorful, bustling, with 800,000 petals
sprinkled on the stage, "is like a preamble to Moon Water, which represents a
silent emptiness in black and white images, " Lin said at a press conference.@</P>
      <P>Sharing the same musical accompaniment -- Bach's cello suites, Moon Water is set
to the adagio version, while Whisper of Flowers uses the allegro version. In
tandem with Whisper of Flowers, two special presentations of Moon Water to be
staged Sept. 29 and 30 will be accompanied by celebrated Russian cellist Mischa
Maisky.</P>
      <P>Whisper of Flowers was inspired by a camellia tree Lin saw in Portugal during a
2007 tour, he said, adding that the sight of the fallen petals on the ground
sparked the idea of producing a dance of color and youth.</P>
      <P>The dance will be staged islandwide in September and October.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, founded by Lin in 1973, was the first modern dance
group in Taiwan. It has performed on international stages and won plaudits from
critics and audiences alike.</P>
      <P>"Unfortunately, it is still the only full-time dance group in Taiwan, " said
Lin, who complained that there is insufficient government support for artists.</P>

      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, June 25 (CNA) As many as 3,400 passengers are expected to fly nonstop
from Taiwan to Mainland China over the July 4-7 weekend, at the forefront of a
historic transportation arrangement that marks a breakthrough in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The weekend direct cross-strait charter flights are scheduled to take off July
4, with a total of 36 flights to be operated by Taiwan airlines and China
carriers.</P>
      <P>According to the five Taiwan-based air carriers that will operate the weekend
charter services, all 18 flights were fully booked, as of Wednesday. This means
that some 3,400 Taiwanese nationals will fly the Taiwan-China route on the
weekend without having to transit in a third destination.</P>
      <P>The launch of the nonstop weekend charter flights was agreed to June 13 in
accords signed in Beijing by Taiwan's quasi-official Strait Exchange Foundation
(SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits Foundation (ARATS).</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest carrier which will operate the first
flight from Taoyuan International Airport (TIA) to Beijing and two others
between TIA and Shanghai, said all its seats were sold out.</P>
      <P>"We at China Airlines will establish official connection with Mainland China
through the launch of the direct flight services," CAL spokesman Bruce P.Y. Chen
told the CNA Wednesday, stressing the the significance of the direct air links.</P>
      <P>Eric Lin, manager of the Public Affairs Division of EVA Airways, another
operator of the charters, said all the seats on EVA's flights from Taoyuan to
Beijing, Taoyuan to Shanghai and Taipei Songshan to Shanghai had been reserved
and that its subsidiary Uni Air was also fully booked.</P>
      <P>In  addition  to  the  so-called  golden  routes  between Taiwan-Shanghai and
Taiwan-Beijing, the flights from Taiwan to Xiamen and Guangzhou were also in
high demand.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines, which will fly its new Brazilian-made jets on the Taichung-
Xiamen-Makung route, said it was extremely excited at the enthusiastic public
response.</P>
      <P>"This is a remarkable moment, " said Irving Hsu, director of the Public
Relations Office at Mandarin Airlines, adding that people are really ready to
fly the nonstop cross-strait route.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways had also been fully booked for its service that will fly the
Songshan- Shanghai, Hualien-Guangzhou, and Makung-Xiamen routes on the coming
weekend.</P>
      <P>Janet So, marketing manager of TransAsia, said she believes that cross-strait
exchanges will see a brighter future, as the direct air links will provide "a
new convenience for passengers."</P>
      <P>Discounting fears that the direct charter flights between Taiwan and China may
squeeze out TaiwanVHong Kong and Taiwan- Macau air services, the airlines said
they have no plans to reduce the number of scheduled flights on those routes.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, there are only 18 flights from Taiwan to the mainland every
weekend -- this will definitely not affect the Hong Kong service," Chen said.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways shared the same view, saying it will maintain its normal Taiwan-Hong
Kong schedule.</P>
      <P>"EVA Airways has no plans to cut down on the frequency of Taiwan-Hong Kong
flights," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Macau is a unique destination that is rapidly developing its tourism
and is worth visiting, So also stressed that TransAsia Airways will not cut its
service to Macau.</P>
      <P>TransAsia plans to focus in the future on its services to central and southern
China, So said, adding that Macau would be good midpoint that would offer
passengers a more flexible choice.</P>
      <P>Once the charter services prove successful, the airlines said, they would all be
prepared to operate daily regular direct flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>" CAL will go to wherever the passengers and commercial interests are," Chen
said.</P>

      <P>Taitung County in southeastern Taiwan, which houses two national parks and is
home to many different indigenous tribes, "is ready" to host Chinese tourists
after they start arriving from July 4, Vice Transportation and Communications
Minister Ho Nuan-hsuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho, who was leading a team of inspectors tasked with screening the safety of
facilities and service quality in various tourist spots around Taiwan, visited
Taitung earlier in the day to conduct safety checks on local hostels and hotels,
restaurants, stores and places where tourists can lease tour buses or ferries.</P>
      <P>The team was organized by the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to engage in an overall inspection of
service quality in potential attractions around the country for Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>In general, Ho said, the team found the county has done well in improving their
tourism resources. For example, some hotels and restaurants have carried out
renovation work, while one tourism center operated by the Taitung County
Farmers' Union was found to have management  with quality so high that it
surprised  the inspectors, Ho said.</P>
      <P>However, there are still some "minor problems" to be fixed, such as fly-filled
restaurants and tour buses that fail to meet safety requirements, Ho said, added
that in general, though, "Taitung is ready."</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government will replace mercury thermometers handed in by
members of the public with free electronic ones Saturday in support of the
central government's banning of the sale of mercury thermometers, a city
government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The activity will be held at the Taipei City Hospital's Yang Ming Branch from 9
a.m. until noon, with 900 electronic thermometers up for grabs,  Taipei City
Department of Environmental Protection Director-General Ni Shih-piao said.</P>
      <P>An official of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) announced
earlier in that day that the sale of mercury thermometers to individual
consumers and non-medical institutions will be banned from July 1, with
violators facing fines of up to NT$6,000 (US$197).</P>
      <P>Ho Soong-chin, director-general of EPA's Department of Waste Management, said
mercury, which is commonly used in measuring devices like thermometers and
barometers, is harmful to the environment.</P>
      <P>Recycling the small amount of the element typically found in thermometers -- 1.2
grams -- is difficult and thus the discarded medical devices are a threat to the
environment, Ho said, adding that the ban is aimed at cutting mercury use.</P>
      <P>Businesses will still be allowed to sell traditional thermometers to medical
institutions until July 1, 2011, Ho said.</P>
      <P>Ni instructed the public that when cleaning up broken mercury thermometers,
instead of using a vacuum or broom, use cardboard or an empty syringe to collect
the mercury, wrap it well and give it to the Department of Environmental
Protection.</P>
      <P>Ni said the free replacement activity is sponsored by three Taiwanese medical
equipment manufacturers -- Omron, Microlife Corp. and Mesure Technology Co.</P>
      <P>After Saturday's activity, the public can also hand in their mercury
thermometers at the Cosmed, Wellcare and Pro Healthcare chain drugstores. They
will not get a free electronic replacement but will get coupons from the three
stores, Ni said.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung City Government is anxiously trying to find a suitable site for
the Hon Hai Group to build dormitories for employees it expects to hire for a
new software investment plan in the largest city in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>City government officials admitted Wednesday that it is difficult to find a plot
of land in southern Kaohsiung to build dormitories to accommodate thousands of
workers.</P>
      <P>There are two prospective choices large enough to facilitate the dormitory
project,  but both have been labeled  by the city government's Environmental
Protection Bureau as "polluted sites."</P>
      <P>One of the sites is a 15,000 square-meter plot formerly used by the Chinese
Petroleum Corp. for its oil storage tanks, and the other is an 85,000-square-
meter site that hosts a disused petrochemical factory.</P>
      <P>Both sites would have to undergo soil treatment before they could be used for
new development projects.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Environmental Protection Bureau have indicated that they may
allow the soil improvement project and the dormitory construction to proceed at
the same time in consideration of the time constraints of the Hon Hai Group's
investment plan.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group Chairman Terry Gou signed a letter of intent with Minister of
Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming in early June to invest in Kaohsiung's software
industry.</P>
      <P>According to Gou, Hon Hai group's Kaohsiung base will be built around
cultivating and upgrading innovation, research, development and design.</P>
      <P>In the first five years of the project, Hon Hai will create some 3,000 jobs for
software engineers, with 520 software engineers to be hired before May 20 next
year -- the planned deadline for the first stage of the project, Guo said.</P>
      <P>Guo's decision to invest in Kaohsiung was made in April after he met with then
President-elect  Ma Ying-jeou and took up Ma's suggestion to set up a software
center in the city.</P>
      <P>Guo told reporters that Kaohsiung could be transformed into a digital content
creation center in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Group is the largest manufacturer of connectors for use in personal
computers in Taiwan, and a leading manufacturer of connectors and cable
assemblies in the world. The company also manufactures enclosures, primarily for
desktop PCs and PC servers.</P>
      <P>The group currently has eight production bases in China. It also has production

one month before Taiwan is expected to open its doors to a significantly larger

arrivals beginning in July.</P>
      <P>"Honesty and credibility are the basic principles in creating a win-win
situation for cross-strait tourism business," said Fan Gui-shan, leader of the
delegation and deputy chief secretary of the Cross-Strait Tourism Association.</P>
      <P>The Cross-Strait Tourism Association is a private organization authorized by the
China National Tourism Bureau to handle cross-strait tourism affairs. The
parallel organization in Taiwan is the Taiwan Strait Tourism and Travel
Association.</P>
      <P>"Only with sincere and honest services can we keep the tourism market
healthy,"Fan said at the seminar that was held for the two associations to
exchange views on pertinent topics. "We must create a stable cross-strait
tourism market -- one that would inspire confidence among tourists, surety among
members of the general public, and ambition among travel agencies to compete
with each other."</P>
      <P>He added that on its visit to 22 counties and cities around the island, the
delegation was very impressed with Taiwans rich tourism resources, various tour
products and modern tourism facilities.</P>
      <P>"We think Taiwan is ready to host Chinese tourists in July and we have great
confidence in the Taiwan tourism market," Fan said. "However, in order to create
a healthy and sustainable market, we need to promote the business in a pragmatic
way."</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-yen, executive secretary-general of the Taiwan Strait Tourism and Travel
Association, said that Taiwan and China share a common goal of forging a closer
cooperative relations and creating a high quality tourism market.</P>
      <P>"It is the goal of travel industry professionals on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to safeguard the quality and build a high-grade tourism market for
consumers," he said.</P>
      <P>The first groups of 600 Chinese tourists are slated to arrive in Taiwan July 4,
mainly from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Fujian.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Private think tank raises forecast for 2008 GDP growth to 4.6%</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The forecast for Taiwan's economic growth through 2008 has been adjusted from
4.32 percent to 4.60 percent, as the economy preformed better than anticipated
in the first half of the year, the Polaris Research Institute, a local private
think tank, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Led by sound export demand, Taiwan's economy is healthier than expected, " said
Liang Kuo-yuan, the president of the research institute.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the 6.06 percent growth rate of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in the first quarter, which was presented as economic growth.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's export destinations are gradually shifting from the U.S. and
European market to emerging economies, including China and Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, where losses resulting from the U.S.
subprime mortgage crisis have been relatively smaller.</P>
      <P>"Also, the anticipated boost in cross-strait economic activities and the
government plan to revitalize domestic market demand will stimulate the local
consumer and investment markets, " Liang said, citing two of the major policies
of the new Kuomintang (KMT) government.</P>
      <P>Hyped by those positive factors, the annual GDP growth forecast was adjusted by
the think tank to 4.60 percent, up from the 4.32 percent predicted in March.</P>
      <P>Citing market demand as the main driver of economic growth in the latter half of
the year, Liang said rising local demand is estimated to contribute as much as
54.68 percent to the overall GDP.</P>
      <P>"Production output to overseas markets could contribute less, representing 45.32
percent, because Taiwan's export revenue is shrinking due to the decline in the
global economy," he added.</P>
      <P>The think tank also revised its March forecasts for the consumer price index
(CPI) from 2.30 percent to 3.44 percent.</P>
      <P>"The soaring prices of international  commodities  and raw materials, along with
the domestic energy and utility price hikes, have put inflationary pressure on
the wholesale price index as well as the CPI," he said.</P>
      <P>The price increases were not just the result of import inflation, Liang said.</P>
      <P>"In the past three months the core CPI has risen more than 3 percent year-on-
year, reaching a nine-year record high, " said the head of the think tank.</P>
      <P>In a bid to ease inflationary pressure, Liang predicted, the central bank would
allow the continued rise in the Taiwan currency, which has appreciated by 6.35
percent since January.</P>
      <P>"We forecast that the Taiwan dollar will hold at NT$30.30 against the U.S.
dollar," he said.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office dismissed as "false" Wednesday a tabloid report which
portrayed President Ma Ying-jeou as "having focused on trivial things instead of
major policy issues" since he assumed office May 20.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi was responding to a report in Next
Magazine, a Chinese-language weekly tabloid, which said Ma has downgraded
himself as a "butler' at the Presidential Office who does not care about big
issues but only focuses on minor matters.</P>
      <P>The magazine, known for its diet of celebrity gossip, stated in its latest
edition that President Ma usually gives attention to minor details such as the
placement of toilet tissue in the bathrooms and the resignation of a security
guard.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said, "such false reporting will only affect the public's
trust in the magazine."</P>
      <P>"The president insists on freedom of the press, but regrets that some media
abuse that freedom for the sake of commercial gain, " he said.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has been attempting to clarify Next Magazine reports almost every
Wednesday, explained that the president has indeed been promoting some measures
aimed at saving energy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>However, these measures are decided by secretary-general or deputy secretary-
general of the Presidential Office, leaving the president free to focus on
important issues, such as national policies, he added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Wednesday upheld the commuted 18-month jail sentence
handed down by a lower court in the case of a woman from China who was charged
with killing her Taiwanese husband in 2006.</P>
      <P>Zhao Yanbing said via her lawyer, Lai Fang-yu, that she will appeal to the
Supreme Court for an acquittal or a delayed prison term. She also urged the
Taipei Public Prosecutors Office not to appeal again to seek a harsher sentence
against her.</P>
      <P>Several women's rights groups, including the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation
and the Awakening Association, held a press conference in support of Zhao
following the High Court ruling, saying that it represented a "giant step
forward" in Taiwan's judicial history in dealing with domestic violence cases.</P>
      <P>Zhao, 54, reportedly endured three years of verbal and physical abuse after she
married Chia Hsin-min in 2003. She finally lost control and stabbed him to death
in February 2006.</P>
      <P>In September last year, the Taipei District Court convicted Zhao of murder and
sentenced her to 18 months in prison for "overdone self-defense."</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the ruling, prosecutors appealed to the Taiwan High Court,
demanding that Zhao be given a harsher sentence. Zhao also appealed the
sentence, seeking an acquittal or a delayed prison term. But the High Court
rejected both appeals and upheld the lower court sentence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan people's rights should not be sacrificed to politics: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>No other "international network" can replace the World Health Organization (WHO)
in coordinating worldwide information on epidemic prevention and control, the
spokeswoman for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday,
suggesting that China should not ignore the Taiwan people's health rights
because of political factors.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh made the remarks in response to media inquiries over
a report that China said it would not sanction Taiwan's admission to the WHO but
would try to build an alternative "international network" for Taiwan to share
information with the countries around the world in the event of an epidemic such
as avian flu.</P>
      <P>China's Taiwan Affairs Office Director Wang Yi reportedly told a group of
Japanese parliamentarians in Beijing Monday that this was Beijing's plan.</P>
      <P>But Yeh suggested that the Geneva-based WHO should make direct contact with
Taiwan on relevant health issues to avoid a leak in the world's quarantine
system for the prevention and control of epidemics.</P>
      <P>In light of the current global situation, Yeh said, it would be best for Taiwan
to gain observer status in the World Healthy Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's highest
decision-making body.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Taiwan has been trying, unsuccessfully, to gain entry to the WHA as
an observer, using its official title the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Taiwan applied for full WHO membership as "Taiwan" for the first time,
but the bid failed due to opposition by China, which claimed that Taiwan is part
of its territory, not a sovereign state, and therefore not eligible to obtain
WHO membership.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that allowing Taiwan to participate in the WHA as an observer would be
the most pragmatic arrangement because whether the island  is tabbed  as a
country,  a political  entity  or a non-governmental organization,  it still
qualifies for observer status.</P>
      <P>The lawmaking bodies in countries like the United States, Japan, Chile and
Lithuania, as well as the European Parliament, have all adopted resolutions in
support of Taiwan's participation in the WHA as an observer, she noted.</P>
      <P>Yeh stressed that Taiwan keeps fighting for accession to the WHO because it
wants to help complete the global epidemic control and prevention network and
strengthen the world's quarantine ability.</P>
      <P>It is out of professional and functional consideration that Taiwan has been
trying to gain entry to the WHO, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Enterovirus outbreak shows signs of subsidence: CDC</HEADLINE>

06/25/08  22:07:46
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's enterovirus outbreak seems to be subsiding after reaching a peak last
week, a senior Department of Health (DOH) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The optimistic forecast is based on a declining number of suspected cases of
severe enterovirus infection reported by local medical institutions in the past
few days, " said Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the DOH's centers for Disease
Control.</P>
      <P>A total of 65 suspected severe enterovirus cases were reported around Taiwan
last week, the highest weekly number so far this year, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>"But the number has declined this week, " Kuo said. From Sunday through
Wednesday, 23 more suspected cases were reported, compared to 41 cases reported
during the same four-day period last week.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that the enterovirus outbreak may have passed its peak
period and is gradually subsiding," Kuo said, adding that if the total suspected
number continues to fall for the rest of the week, it is sure that the disease
situation has begun a reversal.</P>
      <P>As statistics show that 80 percent of suspected enterovirus cases reported by
medical institutions were later confirmed, Kuo said the CDC has decided to
publicize the number of reported cases everyday from Thursday to enhance the
transparency of the disease situation.</P>
      <P>To date, the CDC has only reported the number of confirmed cases. As it takes
much time for virus cultivation and sample testing, some journalists and parents
have expressed concern about the CDC's work efficiency.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the daily reporting of the suspected enterovirus cases will allow the
public to get a better grasp of the latest epidemic situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo said two more severe enterovirus cases were confirmed Wednesday,
bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 247, including eight fatalities,
so far this year.</P>
      <P>Despite the increase in the number of confirmed cases, Kuo said local people
need not panic as the outbreak has been brought under control and will subside
soon.</P>
      <P>"The number of confirmed cases may continue to rise in the near future, but we
are working hard to keep the total number for this year below 300," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of a septic
meningitis and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with
compromised immune systems. The outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this
year and has since spread northward to cover nearly all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated June 10 to
contain further spread of the potentially lethal disease which usually attacks
children aged under 5.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chuan Chi-wan said Wednesday he has been forced
to defer his planned trip on board a maiden charter flight from Kaohsiung City
to Guangzhou in China's Guangdong Province on July 4 because there would be no
such service from the southern port city.</P>
      <P>Chuan said he has decided to put off his Guangzhou trip until July 12, when he
will lead a 40-member group to China to promote Kaohsiung City's tourism.</P>
      <P>A visibly upset Chuan said the Kaohsiung International Airport's exclusion from
the July 4 maiden charter service should not be viewed as a failure by President
Ma Ying-jeou to honor his campaign promise to southern Taiwan residents. Rather
the situation should be ascribed to the carriers' unwillingness to ply the route
because of high operating costs, he said.</P>
      <P>According  to Chuan,  both the mayor  and city government authorities also
failed to take the lead to lobby the aviation companies to include Kaohsiung
City in the cross-strait charter routes.</P>
      <P>Even Makung Airport on the offshore county of Penghu will see maiden charter
flights bound for China on July 4, thanks to the efforts made by its lawmaker
Lin Ping-kun, Chuan noted, adding that members of several religious groups will
take the flights from Penghu to China on the July 4-7 weekend.</P>
      <P>Chuan's remarks marked a noticeable departure from the comments made earlier the
same day by Kaohsiung City Deputy Mayor Chiu Tai-san that the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) should be blamed for having failed to arrange for the
Kaohsiung airport to service some of the charter flights on the very first day.</P>
      <P>Chiu accused the CAA of falling short of delivering on Ma's campaign promise to
heed the interests of the people in the southern regions. He painted the
decision to leave out Kaohsiung as a big disappointment to and unfair treatment
of the people of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is Taiwan's second-largest city and has the country's largest harbor.</P>
      <P>On the first week of the landmark direct cross-strait charters, there will be 16
flights from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to China, 13 flights from
Taipei Songshan Airport and three from Chingchuankang Airport in central Taiwan,
while Hualien Airport in eastern Taiwan and Makung Airport on the outlying
island county of Penghu will have one and three flights, respectively, departing
for China that day.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based aviation companies will operate the charter flights to major
destinations in China such as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Nanjing.</P>

      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien County will use traditional
Chinese therapy during the summer to treat patients with asthma, allergic
rhinitis and other allergic diseases, the Chinese medicine department of the
hospital announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tsung-shun, a Chinese medicine doctor at the department, said the therapy
involves the application of herbal patches at selected acupuncture points on the
patients' bodies during the hottest days of the year.</P>
      <P>The specially prepared herbal paste on the patches is made from a variety of
herbs that can help strengthen the vital "yang" energy when applied to relevant
acupoints, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese medicine holds that the hottest days of the year after the
summer solstice are the best times to boost patients' "yang" energy and
strengthen their immune systems in order to reduce the incidence of these
allergic illnesses in winter.</P>
      <P>According to the Chinese calendar, the three hottest periods of 2008 -- each
lasting 10 days -- will begin respectively on July 19, July 29 and Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Hospital in Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, is one of several
hospitals in Taiwan that use the traditional method to treat patients with
allergic diseases. The other hospitals include the Hsinchu Hospital, the Chi Mei
Medical Center in Tainan and the Kaohsiung Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung hospital claimed last year that it had achieved good results in
treating more than 500 asthma and allergic rhinitis patients using the patches.
Its treatment program was launched based on Chinese medicine literature that
said the method could achieve a success rate of over 80 percent if used for
three consecutive years.</P>

      <P>Three lines of defense will be in place to help ward off spread of diseases by
incoming Chinese tourists, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) ,
made the remarks amid concern for potential public health hazards following the
opening of door to a significantly increased number of Chinese tourists in July.</P>
      <P>"We have set up three lines of defense -- fever screening at airports, Chinese
tour guide reporting and disease reporting by local medical institutions --  to
help prevent spread of contagious diseases," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Among the three measures, only the one that requires Chinese tour guides to fill
out a standard form to inform local health offices and the Tourism Bureau of the
symptoms if any member of their tour groups fall ill during their travel in
Taiwan is especially designed for Chinese tourists, Kuo explained.</P>
      <P>The other two measures -- fever screening at airports and requiring  hospitals
and clinics to report suspected cases of statutory contagious diseases -- have
long been in place as part of the country's epidemic prevention and control
mechanism, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, fever screening at airports -- the main gateway to Taiwan --
have been effective in detecting potential patients of contagious diseases.
"Each year, about two-thirds of imported dengue fever cases were identified
through airport fever screening, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Some people have suggested that Chinese tourists be required to undergo fever
screening and chest X-ray examination before heading for Taiwan, but Kuo said
such a requirement is infeasible and violates the principle of equal treatment.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that our three lines of defense will be effective enough to
avert spread of diseases following the new 'open-door' measures, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Ordinary Chinese citizens will be allowed to visit Taiwan for sightseeing trips
in groups from July 18.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 lines of defense to be in place to ward off epidemics: CDC</HEADLINE>

      <P>Three lines of defense will be in place to help ward off spread of diseases by
incoming Chinese tourists, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) ,
made the remarks amid concern for potential public health hazards following the
opening of door to a significantly increased number of Chinese tourists in July.</P>
      <P>"We have set up three lines of defense -- fever screening at airports, Chinese
tour guide reporting and disease reporting by local medical institutions --  to
help prevent spread of contagious diseases," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Among the three measures, only the one that requires Chinese tour guides to fill
out a standard form to inform local health offices and the Tourism Bureau of the
symptoms if any member of their tour groups fall ill during their travel in
Taiwan is especially designed for Chinese tourists, Kuo explained.</P>
      <P>The other two measures -- fever screening at airports and requiring  hospitals
and clinics to report suspected cases of statutory contagious diseases -- have
long been in place as part of the country's epidemic prevention and control
mechanism, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, fever screening at airports -- the main gateway to Taiwan --
have been effective in detecting potential patients of contagious diseases.
"Each year, about two-thirds of imported dengue fever cases were identified
through airport fever screening, " he noted.</P>
      <P>Some people have suggested that Chinese tourists be required to undergo fever
screening and chest X-ray examination before heading for Taiwan, but Kuo said
such a requirement is infeasible and violates the principle of equal treatment.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that our three lines of defense will be effective enough to
avert spread of diseases following the new 'open-door' measures, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Ordinary Chinese citizens will be allowed to visit Taiwan for sightseeing trips
in groups from July 18.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's enterovirus outbreak seems to be subsiding after reaching a peak last
week, a senior Department of Health (DOH) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The optimistic forecast is based on a declining number of suspected cases of
severe enterovirus infection reported by local medical institutions in the past
few days, " said Kuo Hsu-sung, director-general of the DOH's centers for Disease
Control.</P>
      <P>A total of 65 suspected severe enterovirus cases were reported around Taiwan
last week, the highest weekly number so far this year, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>"But the number has declined this week, " Kuo said. From Sunday through
Wednesday, 23 more suspected cases were reported, compared to 41 cases reported
during the same four-day period last week.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that the enterovirus outbreak may have passed its peak
period and is gradually subsiding," Kuo said, adding that if the total suspected
number continues to fall for the rest of the week, it is sure that the disease
situation has begun a reversal.</P>
      <P>As statistics show that 80 percent of suspected enterovirus cases reported by
medical institutions were later confirmed, Kuo said the CDC has decided to
publicize the number of reported cases everyday from Thursday to enhance the
transparency of the disease situation.</P>
      <P>To date, the CDC has only reported the number of confirmed cases. As it takes
much time for virus cultivation and sample testing, some journalists and parents
have expressed concern about the CDC's work efficiency.</P>
      <P>Kuo said the daily reporting of the suspected enterovirus cases will allow the
public to get a better grasp of the latest epidemic situation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuo said two more severe enterovirus cases were confirmed Wednesday,
bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 247, including eight fatalities,
so far this year.</P>
      <P>Despite the increase in the number of confirmed cases, Kuo said local people
need not panic as the outbreak has been brought under control and will subside
soon.</P>
      <P>"The number of confirmed cases may continue to rise in the near future, but we
are working hard to keep the total number for this year below 300," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of a septic
meningitis and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with
compromised immune systems. The outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this
year and has since spread northward to cover nearly all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated June 10 to
contain further spread of the potentially lethal disease which usually attacks
children aged under 5.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Wednesday upheld the commuted 18-month jail sentence
handed down by a lower court in the case of a woman from China who was charged
with killing her Taiwanese husband in 2006.</P>
      <P>Zhao Yanbing said via her lawyer, Lai Fang-yu, that she will appeal to the
Supreme Court for an acquittal or a delayed prison term. She also urged the
Taipei Public Prosecutors Office not to appeal again to seek a harsher sentence
against her.</P>
      <P>Several women's rights groups, including the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation
and the Awakening Association, held a press conference in support of Zhao
following the High Court ruling, saying that it represented a "giant step
forward" in Taiwan's judicial history in dealing with domestic violence cases.</P>
      <P>Zhao, 54, reportedly endured three years of verbal and physical abuse after she
married Chia Hsin-min in 2003. She finally lost control and stabbed him to death
in February 2006.</P>
      <P>In September last year, the Taipei District Court convicted Zhao of murder and
sentenced her to 18 months in prison for "overdone self-defense."</P>
      <P>Dissatisfied with the ruling, prosecutors appealed to the Taiwan High Court,
demanding that Zhao be given a harsher sentence. Zhao also appealed the
sentence, seeking an acquittal or a delayed prison term. But the High Court
rejected both appeals and upheld the lower court sentence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait dialogue reduces risk of conflicts: Pentagon</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent resumption of dialogue between Taiwan and China has helped lower the
possibility of military conflicts in the Taiwan Strait, a Pentagon official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>James Shinn, assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security
affairs, said the fact that the cross-strait military balance continues to tilt
in favor of China has posed increased dangers in the region.</P>
      <P>However, the likelihood of military clashes has dropped in the wake of the
contact and dialogue that has been taking place between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait since the election of Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou, Shinn said.</P>
      <P>Shinn said he could not jump to any conclusions as to how cross-strait relations
would develop,  but said he thinks the situation has changed.</P>
      <P>Shinn made the remarks while testifying before the House Armed Services
Committee.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, Shinn said many of China's military modernization
developments are relevant to a Taiwan contingency.</P>
      <P>"While we see opportunities on the horizon or a near-term reduction in cross-
strait tension and we encourage both sides to take advantage of them, there is
much more that Beijing can do to support reducing cross-strait tension,
demonstrate flexibility with respect to Taiwan's international space and to
reduce the threat to Taiwan presented by the People's Liberation Army's
sustained military build-up opposite the island," Shinn said.</P>
      <P>Shinn said the United States will watch closely for signs of steps by China to
shift that balance further and will encourage Beijing to work with Taiwan on
more positive actions to reduce tensions.</P>
      <P>He noted that China has at least 10 types of ballistic missiles deployed or in
development,  including  over 1,000 short-range ballistic missiles deployed at
garrisons opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, China is establishing new missile bases outfitted with conventional,
theater-range missiles that could support a variety of contingencies  across
China's  periphery,  including  maritime anti-access, with a new anti-ship
ballistic missile, according to Shinn.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Manufacturers maintain cautious outlook amid uncertainties</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall business climate improved in May with the electronics industry
entering its peak export season, but almost half of all local manufacturers held
a reserved outlook for the latter half of the year, according to the results of
a survey released by an economic research unit Thursday.</P>
      <P>The monthly survey of Taiwan's business climate conducted by the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER) showed that in May, 46.7 percent of
respondents from the manufacturing sector had a reserved outlook for the next
six months, up from the 44.5 percent who held that view in April.</P>
      <P>"The continued rise in the price of international raw materials and commodities
has trimmed the revenues of some local makers, " said TIER President Dr. David
Hong, suggesting that this was the main factor contributing to the uncertain
sentiment in the manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>The survey also indicated a decline in the percentage of makers who held a
positive outlook for the latter half of the year, from 35.5 percent to 33.5
percent from April to May.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  the  May  business  climate  index  for the manufacturing sector
was higher than that of April by 3.18 points, buoyed to 110.02 by an improved
outlook among Taiwan's strongest industries, including electronics and steel,
which are entering the peak export season in the second half of the year, said
Hong.</P>
      <P>The index  rose amid bearish  sentiment  because,  in its calculations, TIER
tends to give greater weight to results from the electronics and steel
industries than their share of Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) -- 35
percent and 9.8 percent respectively -- might justify.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's service providers  were slightly more upbeat than manufacturers. The
business climate index for the service sector in May rose to 122.31 points, up
from April's 121.84.</P>
      <P>"The boost in the retail and hospitality industry, which resulted from the
Mother's Day shopping season, helped sustain the outlook for the local service
sector in the face of a recent decline of the local bourse, " said Chen Miao,
the head of TIER's Marcro-Economic Forecasting Center.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the expected influx of Chinese tourists and the launch of weekend
direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait -- both coming on stream in July
-- would brighten the local business climate, Hong was cautious in his forecast.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that such measures would stimulate local market demand while
cutting down on the operation costs for makers across the strait," Hong said.
"However, further evaluations and studies are needed to evaluate the real
impact" of the initiatives, he added.</P>
      <P>He suggested that a survey of all areas of local business could be conducted  to
determine  whether the new Kuomintang  (KMT) government's  China policies can
truly bring positive economic effects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's bid to join WHA necessary and pragmatic: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
06/26/08  14:28:59

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that Taiwan's bid to
participate in the World Health Organization (WHO) , especially to gain observer
status in the World Health Assembly (WHA), is necessary and pragmatic, and China
should understand the Taiwanese people's wish to have more space in the
international community.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary for Taiwan to establish direct contact and interaction with the
WHO, and only by, at least, becoming an observer in the WHA can the rights of
the 23 million people in Taiwan be safeguarded," said Lin Yung-le, director-
general of MOFA's Department of International Organizations, at a regular press
briefing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a Kyodo News report that Wang Yi, the head of
China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), had told several Japanese congressional
visitors Monday that China would never agree to Taiwan joining the international
health body.</P>
      <P>The report also cited Wang as saying that China would try to establish a new
framework so that, in the event of an epidemic, Taiwan would be able share
information with the rest of the world via an alternative "international
network."</P>
      <P>Lin, who has just been appointed as vice foreign minister, stressed that the
government has not altered its determination to participate in international
organizations and to expand its space in the international community. He added
that regarding the expansion of international relations, Taiwan will adopt the
principles of dignity, autonomy, pragmatism and flexibility.</P>
      <P>"We hope China, based on pragmatism, will try to understand the wishes and
thoughts of the 23 million people in Taiwan and adopt a more rational and
flexible way to deal with the issue of Taiwan's participation in international
organizations," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said the foreign ministry will look into the exact wording and meaning of
Wang's statement as the report did not quote him directly. Also, Lin said, it
was not clear what was meant by "another international network," as reported.</P>
      <P>He noted that the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR), which was
implemented in 2007, is the most comprehensive mechanism for global public
health security.</P>
      <P>"Judging  from the current  situation,  there is no other international network
that can replace a platform like the IHR," Lin said. "We think that in Taiwan's
best interests, the most appropriate approach would be to directly participate
in the WHO mechanism and build direct connections with its secretariat."</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's main objective in seeking to join the WHO is to gain observer
status in the WHA based on professional and technical concerns.</P>
      <P>"China should not brush aside the basic health rights of the 23 million people
in Taiwan for political reasons," he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying, unsuccessfully, to become an observer in the World
Health Assembly -- the WHO's highest decision-making body -- under its official
title, the Republic of China, since 1997.</P>
      <P>Last year, it applied for full WHO membership as "Taiwan" for the first time,
but the bid failed again due to opposition by China, which claimed that Taiwan
is part of its territory, not a sovereign state, and therefore not eligible to
obtain WHO membership.</P>
      <P>The WHA decided May 19 not to put the Taiwan issue on the general assembly's
agenda although 17 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had submitted a motion
urging the WHA to grant observer status to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Thursday another death caused by
enterovirus, bringing to nine the total number of fatalities from the viral
infection so far this year.</P>
      <P>The latest victim was a four-month-old girl in the southern county of Yunlin,
who was hospitalized June 17 one day after she displayed symptoms typical of
enterovirus infection, including fever, hand-foot-and-mouth  syndrome  and
vomiting,  said  CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw.</P>
      <P>The baby's condition worsened abruptly June 20, as she developed severe
complications such as jerky limb movements, rapid heartbeat, and pulmonary
hemorrhage,  followed by reduced heartbeat  and difficulty breathing, Chou said.
The child died the same day despite three hours of emergency treatment, he
added.</P>
      <P>The results of specimen tests indicated that the infant was infected with
enterovirus type 71 (EV71), Chou said.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the baby could have contracted the virus from other children
who had visited her family's home recently.</P>
      <P>From the start of this year to Thursday, 260 cases of severe enterovirus
infection have been recorded nationwide, nine of which were fatal and 32 still
hospitalized, he said.</P>
      <P>CDC data shows that almost all serious enterovirus cases recorded this year were
caused by EV71 -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- and most of the infected
patients were under the age of 5.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a serious EV71 outbreak this year, the CDC recently issued a
directive stipulating that kindergartens, daycare centers and elementary schools
must suspend classes for 10 days whenever two or more enterovirus infections are
reported in the same class within one week.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in infants. EV71 is one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-
and-mouth syndrome and is sometimes associated with severe central nervous
system diseases.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a severe outbreak of EV71, with 405 children
infected, 78 of whom died. Another EV71 outbreak in 2005 saw 145 children
infected, 15 of whom died.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President appoints Jason Yuan as representative to the U.S.: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Thursday that the president has
officially appointed Jason Yuan as Taiwan's representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office officially accepted the resignation of former
representative Joseph Wu and designated Jason Yuan as the new representative to
the United States," said MOFA spokeswoman Phoebe Yeh.</P>
      <P>She said Yuan is slated to return to Taiwan in early July and will take up the
post in mid-July after being sworn in.</P>
      <P>Yuan  has  been  the Kuomintang  and People  First  Party representative to the
United States since 2004.</P>
      <P>Before retiring from the foreign service in January 2004, Yuan had served as the
R.O.C. ambassador to Panama, director-general of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) in Los Angeles, and chief of the Congressional Liaison
Division at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press briefing earlier in the day, Yeh said that the
Executive Yuan has revoked the appointment of Chang Chiang-sheng, a close aide
of former Foreign Minister James Huang, as deputy representative to Malaysia due
to Chang's involvement in a controversial case of diplomatic fraud.</P>
      <P>"As Chang is central to the Papua New Guinea case, he will have to continue to
assist the prosecutors in clarifying the facts, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Chang was one of the few persons with access to
information on Taiwan's secret diplomatic endeavors and the last Taiwan official
to have seen Ching Chi Ju, a middleman who allegedly made away with US$29.8
million in aid funds that were supposed to have been used to establish
diplomatic ties with Papua New Guinea.</P>
      <P>The transfers of Chang and Donald Lee, former director-general of the MOFA's
Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, were suspended in May.</P>
      <P>Lee, however, assumed office as representative to the Philippines June 22, as he

    <HEADLINE>Gov't should use tax surplus to refund taxpayers: DPP chairwoman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said that
the government should have enough money to pay refunds to taxpayers in one
stroke, as it had recorded a revenue surplus in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>In response to a call by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan for rational thought on whether
the government should grant tax rebates to all citizens if it is in debt, Tsai
told the media Wednesday that the government does not necessarily need to borrow
money to grant the refunds as it has a tax revenue suplus.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after the DPP legislative caucus proposed Tuesday that half
of the government's NT$116.6 billion (US$3.8 billion) special budget, allocated
to spur domestic demand, should be used to pay out tax refunds.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that amid surging consumer goods prices and rising cost of living, her
party hopes the Kuomintang government will use the tax surplus to refund
taxpayers and to subsidize disadvantaged groups so as to help maintain the
purchasing power of low- and middle- income families.</P>
      <P>She also said that the government's economic stimulus package, aimed at
expanding domestic demand by providing funds to help local governments complete
infrastructure projects, is unlikely to yield results in the short run.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question raised by Liu on why the former DPP government opted
not to give the public tax refunds during its eight years in office, Tsai said
that the DPP administration did not face serious inflation or rapidly rising
commodity  prices.  Policy formulation generally relies on a number of factors,
including the economic situation, she told reporters after a DPP meeting in the
southern county of Chiayi.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that the government may not need to borrow money to give tax
refunds, as it has many other financial sources. However, she cautioned,
granting tax refunds is a short-term subsidy measure, and the government should
come up with long-term and comprehensive policies to cope with inflation.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh also said the tax refund measure will not cause
inflation and will help to alleviate some social problems.  When the
government's tax revenues increase due to inflation, there was no reason to deny
taxpayers a refund, he added.</P>
      <P>The government revenue surplus for last year was estimated at NT$70 billion,
according to DPP legislative  caucus whip Ker Chien-ming, who suggested the
money be used to provide public tax refunds.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan passed a package of regulations Thursday to allow the Chinese
currency to be traded in the form of cash in Taiwan, and decided to begin
conversions between the yuan and New Taiwan dollar June 30.</P>
      <P>Beginning Monday, banking institutions and foreign currency exchange posts will
be allowed to apply for the right to handle such currency exchanges, Executive
Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin Sun-yuan, deputy director of the Central Bank's Department of Foreign
Exchange, said the new service was formed to meet an expected need of Chinese
tourists visiting Taiwan for NT dollars in cash.</P>
      <P>The move will provide a legal channel for Chinese tourists, more of whom will be
allowed to visit Taiwan for sightseeing from July 18, to sell their yuan for NT
dollars, Lin said.</P>
      <P>On July 4, Taiwan will launch weekend direct charter flights between Taiwan and
mainland China, marking a historic new chapter in Taiwan-China exchanges after
direct air links between the two sides were severed in 1949 following a Chinese
civil war.</P>
      <P>Currently, only a maximum 1,000 Chinese tourists are allowed to visit Taiwan
each day, but the number will be raised to 3,000 after July 4, and eventually to
10,000 a day.</P>
      <P>Lin said everyone, not only Chinese tourists, will have the right to buy and
sell yuan in Taiwan but each person is limited to selling a maximum of 20,000
yuan at one time, noting that this is a "short-term" strategy.</P>
      <P>In the long run, the government will continue talks with Chinese authorities
through its semi-official intermediary body, the Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) , on the issue of building a cross-strait currency clearance mechanism to
"normalize  and systemize" the clearance of Taiwanese and Chinese currencies,
Lin noted.</P>

knighthood rendered by the Ministry of National Education of France.</P>
      <P>Jahn Bor-ming, a distinguished research fellow at Academia Sinica, received the
honorary title for his academic and educational contributions both to France and
Taiwan, according to Institut Francais de Taipei, the French representative
office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jahn was also praised for the France-Taiwan collaboration on seismology that he
headed for over two decades, which led to the creation of the first Associated
International Laboratory between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Order of the Academic Palms is a French order of chivalry created by
Napoleon to honor eminent members of the University of Paris. In 1866, the scope

      <P>The Maokong Gondola is expected to carry its 5 millionth passenger aloft soon,

the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The gondola's passenger volume is expected to break the 5-million barrier this

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan ready to trade ETFs with Hong Kong</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>06/26/08  18:18:16
(By Yeh Fang-hsun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ETF is an investment vehicle traded on primary exchanges, similar to major
stocks or bonds, but with the advantages of low transaction costs and a more
diverse stock portfolio that could minimize investment risks.</P>
      <P>Such funds provide easier access for foreign investors to evaluate local stocks,
facilitating inflows of foreign capital to local bourses and companies.</P>
      <P>Currently Taiwan restricts any form of global funds that contain Chinese
investments. The Cabinet's decision will enable some of the global funds, which
contain Chinese capital but are managed by neutral, independent fund managers,
to invest in Taiwan stocks.</P>
      <P>The relaxed cross-strait securities investment initiative will also include
opening ETFs trading between Taiwan and Hong Kong, allowing Hong Kong listed
companies to list in the Taiwan exchange, and permitting local securities
investment companies to invest in China.</P>
      <P>"These measures altogether will help Taiwan attract international capital for
long-term investment, while facilitating local securities investment companies
to operate business overseas," Susan Chang, vice chairwoman of Taiwan's
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said at a press conference following the
Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>"There are already some Taiwan investment companies showing great interest to
issue ETFs and list the stocks in the Hong Kong Exchange, " Chang added.</P>
      <P>She said the commission expects the first arrival of ETFs trading in Hong Kong
within the next six months after the deregulations take effect, with estimated
share values of NT$3 billion (US$98.6 million).</P>
      <P>As for subsequent procedures to finalize the ETFs trading plan, the vice
chairwoman said Taiwan has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
with Hong Kong to execute bilateral securities investment.</P>
      <P>"Only an additional agreement on information exchange regarding risk management
will be needed to make such trading workable," she stressed.</P>
      <P>The MOU previously signed between FSC and Hong Kong's Securities and Futures
Commission does not obligate either side to provide the information that could
potentially hurt the interest of ETFs holders.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possibilities of investing Chinese securities companies, Chang
said the legal restraints have been removed, "except for an MOU to be signed
with China to finalize the direct investment agreement."</P>
      <P>She said at present local securities companies could still invest in Chinese
securities companies by investing in Hong Kong stocks and securities.</P>

      <P>Most health problems experienced by people in Asia are related to being
overweight or obese, with 47 percent of sufferers having tried to lose weight
for their health, according to the results of a survey released Thursday by
Reader's Digest.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the magazine among more than 19,700 subscribers in
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, India and the Philippines.
Forty percent of the respondents were in the 30-49 age group.</P>
      <P>While only one fifth of respondents thought they were very healthy, the most
common health problems mentioned by the rest of the respondents were
hypertension, high cholesterol levels, eyesight problems, diabetes and being
overweight or obese, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Among  Taiwanese  respondents,  55  percent  suffered  from hypertension, 35
percent were overweight or obese, 34 percent had diabetes, and 27 percent had
high cholesterol levels.</P>
      <P>Liu Tsan-hung, a physician specializing in weight control at Taipei Medical
University-Wan Fang Hospital, noted that hypertension, high cholesterol levels
and diabetes are all indirectly related to being overweight or obese.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, besides their increasingly Westernized diets, decreased
exercise among Asian people is another major cause of the rise in the overweight
and obesity rate among the region's population.</P>
      <P>Among Asians who developed  metabolic  syndrome because of being overweight or
obese, the risk of them suffering from diabetes are five times as high as
others, and Asia is home to 55 percent of the world's diabetes patients, Liu
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the risk  of people  with  metabolic  syndrome experiencing a stroke
is three times as high as others, and their risk of suffering from
cardiovascular disease is three to five times as high, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He said medical literature shows that overweight or obese people need only to

      <P>A delegation from the Taiwan-based Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation
is visiting cyclone-hit areas in Myanmar to gauge the reconstruction needs
there, a Tzu Chi spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tropical Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar hard May 2-3, causing at least 90,000 deaths
and leaving some 56,000 people missing.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the Tzu Chi delegation visited Myanmar soon after it
obtained permission on June 14 from the Myanmar government to participate in the
country's rehabilitation efforts. The Myanmar ruling junta has been criticized
internationally for its slow response to the disaster and its restrictions on
foreign aid workers.</P>
      <P>The delegation is the third sent by the Tzu Chi Foundation to the cyclone-hit
areas in Myanmar since the disaster occurred in early May.</P>
      <P>In addition to assessing  the rehabilitation  task in the devastated areas, the
Tzu Chi volunteers also distributed relief goods and offered free medical
services to the people there.</P>
      <P>To date, three Tzu Chi teams have distributed relief supplies or provided
medical assistance to 5,000 Myanmar families, with some 20,000 people benefiting
from the aid efforts.</P>
      <P>"Defying the unstable weather and the rainy season in Myanmar, Tzu Chi
volunteers have been helping the survivors to deal with the problems of food
shortage and a possible outbreak of contagious diseases, and are studying the
possibility of helping construct temporary houses and schools," the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>"Through sign language, Tzu Chi workers have bridged the gap with Myanmar
survivors, and are hoping that their material and moral support would at least
temporarily help the Myanmar people forget the pain caused by the disaster," the
spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi, a non-profit organization founded in 1966 by Dharma Master Cheng Yen,
has gained prominence because of the relief aid it provides in many corners of
the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foundation's missions of charity, medical care, education and
cultural development, Tzu Chi volunteers have also been deeply committed over
the years to education on recycling.</P>

      <P>The outlying county of Penghu will launch a series of bird-watching activities
in July to give bird watchers a chance to observe the terns on many of Penghu's
uninhabited islets, one of the organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh Li-chin, president of the Wild Bird Society of Penghu, five
groups of bird watchers will be allowed to visit the islets from July 5- Aug.
17, and they will be accompanied by ornithologists who will provide professional
commentary.</P>
      <P>The county is located in the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and China --about 50
km from Taiwan and 140 km from China. Known for its sandy beaches, basalt rocks,
and blue skies, the county is home to an abundance of marine resources and is
favored by many migrating sea birds.</P>
      <P>The major species of terns seen in Penghu include brown noddy, bridled tern,
roseate tern, little tern, and greater crested tern, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the wildbird society's planned activities will not only allow bird
watchers to get close to the terns, but will also serve as a great opportunity
to visit some of the county's uninhabited islets.</P>
      <P>Only 18 of the county's 90 islets are inhabited and visitors rarely have an
opportunity to explore the uninhabited isles as there is no regular
transportation service there, she said.</P>
      <P>The wildbird  society  usually holds various  bird-watching activities when the
terns migrate to the islets for breeding in summer.</P>
      <P>This year, three groups of bird watchers will head to the southern islets, while
the other two will go north, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The bird-watching itineraries also include trips to the island's famous basalt
rock coast, Yeh said, adding that interested persons can sign up by phone at

      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi would not comment Thursday on recent
foreign news reports that quoted China's top official in charge of Taiwan
affairs as saying China would never accept Taiwan becoming a member of the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Wang said the Presidential Office is still verifying a Kyodo News report that
quoted Wang Yi, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, as telling several
Japanese congressional visitors Monday that "China would never accept Taiwan
joining the international health regulatory body formally."</P>
      <P>The report cited Wang Yi as saying that China would try to establish a separate
framework so that in the event of an epidemic, Taiwan would be able to share
information with the rest of the world via an alternative "international
network."</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi said the Presidential Office is also verifying another source of the
report.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office would not comment on the allegations before verifying
the sources," said Wang Yu-chi.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Affairs Office spokeswoman Fan Liqing said Wednesday that she
could not verify what Wang Yi meant by his remarks Monday.</P>
      <P>However, Fan added that as cross-strait talks have resumed, "all these problems
can be discussed and resolved."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying unsuccessfully to become an observer in the World Health
Assembly -- the WHO's highest decision-making body -- under its official title
the "Republic of China" since 1997.</P>
      <P>Last year, it applied for full WHO membership as "Taiwan" for the first time,
but the bid failed again due to opposition by China.</P>
      <P>The WHA decided May 19 not to put the Taiwan issue on its annual assembly's
agenda although 17 of Taiwan's 23 diplomatic allies had submitted a motion
urging the WHA to grant observer status to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China considers Taiwan a province awaiting reunification and objects to the
island joining international groups whose members consist of countries, such as
the United Nations and its affiliates.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's new President Ma Ying-jeou has been inaugurated on May 20,
Taiwan and China have entered into a new phase of strengthening relations, such
as by increasing Chinese tourists allowed to the island and allowing direct
weekend charter flights. Ma has repeatedly expressed hopes that Beijing will
give Taiwan more international space.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Diplomatic truce does not mean suspending work: MOFA spokesman</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 26 (CNA)
06/26/08  19:05:49
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Henry Chen, who
took office Thursday, said that the policy of observing a "diplomatic truce"
means avoiding conflict, not putting all diplomatic work on hold.</P>
      <P>"The basic concept of a diplomatic truce is to avoid conflict (with China) in
the international diplomatic arena and to create a win-win situation," Chen said
at his first reception for members of the media.</P>
      <P>He said the general public has a "misunderstanding" of the MOFA's approach
because many of Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou's thoughts on his diplomatic
policies has not been fully explained and a diplomatic truce is one course that
is misunderstood.</P>
      <P>"A diplomatic truce does not mean we do nothing. Rather, it means that we do not
expend too many resources on things that would create conflict with each other,"
Chen said. "The foreign ministry's top priority will be to advance the existing
relations with our diplomatic allies."</P>
      <P>He added that the expansion of bilateral and multi-lateral relations in
international organizations is also an important task of the foreign ministry.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who took office May 20, has been calling for a
"diplomatic truce" with China, adopting a more pragmatic and reconciliatory
approach in his foreign and cross-Taiwan Strait policies.</P>
      <P>Asked about a Kyodo News report that Wang Yi, the head of China's Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO), had told several Japanese congressional visitors Monday that China
would never agree to Taiwan joining the World Health Organization, Chen said
that as the source and exact wording of the report are not available at the
moment, the foreign ministry cannot comment on the statement.</P>
      <P>He, however, reiterated that "dignity, autonomy, pragmatism, flexibility" and
prioritizing the health and welfare of the 23 million people in Taiwan are the
basic principles on which Taiwan hopes to participate in the WHO.</P>
      <P>Making a bid for entry on the basis of professional and technical concerns can
win the understanding of other countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had served as the spokesman and director-general of the MOFA's
Department of Information and Cultural Affairs from 1999 to 2001, said that many
of the MOFA's problems since the new administrat ion took office have resulted
from a lack of information.</P>
      <P>"I will seek more opportunities for Foreign Minister Ou to communicate his
thoughts on the ministry's diplomatic efforts so that the general public will
have a better understanding of its work," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged to serve as a bridge between the MOFA and the media to convey
the ministry's policies precisely and to provide the most accurate and up-to-
date information.</P>
      <P>"I cannot promise to give exclusive reports to specific media, but I promise
that no members of the media will be left out," the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>A platform dedicated to distributing free technological products donated by big
companies to non-profit and non-governmental organizations has been established
in Taiwan, the Taiwan-based Frontier Foundation announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The platform is part of Techsoup, a non-profit organization founded in 1987 in
San Francisco to provide assistance to non-profit organizations in the United
States. It began to provide technological assistance worldwide six years ago in
order to enhance the organizations' service quality for unprivileged people.</P>
      <P>Techsoup  receives computer hardware and software from big information and
technology companies, and distributes them to non- governmental organizations in
accordance with their needs.</P>
      <P>So far, 31 world-known IT companies have participated in the platform, including
Microsoft, Cisco, Symantec, Adobe and Flickr. By the end of March 2008, more
than 70,000 organizations in the world have benefited from Techsoup's services.</P>
      <P>As the platform is just being launched in Taiwan, Taiwanese companies and NGOs
have not yet participated as donors or recipients.</P>
      <P>"Finances (to buy technological equipment) is one of the most important
difficulties for domestic non-governmental and non-profit organizations'
operation, " said Wang Jin-pyng, president of the Legislative Yuan, said in a
statement issued at a press conference.</P>
      <P>He added that Techsoup and the Frontier Foundation's work will help
organizations in Taiwan to provide better services.</P>
      <P>"The platform  offers opportunity  for us to connect with technology companies
in Taiwan," said Antony Chiang, business systems architect of the Techsoup,
encouraging more local companies to join the platform and donate hardware and
software.</P>
      <P>Already two companies, the American Microsoft, which provides 166 software for
application, and Canadian Bytes of Learning, joined the platform just launched
in Taiwan, said Tsai Shu-fang, the chief executive of the foundation.</P>
      <P>With the platform, social resources can be distributed more efficiently,  and
non-profit organizations'  cost on technology products can be reduced, said the
foundation in a statement.</P>
      <P>Non profit organizations can file applications on the website ( http:
//Techsoup-taiwan.org.tw/) to receive donated legal software with a small amount
of administration fees.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP accuses China of deceiving Taiwan people over WHO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  26  (CNA)
06/26/08  19:11:06
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative caucus members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
accused China Thursday of deceiving the Taiwan people regarding their
international health rights, and suggested that Taiwan government officials
should step down if they are unable to protect the country's interests.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers, including Yeh Yi-jin and Kuan Pi-ling, made the comments at a
Legislative Yuan news conference.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao's promise -- during a meeting in Beijing with
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung in June -- to give Taiwan
more international space was surely a lie, as China is seeking to block Taiwan's
health rights through exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO), the
lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>Yeh and Kuan were referring to a reported comment by China's Taiwan Affairs
Office Director Wang Yi to a group of Japanese parliamentarians in Beijing
Monday that China was trying to create an alternative framework for Taiwan to
share global public information in the event of an epidemic.</P>
      <P>Wang was quoted in a foreign wire service report as saying that China will not
accept Taiwan's official admission to the WHO.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Wang mentioned the WHO's International Health Regulations
(IHR), with which Taiwan is already compliant.</P>
      <P>Even though it is not a signatory to the IRH, Taiwan adopted the regulations in
2006 on the recommendation of countries such as the United States, Japan some
European Union nations. Yeh said that in light of this fact, the statement by
the Chinese official was an attempt to deceive the Taiwanese people concerning
their critical health rights, Yeh claimed.</P>
      <P>Kuan said Wang's remarks were tantamount to a slap in the face for President Ma
Ying-jeou, who during his election campaign called for a diplomatic truce with
China.</P>
      <P>Ma's efforts to cater to China would lead to Taiwan ending up as an exclusive
part of China, she argued.</P>
      <P>"If Minister of Foreign Affairs Francisco H.L. Ou and Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan cannot stand up to Beijing and speak out for Taiwan,
then they should resign," Kuan contended.</P>
      <P>DPP public relations department director Cheng Wen-tsan said Wang's comment
proved that Ma's call for an end to the diplomatic war with China has failed to
gain a positive response from Beijing and that Hu's promise regarding Taiwan's
WHO membership bid was merely a lie.</P>
      <P>As China has repeatedly turned a blind eye to the Taiwan people's health rights
and the country's epidemic prevention needs, it is clear that Taiwan's
engagement with China cannot replace its efforts to improve ties with other
countries and to upgrade its national defense, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Seventy eight children died from enterovirus in 1998 when there was an outbreak
in Taiwan, which had no access to WHO information, he recalled.</P>
      <P>Ten years later, enterovirus has staged a comeback in Taiwan, and the country
needs even more comprehensive information from the WHO to combat related
diseases, he said.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan is ready to embrace as many as 3,000 Chinese tourists per
day starting July, the government has fallen short of putting relevant
quarantine inspection measures in place, Cheng said, warning that the imminent
entry of larger numbers of tourists from China might bring epidemics and
contagious diseases into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since 1997, Taiwan has been trying unsuccessfully to gain entry to the World
Health Assembly as an observer, using its official title the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Last year, the country applied for full WHO membership under the name "Taiwan"
for the first time, but the bid failed again because of China's objection.</P>

      <P>Comprehensive relief work after a natural catastrophe covers four phases --
rescue, prevention of epidemics, psychological counselling and reconstruction,
said Huang Jow-song, chief executive officer of the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation, one of the most active non-governmental organizations that assists
physically challenged people.</P>
      <P>"People should not focus only on the first two phases, as excessive resources
may lead to waste," Huang said at a press conference, stressing that the most
difficult task for people in disaster areas is to reconstruct their lives after
aid dries up.</P>
      <P>For example, in Deyang, one of the hardest-hit cities in Sichuan province, at
least 60,000 people have been disabled due to the earthquake, and they need
physical and mental rehabilitation, he said.</P>
      <P>To provide training for rehabilitation work, the foundation will launch a
"working holiday" program, inviting senior students in Taiwan studying medicine
and other relevant disciplines to serve in Sichuan's disaster areas during the
summer vacation, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The foundation also plans to donate assistive devices, establish a social
resources platform and offer psychological counselling.</P>
      <P>"Due to the weak economy, caused by commodity and fuel price increases,
donations to our foundation have dropped by 18 percent in the past two months, "
said Huang, urging people to continue to show concern for the survivors in
Sichuan.</P>
      <P>The 8.0-magnitude Sichuan earthquake on May 12 killed 69,180 people, according

    <HEADLINE>Former presidential aide gets nine years in prison for taking bribes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court sentenced a former senior aide to ex-President Chen Shui-
bian Thursday to nine years in prison for taking bribes while serving as deputy
secretary-general at the Presidential Office in 2002.</P>
      <P>The high court also ruled that Chen Che-nan, 67, be deprived of his civil rights
for six years.</P>
      <P>The high court's ruling represented a commuted sentence from a 12-year jail term
and 10-year suspension of civil rights that was imposed on Chen by the Taipei
District Court in December 2006.</P>
      <P>The high court cited evidence that Chen received NT$6 million (US$197,270) from
businessman Liang Po-hsun in 2002 and promised to use his job influence to
settle two court cases involving Liang.</P>
      <P>While noting that Chen remained unrepentant, the high court indicated that it
had commuted the sentence in consideration of his age.</P>
      <P>The High Court acquitted Chen of a separate insider trading charge involving
shares of Chih Kan Technology Co.</P>
      <P>Liang, 52, the chief witness in the case against Chen, is a former vice chairman
of the Bank of Overseas Chinese. He was sentenced by the Taiwan High Court to
one year in prison in November 2002 for using his influence to borrow NT$5.3
billion illegally from several branches of the bank through dummy accounts in
1996-1997.</P>
      <P>Liang was also sentenced to one year and two months in prison in a separate case
in January 2003 for committing forgery in real estate deals while he was
chairman of the Hsinchiehchung Construction Co.</P>
      <P>Liang fled abroad in March 2003 shortly after he filed an appeal for a deferred
prison sentence. While at large in China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Africa, he
disclosed that Chen had accepted NT$6 million from him but had failed to fulfill
his promise to get him off the legal hook.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to stem Liang's anger, Chen later returned NT$3 million
to Liang via a friend, but Liang insisted that Chen must give back the other
NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>Liang was brought to justice when he returned to Taiwan from Hong Kong in April
2006. He voluntarily submitted evidence to the prosecutors to prove that Chen
had accepted two checks totaling NT$6 million from him in return for an empty
promise that he would be acquitted in court.</P>
      <P>Chen can still appeal the ruling in the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>Local government heads will have more opportunities to visit China from early
July, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Te-shun said that the issue concerning the relaxation of
restrictions on visits by city and county heads to China is under discussion
among local administrators, as well scholars and experts in cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is expected to give the green light to the relaxation on July
3, one day before the launch of the long-expected weekend direct cross-strait
charter flights, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, local government heads will be allowed to visit China
so long as their trips are related with city or county affairs and bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, many local government heads, including Keelung Mayor Chang Tung-
jung, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen, Changhua County Magistrate Cho
Po-yuan and Miaoli County Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung, gathered at the MAC for
talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>Some of them disclosed after the meeting that a common consensus was reached
that elected local administrators should be subjected to existing regulations on
public functionaries' visits to foreign countries when they apply for permission
to visit China.</P>
      <P>After returning home, they also have to file a special report about their trip
to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The issue came under the media spotlight after the MAC rejected an application
by Taichung Mayor Jason Hu to travel aboard the maiden weekend direct cross-
strait charter flight from the central city of Taichung to China.</P>
      <P>The council had explained that the processing of Hu's application would take at
least one month.</P>
      <P>The plan to ease such restrictions had been in the works for the past two years
but it was not until this week that the MAC decided on feasible revisions.</P>

      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday she hopes Beijing can face squarely
and pragmatically the reality of the relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lai made the remarks after Wang Yi, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office
(TAO), reportedly told Japanese congressional visitors Monday that China will
never accept Taiwan formally joining the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>However, Wang added that China will set up a new framework so that Taiwan can
use this "international network" outside the WHO to share global health
information when it is hit by avian flu or other epidemics, according to a Hong

      <P>The report did not elaborate on the "international network" or how it will work.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus
said Thursday that special taxes should be levied on goods imported from China
if Taiwan has no choice but to import such products.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chang Hua-kuan said the DPP opposes the Kuomintang (KMT)
administration's decision to allow black beans to be imported from China from
July, a decision that she said "might drive Taiwan's farmers into a tight
corner."</P>
      <P>Chang said at a news conference that the KMT guaranteed prior to the March 22
presidential election that it would not open Taiwan's doors to 831 categories of
agricultural products from China if it were to win the election.</P>
      <P>However, it has reneged on its words now that an Executive Yuan task force
responsible for stabilizing commodity prices has decided that from July 1,
Chinese black beans will be allowed to be imported into Taiwan, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DPP does not think the KMT government should allow Chinese farm
products to be imported at a time when oil and other major commodity prices are
soaring while the stock market continues to slide.</P>
      <P>"If imports of Chinese farm products are unavoidable, these imports should be
levied with special taxes, with the revenue generated used to subsidize domestic
farmers, " Chang said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi seconded Chang, saying that the government should be
considered a "government of tyrants" if it allows imports of agricultural
products upon which domestic farmers' lifelines hinge without giving any
consideration of their interests.</P>
      <P>"Opening Taiwan's doors to the 800-odd categories of Chinese agricultural
products is tantamount to giving away several billion NT dollars-worth of
Taiwanese agricultural products to China, " Lee claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the day "substandard" Chinese products begin to flood Taiwan
is the day when hard days for Taiwanese farmers will begin.</P>
      <P>"All agricultural imports must be supervised by the legislature and the
Executive Yuan should not be allowed to plot behind closed doors any longer,"
Lee said.</P>

      <P>The director  of the Tainan city government's health bureau issued a public
written apology in a statement Thursday for a gaffe related to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Hu Shu-chen described the entire incident as being caused by
her careless slip and she urged the media not to overreact to her words.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, caucus members of the ruling Kuomintang in the Tainan
City Council demanded that Hu and Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair give an explanation of
the issue and apologize.</P>
      <P>The controversy began when Hu, in response to questions from a councilor during
an intepellation session Monday about the city's measures to prevent the spread
of contagious diseases as larger numbers of Chinese tourists will begin visiting
Taiwan from July, replied that the municipal authorities will "disinfect the
places where Chinese tourists have passed through."</P>
      <P>Hu's reply sparked widespread criticism and some unlicensed radio stations in
southern Taiwan that support the opposition "pan-green camp" even quoted her
words in their programs.</P>
      <P>Claiming that her words about disinfection had "nothing to do with Chinese
tourists," Hu said she did not expect the matter to become so complex and
apologized for her words.</P>
      <P>As a "healthy city" certified by the World Health Organization, Tainan keenly
welcomes visitors from around the world, including China, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the municipal authorities have stepped up disinfection in all
tourist spots throughout the city amid the current peak season of enterovirus.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the municipal health bureau also issued a statement voicing regret
over the incident and stressed that its disinfection efforts are aimed at
fending off the spread of the influenza virus at the city's scenic spots.</P>

      <P>A gold museum in northern Taiwan's Taipei County will begin a variety of metal
artifact workshops Saturday for the public, as part of the museum's annual
activities to promote gold crafting and local tourism, an activity organizer
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Tsen-yi, acting director-general of the Gold Ecological Park, said the
workshops will be held on weekends from Saturday to Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>Participants will learn how to pan for gold and make their own accessories,
chopsticks and ornaments with gold or other metals, Shih said.</P>
      <P>They can also join other workshops or seminars at local artists' studios and
attend an artifact fair that is held by artists and local residents in an old
street near the museum, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>The museum is also featuring an exhibition on gold coins from around the world
that opened Tuesday and will run until next January, Shih noted.</P>
      <P>The museum is located at Chinkuashih in Taipei County's Juifang township.</P>
      <P>Together with neighboring Chiufen, Chinkuashih was a gold and copper mining area
until the 1960s. During World War II, it was also one of Asia's most notorious
prisoner of war camps, where hundreds of Allied POWs were worked to death in the
mines by their Japanese captors.</P>
      <P>The two places are now popular tourist spots for their natural views and the
history of the area's mining industry.</P>
      <P>The museum opened in late 2004 to preserve the industry's culture and introduce
the township's ecological resources to visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central bank raises key rates to curb inflation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
06/26/08  21:10:14

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Bank of China (CBC) decided Thursday to raise its three key
interest rates for the 16th straight quarter by 12.5 basis points each, in a bid
to ease inflation.</P>
      <P>The CBC board of directors raised the key rates -- the discount rate, the rate
on accommodation with collateral and the rate on accommodation without
collateral -- by 0.125 percentage points each to 3.625 percent, 4 percent and
5.875 percent, respectively, effective June 27.</P>
      <P>"With the surging prices of global energy and raw materials, alongside domestic
gasoline and electricity price hikes, the central bank is obliged to curb the
inflation," Central Bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said at a Thursday press
conference announcing the decision.</P>
      <P>Perng said the CBC has adjusted its domestic consumer price index (CPI) forecast
for this year to 3.25 percent, a huge jump from the previous estimate of 2.1
percent. "It is one of central banks major responsibilities to stabilize
consumer prices," Perng noted.</P>
      <P>The CBC governor also said, however, that 70 percent of Taiwan's inflation comes
from import inflation, which has been imposed by global imports rather than by
an imbalance in local supply and demand.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, in addition to rising interest rates, upgrading energy efficiency
and productivity could be other possible means of tackling the inflation," Perng
said.</P>
      <P>Responding to concerns over Taiwan's economic growth, which could be undercut by
the rises in interest rates, Perng said Taiwan's economy will continue to hold
despite a slowdown of the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>"According to official tallies, the economic forecast for this year could reach
4.78 percent due to the country's exporting strength and the government's plan
to expand public construction," he said.</P>
      <P>Using another tool to cool inflation, the board of directors decided to trim
money stocks in the local market by hiking the required reserve ratios on NT
dollar demand deposits and NT dollar time deposits by 1.25 percentage points and
0.75 percentage points, to 11.025 percent and 5.75, respectively, which will
take effect July 1.</P>
      <P>M2 is the broad money supply stocked in a capital market, including currency in
circulation plus demand deposits. Raising required reserve ratio forces the bank
to take back some of the money it has invested in the market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's banks will take as much as NT$200 billion (US$6.58 billion) out of the
market," predicted Perng, adding that the central bank's estimated target zone
of annual M2 growth rate has been adjusted downward -- 2 percent to 6 percent
from the previous 3 percent to 7 percent.</P>
      <P>With M2 growth remaining at an appropriate level, the board's decision to raise
required reserve ratios will enhance the CBC's reserve money management and
guide the liquidity of money stocks downward, the board said.</P>
      <P>Following a CBC board meeting in March, the annual growth rate of demand
deposits dropped from minus 1.35 percent to minus 1.43 percent in May,
indicating that the central bank has been successful in reducing the currency
liquidity.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu Mayor Lin Jung-tzer's performance ratings on three criteria have topped
those of all other leaders of counties and major cities in Taiwan, according to
the results of a survey released by the Global View Magazine Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin received a top "five star" rating in terms of mayoral performance, the
second time he has won the No. 1 spot in this criterion for two consecutive
years.</P>
      <P>In terms of mayors' and magistrates' contributions to economic growth in cities
and counties, Lin was rated top among all local government chiefs, with a 79.2
percent approval rating from Hsinchu residents.</P>
      <P>Lin also took the No. 1 spot in terms of residents' "sense of pride," according
to magazine pollsters.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted April 22-May 22, with valid samples from 10,560
respondents. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Informed of the survey results, Lin attributed his "three-way win" to his
government's policy of "always trying to meet the people's needs."</P>
      <P>He also attributed the achievements to his policies of not imposing "local
taxes" and of providing a city environment that is as convenient as possible for
residents.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu, with a population of around 400,000 is not only known as a garden city

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local survey has found that mothers with high education and income appear to
suffer greater stress than other mothers whose social and economic status is
relatively lower, an official of the Bureau of Health Promotion said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The bureau released the results of the survey it conducted from July 2005 to
July 2006 among families with a baby born after 2005.</P>
      <P>A total of 21,648 mothers were interviewed by bureau personnel at their homes,
representing an interview rate of 87.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The results show that mothers who graduated from university or higher
educational institutes and have a salary of over NT$70,000 per month suffered
from greater time and mental stress, as well as the stress of social contact.</P>
      <P>Huang Wei-kang, head of the women and children care department at the bureau,
said the stress might be a result of mothers' higher expectations toward their
children.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the percentage  of local mothers who described themselves as under
stress caring for their children was found to be higher than that of foreign
mothers.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, this might be related to the fact that most foreign mothers
are full time housewives, while most local mothers have to divide their time
between home and work.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the percentage of stressed mothers who have access to
friends or relatives willing to listen to them and offer support when they are
in low spirits was much lower than that of mothers without support.</P>
      <P>Huang concluded that sharing housework among family members and having someone
to talk to are the keys to reducing a mother's stress, and she noted that the
government has prepared various measures to help reduce mothers' stress in
caring for infants,  including establishing community baby care networks around
the country and offering parental leave to working mothers.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou received an approval rating of 48.2 percent for his
performance one month after he assumed office May 20, according to the results
of a government poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the results of the poll, conducted by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission June 23-24, with 1,095 valid samples and a
margin of error of 2.96 percentage points, also show that 34.5 percent of the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A controversial lawmaker from a tiny opposition party will be incarcerated for
illegal possession of firearms, according to a verdict issued Thursday by the
Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The court, which has final appellate jurisdiction on criminal cases, upheld a
Taiwan High Court second retrial ruling issued in February that sentenced
Legislator Yen Ching-piao to three years and six months in prison for illegally
possessing submachine guns and pistols during his tenure as a member of the now-
defunct Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>The Taichung branch of the Taiwan High Court sentenced Yen to a combined 11
years and six months Feb. 12 -- eight years for a corruption charge and three
years and six months for the firearm possession conviction. The sentence was two
years shorter than one handed down by the same court in a previous trial.
According to the retrial verdict, Yen will also be stripped of his civil rights
for six years after serving his prison term for the corruption charge.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's verdict, the Supreme Court demanded that the High Court return a
new ruling on the corruption charge in which Yen was accused of having illegally
used up to NT$20.6 million (US$677,632) in public funds to entertain guests at
night clubs during his stint as Taichung county council speaker from October
1998 to December 2000.</P>
      <P>Yen, a key figure in the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, which maintains friendly
ties with the ruling Kuomintang, said he was caught off-guard by the Supreme
Court ruling because he was found not guilty of the firearm possession charge in
the first retrial and prosecutors did not appeal that ruling.</P>
      <P>Yen said he will not flee from justice and will definitely serve his sentence in
accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>He was re-elected as a lawmaker with a high proportion of the vote in the
central county of Taichung in January. Without being stripped of his civil
rights for the firearms conviction, Yen can retain his legislative seat during
his time behind bars.</P>
      <P>Noting that the crime was committed before 1998, Yen said he believes he will be
granted parole after serving one-third of his term. Moreover, the period for
which he was detained during the investigations can be deducted from the prison
term. As a result, Yen said, he might be released in slightly more than a year
to continue his legislative tenure, which will not expire until Jan. 31, 2012.</P>
      <P>Yen was found guilty of both corruption and firearm charges by the Taichung
District Court and then by the High Court in the first retrial. After the High
Court verdict, he appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, which sent the cases
back to the High Court for a new retrial that concluded with the Feb. 12 guilty
verdicts. Yen then appealed to the Supreme Court, hence Thursday's verdict.</P>
      <P>The corruption charge has not yet been finalized and Yen still has leave to
appeal on that count.</P>

      <P>The government is still in deficit, even though its tax revenues have exceeded
its targets for the last four consecutive years, and is therefore not in a
position to offer tax rebates, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement came in response to a proposal by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) that the government should pay out refunds to taxpayers
as it recorded a revenue surplus over the last two years.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers have urged the Kuomintang (KMT) government to follow South Korea
in launching a tax rebate plan rather than earmarking  funds  for local
government  to complete  certain infrastructure projects, which they claimed
will increase inflation or be abused for partisan gains.</P>
      <P>The government had budget surpluses of NT$16.6 billion (US$546 million) and
NT$79.6 billion in 2006 and 2007, respectively, the Finance Ministry said.</P>
      <P>However, the government was still in deficit in those years after its special
budgets were taken into account, the ministry explained.</P>
      <P>The government will have an estimated deficit of NT$184.7 billion this year,
according to the ministry, while the amount of debt the government has yet to
pay off has reached NT$3.9 trillion.</P>
      <P>The government also has huge expenditures on social welfare, which amounts to
NT$300 billion every year, the ministry went on.</P>
      <P>Other major expenditures such as national defense and education are not fully
covered by existing government funds, the ministry continued, adding that as a
result, it would be difficult for Taiwan to adopt South Korea's tax refund move.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ministry said, the government has launched many tax reduction
and subsidy measures in an economic stimulus package aimed at expanding domestic
demand and stabilizing consumer prices.</P>
      <P>The measures, which are designed to serve the same purpose as South Korea's tax
rebate plan, will reduce people's financial burdens or increase their incomes,
according to the ministry.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau has expressed hope to China that charter flights carrying the
first group of Chinese tourists to Taiwan July 4 can be divided into six
subgroups for landing respectively at six different airports designated to
service the cross-Taiwan Strait weekend nonstop flights to ensure the airports
have equal opportunities in providing services, a tourism official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai, China has expressed
willingness to cooperate in the arrangement under which each group will arrive
at a different airport.</P>
      <P>The six airports are Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan
Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung Airport in central Taiwan, Hualien Airport
in eastern Taiwan, Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan, and
Magong Airport in outlying Penghu County.</P>
      <P>Those whose flights land in central and southern Taiwan will take the high speed
trains for a welcome dinner in Taipei City, while those whose flights land in
other places will be given welcome dinners at local restaurants, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The outlying Kinmen Airport, which is also on the list, will not offer the
services until a later date, while the airport in the eastern county of Taitung
did not receive applications from any airlines to use its facilities, according
to Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng.</P>
      <P>The Chinese tourists to arrive in Taiwan July 4 will be led by Shao Qiwei,

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou received an approval rating of 48.2 percent for his
performance one month after he assumed office May 20, according to the results
of a government poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, the results of the poll, conducted by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission June 23-24, with 1,095 valid samples and a
margin of error of 2.96 percentage points, also show that 34.5 percent of the
respondents are displeased with Ma's first-month performance.</P>
      <P>Ma garnered some 58 percent of the March 22 presidential vote, a decisive
victory over his rival, Frank Hsieh of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who was appointed by Ma, received an approval rating of
43 percent and a disapproval rating of 38 for the same period, the results show.</P>
      <P>Forty-two percent of the respondents said they were pleased with the overall
performance of the Cabinet, while 39 percent expressed dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>The results also show that 59.6 percent believe the Cabinet is working hard to
realize the election campaign pledges made by Ma.</P>
      <P>A majority of the respondents were optimistic about the future under the Ma
administration, with 66.1 percent predicting that the Cabinet will perform
better in the future and 63.4 percent expressing confidence about the
government's performance over the coming year.</P>
      <P>In addition, 79.7 percent of the respondents, the highest approval rating in the
poll, said they recognize the Cabinet's efforts in improving relations between
Taiwan and China, which were strained under the previous pro-Taiwan independence
DPP government over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>This highest rating was followed by 66.8 percent who described the Cabinet as
"thrifty, " 62.3 percent who regard it as "valuing democracy and rule of law, "
53.9 percent who deem it "professional" and 53.8 percent who said they view it
as "corruption-free. "</P>
      <P>Moreover,  45.2 percent said they perceive the Cabinet as "seriously boosting
the economy, " 44.8 percent consider it to "care about culture and education, "
44.1 percent see it as "having the guts to reform, " while 42.2 percent regard
it as "listening to grassroots voices."</P>
      <P>Another 38.7 percent believe the Cabinet is "protecting the environment, " while
35 percent said the Cabinet "has achieved administrative efficiency," according

    <HEADLINE>Controversial lawmaker to be jailed over firearm possession</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
06/27/08  11:03:32
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A controversial lawmaker from a tiny opposition party will be incarcerated for
illegal possession of firearms, according to a verdict issued Thursday by the
Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>The court, which has final appellate jurisdiction on criminal cases, upheld a
Taiwan High Court second retrial ruling issued in February that sentenced
Legislator Yen Ching-piao to three years and six months in prison for illegally
possessing submachine guns and pistols during his tenure as a member of the now-
defunct Taiwan Provincial Assembly.</P>
      <P>The Taichung branch of the Taiwan High Court sentenced Yen to a combined 11
years and six months Feb. 12 -- eight years for a corruption charge and three
years and six months for the firearm possession conviction. The sentence was two
years shorter than one handed down by the same court in a previous trial.
According to the retrial verdict, Yen will also be stripped of his civil rights
for six years after serving his prison term for the corruption charge.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's verdict, the Supreme Court demanded that the High Court return a
new ruling on the corruption charge in which Yen was accused of having illegally
used up to NT$20.6 million (US$677,632) in public funds to entertain guests at
night clubs during his stint as Taichung county council speaker from October
1998 to December 2000.</P>
      <P>Yen, a key figure in the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, which maintains friendly
ties with the ruling Kuomintang, said he was caught off-guard by the Supreme
Court ruling because he was found not guilty of the firearm possession charge in
the first retrial and prosecutors did not appeal that ruling.</P>
      <P>Yen said he will not flee from justice and will definitely serve his sentence in
accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>He was re-elected as a lawmaker with a high proportion of the vote in the
central county of Taichung in January. Without being stripped of his civil
rights for the firearms conviction, Yen can retain his legislative seat during
his time behind bars.</P>
      <P>Noting that the crime was committed before 1998, Yen said he believes he will be
granted parole after serving one-third of his term. Moreover, the period for
which he was detained during the investigations can be deducted from the prison
term. As a result, Yen said, he might be released in slightly more than a year
to continue his legislative tenure, which will not expire until Jan. 31, 2012.</P>
      <P>Yen was found guilty of both corruption and firearm charges by the Taichung
District Court and then by the High Court in the first retrial. After the High
Court verdict, he appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court, which sent the cases
back to the High Court for a new retrial that concluded with the Feb. 12 guilty
verdicts. Yen then appealed to the Supreme Court, hence Thursday's verdict.</P>
      <P>The corruption charge has not yet been finalized and Yen still has leave to
appeal on that count.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government still in deficit: Finance Ministry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is still in deficit, even though its tax revenues have exceeded
its targets for the last four consecutive years, and is therefore not in a
position to offer tax rebates, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement came in response to a proposal by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) that the government should pay out refunds to taxpayers
as it recorded a revenue surplus over the last two years.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmakers have urged the Kuomintang (KMT) government to follow South Korea
in launching a tax rebate plan rather than earmarking  funds  for local
government  to complete  certain infrastructure projects, which they claimed
will increase inflation or be abused for partisan gains.</P>
      <P>The government had budget surpluses of NT$16.6 billion (US$546 million) and
NT$79.6 billion in 2006 and 2007, respectively, the Finance Ministry said.</P>
      <P>However, the government was still in deficit in those years after its special
budgets were taken into account, the ministry explained.</P>
      <P>The government will have an estimated deficit of NT$184.7 billion this year,
according to the ministry, while the amount of debt the government has yet to
pay off has reached NT$3.9 trillion.</P>
      <P>The government also has huge expenditures on social welfare, which amounts to
NT$300 billion every year, the ministry went on.</P>
      <P>Other major expenditures such as national defense and education are not fully
covered by existing government funds, the ministry continued, adding that as a
result, it would be difficult for Taiwan to adopt South Korea's tax refund move.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ministry said, the government has launched many tax reduction
and subsidy measures in an economic stimulus package aimed at expanding domestic
demand and stabilizing consumer prices.</P>
      <P>The measures, which are designed to serve the same purpose as South Korea's tax
rebate plan, will reduce people's financial burdens or increase their incomes,
according to the ministry.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau has expressed hope to China that charter flights carrying the
first group of Chinese tourists to Taiwan July 4 can be divided into six
subgroups for landing respectively at six different airports designated to
service the cross-Taiwan Strait weekend nonstop flights to ensure the airports
have equal opportunities in providing services, a tourism official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai, China has expressed
willingness to cooperate in the arrangement under which each group will arrive
at a different airport.</P>
      <P>The six airports are Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Taipei Songshan
Airport in northern Taiwan, Taichung Airport in central Taiwan, Hualien Airport
in eastern Taiwan, Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan, and
Magong Airport in outlying Penghu County.</P>
      <P>Those whose flights land in central and southern Taiwan will take the high speed
trains for a welcome dinner in Taipei City, while those whose flights land in
other places will be given welcome dinners at local restaurants, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The outlying Kinmen Airport, which is also on the list, will not offer the
services until a later date, while the airport in the eastern county of Taitung
did not receive applications from any airlines to use its facilities, according
to Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng.</P>
      <P>The Chinese tourists to arrive in Taiwan July 4 will be led by Shao Qiwei,
director of China's National Tourism Administration and will be coming from
Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou and Nanjing. Shao will visit Taiwan in his
capacity as head of a quasi-official cross-strait tourism promotion association.</P>
      <P>The tour group members will include Chinese tourism officials, journalists,
travel agency representatives and ordinary tourists.</P>
      <P>The six groups are at the forefront of a historic agreement on weekend direct
cross-strait  charter flights to be offered by Taiwanese and Chinese carriers.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct weekend charter flights was agreed upon June 13 in
accords signed in Beijing by Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits.</P>
      <P>About 3,400 Taiwanese passengers are also expected to use the flights to travel
to China over the July 4-7 weekend.</P>

including Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin

    <HEADLINE>Mass whooping cough infection reported in Taipei County</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County health authorities confirmed Thursday a case of mass whooping
cough infection involving three 14-year-old junior high school students in
Sijhih City.</P>
      <P>The first patient was diagnosed in late May, followed by two of her classmates
who tested positive for the disease in June, according to officials of the
county's Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>The officials said the cases are rare because all three victims had been
inoculated against the disease during babyhood and whooping cough is more common
among children under 6 years old than those in other age groups.</P>
      <P>According  to Centers  for Disease  Control  (CDC)  Deputy Director-General Chou
Jih-haw, the infections could have been caused by decreasing protection from the
whooping cough immunization, and he said the government is planning to provide
booster shots against whooping cough for children during the first year of
elementary school to strengthen their immunity.</P>
      <P>At present, children in Taiwan are given four vaccinations for whooping cough,
or pertussis, at the age of two months, four months, six months and 18 months,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the implementation of a pertussis inoculation program over the past 40
years, infections have been decreasing, with only sporadic cases reported since
1977, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 pertussis infections were recorded around Taiwan in 2006, all of
which involved infants under 1 year old with the exception of one case in which
a 9-year-old was infected.</P>
      <P>Whooping cough is a highly contagious disease caused by the bacterium bordetella
pertussis, which is spread by contact with airborne discharges from the mucous
membranes of infected people.</P>
      <P>The disease can be deadly, with most fatalities occurring in young infants who
are either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated.</P>
      <P>Pertussis  in infants and young children  is characterized initially by mild
respiratory infection symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and runny nose. After
one to two weeks, the cough changes character, with an increase in coughing
followed by an inspiratory "whooping" sound.</P>
      <P>As most infected adults and adolescents have residual immunity from previous
infection or immunization, they may display milder symptoms, such as a prolonged
cough without the other classic symptoms of pertussis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation  of food  industry representatives organized by the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) arrived in Toronto Thursday to promote
Taiwanese food products.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Trade Office in Toronto held a trade meeting that same day to bring
Taiwanese food producers and local retailers together to give them the
opportunity to sign deals.</P>
      <P>The delegation included representatives of various food industry associations,
including the Taiwan Confectionary, Biscuit and Floury Food Industry Association
and the Taiwan Regional Association of Frozen Vegetable and Fruit Manufacturers.</P>
      <P>It also included representatives of 18 leading Taiwanese food manufacturers,
including Uni-President Enterprises Corp., Ten Ren Tea Co., Yeou Bin Food
Industry Co. and Young Sun Frozen Foods Co., who promoted snack foods, health
foods, frozen fruit and vegetables, organic food, cookies, noodles, condiments
and a variety of other Taiwanese products.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Trade Center invited major food importers in the provinces of Quebec
and Ontario, as well as leading supermarkets and retailers, including Loblaws,
Sobeys, Metro and Wal-Mart Canada, to take part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, Canada's food retail market amounts to about
C$100 billion (NT$300.7 billion) per year, with Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro
enjoying a combined 53 percent share of the market.</P>
      <P>Thursday's trade meeting brought together 46 food industry businesses from
Taiwan and Canada, and about 150 one-on-one meetings to discuss potential deals
were held through the course of the day.</P>
      <P>Kevin Wei, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in Toronto, said that demand for
Asian food products has risen in the local market in recent years with the
steady increase in the Asian immigrant population.</P>
      <P>Major supermarkets have responded to this demand by selling a greater variety of
Asian food products, he went on, adding that this, coupled with consumers'
greater concern for food safety and the reputation for safety enjoyed by
Taiwanese food products gives great opportunities for Taiwanese food
manufacturers to grab a larger share of the Canadian market.</P>
      <P>In 2007, Canada imported more than C$40.43 million (US$39.97 million)-worth of
food products from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wei noted that TAITRA holds some 30 trade fairs in Taipei City each year,
including the Taipei International Food Show.</P>
      <P>This year's Taipei food fair, held at the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang
Exhibition Hall June 18-21, attracted a record-high 768 food manufacturers
manning 1,609 booths.</P>
      <P>A total of 27 national pavilions were set up at the fair, including a Canadian
one that represented 34 food manufacturers displaying a variety of Canadian food
and beverage products, ranging from ice wine, maple syrup and blueberries to
beef and health foods.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three to five typhoons are likely to hit Taiwan this year, close to the number
recorded annually over the past five years, a Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Teh-jung, director of the CWB's Weather Forecast Center, 26 to
29 tropical cyclones are projected to form in the western part of the north
Pacific Ocean this year, compared with the 30-year average of 26.6.</P>
      <P>The projected number of tropical cyclones for this year is slightly higher than
average mainly because of a La Nina phenomenon that appeared in February this
year, which has pushed the sea-surface temperature in the central Pacific Ocean
lower than average and that of the northwestern Pacific Ocean relatively higher,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the Equatorial
Pacific, compared to El Nino, which is characterized by unusually warm ocean
temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific.</P>
      <P>So far this year, six tropical cyclones have formed west of the north Pacific
Ocean, which is also higher than the average number of 4.5 recorded during the
January-June period over the past 30 years, Wu said.</P>
      <P>CWB data show that an average of 3.1 typhoons hit Taiwan per year. Losses caused
by typhoons and heavy rains amount to more than NT$17 billion per year on
average, accounting for 85 percent of all damage due to climatic disasters.</P>

      <P>The accumulated rainfalls in the Kaohsiung area in southern Taiwan reached
1,083.2 mm as of Thursday in June, marking the largest volume of rain the region
has gotten in that month over the past 80 years, according to a Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) report released Friday.</P>
      <P>The rainfalls in Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County have accumulated to 1,169.2
mm as of Thursday from the beginning of May -- the start of the rainy season in
Taiwan, representing an increase of 594.1 mm from the average level, and more
rain is expected for the rest of the month, the CWB's Weather Forecast Center
Director Wu Der-yuan said.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters that June rainfalls in the Kaohsiung region broke the historic
record of 1,082.4 mm in 1997, and the third largest volume was registered in
2005 at 1,030 mm.</P>
      <P>The CWB report pointed out that during the rainy season between May and June
this year, southern Taiwan received more rain than the east. In Hualien in
eastern Taiwan, the accumulated rainfall recorded was only 210.8 mm in the two-

      <P>Rainfalls in other parts of Taiwan during the rainy season were all near the

    <TEXT>
      <P>An old Catholic church in Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung has raised
enough money to give the 150-year-old structure a facelift thanks to the
compassion shown by Pingtung residents, said parish priest Ruben Mardinec.</P>
      <P>Mardinec, who has served at Wan Chin Basilica since 1999, offered his
appreciation to Pingtung County residents for their compassionate donations that
totaled NT$764,000 (US$25,132) -- enough to help the church foot the NT$1.9
million bill for the project.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung County Department of Culture assisted Wan Chin Basilica last year
in applying for a grant for the project from the Cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>The Council agreed to provide NT$1.136 million in funds to the church in
accordance with regulations governing subsidies to historic sites for renovation
purposes. Wan Chin Basilica is rated a grade three historic site.</P>
      <P>The Department of Culture and the church then launched a fundraising campaign in
April to make up the balance needed for the project.</P>
      <P>Having raised NT$764,000, the church can begin whitewashing the church's walls,
restoring them to their original look when the structure was built 150 years
ago, said an official with the Pingtung County Department of Culture.</P>
      <P>The fundraising campaign "was not just a matter of money, " said Mardinec, who
saw compassion and caring for others.</P>
      <P>"The donors were probably not rich, not Catholics and more of them were school
kids who had probably sacrificed a lunch, their snacks or spending on game
parlors for the church, " said a thankful Mardinec in perfect Taiwanese dialect,
which he has picked up over the past 19 years living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mardinec, who first arrived in Taiwan from Spain in 1989 to serve parishes in
Kaohsiung and Tainan, was made an "honorary citizen of Pingtung County" by
Pingtung County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung April 18, when the fundraiser was
launched, in honor of his contributions to cultural and religious development in
the county.</P>
      <P>Among his many contributions, Mardinec compiled ancient tunes that have been
vocally handed down by the Pingpu indigenous people living near Pingtung and
recorded them on a CD that he gave away to churchgoers.</P>
      <P>He has also distributed free lunch boxes to homeless or poor elders, according
to Tsao's office.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The international non-profit organization World Vision urged the public Friday
to make a long-term commitment to helping the people in Myanmar and China's
Sichuan Province, noting that rehabilitation is a very long process that takes
years.</P>
      <P>It is easy to rebuild houses and restore roads and bridges but it is not easy to
help people regain their livelihood and make it sustainable, " said Watt
Santatiwat, senior vice president of World Vision International's Asia Pacific
region, at a seminar on disaster relief and reconstruction in Sichuan and
Myanmar.</P>
      <P>Tropical Cyclone Nargis hit Myanmar hard May 2-3, causing at least 100,000
deaths and leaving tens of thousands missing. China's Sichuan Province was
devastated by an 8.0-magnitude earthquake May 12 that killed over 70,000 people,
left 20,000 missing and disrupted the lives of 46 million others.</P>
      <P>Santatiwat said that as the emergency phase continues, World Vision is now
transitioning to reconstruction work, and over the next 30 months it will put
US$25 million into rehabilitation in Myanmar. In addition to the 53 child
centers already there, 20-30 more will be built to accommodate 15,000 children,
he added.</P>
      <P>"The uniqueness of World Vision is that we are not only a disaster relief
organization, but we are mainly a development organization, " he said. "We work
in poor countries and disaster areas, with a commitment to bringing long-term
well-being to people."</P>
      <P>In a reference to the theme of the seminar, Seeing Hope, Santatiwat said that
"hope is not a casual, one-time response. We would like to bring sustainable
hope to the children, their parents and communities."</P>
      <P>"It is a comprehensive response that requires a long-term investment," he added.</P>
      <P>Thomas  Chan,  CEO of World Vision China,  said that the organization responded
quickly to the disaster in Sichuan, providing quilts,  tarpaulins,  residential
tents,  school  tents  and child-friendly kits to the hardest-hit areas.
However, he said, psychological rehabilitation is the most urgent work.</P>
      <P>"We have built several  Child-Friendly  Spaces to continue children's education
and address their psycho and social needs through recreational activities," Chan
said.</P>
      <P>He announced that World Vision will provide US$35 million for a relief  and
rehabilitation  project  to build 50 schools,  15 dormitories,  6,000 houses,
and 7 clinics and to restore the livelihood of the local people.</P>
      <P>Dean Hirsch, CEO of World Vision International, expressed his gratitude
especially to the people of Taiwan for the generous help they provided to the
people in Sichuan.</P>
      <P>The quick  response  and generous  donations  of Taiwanese entrepreneurs and the
general public to assist in disaster relief following the May 12 Sichuan temblor
was warmly praised by people in China.</P>
      <P>"We believe every child has the right to be a child and to experience a peaceful
life and a life of harmony, " Hirsch said. "Our world will be better if we take
care of our children."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Local bourse hit by worries over interest rates, tight liquidity</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market plummeted again Friday, with investors spooked not only by
an overnight slide on Wall Street but also by hikes in interest rates and bank
reserve ratios announced Thursday that they fear could slow the country's
economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's benchmark index fell 263.04 points, or 3.37 percent, to close at
7,548.76 points, on turnover of NT$122.48 billion (US$4.01 billion).</P>
      <P>The decline followed the setback in Thursday's  Dow Jones industrial average,
which lost 358.41, 3.03 percent to close at 11,453.42, the lowest level since
September 2006, on worries of crude oil prices surpassing US$140 a barrel and
projected weakness in second quarter earnings.</P>
      <P>One market watcher believed Friday's fall in the Taiex was also related to moves
by Taiwan's central bank a day earlier.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the shock from the U.S. market decline, the central bank's
decision to raise interest rates has also sent a signal that the era of low
interest rates has ended, " Wang Chi-ming, equity head of Capital Investment
Trust Corporation, told the Central News Agency Friday.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) raised three key rates -- the
discount rate, the rate on accommodation with collateral and the rate on
accommodation without collateral -- by 12.5 basis points each on Thursday in a
bid to stem inflation.</P>
      <P>But Wang said that the central bank's move to tighten market liquidity by
increasing local banks' reserve ratios -- by 1.25 percentage points for NT
dollar demand deposits and 0.75 percentage points for NT dollar time deposits --
was equally influential.</P>
      <P>He said the move would have an immediate impact, pulling an estimated NT$200
billion of liquidity, defined as M2, from the economy.</P>
      <P>M2 is a broad measure of the money supply, comprising currency in circulation
plus demand deposits. Higher reserve requirements force banks to hold more funds
in reserves instead of lending them to clients, thus reducing liquidity.</P>
      <P>Lee-rong Wang, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting under the Chung-
Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) , said the central bank's move to
tighten liquidity and reset M2 growth's target range for 2008 to 2-6 percent
from 3-7 percent could compromise economic growth.</P>
      <P>"Compared to China's capital market, in which M2 often rises by more than 10
percent on a yearly basis, the M2 growth in the local market has been much
lower, "the director said.</P>
      <P>"The number of bank loans has also declined in recent years, indicating that
some investors have been retreating from the local market, " Lee-rong Wang said.</P>
      <P>The head of the forecasting center said the government must create more
opportunities for private money to flow back into the economy through
investment.</P>
      <P>"The new Kuomintang (KMT) government's plan to boost local construction
projects, which will welcome the participation of private investment, could make
some difference, " she stressed, citing a possibility for a rise in M2, which
will lead to the revival of share prices.</P>
      <P>The stock market has shed 1,520.13 points since President Ma Ying-jeou was
inaugurated on May 20, when the market closed at 9,068.89.</P>
      <P>Its value has lost 12 percent during that period, falling NT$2.94 trillion to
NT$20.86 trillion on June 20, putting further pressure on the government to
intervene or stimulate economic growth in the short term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan succeeds in breeding honey peach on flat land</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 27 (CNA)
06/27/08  18:19:48
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Council of Agriculture (COA) made public Friday a new
strain of honey peach, which was grown on flat land, instead of in the chillier
mountain area.</P>
      <P>The juicy peach, named "summer honeydew, " was developed by farming experts at
the COA-run Taiwan Agriculture Research Institute (TARI) in cooperation with a
local farmer, Chang Chou-fu, at the latter's orchard in Changhua County in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said the low-land peaches, which are juicy and sweet, ripen earlier than
their cousins grown on mountains, and that they are typhoon-resistant. The fruit
are fit to being grown on flat land in central and northern Taiwan, as well as
on small hills, he noted.</P>
      <P>Honey peaches, also called "juice peaches", is one of the popular fruits in
Taiwan. According to COA statistics, there are around 2,700 hectares of peach
orchards in Taiwan, generating an average output of 32,000 tons each year and an
annual production value of NT$700 million (US$23 million).</P>
      <P>However, the peaches need to grow on soil in the mountains where the temperature
is lower than that in the low lands. The plantation of the fruit trees has
therefore resulted in serious soil erosion and pollution to water sources, TARI
researchers said.</P>
      <P>Out of the need for environmental protection, the institute began over a decade
ago efforts to cultivate peaches on flat land. And in 2005, the new strain of
"summer honeydew" peaches was successfully produced.</P>
      <P>Chang said the new peach grows to an average weight of 204 grams, and can grow
to over 400 grams.</P>
      <P>With a round shape, the fruit is sweet, and can be put on the market before and
after the Dragon Boat Festival, one of major traditional festivals celebrated on
the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Southern leaders, tourism reps protest charter flight schedules</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  27 (CNA)
06/27/08  18:45:45

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several county and city chiefs and tourism industry representatives in southern
Taiwan gathered at Kaohsiung City Hall Friday to protest the central
government's arrangements for weekend cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, Pingtung County
Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung, Kaohsiung County Deputy Magistrate Yeh Nan-ming, and
several tourism reps voiced their displeasure with the fact that northern and
central Taiwan airports will handle most of the weekend cross-strait charter
flights which are set to kick off from July 4.</P>
      <P>Of the 36 cross-strait charters to be flown on the first weekend from July 4-7,
16 will serve Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and 13 will serve Taipei
Songshan Airport in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Three flights will fly in and out of Taichung's Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan, one flight will serve Hualien Airport in eastern Taiwan, and
three will serve Magong Airport on the outlying island county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)  decided
Friday  to add one flight  serving  Kaohsiung International Airport, the move
was made in a perfunctory manner and still does not meet the needs of southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She called on all of southern Taiwan's tourism operators to join her and other
local government  heads in pushing the central government to respect the rights
of southern Taiwan's citizens.</P>
      <P>Hsu  speculated  that  Kaohsiung's  omission  from  weekend cross-strait charter
flight services may have been a deliberate move on the part of President Ma
Ying-jeou's government, adding that if this were the case, it would make the
president "a criminal in history."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsao called for Ma to "stop before making a serious blunder, " noting
that southern Taiwan is an important center of conventional industries and that
many Taiwan businesspeople operate in China.</P>
      <P>He contended that giving the south only one cross-strait charter flight per week
is "tantamount to punishing southern Taiwan's citizens."</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the gathering, Huang Chin-hsiang, head of the Kaohsiung Tourism
Association, said that Kaohsiung International Airport's facilities are just as
good as those of Songshan Airport, adding that if Chinese tourists are not
allowed to enter the country via smaller airports, this will "cause congestion"
in their travels within Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Shang-chih, president of the Kaohsiung Association of Travel Agents,
criticized the fact that the southern branch of the Ministry of Interior's (MOI)
National Immigration Agency has not been authorized to accept and screen Chinese
tourists' applications for exit &amp; entry permits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the people of southern Taiwan are warm and friendly and that many
preparations have been made in advance to welcome Chinese tourists, expressing
the hope that Ma will give the south the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of
the country's opening to more tourists from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The launch of weekend cross-strait charter flights was agreed to June 13 in an
accord signed in Beijing by Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation, and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and five local banks signed an agreement
Friday to jointly establish a platform that would streamline the assessment of
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) seeking financing.</P>
      <P>The platform will facilitate the greater transparency of companiesfinancial
status, making it easier and faster for SMEs to acquire bank loans,Shih Yen-
Shiang, the vice minister of the MOEA said at the signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Taiwan Cooperative Bank,  First Commercial Bank, E.
Sun Commercial Bank and Taipei Fubon Bank will contribute NT$5 million
(US$164,000) each, to match the ministry's input of NT$5 million, for the
construction of a NT$30 million information facility that would provide all-in-
one credit assessment for commercial financing.</P>
      <P>Smaller companies which need relatively more financial assistance often meet
barriers when applying for a bank loan because of the lack of transparency on
their financial status, especially regarding their ability to repay the loans,
the vice minister said.</P>
      <P>Taiwans government currently categorizes private companies with a net capital of
NT$800 million or less as SMEs.</P>
      <P>The facility, officially calledSMEs Financial Service Platform , will be an
electronic financial service platform that is expected to be fully completed in
March 2009. Some of the services will be made available ahead of schedule,
including invoice financing that is set to be the first service to be offered.</P>
      <P>Compiling reports on SMEs, the operation of the platform will be based on the
e-Government Services Hub, a state-run virtual platform to access the data of
the business status and credit status of private companies, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He added that the new mechanism will also save banks expenses, as conventional
procedures require a lot of paperwork and extra time and costs.</P>
      <P>The issue of information asymmetry between private companies and banks will be
solved,Yang Ya-hwei, a commissioner of Financial Supervisory Commission said at
the signing.</P>
      <P>Yang said from July 2005 to May 2008, the total amount of local bank loans for
SMEs increased by NT$795.4 billion to NT$3.16 trillion.</P>
      <P>However local SMEs still need more financing to develop their business,the
commissioner noted, adding that companies now will get a shot in the arm with
the help of the financing service platform.</P>
      <P>Currently the number of SMEs represents 97.8 percent of the total number of
private companies in Taiwan, and 30 percent of the country s total production
value.</P>
      <P>The new platform will incorporate hardware infrastructure and a software system.
The former will focus on a firewall to protect the companies' information, while
the latter will be an application to systemize the information required by the
banks.</P>

      <P>A man called on a prosecutor in Taipei County Thursday to thank the prosecutor
for allowing him to do 50 hours of community service by taking his puppy to
perform on a school campus and promoting animal protection awareness in lieu of
an indictment for copyright violation.</P>
      <P>The man surnamed Liao is a pet Website owner who was found liable for copyright
infringement during a routine Internet investigation by the police. He had
allowed users of his Website to download material with copyrights.</P>
      <P>The offense came as a result of Liao's negligence in removing nearly 1, 000
illegal music downloads his Internet pals had put on his Web page by linking to
other Websites for about half a year.</P>
      <P>During an investigation by Lin Hsiu-ping, a prosecutor in the Banchiao District
Prosecutors Office, who was in charge of the case, Liao admitted his negligence
in managing his Website and his failure in removing illegal content from the
Website immediately.</P>
      <P>Considering his good behavior and the fact that the offense is a misdemeanor,
the prosecutor decided to allow Liao to perform community service at Chung Yuan
Elementary School in Taipei County as a condition of the deferred punishment of
copyright violation.</P>
      <P>Liao and his puppy Cherry therefore embarked on a series of performances  around
the elementary school campus to entertain students, while raising their
awareness about protecting copyrights and animals' rights.</P>
      <P>Describing it as an unexpected happy ending, Prosecutor Lin told reporters that
carrying out community service could be a good alternative to short-term
punishment.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, the school's president Tseng Hsue-chiao and faculty members paid
a visit to the prosecutors office to express appreciation for the office's help
in offering services at schools in remote areas.</P>
      <P>As of the end of May, 1,525 people have benefited from the system of deferred
prosecution, according to the chief of the prosecutors' office Shieh Jung-sheng,
who said he hopes those who benefited from the system would make good use of the
opportunity to develop a new lease in life and contribute more to society.</P>

      <P>The Wage Arrears Repayment Fund has helped 41,049 workers, or 758 firms'
employees get back their owed wages during the past 22 years, according to a
press statement released by the Council of Labor Affairs Friday.</P>
      <P>The Labor Standards Act regulates that employers have to contribute 0.025
percent of a worker's monthly wage to the fund, which allows laid-off workers to
claim their owed wages.</P>
      <P>The fund has provided NT$2.79 billion (US$91.81 million) in total to workers
since May 1986, the statement said.</P>
      <P>However, the statement also pointed out that the amount of wages actually owed
is likely to be higher than the repaid amount, as the fund only compensates
workers for wages owed for less than six months.</P>
      <P>Workers can apply for owed wages from the repayment fund after their employers
stop business operations, clear accounts, or declare bankruptcy, the statement
pointed out.</P>
      <P>A total of 406,553, or 94.71 percent, of the 429,264 firms obliged to contribute

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first hearing on the possible enactment of an anti-human trafficking law was
held at the Legislative Yuan Friday, with a view to addressing the problem of
human trafficking in Taiwan and guaranteeing the rights of victims.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2008, released earlier this month by the
United States Department of State, listed Taiwan as a "Tier 2" country,
describing it as a destination for men, women and children trafficked for the
purpose of forced labor and sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan is also a source of women trafficked to Japan,
Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States.</P>
      <P>@The hearing,  held by Kuomintang legislator Wu Yu-sheng, gathered an alliance
of 11 non-governmental  organizations and governmental agencies, as well as a
representative of a group of lawyers who drafted a non-governmental version of
an anti-human trafficking law.</P>
      <P>In late 2007, the Executive Yuan announced a plan of action to tackle human
trafficking in Taiwan, to protect victims and punish perpetrators.</P>
      <P>However, it requires special legislation in order to attain these goals, one of
participants at the hearing stated.</P>
      <P>"A specialized law is needed to precisely define the meaning of human
trafficking, formulate punishments that can deter criminals, and to protect both
foreigners and nationals, said Cynthia Kao, executive director of the Taipei
Womens Rescue Foundation, during the hearing.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, the non-governmental alliance presented a draft anti-human
trafficking law that covers crimes of sexual and forced labor exploitations and
organ harvesting.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency will also present its own version of the draft
law in the near future.</P>
      <P>Other hearings on the possible enactment of the law will be held during the next
few months, and the discussions on the draft bills will be given priority in the
Legislative Yuan's Internal Affairs Committee, Wu said.</P>
      <P>@Taiwan was ranked among the "Tier 1" countries in the U.S. report from 2001 to
2004, which indicated that the country had fully complied with the minimum
standards for the elimination of human trafficking. However, it was downgraded
to "Tier 2" in 2005, and placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List" in 2006, partly
because foreign workers' rights in Taiwan are not fully protected by the Labor
Standards Law.</P>
      <P>@The United  Nations  defines  human  trafficking  as the recruitment,
transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of threat or
the use of force or other forms of coercion.  The U.N. also includes in its
definition of human trafficking the use of abduction, fraud, deception and the
abuse of power to recruit or transfer people for the purpose of exploitation.

      <P>Taiwan's economy showed signs of slowing down in May, with monitoring indicators
flashing a yellow-blue light for the first time since June 2007, according to a
report released Friday by the Council for Economic Development and Planning
(CEPD).</P>
      <P>The monitoring score dropped to 21 in May from 27 in the previous month, CEPD
officials said, noting that the monitoring indicator had flashed green for six
consecutive months prior to May.</P>
      <P>The change means the economy is slowing down, said Hung Juei-pin, director of
the CEPD Economic Research Department.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color rating system, a "red" light means the economy is
overheated; "yellow-red" indicates the economy is heating up; "green" reflects
steady growth; "yellow-blue" signals an economic slowdown; and "blue" represents
a recession.</P>
      <P>In May, five of the nine components that make up the monitoring indicators
declined from a month before, with the light signals for the stock index and
manufacturing sales both falling from yellow-red to green, while that for
imports of machinery and electrical equipment went from yellow-blue to blue.</P>
      <P>The indicator for the wholesale, retail and food service sectors declined from
green to yellow-blue, and that for the industrial production index from red to
green.</P>
      <P>The  other  four  indicators  --  customs-cleared  exports, nonagricultural
employment, monetary aggregate M1B, and direct and indirect finance -- remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading indicators -- a barometer for the economy's
outlook in the coming three months -- stood at 106.9 in May, up marginally by
0.1 percent from the month-earlier level, according to the CEPD report.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which reflects the current economic
situation, remained at 109.1, the same level as in April.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Controversial lawmaker to give up salary if put behind bars</HEADLINE>

      <P>A controversial lawmaker from a tiny opposition party said Friday that if it is
certain that he has to serve time behind bars, he is willing to give up his
salary.</P>
      <P>But Yen Chin-piao of the Non-partisan Solidarity Union said that his aides will
still receive their salaries according to regulations.</P>
      <P>Yen made the pledge amid criticism by main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers that the public would feel bad if Yen retains his
legislative seat while in prison.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a Taiwan High Court second retrial ruling
that sentenced Yen to three years and six months in prison for illegally
possessing submachine guns and pistols during his tenure as a member of the now-
defunct Taiwan Provincial Assembly in 1986.</P>
      <P>In Thursday's verdict, the Supreme Court also demanded that the High Court retry
Yen in a corruption case for allegedly using up to NT$20.6 million (US$677,632)
in public funds to entertain guests at hostess bars and night clubs during his
stint as Taichung county council speaker from October 1998 to December 2000.</P>
      <P>Yen said that he will respect the ruling, although he felt that he had been
wronged and will "request an extraordinary appeal after receiving the verdict."</P>
      <P>He also asked the Taichung Prosecutors Office to give him some time to deal with
personal matters, seeing that he is a legislator and chairman of the Dajia Jenn
Lann Temple, one of the most worshipped temples in Taichung County, central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yee said that the DPP legislative caucus has already
proposed an amendment that a legislator loses his seat if he or she goes behind
bars.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the ruling Kuomintang might feel that the situation is "nothing
since one of its members had a similar experience,  " but "the public definitely
will have negative impression."</P>
      <P>He was referring to KMT lawmaker Chiu Yi, who served seven months in jail from
April to November 2007 after being found guilty of obstructing official duties.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wong Chin-chu said that if Yen is put behind bars, he can receive
around NT$36.6 million (US$1.2 million), including monthly salary and other
public funds, during the three-year-six-month imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Chiu denied  that he had received  any money during  his incarceration.</P>
      <P>"I did not receive a salary or other public funds during the seven months in
prison," he said.</P>
      <P>But he said that as the aides are public servants hired by the legislature,  the
Legislative Yuan had remitted their salaries directly to their bank accounts.</P>
      <P>On public concerns that Yen could receive a salary while in jail, Legislative
Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that the legislature has a law to deal with the
situation.</P>
      <P>"It's not possible that Chiu Yi did not get paid but that Yen will," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the bad public impression it would create if Yen were to receive a
salary while in prison, Wang suggested "the legislature is not to blame" because
the court has not stripped Yen of his civil rights and he still retains his
legislative seat and will serve the voters.</P>

      <P>The 6th City on the Move Art Festival is slated to open at the Museum of
Contemporary Art Taipei Saturday with exhibits available for the public to view,
a museum official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Sponsored by Taipei City's Department of Cultural Affairs, the 58-day event is
dedicated to presenting two themes: "Dark City" and "Eye of the City".</P>
      <P>The "Dark City" project is the creation of Chao Lee Kuo, an associate professor
from National Taipei University's  Graduate Institute of Urban Planning and Ke-
fung Liu, an assistant professor from the Department of Architecture of the
Chaoyang University of Technology, according to the museum official.</P>
      <P>"Dark City" presents works from six local gifted architects, including Albert
Ho, Jay W. Chiu, Kris Yao, Shi-chieh Lu, Chia-kai Yang and Victor Y.C. Su.</P>
      <P>The six architects are devoted to delving into the relativity of lightness and
darkness within Asian cities. They also devote their energies to scrutinizing
the uniqueness of urban night life and darker spaces, as well as charming
nightscapes of Asian cities, the official explained.</P>
      <P>Works produced from the "Dark City" project have been selected by the Cabinet-
level Council for Cultural Affairs to be displayed at the Taiwan pavilion at the
2008 Venice Architecture Biennale set for Sept. 14-Nov. 23, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The "Eye of the City" project is designed by Hsaio Shu-wen, a researcher at
Taipei City's Department of Cultural Affairs. Seven visual artists taking part
in the project include France's Nicholas FLOC'H, Japan's Ryoichi Kurokawa and
Yuki Okumura and Taiwan's Ya-hui Wang, Iuan-hau Chiang, Chung-han Yao and Chih-
chien Chen, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of the medium of videos and sounds, the seven artists present
various perspectives of the city and, at the same time, explore the concepts of
time and the sense of urban space. They are dedicated not only to presenting the
sights, sounds as well as smell in the city dwellers' experiences, but also to
expressing the emotions or fantasies found in city corners and miscellaneous
anxiety hidden within city life, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA receives first application to host pandas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Forestry Bureau under the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Friday that the
Leofoo Village Theme Park has applied to host two giant pandas offered by China,
the first organization in Taiwan to do so.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it will begin the review process as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>China offered the two pandas as gifts to Taiwan after a visit by then Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan in 2005. But the offer was rejected by the COA under the
previous Democratic Progressive Party administration on the grounds that Taiwan
did not have adequate conditions to raise the animals.</P>
      <P>The movement of the pandas also touched on the issue of sovereignty. As an
endangered species, the giant pandas fall under the Washington Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</P>
      <P>The convention requires exports of endangered animals to be certified by the
exporting and importing countries. Beijing has insisted, however, that the
convention would not apply because the transfer of the pandas would be a
"domestic issue."</P>
      <P>After the new KMT government took office, the panda issue is back on the table,
with the Leofoo theme park and the Taipei City Zoo seen as the main contenders
vying for the rights to house the pandas. Taichung Mayor Jason Hu has also
expressed an interest in hosting the pandas in his city.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Bureau confirmed that while it has received an application from the
Leofoo park, the Taipei Zoo has yet to take action so far.</P>
      <P>The Leofoo Safari Zoo, located in Hsinchu in northern Taiwan, was founded in
1979, and was the first and largest safari zoo in Taiwan. In 1989, the
recreation area was extended into the current Leofoo Village Theme Park, one of
the most popular amusement parks in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Bureau noted in its statement that, in addition to public and
private zoos, research centers and academic institutions are also qualified to
file an application.</P>
      <P>The key criteria in reviewing applications will include the places where the
giant pandas will be raised, medical worker training, and public education
plans, the bureau said.</P>

charity organization's program to sponsor poor children, and that he is
preparing to sponsor an African student through college.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when he received Dean Hirsch, president of World Vision
International (WVI).</P>
      <P>The president lauded WVI for its long-term efforts in assistance programs,
especially its program to sponsor poor children.</P>

giving the nation a positive image aside from its reputation as a leader in
computer technology.</P>
      <P>The president said that World Vision Taiwan, recently invited impoverished
students from other countries to Taiwan in early May, including one that he has
sponsored for nine years -- a girl named Maphalala Nelisiwe from Swaziland.</P>
      <P>The president said he recognized the girl immediately because he had seen her
photo before, although she was "taller than I had thought."</P>
      <P>Ma said the 17-year-old Nelisiwe lives in rural Swaziland and is a senior in
high school. At their meeting on May 3, he gave her a dictionary and a backpack,
and decided to sponsor her through four years in college.</P>
      <P>He said that Nelisiwe wrote him a congratulatory card after he was elected
president  March 22,  giving him a "heartwarming experience."</P>
      <P>World Vision International, founded in the United States in 1950, is an
international Christian relief and development organization whose stated goal is

    <HEADLINE>New panels formed to bolster economy, help the disadvantaged</HEADLINE>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has ordered the formation of two special task forces to
cope with economic volatility and help disadvantaged people amid rising
inflation, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Premier Liu gave the directive while meeting with senior economic and financial
officials earlier in the day to discuss strategies to tame inflation and boost
consumer confidence, " said Minister-without-Portfolio Chu Yun-peng.</P>
      <P>Liu called the meeting after the local bourse plummeted again Friday, with
investors worried about a possible economic slowdown following new surges in
crude oil prices and the central bank's Thursday announcement of hikes in key
interest rates and bank reserve ratios.</P>
      <P>Chu told a news conference after the meeting that Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung
will serve as convener of the new panel tasked with fleshing out effective
measures to revitalize the local economy, which showed signs of slowdown in May
according to the latest Council of Economic Planning and Development report on
economic indicators.</P>
      <P>Monitoring indicators flashing a yellow-blue light, indicating a slowdown, for
the first time since June 2007,</P>
      <P>According to Chu, the panel will hold its first meeting Saturday to draw up a
comprehensive blueprint to prop up the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>At Friday's meeting, Chu went on, it was decided that five measures will be
aopted to stabilize the local stock market, including encouraging the four
public funds to purchase blue-chip stocks with low price-earning ratios and high
dividends.</P>
      <P>Other steps include wooing foreign mutual fund managers to buy Taiwan stocks,
pushing listed companies to implement treasury stock systems to encourage share
buybacks, working out new tactics to attract  inbound  investments  and  luring
overseas  Taiwanese businesspeople to return to Taiwan to invest, Chu said.</P>
      <P>On stimulating economic development, Chu said five measures will be taken,
including offering soft loans for local enterprises to replace their energy-
consuming production facilities; providing new incentives to accelerate private
investments; working out incentives to boost private consumption; offering new
incentives to encourage electricity conservation and speeding up the relaxation
of various financial and banking restrictions.</P>
      <P>With the prospect of stagflation mounting as oil prices soar while consumption
stagnates, Chu said the premier also ordered the formation of a special panel to
help disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>"The panel, to be headed by Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Hsung-hsiung, will
design a mechanism to identify 'near poor' families and relevant govenrment
agencies will pool resources to offer them assistance in terms of the impact of
spikes in food and fuel prices, " Chu explained, adding that the panel will also
craft a tax subsidy system for middle- and low-income wage earners.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government is likely to offer food coupons or tax rebates to
help disadvantaged households tide over inflationary pressure, Chu said no
concrete plans are available at the moment.</P>
      <P>As to whether the government will review the existing "povery line" criteria,
Chu said the Ministry of the Interior will be required to study feasible
measures, including the feasibility of identifying "near poor" families in terms
of tax data.</P>
      <P>"In any case, the Cabinet will unveil complete economy stimulus measures and
strategies to help poor families in the shortest possible period of time," Chu
added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Academia Sinica hopes to build closer cooperation with its China
counterpart, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for large-scale interdisciplinary
exchanges, Chao-han Liu, a vice president of the Taiwan's top research
institute, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks at a seminar on earthquake prevention and disaster relief
in Beijing. Liu and his counterpart, Li Jinhai, a vice president of Chinese
Academy of Sciences, jointly presided over the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that while there has long been cooperation between scholars at the two
research institutes, the links have been between researchers and laboratories.
However, this time the exchanges are between the two institutes, he said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the mode and format of future cooperation will be
discussed and that a mechanism can be established by the two institutes to usher
in an era of "large-scale interdisciplinary cooperation."</P>
      <P>Li, on his part, recalled that when he visited Taiwan a decade ago, he was
greeted with hospitality by the current Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who was then
president of the National Tsing Hua University. Liu Chao-shiuan is the younger
brother of Liu Chao-han.</P>
      <P>Li also expressed the hope that both institutes can establish a closer
relationship and a more solid friendship.</P>
      <P>Liu, at the head of a group of 10 scholars, was in China to take part in the
seminar. Chinese Academy of Sciences President Lu Yongxiang had earlier written
to Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, asking him to send a delegation to
the seminar to share Taiwan's experience in reconstruction in the wake of the
disastrous Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake. More than 2,300 people in Taiwan died in
the magnitude 7.3 quake.</P>
      <P>On May 12, Sichuan Province in southwestern China was devastated by an
8.0-magnitude temblor that killed more than 69,000 people, according to official
figures.</P>

      <P>The Taipei county government slapped a department store with a fine of NT$60,000
(US$1,980.2) Friday for its violation  of regulations  regarding prevention  of
enterovirus infections.</P>
      <P>It was the first fine issued by the county government since its health bureau
began to prohibit children aged under 5 from entering public play areas early
this month over concern that playing in such areas could spread the potentially
lethal virus.</P>
      <P>During a surprise inspection June 21, health officials spotted a 3-year-old boy
playing in a special zone for children at the Banciao branch of the Far Eastern
Department Store.</P>
      <P>"As none of the store's staff tried to dissuade or forbid the boy from entering
the area, we decided to issue a NT$60,000 ticket to the company, " said a health
official from the northern Taiwan county where many suspected and confirmed
enterovirus cases have been reported in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the number of elementary schools, kindergarterns and
day care centers that have reported suspected severe enterovirus cases reached
an average of 50 to 130 per day over the past week.</P>
      <P>"As the figure indicates that the outbreak has yet to subside, we should remain
vigilant against the viral disease," said the official.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, the county government put cram schools onto the list of
institutions obligated to report suspected enterovirus cases to the health
bureau.  Previously,  only elementary  schools, kindergartens and day care
centers were required to do so.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of septic meningitis
and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with compromised
immune systems.</P>
      <P>The outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this year and has since spread
northward to cover nearly all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>As of Friday evening, 265 confirmed severe enterovirus cases, including nine
fatalities, had been reported around Taiwan so far this year, according to
statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said a total of 32 suspected severe
enterovirus cases were reported from Sunday through Thursday, compared to 48
reported during the same five-day period a week ago.</P>
      <P>"The decline seems to signal that the outbreak may be subsiding, but we should
continue to remain vigilant," Chou said.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated June 10 to
contain the further spread of the potentially lethal disease, which usually
attacks children aged under 5.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese construction design company is threatening to sue the Ukrainian
government for not honoring its right won in a tender to renovate a Kiev stadium
that will be used in the Euro 2012 soccer championship.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based Archasia Design Group, which won a tender on April 16 to renovate
the 84,000-seat stadium, accused the Ukrainian government Friday of acting
"illegally" and "unreasonably" in asking the firm to provide documents by a
deadline it contends was impossible to meet or forfeit its rights to the
project.</P>
      <P>Days after the company failed to comply, Ukraine's deputy sports minister
Rostyslav Karandeyev said on June 24 that negotiations on the stadium deal had
ended because of problems with the firm's legal status in Ukraine, with which
Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The company, however, dismissed reports that Ukraine had stopped the
negotiations and was looking for a replacement contractor.</P>
      <P>Perhaps to avoid diplomatic complications, the company said in a statement
Friday that it was also trying to solve the stadium dispute by having its
Shanghai affiliate sign the contract for the stadium renovation with the Ukraine
government.</P>
      <P>The controversy has been magnified by UEFA's growing impatience with Ukraine's
lackluster preparations for the competition and mounting fears that further
delay of the stadium project might cost Ukraine its right to host the event.</P>
      <P>UEFA is Europe's governing soccer body.</P>
      <P>In its statement Friday, the company said it had faced repeated obstacles in the
process of finalizing the contract with Ukrainian authorities,  including
Kiev's  refusal  to provide  requested information on the stadium.</P>
      <P>The dispute came to a head, the company said, when Ukrainian officials demanded
that the company provide documents not related to the contract in a bid to block
the signing of the contract.</P>
      <P>The officials abruptly demanded on June 19 that the documents be authenticated
by governments of both countries by June 20, or it would otherwise cancel the
contract negotiations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>However, due to the absence of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Ukraine, the
authentication process would take at least weeks because the documents needed to
go through Taiwan's and Ukraine's overseas offices in Japan to be translated and
authenticated, the statement said, calling the action "illegal" and
"unreasonable."</P>
      <P>The stadium is scheduled to hold five matches, including the final, in the Euro
2012, which Ukraine will co-host with Poland.</P>
      <P>The renovation was expected to cost around US$300 million.</P>

      <P>Hau said soon after returning from his first trip to Shanghai in his capacity as

      <P>The move to allow 3,000 Chinese tourists per day to visit Taiwan was formalized
in negotiations between quasi-official organizations of Taiwan and China in mid-
June.</P>
      <P>Hau also said that he hoped direct charter flights between Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport will come on stream soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added that the Taipei city government will submit a new
application later this month to Taiwan's Council of Agriculture to seek
permission for the Taipei Zoo to house two giant pandas offered by China as
gifts to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It will be the city government's first application to the new Kuomintang (KMT)
government to host the pandas.</P>
      <P>The city government's previous applications to accept the pandas were rejected
by the pro-Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration, which turned over the reins of the government to the KMT on May

      <P>National Chengchi University announced Friday that it has decided not to renew
the contract of an assistant professor because of controversial political
remarks he made that had offended many.</P>
      <P>University President Wu Se Hwa said that the university has notified the
Ministry of Education about its decision on Chuang Kuo-jung.</P>
      <P>"Chuang could file a complaint via various channels if he cannot agree with the
school's decision," Wu added.</P>
      <P>Chuang, after learning that the school approved a resolution passed by a school
advisory committee June 18 to not renew the contract, said that the school's
decision has "gone beyond the principle of proportionality."</P>
      <P>It is "questionable" for the school to report a decision that "goes against
legitimate legal procedures and is flawed" to the Ministry of Education, Chuang
continued.</P>
      <P>He also said that he'll decide whether to file a complaint after the Ministry of
Education makes a final decision.</P>
      <P>Wu said the school has kept intact the reason for not renewing Chuang's contract
-- "conduct unbecoming of a professor" -- quoted by its advisory committee last
week.</P>
      <P>But in the school's notification to the Ministry of Education, it noted that
while the advisory committee reached a consensus that the university will not
renew Chuang's contract, "he could still teach at other schools."</P>
      <P>The reason given is one of those listed in the Statute Governing the Employment
of Educational Personnel that could keep Chuang from assuming another
professorial post in the future.</P>
      <P>Under the statute, if National Chengchi University officially cites Chuang's
behavior as the reason not to rehire him, he will be stripped of his
qualifications to serve in the educational field and be unable to work as a
professor for any university.</P>
      <P>But National Chengchi University obviously added the words in the hope that
Chuang's career will not be ended prematurely.</P>
      <P>Chuang made highly offensive remarks about then presidential candidate Ma and
his late father on separate occasions in late 2007 and early 2008 while serving
as chief secretary of the Education Ministry. He subsequently apologized, and
the apology was accepted by Ma.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet urged to come up with bill on cross-strait accords</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan should come up with a draft bill on regulating signing of
agreements between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait affairs are crucial to Taiwan's survival and
sustainable development, Wang said no single party or individual can solely
decide on the course of development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>While cross-strait relations have been developing very fast since the
inauguration of the new Kuomintang (KMT) government, Wang said the country has
yet to develop a sufficient supervisory mechanism to oversee relevant
development.</P>
      <P>Recalling that the previous KMT administration had twice referred bills
governing signing of cross-strait agreements to the legislature for screening,
Wang, a KMT heavyweight, said he wonders why the party has not yet come up with
such a proposal now that it has regained power.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said, cross-strait affairs should be kept as transparent as
possible. "Otherwise, disputes or controversies could possibly arise after a
bilateral accord is reached," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>It is also very important that opposition parties are allowed to have a say in
the process of negotiations. "By so doing, hindrances could be minimized in
striking a cross-strait deal," he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing that parliamentary supervision of major policy issues is norm in
mature democratic countries, Wang said the lawmaking body should not be excluded
from crafting  and implementation  of cross-strait policies because they are
critical to national security, sovereignty and popular rights and interests.</P>

never regards anything as beneath his notice or as unworthy of serious and
careful attention -- that is what is meant by being dignified without being
supercilious."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>New panels formed to bolster economy, help the disadvantaged</HEADLINE>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has ordered the formation of two special task forces to
cope with economic volatility and help disadvantaged people amid rising
inflation, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Premier Liu gave the directive while meeting with senior economic and financial
officials earlier in the day to discuss strategies to tame inflation and boost
consumer confidence, " said Minister-without-Portfolio Chu Yun-peng.</P>
      <P>Liu called the meeting after the local bourse plummeted again Friday, with
investors worried about a possible economic slowdown following new surges in
crude oil prices and the central bank's Thursday announcement of hikes in key
interest rates and bank reserve ratios.</P>
      <P>Chu told a news conference after the meeting that Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung
will serve as convener of the new panel tasked with fleshing out effective
measures to revitalize the local economy, which showed signs of slowdown in May
according to the latest Council of Economic Planning and Development report on
economic indicators.</P>
      <P>Monitoring indicators flashing a yellow-blue light, indicating a slowdown, for
the first time since June 2007,</P>
      <P>According to Chu, the panel will hold its first meeting Saturday to draw up a
comprehensive blueprint to prop up the sagging economy.</P>
      <P>At Friday's meeting, Chu went on, it was decided that five measures will be
aopted to stabilize the local stock market, including encouraging the four
public funds to purchase blue-chip stocks with low price-earning ratios and high
dividends.</P>
      <P>Other steps include wooing foreign mutual fund managers to buy Taiwan stocks,
pushing listed companies to implement treasury stock systems to encourage share
buybacks, working out new tactics to attract  inbound  investments  and  luring
overseas  Taiwanese businesspeople to return to Taiwan to invest, Chu said.</P>
      <P>On stimulating economic development, Chu said five measures will be taken,
including offering soft loans for local enterprises to replace their energy-
consuming production facilities; providing new incentives to accelerate private
investments; working out incentives to boost private consumption; offering new
incentives to encourage electricity conservation and speeding up the relaxation
of various financial and banking restrictions.</P>
      <P>With the prospect of stagflation mounting as oil prices soar while consumption
stagnates, Chu said the premier also ordered the formation of a special panel to
help disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>"The panel, to be headed by Minister-without-Portfolio Tsai Hsung-hsiung, will
design a mechanism to identify 'near poor' families and relevant govenrment
agencies will pool resources to offer them assistance in terms of the impact of
spikes in food and fuel prices, " Chu explained, adding that the panel will also
craft a tax subsidy system for middle- and low-income wage earners.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government is likely to offer food coupons or tax rebates to
help disadvantaged households tide over inflationary pressure, Chu said no
concrete plans are available at the moment.</P>
      <P>As to whether the government will review the existing "povery line" criteria,
Chu said the Ministry of the Interior will be required to study feasible
measures, including the feasibility of identifying "near poor" families in terms
of tax data.</P>
      <P>"In any case, the Cabinet will unveil complete economy stimulus measures and
strategies to help poor families in the shortest possible period of time," Chu
added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Academia Sinica hopes to build closer cooperation with its China
counterpart, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for large-scale interdisciplinary
exchanges, Chao-han Liu, a vice president of the Taiwan's top research
institute, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks at a seminar on earthquake prevention and disaster relief
in Beijing. Liu and his counterpart, Li Jinhai, a vice president of Chinese
Academy of Sciences, jointly presided over the two-day meeting.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that while there has long been cooperation between scholars at the two
research institutes, the links have been between researchers and laboratories.
However, this time the exchanges are between the two institutes, he said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the mode and format of future cooperation will be
discussed and that a mechanism can be established by the two institutes to usher
in an era of "large-scale interdisciplinary cooperation."</P>
      <P>Li, on his part, recalled that when he visited Taiwan a decade ago, he was
greeted with hospitality by the current Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, who was then
president of the National Tsing Hua University. Liu Chao-shiuan is the younger
brother of Liu Chao-han.</P>
      <P>Li also expressed the hope that both institutes can establish a closer
relationship and a more solid friendship.</P>
      <P>Liu, at the head of a group of 10 scholars, was in China to take part in the
seminar. Chinese Academy of Sciences President Lu Yongxiang had earlier written
to Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong, asking him to send a delegation to
the seminar to share Taiwan's experience in reconstruction in the wake of the
disastrous Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake. More than 2,300 people in Taiwan died in
the magnitude 7.3 quake.</P>
      <P>On May 12, Sichuan Province in southwestern China was devastated by an
8.0-magnitude temblor that killed more than 69,000 people, according to official
figures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Department store fined for violating enterovirus prevention rule</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei county government slapped a department store with a fine of NT$60,000
(US$1,980.2) Friday for its violation  of regulations  regarding prevention  of
enterovirus infections.</P>
      <P>It was the first fine issued by the county government since its health bureau
began to prohibit children aged under 5 from entering public play areas early
this month over concern that playing in such areas could spread the potentially
lethal virus.</P>
      <P>During a surprise inspection June 21, health officials spotted a 3-year-old boy
playing in a special zone for children at the Banciao branch of the Far Eastern
Department Store.</P>
      <P>"As none of the store's staff tried to dissuade or forbid the boy from entering
the area, we decided to issue a NT$60,000 ticket to the company, " said a health
official from the northern Taiwan county where many suspected and confirmed
enterovirus cases have been reported in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the number of elementary schools, kindergarterns and
day care centers that have reported suspected severe enterovirus cases reached
an average of 50 to 130 per day over the past week.</P>
      <P>"As the figure indicates that the outbreak has yet to subside, we should remain
vigilant against the viral disease," said the official.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, the county government put cram schools onto the list of
institutions obligated to report suspected enterovirus cases to the health
bureau.  Previously,  only elementary  schools, kindergartens and day care
centers were required to do so.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus is a virus that enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract and thrives there. The virus is the most common cause of septic meningitis
and can cause serious illness, especially in infants and those with compromised
immune systems.</P>
      <P>The outbreak began in southern Taiwan earlier this year and has since spread
northward to cover nearly all parts of the island.</P>
      <P>As of Friday evening, 265 confirmed severe enterovirus cases, including nine
fatalities, had been reported around Taiwan so far this year, according to
statistics released by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw said a total of 32 suspected severe
enterovirus cases were reported from Sunday through Thursday, compared to 48
reported during the same five-day period a week ago.</P>
      <P>"The decline seems to signal that the outbreak may be subsiding, but we should
continue to remain vigilant," Chou said.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet-level epidemic response command center was activated June 10 to
contain the further spread of the potentially lethal disease, which usually
attacks children aged under 5.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan company to solve Ukraine stadium dispute through law</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese construction design company is threatening to sue the Ukrainian
government for not honoring its right won in a tender to renovate a Kiev stadium
that will be used in the Euro 2012 soccer championship.</P>
      <P>Taipei-based Archasia Design Group, which won a tender on April 16 to renovate
the 84,000-seat stadium, accused the Ukrainian government Friday of acting
"illegally" and "unreasonably" in asking the firm to provide documents by a
deadline it contends was impossible to meet or forfeit its rights to the
project.</P>
      <P>Days after the company failed to comply, Ukraine's deputy sports minister
Rostyslav Karandeyev said on June 24 that negotiations on the stadium deal had
ended because of problems with the firm's legal status in Ukraine, with which
Taiwan does not have diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>The company, however, dismissed reports that Ukraine had stopped the
negotiations and was looking for a replacement contractor.</P>
      <P>Perhaps to avoid diplomatic complications, the company said in a statement
Friday that it was also trying to solve the stadium dispute by having its
Shanghai affiliate sign the contract for the stadium renovation with the Ukraine
government.</P>
      <P>The controversy has been magnified by UEFA's growing impatience with Ukraine's
lackluster preparations for the competition and mounting fears that further
delay of the stadium project might cost Ukraine its right to host the event.</P>
      <P>UEFA is Europe's governing soccer body.</P>
      <P>In its statement Friday, the company said it had faced repeated obstacles in the
process of finalizing the contract with Ukrainian authorities,  including
Kiev's  refusal  to provide  requested information on the stadium.</P>
      <P>The dispute came to a head, the company said, when Ukrainian officials demanded
that the company provide documents not related to the contract in a bid to block
the signing of the contract.</P>
      <P>The officials abruptly demanded on June 19 that the documents be authenticated
by governments of both countries by June 20, or it would otherwise cancel the
contract negotiations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>However, due to the absence of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Ukraine, the
authentication process would take at least weeks because the documents needed to
go through Taiwan's and Ukraine's overseas offices in Japan to be translated and
authenticated, the statement said, calling the action "illegal" and
"unreasonable."</P>
      <P>The stadium is scheduled to hold five matches, including the final, in the Euro
2012, which Ukraine will co-host with Poland.</P>
      <P>The renovation was expected to cost around US$300 million.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday that his administration is ready to
welcome the 3,000 Chinese tourists who will be allowed to visit Taiwan daily
from July 4.</P>
      <P>Hau said soon after returning from his first trip to Shanghai in his capacity as
city mayor that the Taipei city government has already  designed  various
package tours,  cleaned up tourist attractions, and set up emergency assistance
prior to the arrival the Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>Hau said the northern city will present its best image to the tourists.</P>
      <P>Hau was in Shanghai to witness the signing of an agreement to confirm Taipei's
participation in World Expo Shanghai 2010.</P>
      <P>The move to allow 3,000 Chinese tourists per day to visit Taiwan was formalized
in negotiations between quasi-official organizations of Taiwan and China in mid-
June.</P>
      <P>Hau also said that he hoped direct charter flights between Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport will come on stream soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added that the Taipei city government will submit a new
application later this month to Taiwan's Council of Agriculture to seek
permission for the Taipei Zoo to house two giant pandas offered by China as
gifts to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It will be the city government's first application to the new Kuomintang (KMT)
government to host the pandas.</P>
      <P>The city government's previous applications to accept the pandas were rejected
by the pro-Taiwan independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration, which turned over the reins of the government to the KMT on May
20.</P>

      <P>Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Saturday that his
party will propose an amendment to the Nationality Law in the coming days that
will require individuals holding government posts to give up their permanent
residency status in foreign countries within one year of assuming office.</P>
      <P>Wu, who serves as convener of the Legislative Yuan's Internal Administration
Committee,  made the remark one day after the Presidential Office made an
announcement concerning the foreign residency status of President Ma Ying-jeou's
nominees for Examination Yuan and Control Yuan posts.</P>
      <P>According to the Presidential Office, six of the Examination Yuan nominees and
four of the Control Yuan nominees had previously held U. S. green cards or dual
citizenship. All 10 have since relinquished that status or their status has
become invalid.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
she believes the Presidential Office's claims but added that her party will
maintain a "cautious attitude" and thoroughly review each of the nominees'
histories.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his party will put forward the draft amendment to the Nationality
Law next week to establish clear regulations in order to resolve the controversy
over foreign permanent residency and citizenship status held by government
officials.</P>
      <P>He said the Nationality Law as it stands only covers the issue of dual
citizenship, while the amendment will also provide unambiguous rules on foreign
residency status.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said Taiwan's situation is unique and claimed that
it is "obviously wrong" for individuals  holding government posts to have the
attitude of "having a lifejacket in reserve" by holding residency status of
another country.</P>
      <P>Kuan said she will fully support the KMT's amendment if it is "playing on the
level, " but expressed concern, however, that the move by the ruling party might
only be "some sort of ploy."</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Designers' Week opened Saturday in Taipei City to inspire people with
design forums and exhibitions of works by local designers, event organizer Chou
Hsiang-yun said that day.</P>
      <P>Chou said the event, titled "Design and Beyond, " is aimed at creating a
platform for local designers to show their creativity and for people who are
interested in the design industry to learn about the work of local designers.</P>
      <P>Visitors will see over 250 design works in 10 categories. An exhibition in the
category "Play with Eating Culture" showcases creative dining utensils that
suggest new views of eating culture, and "50 Pleasures in the Study" inspires
visitors on how to fill the needs of a study with designers' creative ideas,
said Chou.</P>
      <P>The "City Yeast-Balcony Project, " displays Taiwanese designers' ideas about how
a balcony in the city can contribute to improving citizens' lifestyles, while
the "Having a Perfect Life is Easy" show presents designers' ideas about how a
perfect life can be achieved through imperfect objects, Chou said.</P>
      <P>The public is also welcome to attend forums to be presided over by lacquer
artist Huang Li-shu and graphic designer Lee Ken-tsai, as well as Japan's
package designer Saihei Makinami, Chou went on.</P>
      <P>The event, which is being held for the second year, was commissioned by the
Taipei city government and the Industrial Bureau under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, Chou added.</P>
      <P>This year's event has more design projects on show and many works conveying the
idea of environmental protection in surprising ways, Chou said. One designer has
turned a discarded lunchbox into a lampshade and another has created an ashtray
made of coffee grounds.</P>
      <P>This year's event covers three venues, with most of the works displayed at the
Xinyi Citizen Meeting House, while others are on display at the Taipei Artist
Village and at the Xue Xue Institute.</P>
      <P>All the exhibitions are open 10 a.m.-8 p.m. and will run through July 4, Chou

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou affirmed at a workshop on green technology Saturday that
green technology is the key to building up a sustainable Taiwan and resolving
the dilemma of economic development versus protecting the environment.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at the first Sustainable Green Technology Symposium  held
by the  Graduate  Institute  of Environmental Engineering, National Taiwan
University, Ma said the Taiwanese cannot neglect the regulations of the Kyoto
Protocol, as even though the country is not a signatory, it has an obligation to
reduce carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, where most of the world's notebooks are made, comes top in the area of
information communication technology. But if we do not pay attention to carbon
emissions, we will not be able to escape economic sanctions," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He further noted four mains areas for Taiwan's green technology development,
including energy-saving and carbon-reducing technology, especially the
development of carbon capture and storage techniques and renewable energy,
resource recycling technology, clean technology and nature restoration
technology.</P>
      <P>Ma also vowed to establish an energy-saving and carbon-reducing technology
development fund to make Taiwan's technology industry greener, saying that his
administration will try to raise the development budget to 3 percent of the
gross domestic product, instead of the current 2.52 percent.</P>
      <P>Taking the Wanhua Sports Center as an example, Ma said that even though the
total cost of construction was much higher than other centers, the building can
save a considerable cost on energy every month.</P>
      <P>To make Taiwan a sustainable society, "it is the total cost that should  be
taken into consideration  rather  than the initial investment, " said Ma.</P>
      <P>The Wanhua Sports Center, located in the south of Taipei and inaugurated in
2007, conforms to green building regulations, as it uses solar energy and
energy-saving materials.</P>
      <P>The president also urged the public to change its behavior and attitudes, which
he described as the real key to sustainable development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pre-mRNA splicing reversible: study</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwanese microbiologists have observed for the first time that reverse
modifications exist in the splicing process of precursor messenger ribonucleic
acid (pre-mRNA) -- a mechanism that is key to genetic functions, according to
local news reports Saturday.</P>
      <P>The findings suggest that mistakes made during pre-mRNA splicing can be remedied
to prevent the development of genetic disorders, said Cheng Soo-chen, a
distinguished research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Molecular
Biology who participated in the research.</P>
      <P>The discovery by Cheng and Tseng Chi-kang -- a doctoral student at the Institute
of Microbiology and Immunology of National Yang-Ming University -- has been
presented in the June 27 issue of Science magazine, a renowned journal published
by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</P>
      <P>In genetics, RNA splicing is defined as a process that occurs after
transcription  to prepare  the pre-mRNA  for  following translation.
Transcription  is a process  by which hereditary information contained in DNA is
copied to pre-mRNA, while translation is a mechanism by which mRNA is made to
produce protein.</P>
      <P>During RNA splicing, introns in the pre-mRNA string are removed and exons
divided by introns are reconnected to each other to compose a mature mRNA.
Introns are derived from "intragenic regions, " which are the non-coding
sections on pre-mRNA, while exons are the "expressed regions" that contain
genetic information.</P>
      <P>Biologists have long suspected that RNA splicing should be reversible if RNA
sections are found to be removed or joined mistakenly. However, no evidence has
been established to date.</P>
      <P>Fifteen percent of genetic disorder diseases are related to faulty RNA splicing,
including thalassemia, spinal muscular atrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa, said
Cheng.</P>
      <P>"Although our results have medical potential, it is too early to determine if
they are applicable to clinical use," he noted.</P>
      <P>"Controlled and manipulated reverse modifications to RNA splicing can only
alleviate the syndromes by inducing the modified RNA to produce near-normal
proteins, " Cheng warned, adding that "such genetic disorders can only be cured
by gene therapy."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the start of summer vacation draws near, more and more students are looking
for part-time jobs for the two-month break, with most of them saying they need
money to pay for their living costs, according to the results of a survey
released Saturday by the Taipei-based 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>More than 76 percent of the surveyed students who had applied for jobs on the
online employment service network said they must work to earn money to live,
while over 61 percent said they need work experience and some 50 percent said
they need the money to pay tuition fees or education loans.</P>
      <P>The number surpassed 100 percent because respondents were allowed to choose more
than one answer to the question of why they want to work during the summer
vacation.</P>
      <P>Notably, 7.73 percent of the respondents said they want money to buy luxury
designer products, according to the survey that was conducted online June 6-19.
A total of 1,776 valid samples were collected.</P>
      <P>The survey had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Asked about their conditions for selecting a job, 70.9 percent of the
respondents said their first consideration is that the workplace has to be close
to where they live, 45.3 percent said it depends on how much they get paid, and
40.75 percent said a safe and non-shady workplace is their first consideration.</P>
      <P>1111 Job Bank spokesman  Ryan Wu analyzed that increasing transport costs caused
by fuel price hikes is the reason job seekers list the travel distance as their
top consideration.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that a trend toward working in the summer vacation is increase
among students in Taiwan because of an overall increase in consumer prices, with
90.37 percent of the respondents saying they plan to work this summer, with
74.49 percent planning to find part time work and 15.88 percent having already
found a job.</P>
      <P>The percentage is markedly higher than the 85.66 percent recorded last year,
1111 Job Bank said.</P>
      <P>In terms of wages, students who already have summer jobs said they earn an
average NT$105 (US$3.46) per hour and work an average 25.84 hours per week.</P>
      <P>However, those who have not yet found work said they expect NT$112 per hour,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The poll results also show that the top 10 jobs among students seeking or having
part-time work are working at a restaurant (45.55 percent) ; office clerk (33.08
percent) ; data entry personnel (28.41 percent) ; school assistant (22.24

      <P>The LJMBS was founded in 1983 in Fulong township in northern Taiwan's Taipei
County by Buddhist Master Hsin Tao with the aim of promoting Buddhism as well as
harmony and co-existence of different religions and communities.</P>
      <P>According to a LJMBS press release, the celebration will start with welcoming a
statue of a golden Buddha to the monastery, followed by an activity in which
1,000 followers will hike from the foot of the hill to the monastery, which is
situated on the top of the ridge.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a hall in the monastery that followers are normally not allowed to
enter and a closed-door grotto where Master Hsin Tao practiced Buddhism more
than two decades ago will be opened to the public, said the press release.</P>
      <P>A vegetarian lunch will also be provided, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>In order to allow the visitors to commemorate their ancestors, the LJMBS said it

      <P>An agreement aimed at suspending longlining for tuna was signed by four fishery

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (COA) held a large-scale flowering plant exhibition
outside Taipei City Hall Saturday to promote the domestic flower industry.</P>
      <P>Some 30 booths were set up by flower grower organizations and agricultural

      <P>City and county chiefs in southern Taiwan should urge the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to formulate policies that help broaden the scope of
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, ruling Kuomintang Deputy Secretary-General Chang
Jung-kung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal via a press release in response to criticism from several
mayors, magistrates and tourism industry representatives that the
administration's arrangements for weekend direct charter flights between Taiwan
and China are unfair to the people of southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The flights are scheduled to begin July 4, with a total of 36 flights to be
operated by Taiwanese airlines and Chinese carriers during the first weekend,
based on June 13 accords signed by both sides.</P>
      <P>According to the terms of the agreement, the services from July 4-7 will cover
five Chinese cities and six airports in Taiwan. Only one flight will land at
Kaohsiung International Airport in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is not politics but the market that is the main reason for the
arrangements, Chang said the decision "had nothing to do with the preferences of
President Ma Ying-jeou or the KMT."</P>
      <P>The decision on which airports to use is based purely on where the passengers
are, Chang pointed out.</P>
      <P>Commending the protest as a "sound intention to safeguard the interests of
southern cities and counties, " Chang suggested that the mayors and magistrates
urge the DPP to show goodwill to cross-strait exchanges carried out by the
government.</P>
      <P>He went on to rebut the propaganda of some broadcasting stations based in the
south that have denigrated Chinese tourists, adding that local governments are
responsible for promoting the correct concepts of exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, as encouraging the people of both Taiwan and China to engage in further
friendship and bilateral interaction is what matters.</P>

festivals in the past few years, such as the Spring Festival, to transport
Taiwanese businessmen operating in China back to Taiwan for family reunions, the
executive told CNA.</P>
      <P>The flight will return to Taiwan one hour after landing, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has banned direct scheduled flights ever since it split from China in

flight services marks a breakthrough in the long-stagnant cross-strait transport
links.</P>

      <P>With just a week to go before the first direct charter  flight from China
arrives in Taiwan,  tourism businesses around the island are making a variety of
efforts to attract Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"With the arrival of Chinese tourists in July, the tourism industry is expected
to make a profit of NT$60 billion in the first year, rising to NT$200 billion in
the fourth year, " You Guo-chien, vice chairman of the Janfusan Fancyworld
resort, said Saturday at a conference focusing on developments and breakthroughs
in tourism in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Janfusan Fancyworld, located in Yunlin County in southern Taiwan, is one of the
country's most popular amusement parks.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed June 13 by Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation
and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, 36 round-trip weekend direct charter flights are scheduled for the July
4 weekend, with Taiwanese airlines and Chinese carriers each operating 18.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the daily ceiling on the entry of Chinese tourists will be
capped at 3,000, making an annual total of 1.1 million people. In four years,
the ceiling is expected to be raised to 10,000 per day.</P>
      <P>Seeking to grab a slice of the considerable market, Taiwanese tourism business
operators have been trying to improve the quality of both their hardware and
service.</P>
      <P>For example, several businesses in Guguan, a famous thermal spring resort in
Taichung County,  central Taiwan, have asked geologists to examine their thermal
springs so that they can apply for hot spring certification.</P>
      <P>Tourism operators are also hoping to attract Chinese tourists with novelty
items.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung, Taiwan's southernmost county, several large leisure farms said they
are ready to receive Chinese tourists with high quality services and rare plants
and animals on display.</P>
      <P>"Our team already receives two Chinese groups per month on average, " said Chen
Wen-chin, a farmer who is a member of a flower production and marketing team in
the county's Zhutian township.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of the dancing lady orchid variety grown by Chen's team are
exported to Japan and the high quality has attracted many Chinese officials and
experts to visit their farm, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A plan turn the orchid farm into a leisure farm is underway, Chen went on,
adding that the farm will have opportunities to win Chinese tourists' hearts, as
the geography and climate in China are not suitable for growing the flower.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a crocodile farm in the area is also confident of attracting Chinese
tourists with its collection.</P>
      <P>"Leisure agriculture is just beginning to develop in China, providing activities
such as fishing, unlike leisure farms in Taiwan, which combine various
activities with ecological education, " said Li Chung-shang, secretary-general
of the Pingtung Leisure Agriculture Development Association, adding that many
Chinese groups have visited leisure farms in Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Nature's Garden Restaurant, a farm famous for its herb garden and meals,
hopes to receive tourists from not only China but also those from Malaysia,
Singapore and Hong Kong, and requires its staff to take English courses.</P>
      <P>Another  member of the Taiwan Leisure  Farming Development Association added the
association is also taking measures to enhance fire control equipment and
service quality in farms around the country.</P>

be added, such as a place for indigenous Tsou tribe traditional singing and
dancing performances, according to Jhong Fu-song, Alishan National Scenic Area
Administration director.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan pledged Saturday that the performance of his Cabinet
will be gradually improved.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while attending a coordination meeting of mayors
and magistrates of the ruling Kuomintang in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said communications between his Cabinet and local governments have been
inadequate and expressed hope that the communications will be stepped up.</P>
      <P>Amid criticism that his Cabinet has not lived up to public expectations, Liu
said his office has been under tremendous pressure from the presidential
campaign slogan of "immediate improvement."</P>
      <P>He said that while it was indeed a resounding slogan, it would have been better
to have promised an immediate "gradual" improvement.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that when he assumed the premiership May 20, Taiwan had already frozen
oil prices for six months, although during the same period, international oil
prices had surged by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Taking a cue from the experience of South Korea, he said that if the prices of
basic goods are frozen, the move can backfire. A twisted market mechanism can
lead to out-of-control consumer price increases, he added.</P>
      <P>This, he said, is why the Cabinet announced price hikes of gasoline and diesel
at the end of May, but also put complementary measures in place, he said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet then announced an economic stimulus plan to boost domestic demand
through local infrastructure projects with the aim of contributing to the
overall economy, Liu added.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development has estimated that because of
the economic stimulus plan, the overall economy should grow by 0.45 percent from
the previous estimate, while the gross domestic product could reach 4.8 percent.</P>
      <P>In terms of inflation, Liu said he hopes that the consumer price index increase
will be 3.3 percent this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central bank releases first financial stability report</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
06/28/08  19:07:32
(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China has released its first financial
stability report, which covers the financial situation in 2007, with future
reports to be released every six months.</P>
      <P>The report is part of the central bank's efforts to join a global trend in
issuing such reports, it said in a statement Friday.</P>
      <P>In the report, the central bank predicts that local households' financial
burdens are likely to increase due to rising inflation and higher interest on
mortgages.</P>
      <P>The increase in interest rates is the result of the expiring grace period of
over 80 percent loan-to-value (LTV) ratio loans borrowed by local families two
years ago, said Fred Chen, head of the central  bank's financial  inspection
department,  at a press conference.</P>
      <P>The forecast was nevertheless made based on real estate market statistics
collected as of the end of last year, the central bank explained.</P>
      <P>The report also predicts that local household real incomes will decrease as
local families will need to allot more money from their incomes to pay the
higher interest each month and buy goods, the prices of which have also
increased.</P>
      <P>The report also says that real estate market prices were still on the rise last
year and that house and apartment rental rates were slowly climbing.</P>
      <P>However, trading in the real estate market was cooling down amid a slowing
economy, the report adds.</P>
      <P>The trading is likely to decline due to the rising number of vacant houses and
banks' stricter requirements for applying for housing loans, the report
continues.</P>
      <P>In addition, the report indicates that the total amount of household loans has
been going up over the years, partly because the government launched a series of
preferential housing loan packages since 2003, when interest rates were low.</P>
      <P>The report also attributes the cause to the efforts of banks to expand their
consumer financial business since that time.</P>
      <P>Local household  loans totaled NT$10.52  trillion (US$346.3 billion) as of the
end of last year, up 3 percent from the previous year, while the amount of money
loaned in the form of mortgages grew 6 percent, the report points out.</P>
      <P>Of the total household loans in 2007, 67 percent were mortgages, 24 percent were
working capital loans and less than 3 percent were credit card loans, the report
says.</P>
      <P>Local families' debt burdens were higher than those in Singapore, South Korea
and Japan, but lower than those in Australia and the United States, according to
the report.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung County in southern Taiwan opened its first "English village" Saturday,
with facilities enabling students to practice real life English in the immersion
style of teaching.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Magistrate Young Chiu-hsing expressed hope at the opening ceremony
that students and teachers can make good use of the village to learn and teach
English effectively.</P>
      <P>The  village  provides  various  simulated  English-language scenarios,
including a hospital, bank, hotel, airport, library and classrooms.</P>
      <P>Both students and instructors are obliged to speak English in the village, which
purports to offer an "overseas experience" for students.</P>
      <P>Students  can learn how to use English to order food in restaurants, speak to a
doctor in a hospital, mail a letter at the post office, and shop for groceries
in a supermarket, Yang said, adding that the village's facilities and learning
materials will increase in the future.</P>
      <P>The "English village, " constructed in unused classrooms at the Tsai Wen
Elementary School in the county's Luchu township, took a year to complete at a
cost of NT$6 million (US$197,530), Yang said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung county government staff visited South Korea last August to learn about
that country's  operation of language learning villages, upon which they based
the Kaohsiung facility, Yang went on.</P>
      <P>There will be a series of one-day learning tours for the county's elementary and
junior high students from September, and several other "English villages" will
be built in the future, Yang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu has recently won an improved rating in terms of her
administrative performance, but the achievement has not satisfied her and she
said Saturday that as there are still many citizens unhappy with her service,
she needs to work harder.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) published earlier in the day
the results of its latest poll on public satisfaction with the Kaohsiung city
government headed by Chen, who is a DPP member.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that Chen won the support of 66.2 percent of  the  poll
respondents,  while  28.4  percent  expressed dissatisfaction with her
performance in her second year in office.</P>
      <P>In  comparison,  a similar  survey  conducted  by  a city government-contracted
public opinion research company in March 2007 showed public satisfaction with
Chen's performance standing at 34.9 percent.</P>
      <P>After reading the DPP survey report, Chen said the satisfaction rating only
means that her performance passed the 60-point basic score.</P>
      <P>"It is nothing to brag about, " she said, noting that the dissatisfaction degree
has warned her she must work harder.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, she won higher approval than disapproval for her performance
in the fields of cultural and tourism development, city environment, living
quality and traffic conditions.</P>
      <P>In the ratings for industrial development, social welfare, education  quality
and water resource quality,  the degree of satisfaction was close to that of
dissatisfaction, while in social order and employment opportunities, more
citizens were dissatisfied with Chu's performance than those who said they were
happy.</P>
      <P>The survey results also show that 80.8 percent of the respondents sensed
progress on the city's development, 79.6 percent expressed confidence in future
developments and 84.6 percent said they feel proud to be a citizen of the
southern port city.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted June 16 and June 19-20 through telephone interviews
with voters living in the city. A total of 1,054 valid samples were produced
with a margin of error of 3.08 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan bank wins suit against fugitive tycoon's wife in U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  June 27 (CNA)
06/28/08  20:09:49

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese fugitive tycoon's wife must pay NT$740.85 million (US$24.29 million)
to a Taiwan-based bank, a judge in Los Angeles ruled Friday.</P>
      <P>Elihn M. Berle, a judge of the Superior Court of California, ordered Wang Chin
She-ying, wife of Wang You-theng, founder of the financially distressed Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, to pay the principal and interest owed by the Rebar group to
Mega International Commercial Bank, as Wang Chin was the guarantor of the
group's loans.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin, who has 60 days to appeal according to U.S. law, was not present in
court when Berle announced the ruling.</P>
      <P>Thomas Robins and Hung Maan-huei, representing Mega Bank, said they were
"gratified" to hear the verdict, saying that the bank can now begin to recover
the money according to the law.</P>
      <P>Wang Chin has to pay the principle of NT$663.496 million, plus interest of
NT$77.35 million, according to the court ruling.</P>
      <P>Berle also said she must pay all expenses and legal fees since the court began
to handle the case in January, and that this amount will be announced later
after careful calculations.</P>
      <P>The judge ordered Wang Chin not to transfer stocks of OmniBank in California
under her name before paying her debts, but Mega's lawyers pointed out that she
had already transferred most of the stocks to her son early this year before the
litigation process began.</P>
      <P>A high-end property worth US$300 million under Wang Chin's name in suburban Los
Angeles will be one of the first targets for recovering the money.</P>
      <P>Hung said that although the bank only told Wang Chin to repay more than US$24
million this time, the actual debts owned by the Rebar group are far greater
than that.</P>
      <P>There are nine other cases demanding loan repayments by Rebar that are currently
being handled in Taiwanese lawsuits, court trials or auctions.</P>
      <P>Mega Bank, the Rebar Group's largest creditor, filed suit in the Los Angeles
court Feb. 5, 2007, initially hoping to recover US$210 million, but later
adjusted the figure after reassessing their strategy, according to bank
officials.</P>
      <P>They said they decided to collect part of the debts in the first stage of the
legal process and to seek to collect the full amount later.</P>
      <P>The Rebar scandal came to light in January 2007 after the group's China Rebar
Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. applied for insolvency
restructuring, triggering a run on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar affiliate.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese authorities placed Wang Chin and her husband on the country's
most-wanted list in January 2007 and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have
them repatriated to Taiwan to face charges.</P>
      <P>In March that year, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang You-theng and 106 others
involved in the Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud,
money laundering and insider trading. They are seeking a prison sentence of 30
years and an unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion for him.</P>
      <P>According to initial estimates, the total losses caused by the Wang family's
systematic siphoning off of Rebar Group subsidiaries' assets amounted to NT$300
billion -- about one-fourth of Taiwan's annual tax revenues.</P>

      <P>Sports can help forge good relations between the children of Taiwan's new
immigrant parents from Southeast Asia and their local peers, a social services
group said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su He,  secretary-general  of the Canlove  Social Services Association, cited
the latest Ministry of Education statistics in saying that the number of
Taiwan's new immigrant children has surpassed 100,000.</P>
      <P>Su said these children encounter many obstacles in peer relations due to poor
language communication, their ethnic backgrounds, the lower social status of
their parents and insufficient care from parents.</P>
      <P>Su urged teachers to pay special attention to these children and to organize
more sports to help them form better bonds with their peers.</P>
      <P>Su made the appeal after the association organized a sports event at an
elementary school in Taipei Wednesday that was attended by nearly 400 students
-- including those with parents from China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines
and Indonesia -- from 13 primary schools.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China should put the issue of setting up joint crime intelligence
centers to combat crime on their future negotiation agenda, local police
scholars said Friday.</P>
      <P>As cross-Taiwan Strait relations have been warming up since the May 20
inauguration of the new Kuomintang (KMT) government, which favors closer trade
ties with China, the two sides should take the opportunity to tackle cross-
strait crime, said Hsieh Li-kung, a professor at Central Police University, at a
seminar held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The appeal came amid an increasing number of cases in recent years of drug
smuggling, human trafficking, Internet crime, fraud and money laundering
involving criminals on both sides.</P>
      <P>The lack of a joint crime-fighting mechanism between Taiwan and China allows
criminals to evade justice by fleeing across the strait, which has had a serious
impact on the social order on the two sides, according to a news release issued
by the organizers of the event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China should therefore consider signing a pact to establish centers
in both China's southeastern coastal city of Xiamen and on the Taiwan-controlled
island of Kinmen, Hsieh suggested.</P>
      <P>These centers could offer judicial assistance to law enforcement officials on
both sides, he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the expected influx of Chinese tourists from July 4, the scholars
urged the government to formulate complementary measures to prevent cross-strait
crimes relating to the tourist arrivals.</P>
      <P>They called on related government agencies to step up the exchange of
intelligence and cooperation prior to the arrival of up to 3,000 Chinese
tourists per day.</P>
      <P>The scholars also discussed the idea of setting up a "community policing system"
in Taiwan to enhance crime prevention.</P>
      <P>The system is aimed at forging a partnership between law enforcement officials
and local communities to deter crime, said Chen Kuo-an, head of the National
Police Agency's Public Relations Office.</P>
      <P>Describing the system as a new strategy, Chen said crime-fighting efforts would
be more effective with the participation of local citizens in helping maintain
social order.</P>

      <P>Foreign investors have sold NT$84.8 billion-worth  more of Taiwanese shares than

      <P>Cabinet sources remained tight-lipped about the reports, saying only that

foreign investors and encourage them to invest in the local bourse.</P>
      <P>The sources refused to disclose the time or venue of the meeting, saying that
they were respecting the wishes of the executives, who did not want their names

    <HEADLINE>DOH head calls for community suicide prevention network</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Grassroots community suicide prevention networks should be established
throughout the country to help curtail suicide attempts and reduce the suicide
mortality rate, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Lin Fang-yue said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin said education programs should also be implemented to help young people
understand that there are many hurdles to overcome in life and that suicide is
never the answer.</P>
      <P>"We should educate young people that life is often full of tests, challenges and
frustrations and that they should not be daunted by setbacks but should instead
gear up to overcome the difficulties on their roads to success, " Lin said,
adding that such education is critical, as only those who have such an
understanding can treasure their life.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while attending the inauguration of a community support
network for suicide prevention  in Kaohsiung County's Taliao village, in which
the suicide mortality rate has surpassed the national average and the southern
county's average for the past three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>In the face of steadily rising suicide mortality rates and suicide emerging as
one of the top-10 causes of death in Taiwan, Lin said a national center was
inaugurated in December 2005 to pool resources and coordinate efforts for
suicide prevention and related care delivery.</P>
      <P>Through the efforts of the National Suicide Prevention Center and assistance of
non-governmental organizations, Lin said Taiwan's suicide mortality rate dropped
to 17.2 persons out of every 100,000 in 2007, down 11 percent from the 2006
level. "It marked the first decline since 1994," he added.</P>
      <P>As suicidal persons usually would tell someone close to them their intention,
Lin said a publicity campaign has been launched to educate people that everyone
is obliged to do his or her part in helping prevent suicide.</P>
      <P>"All-out efforts should be made to promote the core values of 'cherishing life,
restoring hope' and that 'suicide prevention is everybody's business," Lin
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said
the county's health bureau has worked hard for the establishment of a community
suicide prevention network in Taliao village in the hope that every resident can
become a doorkeeper to help curtail suicide.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Kaohsiung County's suicide mortality rate slid from 20.9
persons per 100,000 in 2006 to 16.6 in 2007, but the rate has remained at around
25 persons per 100,000 in Taliao village.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we have overcome various difficulties installing a
grassroots support network in the village to help prevent residents from killing
themselves for any reason," Yang said, adding he is hopeful that similar systems
can be copied in the county's other townships in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the National Suicide Prevention Center, also said at
the inauguration ceremony that suicide is a global issue, with one failed
suicide attempt reported around the world every 40 seconds. In Taiwan, one
suicide attempt is reported in less than two hours.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, elderly people are far more likely to commit suicide than
young people. Nevertheless, he said that although suicide rate among young
people registered an 11 percent decline last year, the ratio among those aged
15-24 didn't drop.</P>
      <P>"We need to pay more heed to well-being and mental health of those in this age
group," Lee added.</P>
      <P>He further said relationship problems, depression, financial straits, family
life and chronic diseases are the five major causes of suicide.</P>
      <P>As to suicide prevention measures, Lee said the most important steps include
identifying high-risk groups, properly responding to their needs or demands, and
seeking appropriate support or referring cases to suitable institutions.</P>

      <P>As expected, Taiwan's Tsung-Hua Yang advanced beyond the first round of the boys
singles event at Junior Wimbledon Saturday,  defeating Jose Hernandez of the

      <P>Yang, who won the junior boys singles title at the French Open June 9, said
after the match that he was pleased with the win as it marked a good start.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yang said he didn't play well in the game as he was still adapting
himself to the grasscourt event. This is his first presence at Wimbledon, the
world's oldest tennis championship.</P>
      <P>With a stack of outstanding Gram Slam results behind him -- runner-up at the
Australian Open in January and champion at the French Open earlier this month,
Yang is the second top seed at Junior Wimbledon.</P>
      <P>Declaring his confidence of entering at least semi-finals at Wimbledon, the 17
-year-old ace said he is hopeful that all his fans back at home will cheer and
pray for him.</P>
      <P>Yang was the first Taiwanese junior player to emerge as champion at Roland

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged Cabinet members Saturday to reach out to grassroots
people and show empathy for their hardships in the face of current economic
volatility.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a dinner hosted by him at Taipei Guest House in honor of
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and all members of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As the dinner took place a day after the local bourse plummeted to a five-month
low, Ma encouraged all members of the administrative team to stay calm and cope
with the situation with a cool head.</P>
      <P>The local stock exchanges lost 263.04 points, or 3.37 percent, to 7,548.76
Friday, with investors worried about a possible economic slowdown following new
spikes in international crude oil prices and the central bank's Thursday
announcement of hikes in key interest rates and bank reserve ratios.</P>
      <P>Ma said although Taiwan is facing imported inflation fueled by oil prices
surges, its economic fundamentals are not bad. "We should deal with the current
challenges with composure and confidence, " he added.</P>
      <P>In the face of a bearish stock market, Ma said he hopes all Cabinet members can
put themselves in people's shoes and seek their understanding  of the
government's determination to make every possible effort to revitalize the
domestic economy and improve their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>After the Legislative Yuan ends its current interpellation session, Ma said

    <HEADLINE>DOH head calls for community suicide prevention network</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 28 (CNA)
06/29/08  11:07:43
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Grassroots community suicide prevention networks should be established
throughout the country to help curtail suicide attempts and reduce the suicide
mortality rate, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Lin Fang-yue said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin said education programs should also be implemented to help young people
understand that there are many hurdles to overcome in life and that suicide is
never the answer.</P>
      <P>"We should educate young people that life is often full of tests, challenges and
frustrations and that they should not be daunted by setbacks but should instead
gear up to overcome the difficulties on their roads to success, " Lin said,
adding that such education is critical, as only those who have such an
understanding can treasure their life.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while attending the inauguration of a community support
network for suicide prevention  in Kaohsiung County's Taliao village, in which
the suicide mortality rate has surpassed the national average and the southern
county's average for the past three consecutive years.</P>
      <P>In the face of steadily rising suicide mortality rates and suicide emerging as
one of the top-10 causes of death in Taiwan, Lin said a national center was
inaugurated in December 2005 to pool resources and coordinate efforts for
suicide prevention and related care delivery.</P>
      <P>Through the efforts of the National Suicide Prevention Center and assistance of
non-governmental organizations, Lin said Taiwan's suicide mortality rate dropped
to 17.2 persons out of every 100,000 in 2007, down 11 percent from the 2006
level. "It marked the first decline since 1994," he added.</P>
      <P>As suicidal persons usually would tell someone close to them their intention,
Lin said a publicity campaign has been launched to educate people that everyone
is obliged to do his or her part in helping prevent suicide.</P>
      <P>"All-out efforts should be made to promote the core values of 'cherishing life,
restoring hope' and that 'suicide prevention is everybody's business," Lin
added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing said
the county's health bureau has worked hard for the establishment of a community
suicide prevention network in Taliao village in the hope that every resident can
become a doorkeeper to help curtail suicide.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Kaohsiung County's suicide mortality rate slid from 20.9
persons per 100,000 in 2006 to 16.6 in 2007, but the rate has remained at around
25 persons per 100,000 in Taliao village.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we have overcome various difficulties installing a
grassroots support network in the village to help prevent residents from killing
themselves for any reason," Yang said, adding he is hopeful that similar systems
can be copied in the county's other townships in the future.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-pin, director of the National Suicide Prevention Center, also said at
the inauguration ceremony that suicide is a global issue, with one failed
suicide attempt reported around the world every 40 seconds. In Taiwan, one
suicide attempt is reported in less than two hours.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, elderly people are far more likely to commit suicide than
young people. Nevertheless, he said that although suicide rate among young
people registered an 11 percent decline last year, the ratio among those aged
15-24 didn't drop.</P>
      <P>"We need to pay more heed to well-being and mental health of those in this age
group," Lee added.</P>
      <P>He further said relationship problems, depression, financial straits, family
life and chronic diseases are the five major causes of suicide.</P>
      <P>As to suicide prevention measures, Lee said the most important steps include
identifying high-risk groups, properly responding to their needs or demands, and
seeking appropriate support or referring cases to suitable institutions.</P>

      <P>Free exchange of Taiwanese and Chinese currency is expected to kick off in
Taiwan Monday -- a relaxation of policy in line with Taiwan's imminent opening
to Chinese tourists and direct cross-strait weekend charter flights, banking
sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Local banking institutions and foreign currency exchange outlets will be allowed
to apply for the permission to handle exchanges between the new Taiwan dollar
and the Chinese yuan from Monday, according to a package of regulations passed
by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) was screening applications
Sunday filed by 13 banks which operate 1,500 branches islandwide for the yuan-NT
exchanges.</P>
      <P>"The first batch of permits are expected to be issued Monday at the earliest," a
CBC official said that day.</P>
      <P>The CBC could not guarantee a sufficient supply of Chinese yuan for customers in
Taiwan in the initial stage, as China's monetary authority has not promised to
provide Taiwan with yuan regularly or sufficiently, the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese citizens and foreign visitors can do yuan-NT exchanges to an amount of
up to 20,000 yuan per person per day, the official noted.</P>
      <P>Initially, currency exchange outlets, such as those in hotels, souvenir shops
and airports, will only be able to buy yuan from customers but will not be
allowed to sell that currency, he added.</P>
      <P>The newly-liberalized service is aimed at meeting the expected demand from
Chinese tourists expected to flood in from July 18 after Taiwan and China signed
agreements June 13 for the opening of Taiwan to increased numbers of Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>In the long run, the government will continue talks with the Chinese authorities
through its semi-official intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on the
issue of building a cross-strait currency clearance mechanism to "normalize  and
systemize" the clearance of Taiwanese and Chinese currencies, the CBC official
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to launch the weekend flights between Taiwan and China July
4, marking a historic chapter in Taiwan-China exchanges.</P>
      <P>At present, a maximum of 1,000 Chinese tourists are allowed to visit Taiwan each
day, but the number will be raised to 3,000 after July 4, and eventually to
10,000 per day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No resignation from representative to Germany: Foreign Ministry</HEADLINE>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Sunday that it had not received any
notice of resignation from You Ching, Taiwan's representative to Germany, but
will respect the will of politically  appointed diplomats by the previous
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration should they decide to quit.</P>
      <P>Since the Kuomintang (KMT) took office May 20, the issue of whether DPP
political  appointees  should resign has become a controversial issue.</P>
      <P>So far,  several  DPP  officials  already  tendered  their resignations,
including representative to the United States Joseph Wu, representative to the
European Union Michael Kau, representative to Japan Koh Se-kai and
representative to Brazil Chou Shu-yeh.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou appointed Jason Yuan June 25 as the new representative to
the United States. However, the Presidential Office has not announced new
appointments for the other vacancies.</P>
      <P>"As of Sunday, the Foreign Ministry had not received a formal resignation from
You, " ministry spokesman Henry Chen said. "However, if he decides to quit, the
ministry will respect his decision."</P>
      <P>While stressing the ministry's respect for the decisions of DPP political
appointees, Chen said, however, that "nevertheless, instead of looking at
individual cases, the ministry will also make an overall assessment regarding
its personnel appointments."</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry will only evaluate officials on their professionalism and
abilities, he added.</P>
      <P>Contradicting  the  ministry,  however,  You confirmed  his resignation a day
earlier, saying that he issued his oral resignation to Foreign Minister
Francisco H.L. Ou during a meeting June 25.</P>
      <P>You said he told Ou that he tendered his resignation in order to allow the
government to make new and comprehensive personnel arrangements.</P>
      <P>"I believe that I am competent. However, if I cannot win trust from the
government, I should not and do not have to stay," he said.</P>
      <P>Opposition DPP legislators urged its members who continue to serve as government
officials and executives in state-run enterprises under the KMT administration
to resign to "avoid becoming scapegoats for the KMT government's incompetence."</P>
      <P>The appeal came after Representative to Japan Koh Se-kai resigned June 16 after
being called a "traitor" by KMT legislators over his handling of the aftermath
of a boat collision between a Japanese patrol vessel and a Taiwanese fishing
boat near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands June 10.</P>
      <P>You, however, said his resignation has nothing to do with the DPP's appeal.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Sunday that it will offer full
cooperation if first lady Chow Mei-ching decides to take part in a charity trip
organized by World Vision Taiwan to visit overseas disadvantaged children,
including those who are sponsored by the first family.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry will cooperate fully to organize the first lady's  foreign
visits upon receiving  instructions  from the Presidential Office," said MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>Miuer Lin, a senior public relations specialist of World Vision Taiwan confirmed
Sunday to CNA that Chow, who is a diplomatic ambassador of the organization, has
agreed to take part in its annual Child Sponsorship  project  in which the
organization  invites celebrities to visit disadvantaged children in foreign
countries to raise awareness of the charity.</P>
      <P>"Chow expressed great willingness to take part in the meaningful event, " Lin
said. "However, we still need to make careful planning and arrangements in
accordance with the first lady's schedule, " she added.</P>
      <P>In response to whether Chow is likely to make the trip in August, as President
Ma Ying-jeou might make his first state visit since taking office May 20 to
attend the inauguration ceremonies of two diplomatic allies of Taiwan --
Paraguay and the Dominican Republic -- Lin said that August will be too rushed,
as World Vision Taiwan will hold its annual 30 Hour Fast event at around the
same time.</P>
      <P>She noted that World Vision Taiwan has direct contact with the first lady rather
than the Presidential Office and therefore will arrange the visits to
accommodate Chow rather than the president.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said a day earlier that the office
cannot confirm whether the first lady will visit foreign countries.</P>
      <P>"But the Presidential Office will do all it can to facilitate any philanthropy-
related events for the first lady," Wang added.</P>
      <P>The first family has been long-time sponsor of World Vision Taiwan for
disadvantaged children in Taiwan and foreign countries such as Honduras, El
Salvador and Swaziland.</P>
      <P>Chow recently quit her job as chief of the department of legal affairs at Mega
International Commercial Bank, where she has worked for 27 years, and has
decided to devote her time to charity affairs.</P>
      <P>She has accepted offers to serve as honorary chairwoman of the Red Cross Society
of the Republic of China and as head of a cultural and educational foundation
under a Mega-affiliated bank.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Bureau plans to fine a local travel agency after three Chinese
tourists who came to Taiwan via a third country went missing on an unspecified
date earlier in the month, a bureau official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The three tourists were part of a 22-member tour group visiting Taiwan under the
arrangement of the Taipei-based Sightseeing Travel Service Co. The group was
scheduled to spend a night at a hotel in Jhongli, Taoyuan County, on the second
day of their tour, when the three were found to be missing, the official said.</P>
      <P>The travel agency reported they were missing to the Tourism Bureau June 19.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, travel agencies managing Chinese tourists are
required to deposit NT$2 million (US$65,600) to pay compensation to customers
when an agency is unable to fulfill its obligations and to pay penalties that
agencies could incur.</P>
      <P>The rules also stipulate that travel agencies can be fined NT$200,000 each time
one of their Chinese clients goes missing.</P>
      <P>As the three men failed to rejoin their group within 10 days, they have been
marked as illegal aliens and the travel agency faces a NT$600,000 fine,
according to the official.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened  its doors to group tours by certain categories of Chinese
citizens arriving via a third country or area in 2002, a total of 119 Chinese
tourists have absconded from their tour groups. Of these, 94 have been found and
deported to China, while 25 remain unaccounted for.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports to China from January to April surpassed 30 percent of the
country's total exports, recording US$26.09 billion (NT$793 billion) and
representing a rise of 20.3 percent year-on-year, according to the latest cross-
Taiwan Strait trade report recently released by the Bureau of Foreign Trade
(BOFT).</P>
      <P>The bureau's monthly report indicates intensified trade relations across the
Taiwan Strait in the first four months of 2008, with the total value of trade
showing an annual increase of 20.8 percent to US$36.39 billion, representing
21.5 percent of Taiwan's external trade value during the period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished the four-month period with a trade surplus of US$15.79 billion
in terms of China trade, rising 19.3 percent compared with the figures recorded
in the year-earlier period.</P>
      <P>During the period, exports to China gained 20.3 percent, with a value of
US$26.09 billion, capturing 30.1 percent of Taiwan's total export value during
the period, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>Imports from China, on the other hand, rose by a larger margin of 22 percent to
US$10.3 billion.</P>
      <P>"The  increase  in import  value  was the result  of the differentiation of
cross-strait industry sectors, which led to rising import demand from Taiwan for
electronic semi-finished goods and components, " the bureau said, adding that
the higher prices of imported steel and minerals from China also added to the
rising figures.</P>
      <P>Citing a continued export strength in trade with China, the bureau noted that
the US$7.02 billion recorded in April's exports to the Chinese market
represented an 18.6 percent rise year-on-year. "The growth was mainly due to
China's rising demand for Taiwanese electronic products and components," the
press statement explained.</P>
      <P>However, the report also indicated a lowered percentage of China's import market
occupied by Taiwanese products, reaching only 9.8 percent January-April and
representing a slide of 0.41 percentage points year-on-year.</P>
      <P>"With China's industrial sector focusing on diversification, its import demands
for iron, copper,  energy and agricultural and industrial raw materials are
getting stronger, " said the statement, adding that those commodities are not
Taiwan's exporting strengths.</P>
      <P>According to Chinese customs statistics, Taiwan ranked third in China's import
market, with US$35.76 billion trade value from January to April, lagging behind
Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The major Taiwanese exports to China are machinery equipment and components,
which together captured a trade value of US$9.1 billion during the four-month
period, representing 34.9 percent of the total exports to China, according to
the BOFT.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first fairtrade shop licensed by the Germany-headquartered Fairtrade
Labelling Organization (FLO) International opened in Taipei recently to enable
local consumers to buy Third World products at lower prices while making
donations upon purchase to benefit people from poor countries.</P>
      <P>Oko green, established and run by Hsu Wen-yen, who has studied in Britain, is a
cozy little coffee shop nestling in a quiet lane off Xuzhou Road, which offers
coffee beans -- both via the Internet or at his shop -- along with freshly made
coffee.</P>
      <P>There is no price list for Hsu's coffee. "You pay what you consider a reasonable
price, " said Hsu, who spent more than a year obtaining an FLO license to
operate an FLO fairtrade shop.</P>
      <P>Hsu obtained his FLO license in December 2007, paving the way for the opening in
April of his coffee shop, where he sells coffee beans from Africa, Latin America
and other Third World countries at much lower prices than those sold at
supermarkets or international food chains.</P>
      <P>Oko green's  coffee  beans are directly  supplied  by FLO International at
prices that include no extra middle-man costs.</P>
      <P>Hsu maintains a transparent cost-and-spending chart that can be monitored
directly by FLO International headquarters on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Under the FLO motto of Trade Not Aid, Hsu follows the FLO criteria of donating 1
percent of his business turnover each month to support FLO activities aimed at
helping people in poor Third World countries, including building power plants,
exploring new water sources, developing medical infrastructure and helping
people to escape poverty.</P>
      <P>Hsu himself donates NT$10 for each cup of coffee sold at his shop, an amount
that will accrue so that he can donate to local charity organizations, "to help
people from my own country, in efforts to save energy and cut carbon dioxide
emissions."</P>
      <P>Hsu became aware of FLO fairtrade operations several years ago, but knew that
Taiwan people had been purchasing FLO-certified Third World products via Japan
at "unreasonably high prices" due to the lack of any FLO presentation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He wanted to have an FLO-certified shop in Taiwan and started to contact the FLO
International head office in 2006, only to find that the road before him was
"long and winding."</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, he obtained an FLO business license Dec. 7, 2007,
issued by the FLO head office after it found that Hsu is a member of Taiwan's

      <P>Fairtrade certification  is a product certification  system designed to allow
people to identify products that meet agreed environmental, labor and
development standards. Overseen by a standard-setting body, FLO International,
and a certification body, FLO-CERT, the system involves independent auditing of

    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force led by Vice Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung decided Saturday to adopt a
series of measures, including enticing local insurance companies to invest in
the stock market, in the hope of stabilizing the plummeting share prices as well
as the long-term economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market suffered another big blow June 27, dropping 263.04 points,
or 3. 37 percent, to close at 7,548.76, as investors were spooked not only by an
overnight slide on Wall Street June 26 but also by hikes in interest rates and
bank reserve ratios announced the previous day.</P>
      <P>The task force was established June 27 with the participation of finance and
economic officials, including Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming and
Central Bank of the Republic of China Governor Perng Fai-nan.</P>
      <P>Following the first meeting of the ad-hoc group Saturday, eight measures were
announced by the Cabinet, such as encouraging the four government-run funds --
including the Labor Pension Funds -- and insurance funds to invest in local
stocks. The eight measures are:</P>
      <P>1 -- The four government-run funds are encouraged to choose stocks with good
credentials for long-term investment.</P>
      <P>2 -- With an estimated NT$8 trillion (US$263 billion) of total capital, local
insurance companies are encouraged by the Cabinet to invest in highly regarded
stocks and will also be guided to inject their money into public-sector
investments such as the government's i-Taiwan construction projects, to boost
local market demand.</P>
      <P>3 -- The Cabinet will utilize state-owned real estate property to establish land
exploration companies under the framework of financial holdings in a bid to
increase the value of land resources.</P>
      <P>4 -- The task force will adjust exchange traded funds (ETFs) risk factors of the
of Risk-Based Capital Ratio for life insurance companies, in an effort to
encourage more ETF investment from life insurance companies.</P>
      <P>5 -- The Cabinet will encourage non-government institutions to invest their
insurance funds.</P>
      <P>6 --- The Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) and Gre Tai Securities Market
will encourage companies to buy back their own stock.</P>
      <P>7 -- The Cabinet will ask listed companies in which the company boards do not
hold legally required amount of shares to make amends as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>8 -- The TSEC will encourage listed companies to hold investor conferences to
enhance investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Before the meeting, the vice premier urged market investors to remain positive,
saying that although foreign investors had sold some of their shares during the
recent drop, their money did not leave Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if a NT$500 billion National Stabilization Fund will also be activated to
bolster the market, Chiu said the government will evaluate that option.</P>

      <P>A majority of Taiwanese office workers based in China want to return to Taiwan
to work, while many of their peers in Taiwan want to go to China, according to
the results of an online poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by 1111 Job Bank, a major local online recruitment agency,
shows that 65.45 percent of the 10.58 percent of respondents who were or are
currently based in China said they prefer working in Taiwan even though they can
get higher salaries in China.</P>
      <P>The poll results show that 67.27 percent of the Taiwanese people polled received
an average monthly pay raise of NT$25,811 (about US$850) after they began
working in China.</P>
      <P>Allowed to give multiple responses,  49.09 percent of the respondents explained
that they wanted to work in Taiwan for family reasons, 27.27 percent said their
work in China fell short of their expectations, while 21.82 percent were not
optimistic about the prospects of their industries.</P>
      <P>Of those surveyed who have ever worked in China or are still working in China,
50.91 percent are posted by their companies in China for the long term, 25.45
percent regularly work at offices in China, while 14.55 percent often visit
China on an irregular basis, the poll indicates.</P>
      <P>Of these respondents, 50.91 percent observed that the biggest difference between
Taiwan's and China's working environments is the loyalty of employees.</P>
      <P>This percentage is followed 38.18 percent who think room for career development
is the biggest difference, 34.55 percent who think employees' professionalism is
the major difference, 32.73 percent who think the corporate hospitality culture
is the biggest difference and 29.09 percent who think wage growth is the main
difference, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 41.82 percent of those surveyed who have experience of working in
China believe that surviving in China requires strong professional skills, the
poll results show.</P>
      <P>Other respondents cited the ability to adapt to local customs and culture (36.36
percent), the ability to socialize with others (32.73 percent) , having official
connections (30.91 percent) and flexible personality (27.27 percent).</P>
      <P>Although a majority of China-based Taiwanese office workers wanted to return
home, 53.65 percent of the Taiwanese office workers responding to the same poll
said they would be willing to work in China, the poll notes.</P>
      <P>However, 58.1 percent of these respondents expressed worry that they might not
be able to compete with their Chinese counterparts, according to the results.</P>
      <P>Ryan Wu, chief operating officer of the job bank, predicted that the number of
Taiwanese office workers with one to six years of work experience who want to
work in China will continue to grow.</P>
      <P>Of those respondents who want to work in China, Wu went on, 83.17 percent said
they had greater willingness to head to China after the Kuomintang (KMT)
government, which took office May 20, launched more friendly policies toward
China.</P>
      <P>In addition, 45.4 percent of those who aspire to work in China said they want to
work in the information technology industry, while 42.86 percent would choose
the traditional manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>Also, the top five Chinese cities chosen as ideal working places are Shanghai
(56.51 percent) , Beijing (30.79 percent) , Shenzhen (20.95 percent) , Hong Kong
(16.83 percent) and Suzhou (15.56 percent), the poll reveals.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted between May 26 and June 8, with 1,299 valid samples. It
had a margin of error of 2.72 percentage points.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June  29  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan inspected quarantine and inspection facilities at
Kaohsiung International Airport in this southern city Sunday to see whether it
is ready to welcome Chinese tourists early next month.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the airport, Liu said the Cabinet knows that almost all of Taiwan's
eight airports that have been designated to welcome Chinese tourists fall short
of quarantine readiness in terms of both personnel and facilities.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet has already made preparations and relevant personnel have received
intensive training, " Liu said, adding that "properly trained personnel will be
assigned to the airports within days."</P>
      <P>Liu was accompanied by several government officials, including Vice Minister of
Transportation and Communications Oliver Fang-lai Yu and Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy Kuo-cheng Chang.</P>
      <P>The premier and his entourage were met by legislators of different political
affiliations who protested over what they claimed is the central government's
"unfair" treatment of airports in southern Taiwan with relation to arrangements
for the Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers voiced their displeasure with the fact that northern and central
Taiwanese airports will handle most of the weekend cross-strait charter flights
set to kick off July 4.</P>
      <P>Of the 36 cross-strait charters to be flown on the first weekend from July 4-7,
16 will serve Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and 13 will serve Taipei
Songshan Airport in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>Three flights will fly in and out of Taichung's Chingchuankang Airport in
central Taiwan, one flight will serve Hualien Airport in eastern Taiwan, and
three will serve Magong Airport on the outlying island county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>Although the CAA decided Friday to add one flight serving Kaohsiung
International Airport, "the move was made in a perfunctory manner and still does
not meet the needs of southern Taiwan, " ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
Huang Chao-shun claimed, despite the fact that the flights have been allocated
strictly according to passenger demand rather than according to any political
consideration.</P>
      <P>Responding to the legislators' criticism, Chang pointed out that it is not
politics but the market that is the reason for the arrangements, adding that the
decision "had nothing to do with the preferences of President Ma Ying-jeou or
the KMT."</P>
      <P>"The decision on which airports to use is based purely on where the passengers
are," Chang added.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu Railway Station in northern Taiwan, an elegant baroque building listed
as a provincial-level historic site, has been selected as the most popular
smoke-free railway station in Taiwan, according to a poll released Sunday.</P>
      <P>At an award presentation ceremony, Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) Director-
General Frank Fan said that with a view to increasing the public's appreciation
for the architectural beauty of various train stations and demonstrating the
state-run company's resolve to protect passengers' health, it conducted the poll
in collaboration with the Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the bureau, said the activity was part
of stepped-up efforts to promote public awareness of a new anti-smoking bill
under which smoking will be banned from Jan. 11, 2009 in most indoor public
places in Taiwan, including all modes of public transport and train and metro
stations.</P>
      <P>Smokers lighting up in banned areas will face fines of up to NT$10,000, while
operators of public places that do not post no smoking signs will be fined up to
NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Ou Cheng-bin, chief of the Hsinchu Railway Station, said the station  is
equipped  with plenty  of anti-smoking  logos and anti-tobacco symbols and
conveys the anti-smoking message via its public address system every hour.</P>
      <P>Around 35,000 people took part in the poll to choose the most beautiful smoke-
free stations, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>Rounding up the second to sixth most popular stations are Yilan in northeastern
Taiwan, Banchiao in the north, Tainan in the south and Tachia in the central
county of Taichung, according to the poll.</P>

      <P>The direct charter flights between Taiwan and China should be able to reduce the
likelihood of runaway Chinese tourists in Taiwan due to the Chinese government's
screening mechanism, a Taiwanese official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourists will not be able to take direct cross-strait charter flights --
to be launched July 4 -- from China to Taiwan unless they gain approval from the
Chinese authorities, said Liu Te-shun, spokesman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , Taiwan's supreme China policy coordinator.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities will not allow their citizens to visit Taiwan if they
find they have committed crimes or are likely to go missing in Taiwan, according
to Liu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chinese travel agencies will be required to bear responsibility if
any members of their tour groups run away in Taiwan, which will also help reduce
the number of absconding Chinese tourists, he went on.</P>
      <P>After the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights, the government will
still punish local travel agencies dealing with Chinese tourists with fines of
NT$200,000 (about US$6,584) for each runaway Chinese tourist on their rosters,
Liu went on.</P>
      <P>Liu also explained that repeat cases of missing Chinese tourists in Taiwan in
recent years have been the result of the difficulty Taiwan faces confirming the
identities of Chinese tourists due to a lack of information.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese tourists can only travel to Taiwan through a third place.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks after three Chinese visitors went missing in northern
Taiwan June 25 after arriving in Taiwan with a tour group via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The incident sparked concerns in Taiwan because after July, more Chinese
tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan from China per day.</P>
      <P>However, Liu dismissed the concerns and blamed the incident on the current lack
of a screening mechanism on the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Since the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists from a third place in 2002, 119
Chinese people have absconded, 94 of whom have been caught and repatriated,
while 25 are still at large, according to local travel agency figures.</P>

      <P>The government's urging of insurance companies to invest in the stock market
might prove to be a weak attempt to reverse the recent market slump, market
analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's stock market plummet June 27, when share prices dropped by
263.04 points, or 3.37 percent, to 7,548.76 points, the Cabinet established a
task force in a bid to remedy the market woes with a series of measures, led by
urging insurance companies to put their capital into local stocks to the tune of
an estimated NT$8 trillion (US$263 billion).</P>
      <P>However, some market watchers said such urging might lack strength, as the
market mechanism is what really matters rather than government's agenda in terms
of stock market investing.</P>
      <P>"The insurance companies, like any private companies, are usually sensible in
managing their assets, " Wang Chi-ming, equity head of Capital Investment Trust
Corporation, told CNA Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that unless the insurance companies are offered preferential
initiatives, it is unlikely that they will simply follow the government's urging
unconditionally.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao, head of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research's Macro-Economic
Forecasting Center, also said that a rebound of local bourse will be more likely
to depend on market prospects rather than any artificial measures taken by the
government.</P>
      <P>"Insurance companies' capital often includes pension funds of their clients,
therefore companies will evaluate the risks before investing the money in the
stock market," he told CNA.</P>
      <P>However, Chen expressed optimism in the mid- and long-term prospects of local
stocks, "because the anticipated cross-strait economic activities and the
upcoming hot season for local exporters could brighten Taiwan's economy."</P>
      <P>The other measures that the Cabinet decided Saturday include encouraging four
government-run funds to target stocks with good credentials for long-term
investment and urging listed companies to buy back their own stocks.</P>
      <P>"Those urges are a positive thing, but it should be left to market investors to
decide when to inject their money into the market, " Chen noted.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met with his chief economic officials Sunday evening to
discuss the country's economic issues especially the surging commodity prices.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi quoted the president as saying after
the three-hour meeting that the country's economic fundamentals are very
healthy, and the handling of the situation by the Central Bank of Republic of
China and the Executive Yuan is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ma was cited as urging the officials at the meeting to address people's grief as
urgently as they would do to their own grief.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the president agreed with his economic officials that
the skyrocketing hikes in commodity prices were triggered by the surging prices
of imported oil and raw materials.</P>
      <P>In a response to journalists' question, Wang said the problem of the bourse,
which has seen Taiwan's benchmark index fell 263.04 points Friday to close at
7,548.76, or the nadir since the president took office on May 20, was not raised
during the meeting.</P>
      <P>"The meeting was convened to discuss the country's economy as a whole rather
than the bourse." Wang said.</P>
      <P>However, he quoted Vice President Vincent Siew as saying at the meeting that
Taiwan's stocks boast one of the world's highest earning yields and lowest
price/earning  ratios and thereby are ideal investment target.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Ministry of Economic Affairs will come up with a set of new
measures Monday to reward households which cut down their consumption of

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou met with his chief economic officials Sunday evening to
discuss the country's economic issues, and especially the surging commodity
prices.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Spokesman Wang Yu-chi quoted the president as saying after
the three-hour meeting that the country's economic fundamentals are very healthy
and the handling of the situation by the Central Bank of Republic of China and
the Executive Yuan is appropriate.</P>
      <P>Ma was cited as urging the officials at the meeting to address people's worries
as urgently as they would deal with their own.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the president agreed with his economic officials
that the skyrocketing of commodity prices was triggered by the increases in the
price of imported oil and raw materials.</P>
      <P>In response to journalists' questions, Wang said the problem of the stock market
was not raised in the meeting. Taiwan's benchmark index fell 263.04 points
Friday to close at 7,548.76 -- the nadir since the president took office on May
20.</P>
      <P>"The meeting was convened to discuss the country's economy as a whole rather
than the bourse." Wang said.</P>
      <P>However, he quoted Vice President Vincent Siew as saying at the meeting that
Taiwan's stocks boast one of the world's highest earning yields and lowest
price/earning ratios and therefore are ideal investment targets.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Ministry of Economic Affairs will come up with a set of new
measures Monday to reward households that cut down their consumption of
electricity amid increasing electricity rates.</P>
      <P>Sunday's meeting brought together Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Hsieh Hsiang-chuan, Minister of
Finance Li Sush-der, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming, Council for
Economic Planning and Development Chairman Chen Tain-jy and Central Bank of

      <P>An opposition lawmaker suggested Monday that all public offices in Taiwan turn
off their lights for one hour at noon every day to help reduce energy
consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>"The government  should take the initiative  to cut power consumption,
particularly at a time when electricity rates are set to increase from July 1
and it is the taxpayers who are footing the electricity bills for public
offices, " said opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Tien
Chiu-chin.</P>
      <P>"Public offices can help reduce carbon emissions by 37,500 tons each year if
they turn off their lights for one hour at noon each day throughout the year,"
Tien asserted.</P>
      <P>"Office air conditioners should also be switched off for one hour at noon if
possible," she added.</P>
      <P>Citing Germany as an example, she said that public offices in that European
country do not use artificial lighting during the daytime, but rather rely on
the natural light coming through the windows.</P>
      <P>Tien said the suggestion that the public offices turn off their lights is not
aimed at mistreating public servants. Instead, she argued, public functionaries
should lead the country's efforts to save energy, since this is a world trend
and Taiwan produces less than one percent of the energy it consumes.</P>

      <P>Eighty-eight percent of workers are dissatisfied with their unchanging earnings
as the cost of living is increasing due to inflation, according to the results
of a survey released Monday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The survey revealed that 44.32 percent of respondents have not received a pay
raise for more than one and a half years and 31.66 percent have not seen a
salary increase for more than three years.</P>
      <P>However, the ongoing inflation has added an extra NT$2,311 to their average
monthly spending, with 14.71 percent having to spend NT$5,000 more per month,
the survey showed.</P>
      <P>To cope with the soaring  fuel prices,  38.75 percent of respondents said they
have stopped driving a car to work, with 52.17 percent using a motorcycle
instead, 25.98 percent changing to public transportation, and 13.58 percent
using a bicycle instead.</P>
      <P>Also,  77.96 percent of respondents  said they have taken substantial steps to
reduce spending in light of the rising consumer prices.</P>
      <P>The cost-cutting measures mentioned by the respondents include avoiding shopping
(54.21 percent), eating out less frequently (44.62 percent) , buying only daily
necessities (39.82 percent) , avoiding gatherings or dining with friends (36.69
percent), and switching off unnecessary lights or electrical appliances (35.62
percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out June 11-24 by 1111 Job Bank among 1,311 workers. It
had a margin of error of 2.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another survey conducted by the job bank among 457 businesses during
the same period showed that the rising commodity prices will impact unfavorably
on their operations during the third quarter of this year, with 55 percent
describing the negative impact as moderate to severe.</P>
      <P>While 32.39 percent of businesses said they have decided to cut back on the
hiring of regular staff during the third quarter, 8.11 percent said they will
stop hiring regular employees altogether.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 31.95 percent of businesses will instead increase the
hiring of atypical workers, and 13.73 percent are either considering or have
decided to lay off workers.</P>
      <P>Another 8.1 percent of businesses are either considering or have decided to cut
their employees' salaries by 9.38 percent on average.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 15.1 percent of businesses are considering or have decided to raise
their workers' pay to help them counter inflation, according to the survey.</P>

      <P>The buying rate for the Chinese yuan was quoted at NT$4.339 and the selling rate
at NT$4.552 Monday, the first day of the opening of free exchange of Chinese and
Taiwanese currency, the Bank of Taiwan reported.</P>
      <P>Free yuan-NT dollar exchange kicked off in Taiwan Monday, marking a relaxation
of policy in line with Taiwan's imminent opening to larger numbers of Chinese
tourists  and the launch of direct cross-strait weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>Fourteen local banking institutions, which operate 1,240 branches islandwide,
are now allowed to legally handle exchanges of new Taiwan dollar and the Chinese
yuan, as they were issued permits by the Central Bank of the Republic of China
(CBC) earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese citizens and foreign visitors can obtain yuan-NT exchanges in amounts
of up to 20,000 yuan per person per day, a CBC official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 67 currency exchange outlets, at places such as hotels,  souvenir
shops, department stores and airports,  have permission to buy yuan from
customers but are not allowed to sell that currency, he added.</P>
      <P>The CBC reportedly had some 500 million yuan ready for exchange Monday, although
trading on the first day was said to be "light."</P>

      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, said
Monday that government intervention is not an effective way to boost the ailing
bourse, and he expressed confidence in the long term prospects of the stock
market.</P>
      <P>"The government perhaps can do a little to prop up the market but it will not be
very effective," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan's stock market woes are not a special case, as the global
markets are suffering as well. However, the best way to strengthen the market is
to go back to basics, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to the Executive Yuan's call for insurance
companies, which currently have capital of around NT$8 trillion (US$263
billion), to invest in the stock market and domestic infrastructure projects to
help rescue the market.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's call came after the TAIEX slumped 3.37 percent on Friday, marking
an accumulative retreat of more than 1,700 points on the benchmark index since
the May 20 inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou. The administration has been
struggling to boost the sluggish domestic economy that was one of the central
issues in the March presidential election.</P>
      <P>Despite the turmoil in the stock market, Chang expressed confidence in a long-
term bull run, saying that the pressure of inflation is only temporary, the oil
price rise will slow down and the credit situation will improve.</P>
      <P>"I'm optimistic about the long term performance of Taiwan's stock market, " he
said, prior to the 11th meeting of the 6th board of directors of the Strait
Exchange Foundation -- a quasi-official organization that handles cross-Taiwan
Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>"There is no need for stock investors to panic or get too nervous, as the
fundamentals remain pretty good."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has adopted an eight-point package to help boost the sagging
domestic stock market, which has been battered by surging oil prices and a
volatile Wall Street.</P>
      <P>Four major government funds -- the public service pension fund, the labor
pension fund, the labor insurance fund and the postal savings system -- have
also been encouraged to invest more in the market.</P>

      <P>The government's tax reform committee will will aim to formulate a system that
is fair, highly efficient, simple and can enhance the global competitiveness of
local companies, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday during the launch of the
committee.</P>
      <P>After the launch, the committee held its first meeting, which was chaired by
Vice-Premier Chiu Cheng-hsiung. It was attended by lawmakers, Minister of
Finance Li Shuh-der and other high-ranking financial officials.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Liu said that reform of the current tax system to
develop a more equitable and logical one will allow for better utilization of
Taiwan's high-quality human resources as part of the effort to achieve economic
growth in the face of globalization and competition from emerging economies.</P>
      <P>"The establishment of the committee is the realization of President Ma Ying-
jeou's pledge to build a tax system that is equitable, highly efficient, simple,
and boosts the global competitiveness of local industries," the premier said.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) government's tax reform committee, in its first meeting,
focused on 20 different tax statues, including those that apply to income,
inheritance and energy, and on pertinent regulations in the Industrial Upgrade
Promotion Act.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in order to build a better tax system to tackle Taiwan's financial
woes, the central and local governments need to trim debts totalling more than
NT$4 trillion (US$131.5 billion), "a figure that represents 34.2 percent of the
nation's gross domestic product (GDP)."</P>
      <P>Liu also said that with the average tax payer being levied at 14 percent of
their annual income, which is significantly lower than the rates in more
developed countries, many people in Taiwan still find the tax burden too heavy.</P>
      <P>"This committee should find a solution to this situation by redistributing the
tax burden more fairly," Liu urged.</P>
      <P>Taiwan established tax reform committees in 1968 and 1987, which mainly focused
on redistributing the wealth in the society. In 2001 the government also set up
a financial reform committee to deal with bad debts held by local banks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi promised Monday that in three months time the
ministry will revise the regulations that require foreign spouses to show proof
of financial ability when applying for Taiwan identity cards.</P>
      <P>Liao made the promise to representatives of foreign spouses in Taiwan who
requested that the Ministry of Interior abrogate the financial certification
requirement for foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>According to regulations under the Nationality Act, in order to obtain Taiwan
identity cards, foreign spouses must prove that they earn an average monthly
income that is at least double Taiwan's basic wage, or that they have on deposit
at a local financial institution a sum that is at least 24 times the basic
monthly wage.</P>
      <P>The current monthly wage in Taiwan, as promulgated by the Council of Labor
Affairs, is NT$17,280 (US$568). Foreign spouses therefore are required to prove
that they earn at least NT$34,560 (US$1,136) a month, or present a statement
showing that they have on deposit at least NT$414,720 (US$13,642) at a domestic
bank.</P>
      <P>However, many foreign spouses, mostly from Southeast Asia and Mainland China,
are married to unprivileged Taiwanese men and live in economically difficult
situations, said Wu Yu-chen, who is from Vietnam and is a board member of the
Taiwan-based TransAsia Sisters Association.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign spouses borrow money from brokers to apply for identity cards and
they have to pay a fee, while some even engage in prostitution in order to
accumulate enough money," said Wu in a meeting with the MOI minister, adding
that the regulation puts great pressure for foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>Without identity cards, foreign spouses make less money than regular workers,
are not covered by labor insurance, and cannot even apply for a mobile phone,
noted Wang Chuan-ping, a cadre member of an association that provides assistance
to spouses from China.</P>
      <P>"The financial certification  requirement  is discrimination against poor
people, as it discourages them from marrying foreigners and hinders the
naturalization of foreign spouses in Taiwan, " said Tsen Chao-yuan, secretary-
general of the Awakening Foundation, one of the major advocates of women's
rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that many countries, such as Canada and Australia, only request financial
statements from business immigrants, Tsen strongly urged the MOI to revoke the
regulation.</P>
      <P>In response, Liao said that his ministry will try to modify the regulation in
three months time without amending the parent act. He acknowledged that it does
not make sense and does not serve the best interests of the applicants if they
have to borrow money from brokers to meet the financial requirements.</P>
      <P>"The new administration is trying to adopt an open and practical attitude to
serving people, rather than managing and controlling them like the previous
Democratic Progressive Party government did," said Liao.</P>
      <P>He however advised that foreign spouses make regular deposits to their bank
accounts so that they can present proof of savings and also suggested that proof
of their self-reliance can be provided by village or district chiefs or
officially recognized non governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI, 399,000 foreign spouses were registered in Taiwan as of
the end of 2007 -- 262,000 from the China and 137,000 from other countries.</P>
      <P>At present, 71,527 foreign spouses and about 200,000 Chinese spouses still hold
residence permits, according to advocates of foreign spouse rights.</P>

industrial applications.</P>
      <P>The second stage of the program has a budget of NT$100 million and will run
until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The 2007 projects focused on scientific discoveries that lead to early stage
technologies in areas such as carbohydrate synthesis, 3-D neural imaging, self-
assembled nano-structures, micro-beam X-ray, crystal fibers, and eutectic
memory.</P>
      <P>Research labs in local colleges,  such as National Taiwan University, were among
the applicants that won the 2007 program grants.</P>
      <P>"The second stage will be open to submissions in three major areas of research
-- germination, energy storage, and risk management -- that could bring new
ideas to the transformation of Taiwan's industries, " said Eugene Wang, an
Academic Sinica scholar who is the director of the program.</P>
      <P>Wang said these three areas can sustain Taiwan's focus on the development of
early stage technology and high value services, both of which he projected will
determine Taiwan's economic future.</P>
      <P>"Germination represents the most challenging task in industrial innovation, as
it aims to find ways of starting business with the discovery of fundamental
things," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The area of energy storage should target applications such as electrical
vehicles and should coordinate with existing programs that are studying energy
and nano-technology, he explained.</P>
      <P>"As for risk management, the ongoing U.S. subprime mortgage crisis actually
offers a window of opportunity in this area for Taiwan's financial sector
because Taiwan has the potential to develop the risk management skills that
could be the cornerstones of future financial systems," the scholar said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP accuses government of poor preparation for Chinese tourists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers accused the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Monday of failing to make adequate preparations for the arrival
of more Chinese tourists from later this week.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus deputy whip Chiu Yi-ying, Legislator Lin Shu-fen and
other lawmakers held a news conference to urge President Ma Ying-jeou to first
make the "proper" preparations in terms of airport security,  public order and
epidemic prevention before gradually opening Taiwan up to more tourists.</P>
      <P>Under accords signed June 13 in Beijing between Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , weekend direct
cross-strait charter flights will be launched from July 4, while more Chinese
tourists will allowed to visit Taiwan from July 18.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Lin claimed that although it appears on the
surface that the Ma administration has won a victory for Taiwan with the signing
of the accords, it has suffered "a loss in substance."</P>
      <P>She said that the weekend cross-strait charter flights will lead to an increase
of about 6 million Taiwanese tourists visiting China per year, representing
another NT$180 billion (US$5.93 billion) for China's economy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin continued, the agreement will only lead to an increase of about
350,000 Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan per year, pumping only an extra NT$100
billion in tourist dollars into the local economy.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, while Beijing has restricted the number of Chinese tourists
that can visit Taiwan, Ma's administration "has done the opposite by sending
Taiwan's money to China."</P>
      <P>Chen Ting-fei, another DPP lawmaker, noted that there have been many cases of
Chinese citizens absconding from their tour groups while traveling in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past Chinese citizens had to pay hundreds of thousands of NT dollars to
sneak into Taiwan, but now all they have to do is pay for a NT$40,000 tour
package and they can get into the country and remain as illegal immigrants, she
said, urging Premier Liu Chao-shiuan to reflect on this problem.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Yu Cheng-tao noted that there have been some 60,000
enterovirus cases in China so far this year, warning that if proper precautions
are not taken, allowing more Chinese tourists into Taiwan could worsen the
enterovirus outbreak on the island.</P>

      <P>Eleven Vietnamese nationals were nabbed off the coast of Miaoli Monday while
trying to enter Taiwan illegally, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) reported
later that day.</P>
      <P>Following up on a tip-off, the CGA launched a pre-dawn raid on a Chinese fishing
boat off the coast of Tunghsiao in the northern county of Miaoli, and found 11
Vietnamese aboard.</P>
      <P>The 11 Vietnamese -- nine men and two women -- were crammed into the small
wooden-hulled boat that was large enough to accommodate only three to four
people.</P>
      <P>The coast guard found extra fuel aboard the vessel as well as instant noodles
that the illegal immigrants said they bought in Chaozhou City in the southern
Chinese province of Guangdong.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese were taken to a Tunghsiao police station for questioning, where
they admitted that they paid US$6,000 each for a ticket from Vietnam to China
and then to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's been two days since we left Chaozhou, " said one of the illegals, adding
that they planned to sneak into Taiwan to seek employment.</P>
      <P>According to the CGA authorities, nine Vietnamese nationals were busted, also in
the waters off Tunghsiao, June 5. Those nine people said they first traveled to
China from northern Vietnam and then boarded a fishing boat heading for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also off Tunghsiao, 26 young Chinese women were thrown overboard by human
traffickers, commonly known as "snakeheads," in August 2003. Six of the women
drowned, while the remaining 20 were rescued by coastguard officers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New point-based system launched for migration to U.K.</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The British government introduced a new points-based system (PBS) Monday to
control migration to the U.K. -- the most significant change to migration
management in the last 40 years.</P>
      <P>In a news conference to introduce the PBS, Charles Garrett, deputy director of
the Taipei-based British Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) , said the new system
will significantly streamline the visa application process to facilitate entry
to the U.K. of all those wanting to come to work, train or study.</P>
      <P>"It will be a one-stage application, not a two-stage application ... and the
five tiers, or categories, will replace 80 different routes used in the past,"
Garrett said.</P>
      <P>The five categories are: Tier 1 -- Highly skilled individuals; Tier 2 -- Skilled
individuals with a job offer; Tier 3 -- Low-skilled individuals; Tier 4 --
Students; and Tier 5 -- Youth Mobility and temporary workers.</P>
      <P>In the past, applicants would have to first apply to the Home Office in the U.K.
and then go to the BTCO to apply for a visa if they pass the Home Office review
process.</P>
      <P>Also, with the PBS, applicants will be able to do an online self-assessment
before applying to enable them to calculate whether or not they are likely to
meet the number of points required to be issued a visa.</P>
      <P>"Applicants will be able to go online and work out whether they will get a
positive or negative decision if they apply, " Garrett said. "Before they pay
the money to apply for the visa, they can work out whether it is worth their
while."</P>
      <P>Points will be awarded according to objective criteria such as qualifications,
previous earnings, competence in English language and ability to support
themselves and their dependents, he added.</P>
      <P>The deputy director said there are two reasons for introducing the new system.
First is that the U.K. would like to attract the most talented people with the
skills the country needs, as migrants are the key to the U.K. economy,
contributing six billion British pounds (US$12 billion) every year to Britain's
gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>The second reason is that the U.K. can have a simpler system, one that is more
user-friendly for applying for British visas to work in the U.K., he added.</P>
      <P>Tier 1, covering highly skilled workers, entrepreneurs, investors and people
wanting to stay to work after their study in the U.K., will be covered by the
new system from June 30, while it will be introduced to the other tiers over the
next 12 months.</P>
      <P>The BTCO advised people who are interested in the PBS to log onto the Web site
www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk/pointscalculator in order to determine whether they
have enough points to make a successful application, and to check out
www.ukvisas.gov.uk or www.bia.homeoffice.gov.uk for further information on the
PBS.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan was accused Monday of violating the law that public
servants should avoid conflicts of interest, and Minister of Justice Wang Ching-
feng said a probe has been launched into the allegation.</P>
      <P>Wang met with two legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , Lai Ching-te and Pan Meng-an, who brought the accusation against Liu.</P>
      <P>Wang promised that the ministry will handle the case according to the law if Liu
is found to have used his position to benefit members of his family.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lai and Pan said that the Taipei-based TECO Electric and
Machinery Co. Ltd., has recently obtained a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
subsidy for private investment in wind power generation, because TECO Chairman
Liu Chao-kai is the premier's younger brother.</P>
      <P>A day after the MOEA released its plan to offer the subsidy on its Web site June
5, TECO won the subsidy at an amount of over NT$400 million (US$13 million), the
lawmakers said, noting that the brothers might have acted to ignore the conflict
of interest.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that Liu Chao-kai has violated the law that prohibits first- and

    <TEXT>
      <P>To cope with the new challenges that will arise with the launch of nonstop
weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China, Air Macau is ready to promote
Macau as a destination in its own right through attractive offers, Jo Wu,
manager of the airline's marketing department, said Monday.</P>
      <P>The weekend direct cross-strait charter flights are scheduled to take off
Friday, based on accords signed in Beijing on June 13 by Taiwan and China. A
total of 36 flights will be operated by Taiwan airlines and China carriers on
the direct route. This means that passengers traveling between the two sides of
the strait on weekends will no longer be obliged to go via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>However, in order to sustain the Taiwan-Macau route, on which Air Macau operates
12 flights daily, Wu said the carrier is offering different packages to promote
the idea that Macau is more than just a transit point.</P>
      <P>"We at Air Macau hope that the packages and offers will enhance Macau's tourism,
" Wu told the CNA. "Air Macau must make greater efforts to promote Macau amid
the launch of the cross-strait nonstop charter flights."</P>
      <P>Wu mentioned a package that offers a discount of NT$1,000 (US$33) to each
passenger traveling in a groups four, saying that it was well received in June
and that the airline will continue the promotional offers.</P>
      <P>In addition, starting July 1, Air Macau passengers who buy flight and
accommodation packages will have the option to visit Hong Kong Disneyland for an
extra charge of NT$1,900 (US$62.5), which will cover one-way transportation from
Macau to Hong Kong, shuttle bus service between the Hong Kong pier and
Disneyland, and the admission fee, she disclosed.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong and Macau must work together in light of the changing market," Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Discounting fears that the direct charter flights between Taiwan and China may
squeeze out Air Macau, Gary Yang, general manager of the airline's Taiwan
marketing and sales division, said it has no plans to cut the number of flights
on the Taiwan-Macau route.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the period Jan. to May this year the airline recorded a 15
percent increase in the number passengers traveling from Taiwan to Macau without
going on to China, compared with the same period last year, and he expressed
confidence in the viability of the route.</P>
      <P>Wu said she hoped Macau will become a popular destination in its own right for
Taiwanese tourists after the launch of direct charter flights. She added that
the hotels selected in Air Macau's packages are "scrupulously chosen" and that
Macau authorities are aggressively promoting tourism there.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that China represents both an opportunity and
a threat, and that a good leader understands how to "maximize the opportunity
while minimizing the threat."</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments at a biannual military promotion ceremony held at the armed
forces' officers club in Taipei City, which was also attended by Vice President
Vincent Siew and Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min.</P>
      <P>Ma was presiding at a military promotion ceremony for the first time since he
assumed the presidency on May 20 of this year.</P>
      <P>Ma said that since taking office, changes have occurred in terms of the
atmosphere and the state of affairs in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He said that part of minimizing the threat that China poses is for Taiwan to
strengthen its military defenses and combat readiness, adding that the purpose
of doing so is "not to seek war, but instead to avoid war."</P>
      <P>On introducing a voluntary military system, Ma expressed the hope that it can be
done in the next 4-6 years so that the armed forces can recruit the most
outstanding soldiers and officers. He added that having a strong reserve force
is extremely important to establishing an effective voluntary military system.</P>
      <P>The military must work hard to build a strong fighting force and enhance its
combat readiness to demonstrate the country's resolve to defend itself, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"We must protect and defend our country ourselves, " he added, expressing the
hope that all military officers will work as hard as they can in this regard.</P>
      <P>He further said that while Taiwan's democracy continues to grow stronger, the
role of the armed forces remains the same, namely to protect the country and the
people.</P>
      <P>At the ceremony, a total of 13 officers were promoted to the rank of lieutenant
general or vice admiral, while 45 officers were promoted to the rank of major
general or rear admiral.</P>

      <P>A total of 25 Chinese visa overstayers remain at large since Taiwan opened its
doors in 2002 to Chinese tourists arriving from a third place, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, a total of 23,513 Chinese tour groups comprising 293,312 tourists
had traveled to Taiwan, said MAC spokesman Liu Te-shun.</P>
      <P>Of that total, 119 people have absconded, 97 of whom have been caught and
repatriated, while 25 are still at large, representing an absconding rate of
0.04 percent, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Of the 25 runaway Chinese citizens, three are new arrivals who went missing only
last Thursday, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Liu called on the Chinese authorities to step up their screening of Taiwan-bound
sightseers before their departure, adding that the functions of the two leading
travel associations on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait authorized to handle
tourism exchanges should also be upgraded to help stem the absconding.</P>
      <P>Liu said the day before that the imminent opening of direct charter flights
between Taiwan and China should reduce the likelihood of runaway Chinese
tourists due to the Chinese government's screening mechanism.</P>
      <P>"Chinese  tourists  will not be able to take  the direct cross-strait charter
flights to be launched July 4 unless they gain approval from the Chinese
authorities," Liu noted.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities will not allow their citizens to visit Taiwan if they
find they have committed crimes or are likely to go missing in Taiwan, according
to Liu.</P>
      <P>Chinese  travel  agencies  will  be required  to bear the responsibility if any
members of their tour groups run away in Taiwan, which Liu said will also help
reduce the number of absconding tourists.</P>
      <P>After the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends, the
government will still punish local travel agencies dealing with Chinese tourists
with fines of NT$200,000 (about US$6,584) for each runaway Chinese tourist on
their rosters, Liu went on.</P>
      <P>An influx of Chinese tourists is expected from July 18 after Taiwan and China
signed an agreement in Beijing June 13 to bolster tourism exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker wants to make kindergarten tuition fees tax-deductible</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker urged the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Monday to offer its
support to a bill aimed at making kindergarten tuition fees and daycare expenses
tax-deductible, in an attempt to reverse the country's declining birth rate.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsueh Ling of the Democratic Progressive Party, a lead initiator of
the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act, noted that many young couples in
Taiwan are hesitating about having children nowadays mainly because tuition fees
charged by Taiwan kindergartens are sometimes more expensive than those charged
by higher education institutions.</P>
      <P>According  to  Hsueh,  an  insufficient  number  of public kindergartens in
Taiwan has resulted in 70 percent of children being sent to private
kindergartens, which charge up to NT$46,000 per person per semester -- a range
that is even higher than the tuition of public universities.</P>
      <P>With double-income families in the Taipei area earning between NT$1.25 million
and NT$1.8 million per year and educational expenses averaging NT$25,000 per
child per month, a family having two pre-school or school-age children will see
half of its income gone, Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>The bill, if passed, would allow taxpayers to claim a special deduction of
NT$25,000 for each child attending kindergarten or sent to a daycare center,
Hsueh said, adding that the same amount of deduction would also be allowed for
each child receiving higher education.</P>
      <P>Currently, the special deduction for tuition fees covers higher education only,
and only NT$25,000 per household is allowed, no matter how many children are

    <HEADLINE>National Immigration Agency being probed over embezzlement charge</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liao-yi said Monday that he has asked the
ministry's ethics office to refer a collective embezzlement case involving 44
National Immigration Agency (NIA)  officials to the Taipei Public Prosecutors
Office for investigation.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks while answering questions from reporters about a newspaper
report that the NIA failed to return a surplus of NT$3.07 million (US$101,120)
from an airport computer project to the national coffers and instead used the
money illegally to reward 44 of its officials.</P>
      <P>The NIA won a NT$35.38 million project from the National Security Bureau to set
up computer systems in five airports around the country -- Sungshan Airport in
Taipei, Hsiaokang Airport in Kaohsiung, Shangyi Airport on the outlying island
of Kinmen and two airports of the Matsu island group -- and link the systems
with the database at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>The computer systems were installed as part of preparations for a government
plan that will see a massive increase in the number of Chinese tourists visiting
Taiwan. The systems are also intended to prevent convicted criminals from
fleeing the nation through these airports.</P>
      <P>A report in the Chinese-language China Times Monday said the NIA did not return
the NT$3.07 million left over -- as it should have according to the Budget Law
-- when the project was completed at the end of 2006, but instead used the money
to reward 44 officials, some of whom were apparently not even involved in the
computer project.</P>
      <P>According to the report, former NIA Director Wu Cheng-chi and Deputy Director Wu
Hsueh-yen  each received a cash reward of NT$40,000, while chief secretary Ho
Jung-tsun got NT$50,000. The rewards for other staff members responsible for the
project varied from NT$150,000 to NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>The 44 NIA officials  are "suspected  of having committed collective
embezzlement," the report said.</P>
      <P>The NIA deputy director, who also serves as NIA spokesman, said the NIA spent
the NT$3.08 million rewarding officials involved in the computer project with
the approval of the National Security Bureau, and that there were no
irregularities about the use of the money.</P>

      <P>The director-general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration urged opposition
politicians and some local governments Monday not to be critical of the historic
weekend direct charter flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Billy Kuo-cheng Chang issued the appeal amid disputes raised by some local
governments and opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians over
the routes for the maiden flights starting July 4, as well as over the
capacities of some the planes to be used on the flights.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the preparation work for the first weekend from July 4-7 is
almost complete with the exception of two flights for which the departure and
arrival times might be changed, Chang expressed hope that everyone will look at
the breakthrough in cross-strait transport links with a more positive attitude.</P>
      <P>"The launch of weekend direct charter flights between Taiwan and China is a good
development with historical significance," Chang told CNA, adding that the CAA
has been doing its upmost to make the arrangements perfect.</P>
      <P>All the actions the CAA has taken have been based on the July 13 accords signed
in Beijing by Taiwan's quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
Chinese counterpart the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), Chang added.</P>
      <P>But opposition figures and some local government officials have complained that
the flights and routes are not equally distributed, and have described the
preparations as chaotic.</P>
      <P>Commending the five domestic airlines authorized to offer the services as active
participants in the program, Chang further expressed hope that the opposition
will not write off the policy and efforts in their attempts to score political
points.</P>
      <P>The detractors have no idea what the CAA and the government are doing, nor have
they made any efforts to entice the airline companies to serve their counties or
cities, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The launch of the direct flights -- one of President Ma Ying-jeou's election
pledges -- is expected to bring not only more business opportunities to Taiwan
but also to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>With a total of 36 flights to be operated by Taiwanese and Chinese   airlines,
the  Taipei-Shanghai,   Taipei-Beijing, Taoyuan-Shanghai and Taoyuan-Beijing
routes are most popular among both the airlines and the tour operators.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) has devised an NT$250 million
plan to improve sanitation near key tourist destinations around Taiwan in
anticipation of an influx of Chinese visitors in the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>The plan will focus on keeping roads and public toilets near scenic sites and at
popular spots in cities perfectly clean, said Yuan Shaw-ying, director of the
EPA's Department of Environmental Sanitation and Toxic Substance Management, in
a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>The EPA has applied for NT$250 million to finance the 6-month plan, a request
expected to be approved in July. The funding will be used to clean streets more
frequently and hire more cleaners and inspectors, said Chiou Ming-jong, the EPA
official in charge of the plan.</P>
      <P>"Having cigarette butts all over Ximenting, for example, is unacceptable," he
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the EPA will also promote Taiwan's environmental protection
concepts and practices during the Chinese tourists' visits, saying that local

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice President Vincent Siew called for strengthening ties with Japan,
including enhancing exchanges between the younger generation of Taiwanese and
Japanese politicians, in an interview aired over the weekend by two Japanese
television stations.</P>
      <P>Although President Ma Ying-jeou did not mention Taiwan-Japan links in his May 20
inaugural address, Siew said this does not mean that the Kuomintang (KMT)
administration does not attach importance to ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the statement in an exclusive interview by the Tokyo
Metropolitan Television Saturday and by the Chiba Television Broadcast
Corporation Sunday.</P>
      <P>Despite close trade and economic relations between Taiwan and Japan, Taiwan
still hopes that the two countries could sign a free trade agreement and
economic cooperation pacts to bolster mutual benefits, Siew said.</P>
      <P>As the United States and Japan are the backbone to safeguarding peace and
security in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan fully supports the U.S.-Japan
security pact, Siew noted, adding that he looks forward to Japan taking a
leadership role in the international community and assisting Taiwan to join
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Bilateral Taiwan-Japan cooperation will benefit the entire world, said the vice
president.</P>
      <P>Pointing  to an axial airport transportation  plan jointly projected by Taiwan,
China, Japan and South Korea as example, Siew said the establishment of a
network connecting Taipei's Songshan Airport, Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport,
Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Seoul's Incheon Airport would undoubtedly become a
"primary" travel air route.</P>
      <P>To better underscore the cause for two-way exchanges, Siew called for Songshan
and Haneda airports to take the lead to serve that end.</P>
      <P>Speaking on cross-Taiwan Strait trade end economic issues, Siew said China now
is Taiwan's No. 1 trade partner, with about 1 million Taiwan businessmen
operating in China.</P>
      <P>With China possessing  a pivotal significance  in Taiwan's international space
and domestic economic development, President Ma is resolved to settle cross-
strait issues through forging agreements between the two sides, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung as well as officials
from the Department of Health and the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, were also interviewed on the same occasion.</P>
      <P>A special program featuring Taiwan's scenic spots and cuisine was broadcast
along with the interview to attract Japanese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai extended the welcome to Japanese

      <P>Households and junior high and elementary schools will be able to cut their
electricity bills by as much as 20 percent if they conserve energy starting in
July, when an average 12.6 percent hike in electricity prices is due to take
effect.</P>
      <P>"Families and schools that find ways to save electricity will be rewarded with
price discounts, " said Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming at a news
conference Monday.</P>
      <P>Announcing the ministry's incentives to help households offset the price
increase, Yiin said residential electricity users who consume 5 percent less
power over a two-month period compared to the same two-month period in 2007 will
get a 5 percent discount on their electricity bill.</P>
      <P>"The discounts are deeper if more power is saved, " Yiin said, explaining that
the plan hopes to encourage consumers to conserve energy.</P>
      <P>Households will get a 10 percent discount if they save an average 5-10 percent
in electricity over a two-month period, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>Local electricity users are billed every two months, meaning consumers will be
able to track their power consumption and savings.</P>
      <P>"The biggest discount will be a 20 percent deduction, for customers who save 10
percent or more year-on-year," said the head of the MOEA, which supervises
state-run Taiwan Power Company.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, families and schools set to be charged an additional 7.52 percent
for electricity after the increase, will actually spend less on power if they
can earn a discount of 10 percent or more," the minister said.</P>
      <P>A different kind of incentive will be offered to industrial power customers,
whose bills are set to go up by an average 15.24 percent.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the ministry will offer loans with preferential interest rates to help
private companies maintain their operations while saving electricity.</P>
      <P>Yiin said National Development Fund subsidies will cut the interest companies
pay on loans for energy-saving equipment to an annual 0.45 percent rate, 2
percent below regular rates.</P>
      <P>"To compensate the banks for the reduction of interest rates, the government
will expand the National Development Fund to NT$50 billion (US$1.64 billion)
from NT$10 billion," Yiin said.</P>
      <P>The 7.52 percent hike for schools and residential customers and 15.24 percent
hike for commercial customers is set to take effect July 1.</P>
      <P>A second phase of electricity price increases, also averaging 12.6 percent, is
expected to take effect Oct. 1.</P>

Tourism Exchange Association at the invitation of the Taipei-based Taiwan Strait
Tourism Association, will depart from five major Chinese cities earlier that
same day on their way to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese tourists arriving July 4 will all land at either Taipei Songshan
Airport or Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in northern Taiwan, the only two
airports where Chinese carriers applied to land despite six airports across the
country being opened to serve Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said market mechanisms had to be
respected even though her bureau had hoped that the Chinese tourists arriving in
Taiwan on July 4 could enter via the six airports in different parts of the

      <P>The more than 600 Chinese tourists will take the first ever weekend charter
flights offered by Chinese carriers from Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Xiamen and
Guangzhou.</P>
      <P>The first charter to depart from China on July 4 will leave from Beijing at 6:
30 a.m. because it will have to cover the longest distance, a China National
Tourism Administration official said.</P>
      <P>China's tourism authorities have authorized 33 Chinese travel agencies to
organize group tours to Taiwan and have permitted people from 13 cities and
provinces to sightsee in Taiwan, the official said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government suspended the rights of China's Xinhua News Agency and
People's Daily to station representatives in Taiwan in 2005.</P>
      <P>The move came in response to the outlets' biased reporting on Taiwan's reaction

Cabinet spokeswoman Vanessa Yea-ping Shih.</P>
      <P>In mid-June, Taiwan and China reached a agreements to inaugurate weekend charter
flights between the two sides from July 4 and allow more Chinese tourists to
visit Taiwan on a regular basis beginning in mid-July.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that Taiwan will grant the same visa treatment to Chinese
journalists as China offers to Taiwanese reporters, based on the principle of
parity.</P>
      <P>This means that Chinese correspondents will be allowed to stay in Taiwan for
three months, instead of the current one month, and be eligible to extend their

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is very much concerned with Taiwan's economic
development, but has prodded the Executive  Yuan to take measures to improve
Taiwan's economic environment rather than actively intervened, the Presidential
Office spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Wang Yu-chi said the president has not taken a more public role out of
respect for the Republic of China Constitution,</P>
      <P>which stipulates that the head of the Executive Yuan -- the premier -- is the
country's top executive charged with carrying out national policies.</P>
      <P>Wang denied criticism that Ma has not been involved in running the government
and stayed away from the front lines, saying the president  has in fact  paid
attention  to national  economic development.</P>
      <P>He pointed to Ma's recent meeting with the premier, vice premier and top Cabinet
officials in charge of economic and financial affairs to discuss the economy,
including slumping stock prices.</P>
      <P>The president insists he only has the right to give direct instructions in the
areas of national defense, cross-Taiwan Strait policy and foreign affairs and
that he must allow the Executive Yuan to take charge of domestic issues, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the arrangement was in line with constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>Unlike his predecessor, Ma has been reluctant to talk about major national
issues since taking office May 20, including recent consumer price fluctuations
and continuing economic sluggishness.</P>
      <P>He has also been criticized for traveling less to the countryside to make direct

      <P>Two lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) raised doubts
about the authenticity of a master's degree that Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi
claimed in 1989 and 1993 to have received from the University of San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Legislators Chai Trong-rong and Yu John-dow said at a news conference that the
legislative caucus of the DPP has sent a formal request to the Executive Yuan,
asking it to provide information about the leave Liao took to attend classes in
San Francisco and official records showing his departures and arrivals at Taiwan
ports of entry.</P>
      <P>The two DPP legislators cited Liao as saying at a June 2 interpellation session
that he had spent four weeks each year at the American university to complete 36
credit hours for the master's degree.</P>
      <P>Arguing that each semester has at least 15 weeks, the two opposition lawmakers
said it would be extremely difficult, even for native American graduate
students, to obtain 18 credit hours within one semester.</P>
      <P>They contended that Laio, as a public figure, owes the people in Taiwan an
explanation how he managed to obtain a master's degree in public administration
from the University of San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that in the official bulletins of the 1989 and 1993 Taichung
County magistrate elections, candidate Liao claimed to hold the master's degree.</P>
      <P>"But Liao never repeated that claim after that. Was it because the degree from
that university was not recognized by the Ministry of Education? Or was it
because the degree was fake?" Yu asked.</P>
      <P>"If Liao made a false statement of his educational background, he would have
committed forgery," Yu added.</P>
      <P>The University of San Francisco is a Roman Catholic school with a 102-year
history. According to information posted on its Web site, the curriculum of its
master of public administration program is comprised of 12 courses totaling 36
credit units.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan protests Japanese inspection tour to Tiaoyutais</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
06/30/08  22:12:13
(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Monday protested an inspection tour of
the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands by Japanese Diet members earlier the same day,
according to a statement released by the ministry.</P>
      <P>The statement also said the MOFA has delivered its protest to Japan via Taiwan's
representative office there.</P>
      <P>Five Japanese politicians led by Yukio Edano, a Democratic Party of Japan member
of the Diet's House of Representatives, took a Japanese Coast Guard airplane to
tour waters and islets off Japan's Okinawa Islands Monday, reaching the airspace
over the disputed Tiaoyutais at 12: 30 p.m. Taipei time.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited island group is located some 100 nautical miles northeast of
Taiwan, with Taiwan, Japan, and China all claiming sovereignty. Interest in the
archipelago has grown since potentially vast oil and gas reserves were
discovered under waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>The often ignored island chain was back in the headlines June 10 when a
Taiwanese recreational fishing boat sank near the main island of the chain after
colliding with a much larger Japanese Coast Guard patrol boat that was trying to
chase it out of the area.</P>
      <P>Japan detained the captain of the Taiwanese vessel, Ho Hung-yi for over three
days before allowing him to return to Taiwan June 13.</P>
      <P>The incident caused tensions between Taiwan and Japan until Hitoshi Funamachi,
deputy representative of Japan's Interchange Association in Taipei, presented a
letter of apology to Ho at the skipper's home in Taipei County June 20 and
agreed to discuss his request for compensation.</P>
      <P>The MOFA regretted that the parliamentarians were touring the area so soon after
the incident earlier in the month was settled, a MOFA official said before the
Diet members took to the air.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement stressed that the government's determination to protect
Taiwan's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutai Islands has never wavered and will not
change.</P>
      <P>The ministry expressed the hope that Japan understands Taiwan's stance and
called on Japan not to trigger any disputes to harm bilateral relations, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>The ministry also expected that the two sides would solve the jurisdiction
problem through peaceful and rational means, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Edano's assitant told the Central News Agency that the inspection tour was a
regular scheduled outing and did not imply that Japan was asserting its
sovereignty over the area.</P>
      <P>An official at Taiwan's representative office in Japan said the office received
the same explanation from the Interchange Association Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier defends reinstating floating oil pricing mechanism</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday the government must reinstate a floating
pricing mechanism for fuel in July to reflect fluctuations in global oil prices.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that his Cabinet has made great efforts to prepare for the
reimposition of the floating pricing mechanism, saying "if we don't deliver the
promise in the first month, how can we expect public trust in the government."</P>
      <P>"What must be done has to be done," the premier reiterated during an interview
with a local TV station.</P>
      <P>After the previous administration's six-month freeze on local fuel prices,
during which the price of crude oil soared 50 percent in the international
market, Liu said his Cabinet had to raise prices late last month because the
freeze violated economic principles and distorted market mechanisms.</P>
      <P>On May 28, Liu announced a 12.5 percent price hike for fuel and 16 percent
increase in diesel prices, and said he would reinstate a monthly review of
prices at the pump in July based on a floating pricing mechanism.</P>
      <P>He said that the top priority faced by all administrations around the world is
inflation, noting that a Cabinet price stabilization panel has worked closely
with the Central Bank of the Republic of China to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>But compared with 11 Asian countries, including China and Japan, Taiwan's
consumer prices were relatively stable, second only to Malaysia in terms of
consumer price stability, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that Taiwan doesn't produce a single drop of oil, and it can't afford
to continue to consume oil like it once did.</P>
      <P>Although electricity rates will be increased in July, part of the increased
revenues will be used to subsidize those who are willing to conserve energy and
cut carbon dioxide emissions, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"In this way, electricity rate hikes may turn out to be the first step toward
conserving energy and cutting carbon dioxide emissions, " he said, adding that
"if this can be achieved, then whatever criticism we are hit with will be
worthwhile."</P>
      <P>He also said that the Council for Economic Planning  and Development has
estimated that inflation for the whole year will be 3.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked if he will comply with the wishes of ruling Kuomintang legislators and
city and county chiefs if they ask the Cabinet to freeze fuel prices prior to
city and county chief elections next year, Liu responded that "the policy will
be systematic."</P>
      <P>"If part of the policy is to reflect higher cost, it will be continued," he
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet to review nuclear energy policy: Premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)

(By Ruth Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will hold a meeting to review Taiwan's nuclear energy policy
and discuss the possibility of applying new techniques to increase the
efficiency of both nuclear power generation and applications, Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Many countries that originally supported the idea of a non-nuclear homeland are
changing their thinking," Premier Liu said, adding that Taiwan could learn from
them.</P>
      <P>One of those countries -- Sweden -- has developed techniques that multiply
nuclear energy efficiency but produce only 1 percent of the normal nuclear
waste, Liu said.</P>
      <P>These new techniques would be worthwhile for Taiwan to learn, Liu believed, and
he said Taiwan could even transfer these techniques to other countries if it
masters them at home.</P>
      <P>Liu's Cabinet has listed nuclear energy as a carbon-free energy option in a set
of draft guidelines outlining the government's future energy policies.</P>
      <P>The premier said earlier this month that he hoped the fourth nuclear power plant
under construction in Taipei County in northren Taiwan would be completed  as
soon as possible  to meet the government's policy of increasing the percentage
of carbon-free energy sources in Taiwan's generation of electricity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has three nuclear power plants in operation, with two located
in Taipei County and one in Pingtung County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu's interest in reducing radioactive waste stems from Taiwan Power Company's
headache in finding an acceptable location to store the radioactive waste
already generated.</P>
      <P>A total of 97,672 barrels of low-radiation waste produced at the three plants
before 1996 were stored in 23 trenches on Taiwan's outlying island of Lanyu,
also known as Orchid Island.</P>
      <P>The site stopped accepting additional nuclear waste in 1996 because of protests
by local residents, and all waste generated since then has been stored at the
power plants themselves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA has no plan to freeze fuel prices: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
06/30/08  23:11:39
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said Monday that the ministry has no
plan to freeze fuel prices and will not lower excise taxes on petroleum-based
products for the time being.</P>
      <P>Yiin's remarks came as state-owned CPC Corp., Taiwan is scheduled to announce
further hikes in the local price of gasoline and diesel Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Faced with world crude oil prices that have surpassed US$140 a barrel and a 12.5
percent gasoline price rise in late May, some have asked the ministry to
consider a renewed freeze on fuel prices or a reduction in the excise tax on
petroleum products to help mitigate future increases at the pump.</P>
      <P>"The ministry will not consider such options for the time being," Yiin
reaffirmed.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government only lifted a six-month freeze on gasoline prices by
the previous administration late last month, Yiin argued that if the government
reimposed a price freeze, there would only be greater resistance the next time
the authorities would try to lift it.</P>
      <P>Yiin noted that the government has already shouldered NT$1.3 and NT$1.4 per
liter in excise taxes for gasoline and diesel fuel respectively.</P>
      <P>The government will spend up to NT$220 billion (US$7.21 billion), or 1.6 percent
of GDP (gross domestic product) in subsidies on fuel, electricity and oil
products this year, which he said is much higher than China, whose subsidies
will account for 0.9 percent of GDP.</P>
      <P>"The government has made great efforts to absorb fuel and electricity price
hikes, " he said, urging the public to "join in efforts to conserve energy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier confident over his policies</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)

(By T.C. Jiang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Monday that he has great confidence in his policies
and that a recent fall in the new administration's approval ratings is not
directly related to the government's recent decisions to raise fuel and
electricity prices.</P>
      <P>Liu said in a TV interview that opinion polls reflected temporary public
sentiment and that the results often fluctuated, but he believed that the
government's policies would ultimately produce results.</P>
      <P>He was responding to the interviewer's contention that the government's
decisions to raise fuel and power prices in June and July caused the drop in
support of the Ma Ying-jeou government that took office on May 20.</P>
      <P>The interviewer also cited another poll released by Global Views Monthly
magazine on June 26, in which Ma received a disapproval rating of 46.2 percent
compared to an approval rating of only 37.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Ma won some 58 percent of the vote in the March 22 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>During  the interview,  Liu also countered  the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) criticism that Ma has failed to realize his campaign
promise that the economy would become "good immediately" after he was elected
president.</P>
      <P>Liu recently changed the word "immediately" in the slogan to "gradually, " which
prompted the DPP to accuse the Ma administration of being a "fraud ring."</P>
      <P>Liu, who was appointed by Ma, argued that the issue was a question of timing.
Slogans, he said, have to sound "resounding, " but once in power the new
administration needed time to realize its goals step by step.</P>
      <P>He nevertheless added that he was very confident that the policies he has been
advocating would yield positive results in the future.</P>
      <P>Responding to the local media's frequent comparisons of Ma with South Korea
President Lee Myung-bak, and the fact that both received heavy support prior to
their inaugurations, Liu said that Lee's plummeting approval ratings were the
result of his failure in three areas.</P>
      <P>He has failed to improve relations between South Korea and North Korea,
mishandled the sensitive issue of importing U.S. beef, which touched on public
concerns about mad cow disease, and has not been able to stabilize consumer
prices, Liu contended.</P>
      <P>Lee's approval rating dropped to some 20 percent after his first 100 days in
office. He took 48.7 percent of the presidential vote last December.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan has improved its ties with China, stuck to its bottom line
on the import of U.S. beef and lifted the freeze on domestic oil prices to
control consumer prices, Liu noted.</P>

      <P>A taekwondo team from Taiwan, competing under the name Chinese Taipei in the
2008 Austrian Open June 28-29, has won nine gold, one silver and 15 bronze
medals.</P>
      <P>According to results provided on the event's Web site, Taiwan's senior team
captured five gold and six bronze medals at the tournament, including two gold
and two bronze medals by the four athletes scheduled to represent Taiwan at the
Beijing Olympic Games in August.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also won four gold, one silver and nine bronze medals in the juniors'
category.</P>
      <P>Olympic hopefuls Chu Mu-yen won a gold in the men's under-58 kilogram flyweight
class and Su Li-wen took gold in the under-59 kg women's featherweight class.</P>
      <P>The other three gold medal winners in the women's category who will not be going
to Beijing were Lee Wan-chen in the under-47 kg class, Tseng Yi-hsuan in the
under-55 kg class, and Tseng Pei-hua in the under-63 kg class.</P>
      <P>The two athletes scheduled to compete in Beijing who captured bronze medals were
Sung Yu-chi in the men's under 72-kg class and Yang Shu-chun in the women's
under-51 kg class.</P>
      <P>In the juniors male category, the four gold medal winners were Wang Yu-hsuan in
the under-45 kg class, Lee Yu-ju in under-48 kg. class, Lee Cheng-tsu in the
under-59 kg class, and Yeh Hong-chieh in under-78 kg class, while Lee Chia-chen

      <P>According to the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association, the team is scheduled to
return to Taiwan July 3, and the four Olympic athletes will undergo a final
period of intensive training before setting off for the 2008 Olympic Games in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>It is expected to be one of the few events in which Taiwan has a chance to win a
medal. At the Athens Olympics in 2004, three of the country's five medals came
in the taekwondo competition, including a gold medal won by Chu Mu-yen. The
other two medals were won in archery.</P>
