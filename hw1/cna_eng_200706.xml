    <HEADLINE>VISITING U.S. CADET CLEARED OF WRONG DOING</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The General Headquarters of the Army said in a press release that an
investigation conducted Friday by a ten-member investigation panel led by Maj.
Gen. Chen Liang-pei, president of the Republic of China Military Academy
(ROCMA), found that the U.S. cadet neither raped the woman nor forced her to
have sex with him. The woman who was present at the investigation didn't take
exception to the panel's finding, according to the press release.</P>
      <P>According to Wednesday's United Daily News, the cadet from West Point who is in
the ROCMA on an exchange program was accused by a local woman of having sex with
her without her consent.</P>
      <P>The woman told the paper that she was introduced to the West Point cadet in a
pub in Tainan City last Friday night by a friend studying at the ROCMA,
identified by his surname as Chuang, who was in charge of receiving the West
Point cadet during his stay in Taiwan for a short-term exchange program at the
ROCMA.</P>
      <P>The woman claimed that Chuang and the West Point cadet kept encouraging her to
drink and that they brought her out of the pub soon after midnight, when she had
become "half drunk" after consuming about three bottles of beer.</P>
      <P>Chuang then left her with the West Point cadet, who later brought her to the
city's Evergreen Laurel Hotel, the woman said.</P>
      <P>As they entered the hotel room, the cadet began stripping off her clothes, the
woman claimed, adding that he then engaged in sexual intercourse with her before
she "even had a chance to resist" as she was not fully conscious due to the
effects of the alcohol she had consumed, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMCHAM MIGHT HAVE INTERFERED IN TAIWAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  May 31 (CNA)
06/01/07  10:32:22
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said
Thursday that the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Taipei might have
interfered with Taiwan's internal affairs by blasting the government in its 2007
Taiwan White Paper.</P>
      <P>Responding to the just-released  Taiwan White Paper,  CEPD officials admitted
that problems such as "inconsistent enforcement of regulations and inadequate
governmental transparency" that the White Paper criticized might well be true,
but said its urging for direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links -- which is
not a matter the government can control -- made CEPD officials feel that AmCham
is trying to back-seat drive in terms of Taiwan's own business.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference unveiling the 2007 AmCham Taiwan White Paper,
AmCham Executive Director Richard Vuylsteke warned that Taiwan's economy will
"get into a big trouble" next year if the government still refuses to deregulate
cross-strait exchanges and remove trade barriers, and said that he sees neither
of the two candidates the ruling and opposition parties might field for the 2008
presidential election as determined to turn Taiwan's sagging economy around.</P>
      <P>Regarding direct cross-strait transport links, the White Paper says that
"nothing can be said that hasn't been said repeatedly before about how the
failure to act on this issue has isolated, constrained and damaged Taiwan's
economy."</P>
      <P>"So on cross-strait links, the AmCham message to the Taiwan government remains
clear and unequivocal: Just do it!"</P>
      <P>The White Paper stresses Taiwan's regulatory morass and said that AmCham's
complaints  fall into several  categories,  including inadequate transparency,
violation of due process,  legislator interference  on  behalf  of  private
interests,  insufficient consultation with industry players, inconsistent
interpretations and enforcement, and regulations inconsistent with international
best practices.</P>
      <P>Describing the 2007 AmCham Taiwan White Paper as a record of a "health checkup
for the Taiwan tiger, " AmCham President Jane Hwang said in a press conference
that AmCham is concerned that Taiwan appears to be falling behind the other
"aging" Asian tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea -- in economic
competitiveness, while other "new" Asian tigers, including China, India and
Vietnam, are rapidly gaining strength.</P>
      <P>Hwang said she will be leading  an AmCham delegation  to Washington, D.C. in 10
days to discuss the 2007 AmCham Taiwan White Paper with American officials and
elected representatives in a projected 30 meetings with the goal of encouraging
stronger trade and business links between the United States and Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The decision on whether to place Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng at the
top of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) list of at-large legislators will
have to take into account the feelings of the public, KMT Secretary-General Wu
Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after Wang turned down an offer by KMT presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou earlier the same day to serve as his running mate,
finally ending months of speculation that the two would pair up to boost the
party's chances of winning in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang said he wants to remain in the legislature, adding that for the sake of
political stability as well as the interests of the people, he decided to turn
down the offer. He did agree to cooperate with Ma.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the KMT will put Wang directly at the top spot on the list of the
party's at-large nominees in the year-end legislative elections so that he can
continue to vie for the legislative speakership, Wu answered with an unequivocal
"No." Wang is already a three-term legislative speaker.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the party will have to consider several things: the response of the
"pan-blue alliance" led by the KMT; and the wishes of Ma and Wang himself.</P>
      <P>"Only after taking these three things into consideration will the party make its
initial decision," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The year-end legislative elections will be especially fierce as they will be
held under a new "single-member constituency, two-vote" electoral system that
will also halve the number of seats to 113.</P>

      <P>Frank Albert Cotton (1930V2007) -- the former chair of the W.T. Doherty-Welch
Foundation and a Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at TAMU -- is widely
recognized for his research into the chemistry of transition metals.</P>
      <P>Cotton authored more than 1,600 scientific papers and received 29 honorary
doctorates and important awards such as the U.S. National Medal of Science, the
Wolf Prize and the Priestley Medal, as well as the American Chemical Society's
highest recognition.</P>
      <P>The F.A. Cotton Medal was initiated by the American Chemical Society and TAMU in

      <P>The young director of the Stone Theater -- a troupe based in Taichung, central
Taiwan -- died Thursday of head injuries he suffered in an accidental fall from
the ceiling of a theater June 25.</P>
      <P>Cheng Jen-po, 25, is survived by his parents. The young director was trying to
adjust the lights in the Puli Arts and Cultural Center before a performance when
he fell head-first to the ground.</P>
      <P>Doctors at the Puli Christian operated on him twice but were unable to save him.</P>
      <P>Cheng graduated from National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu with a major in
information engineering in 2005, but found that he loved playwriting and
directing more than information science after taking a course in drama in 2004.</P>
      <P>In 2005, he joined the Stone Theater, which aims to combine theater with
everyday life and foster the growth of theater in the community.</P>
      <P>The stage play titled Witch Ulala's Crystal Ball, which he wrote and directed
for children, proved so successful in 2005 and 2006 that the Cabinet-level
Council for Cultural Affairs awarded him a grant to give 10 extra performances
around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The performance in Nantou was the first of these shows.</P>
      <P>Cheng's parents told reporters that they will watch the June 2 show in Hsinchu

      <P>Seventy percent of Taiwan adults eat out frequently, with a higher ratio of men
doing so than women, according to the results of a recent survey released by the
Global Views Monthly magazine.</P>
      <P>The magazine estimated that 3.3 million of Taiwan adults eat out everyday.</P>
      <P>The trend is most common among those in the 20-29 age group, which includes
students and young office workers, with more than 35 percent of people in this
group not having meals at home everyday, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Citing tallies from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, the magazine noted that each Taiwan family spent some NT$50,000
(US$1,515) on average eating out last year, meaning that the total spending by
Taiwan's more than 7 million households on eating out amounted to NT$36 billion
for the year.</P>
      <P>The survey found that lunch is the meal that the largest percentage of
respondents enjoy outside the home frequently, with 78.7 percent doing so,
followed by breakfast, with 66.8 percent of respondents usually eating this meal
outside the home.</P>
      <P>As to the places where people eat out for lunch, 59.6 percent of respondents
mentioned boxed lunch sellers, noodle eateries and snack bars.  Other popular
choices  mentioned  included  cafeterias, restaurants and luncheonettes, as well
as roadside food stands and food wagons.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the oyster omelet was selected by the largest number of respondents
as the snack best representing Taiwan, followed by pearl milk tea, oyster
vermicelli, stinky tofu and braised pork rice. Other items mentioned included
rice meat balls, rice dumplings, tan-tsai noodles, beef noodles, small steamer
buns, rice noodles, and bowl cakes, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted via telephone from May 4-9 on 500 men and 500 women around

      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui was awarded Friday the first
Shimpei Goto Prize by a Japanese publisher for his contribution to Taiwan's
urbanization and democratization.</P>
      <P>The event was organized by Fijiwara Shoten's Goto Shimpei Organization to mark
the 150th anniversary of the birth of the late Japanese colonial administrator
Shimpei Goto. The prize is awarded to people who have contributed to national or
regional development.</P>
      <P>Delivering a speech titled "Shimpei Goto and Me" during the ceremony, Lee noted
that Goto made a great contribution to Taiwan's modernization during his service
as the chief of civil administration under the Japanese colonial government in
Taiwan between 1898 and 1906.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although his life hardly overlapped with that of Goto,  he
personally has been profoundly influenced by Goto's achievements in Taiwan and
his extraordinary philosophy of life.</P>
      <P>"It is not an exaggeration to say that Taiwan's development has moved forward
along the track paved by Goto, " Lee said, adding that the Japanese education
that he received allowed him to become mayor of Taipei City, governor of Taiwan
Province, vice president and even president.</P>
      <P>On what he takes pride in the most, Lee pointed to his success in transforming
Taiwan's political system from a military dictatorship into a democracy without
a single drop of blood being shed in his 12 years as president.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, there are two kinds of politicians: those who engage in the
pursuit of power and those who aim to serve the people. He added that
politicians who are not subject to the temptation of power do not become
corrupt.</P>
      <P>Just like Goto, Lee said, he exercised self-restraint and was always ready to
relinquish power during his presidency.</P>
      <P>Claiming that faith is one of the most important qualities of a leader, Lee said
love and justice are what he believes in as a Christian.</P>
      <P>Lee further said that although he and Goto may be different in terms of their
religious beliefs, having strong faith is what they have in common and what
connects them spiritually.</P>
      <P>This is Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in May 2000.
However, this is his first visit to Tokyo and the first time that he has made a
public speech in Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition to receiving the prize, another highlight of Lee's current trip is a
planned "oku no hosomichi" tour covering the prefectures of Miyagi, Yamagata,
Iwate, Akita and Gunma, retracing a similar journey made by haiku poet Matsuo
Basho in 1689 based on which his famous work "Oku no Hosomichi, " or "Narrow
Road to the Interior," was written.</P>
      <P>Lee will also visit Akita International University and Takushoku University and
has indicated his desire to visit the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo to pay respects
to his older brother who died fighting for the Japanese colonial government
during World War II.</P>
      <P>The former president is scheduled to hold a news conference in Tokyo before his
departure June 9.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with Jason Hu, mayor of the central city of
Taichung, at the Presidential Office Friday for a hour-long talk, during which a
long-stalled plan to develop a massive plot of land in the greater Taichung area
was put on the fast track.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed that NT$7 billion (US$212 million) be allocated out of a
military barracks reconstruction fund to facilitate the relocation of the Air
Force Second Logistic Command Center away from the site of the former Shuinan
Airport so that development projects on the vast plot of land covering
approximately 250 hectares can kick off.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, the Ministry of
National Defense and the Taichung City Government to collaborate and jointly
form a task force on the development plan so as to enable the Air Force Second
Logistic Command Center to be fully relocated by the end of this year, paving
the way for the launch of the mammoth land development plan at the beginning of
2008 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The Shuinan development plan --  potentially involving the development of a
modern urban hub that will house a university city, a trade exhibition center,
an up-scale residential district and a forest park -- put Taichung on the map in
March this year after Richard Li, a Hong Kong business tycoon whose father, Li
Ka-shing, is Asia's richest man, paid a visit to the site for a fact-finding
tour.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  according  to Taichung City Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi, who was
also present at the Chen-Hu meeting, the president also instructed the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration to talk with the DPP
legislative caucus to reach a consensus on the issue of whether the Act on Local
Government Systems should be further amended to enable Taichung City to be
upgraded to a special municipality.</P>
      <P>During the Chen-Hu meeting, according to Hsiao, Mayor Hu also suggested that the
Chingchuankang Airport, now known as the Taichung Airport, be allowed to operate
cross-strait charter flight services during the Chinese New Year and other major
holidays.</P>
      <P>Chen instructed the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to study the
feasibility of Hu's suggestion, according to Hsiao.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS TO BUILD CLEAN, SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung pledged Friday to aggressively work to create a
clean and safe election environment ahead of two major elections -- the year-end
legislative election and the presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang, who assumed office May 21, said he believes that "cracking down on money
politics" and "eradicating vote-buying" are what the people expect a clean
government to do.</P>
      <P>Chang made the pledge while delivering an administrative policy report at the
Legislative Yuan. In the report, he reiterated that "replacing conflict with
cooperation" and "building nests instead of walls" are the fundamental guiding
principles of his administration.</P>
      <P>It is the ongoing conflict between the ruling and opposition parties that has
blocked the central government's 2007 general budget bill from clearing the
Legislative Yuan, slowed down the nation's economic growth, and brought about a
rise in unemployment, Chang said. In a humble and sincere manner, the premier
asked the Legislative Yuan to pass the budget bill as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the economy, Chang said that the Executive Yuan will continue
promoting financial reform while making efforts to carry out his "Taiwan
Priority" policy aimed at encouraging overseas Taiwanese business people to
invest in their homeland.</P>
      <P>Besides working to make Taiwan more prosperous, Chang said his administration
will also continue to work on implementing the series of "Mega Warmth"  social
welfare  programs  initiated  by his predecessor, Su Tseng-chang, and will do
its utmost to resolve problems related to the development of small and medium
enterprises, economic development in the less-developed central and southern
Taiwan regions, and the livelihood of the lower class.</P>
      <P>On the topic of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the premier said Taiwan should
display its determination in defending its sovereignty, adding that to this end,
the government should actively work to push for military reforms and carry out
military arms procurement projects while  bidding  for  the country's  entry
into  international organizations, including the United Nations, under the name
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the upcoming 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Chang said Taiwan sincerely
hopes that the international sporting festival which is widely seen as a symbol
of "peace" and "friendship" will help the two sides of the strait resume
dialogue.</P>

    <TEXT>La Repubblica: Italy on growth, it is time to reform.

Italian central bank governor Mario Draghi said Thursday that Italy can expect
an economic growth of two percent this year, while its deficit spending will run
at 2.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Although the country's economic
picture has improved, the Bank of Italy chief called for reforms soon. Italy has
to take action to reduce its massive public debt which amounted to 106.8 percent
of GDP at the end of last year, he noted.

      <P>A no-confidence vote called by Chen Chin-de, a ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker, had gained positive responses from his DPP peers as of
Friday, with over half of the party's lawmakers endorsing the proposal.</P>
      <P>The no-confidence vote proposed earlier this week by Chen was endorsed by 46
lawmakers, all of the DPP -- only 27 short of the one-third legal threshold
required to allow it to become a motion. The DPP controls 84 seats in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a news conference, Chen urged lawmakers of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to honor their previous
pledges by joining the move to topple the Cabinet led by Premier Chang Chun-
hsiung so as to permit President Chen Shui-bian to dissolve the parliament and
elect new legislators who could vote on several key bills stonewalled in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The long-term disorder in the "pan-blue alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan has
seriously hobbled administrative operations and now is the time to put an end to
the farce, Chen said, adding that he has strong confidence that his no-
confidence proposal will pass the legal threshold and be put on the legislative
agenda next Tuesday for a vote within five days.</P>
      <P>Despite Chen's explanation as to why he wants the legislature dissolved, PFP
spokesman Lee Hung-chun questioned why the DPP does not instead propose a motion
to recall the president instead of taking aim at the premier, as Chang was
appointed by the president.</P>

      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin expressed hope Friday that Taiwan can learn
from the drug-control experience of other countries and step up international
cooperation to deal with its drug problem.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks when he presided over the opening of an international drug
control symposium sponsored by the ministry. More than 30 anti-drug officials
and experts from 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, France and
Australia, took part in the symposium.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government formulated a new policy on drug control last year
and that a major concept under the new policy is to treat drug addicts as
patients rather than criminals.</P>
      <P>The government is also providing the drug addicts with clean needles and taking
cues from the United States, Australia and Hong Kong to use methadone to treat
heroin addicts.</P>
      <P>Methadone is a rigorously tested medication that is safe and efficacious for the
treatment of narcotic withdrawal and dependence, Shih claimed.</P>
      <P>The government also divides drug control work into four major areas: drug-
prevention, drug-rejection, drug rehabilitation and drug crackdowns.</P>
      <P>The central government is also working with local governments, with drug-
prevention centers established in every city and county, he went on.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the government is adopting a multi-pronged approach to drug
control, with four drug rehabilitation centers set up in Taipei, Taichung,
Kaohsiung and Taitung.</P>
      <P>On drug crackdowns, Shih said Taiwan is working with Thailand, Vietnam, Japan,
Malaysia and Australia to form a regional drug prevention network.</P>

      <P>Asian horseshoe crabs, known as one of the few "living fossil" species in the
Taiwan area, have been sighted on the coast of the southern county of Chiayi
recently, opening another wildlife conservation door, Chiayi County officials
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Five adult and 32 young  Asian horseshoe  crab tachypleus tridentatus, whose
appearance on Earth can be dated back to 200 million years ago, have been
sighted on the coast of Putai, Chiayi, making Chiayi County the third place in
Taiwan to witness the appearance of the crabs after sightings were reported on
the outlying island of Kinmen and in the Penghu archipelago, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi county authorities are collaborating with researchers from the
Research Center for Biodiversity, Academia Sinica (RCBAS) to protect the rare
species and its habitat near the Putai coast, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Other members of several wildlife conservationist groups will also join the
RCBAS researchers and Chiayi officials on a field trip to a saltmarsh in Putai
Saturday to witness the erection of a netted area to allow the adult crabs to
spawn and the babies to be nurtured, making the area an exclusive breeding zone
for the crabs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the officials went on, the protection of Asian horseshoe crabs will
also be arranged as one of the activities to attract tourists to Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>In 2006, some 70,000 baby Asian horseshoe crabs bred in captivity were released
into the wild off the coast of Kinmen as part of efforts to conserve the "living
fossil" species.</P>
      <P>With its distinctive domed carapace shaped like a horseshoe and a stiff pointed
tail, the Asian horseshoe crab was nearly extinct in waters surrounding Taiwan
proper as a result of development and environmental change until it occasionally
began to be seen near Penghu a couple of years ago.</P>

out of grave concern over national development and the people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks  during  an award ceremony  at the Presidential Office for
outstanding engineers.</P>
      <P>Saying that economic issues must be free from political meddling, Chen said that
the 2007 central government budget bill must clear the Legislative Yuan as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>The annual budget bill has been stonewalled for more than six months in the
Legislative Yuan due to an "irrational" boycott of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" lawmakers of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (DPP),
Chen said, blaming them for tying its passage to that of the draft Central
Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law.</P>
      <P>Now that the ruling and opposition camps have reached initial agreement over the
draft CEC Organic Law, Chen said, the budget bill should be approved as soon as
possible and he expressed his hope that no more disputes will arise to further
complicate the situation.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has been in a gridlock over the two bills, which are of
respective significance to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP made it clear that they will never agree to the annual

    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether President Chen Shui-bian can deliver on his pledges regarding
constitutional reforms in the last year of his presidency will be a test of what
his legacy will be, a civic group said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Association of University Professors made the remarks during a news
conference to unveil a mid-term report on Taiwan's political situation.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the public is "generally positive" about Chen's
performance in the areas of strengthening Taiwan-centric consciousness and
promoting a pluralistic democracy and financial reforms.</P>
      <P>But  in the areas  of constitutional  reforms,  ecological preservation and the
realization of social fairness and justice, the president has yet to meet
expectations, the report says, adding that whether he can realize those goals in
the last year of his presidency will affect his legacy.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chu-feng, a lecturer at National Chi Nan University, said that compared with
the turbulent street protests by the "red-clad" protesters last year to demand
that Chen to step down in the wake of a series of corruption scandals
surrounding his family members and top aides, this year seems to be calmer.</P>
      <P>"But the ideological rivalry is even fiercer, " he said, adding that the ruling
and the opposition parties have continued their ethnic mobilization with winning
the presidential election next year as their major concerns.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's relations with China, National Taiwan University Professor Chen
Chun-sheng said the opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
has held cross-Taiwan Strait trade forums, agricultural cooperation forums and
trade and cultural forums since 2005.</P>
      <P>Chen said this is China's attempt to join forces with Taiwan's private sector to
drive a wedge between the Taiwan government and its people.</P>
      <P>China's two-pronged approach -- courting Taiwan's private sector on one hand and
bashing Taiwan relentlessly internationally -- will only antagonize the Taiwan
people, according to the professor.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Friday that he is not in a hurry to pick his running mate for the 2008
election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks on the sidelines of an activity organized the Taipei-
based Chinese Institute of Engineers.</P>
      <P>He said that he did not want to decide on who to pair up with so early, adding
that "I will have to see the development of the political situation as well as
other matters before making a decision."</P>
      <P>On President Chen Shui-bian's instruction earlier that day to upgrade Taichung
City to that of a special municipality like Taipei and Kaohsiung, he said he is
not opposed to the upgrade, although Taiwan should have "longer-term planning."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should be divided into six provinces or states, each of about 4
million people, which he claimed would be "most favorable to international
competition."</P>
      <P>It could also avoid the disputes over which cities get to be promoted to the
level of a special municipality and which cities do not.</P>
      <P>According to earlier remarks by Hsieh, Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County and
Pingtung County can be integrated into one province; Yunlin County, Chiayi
County and Tainan County can form the second province; Taichung County, Changhua
County, Nantou County the third province; Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County and
Miaoli County the fourth province; Taipei County, Keelung City and Yilan County
the fifth province; and a special administration can encompass Hualien County
and Taitung County.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the central government will definitely
include Taichung in its direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter services.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while talking to Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, whom he had
invited to a meeting at the Presidential Office to discuss the central city's
long-term development.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he will never forget promises he made to Taichung citizens --
building an international airport, constructing a science park and upgrading the
city's administrative status -- Chen pledged that he will do his utmost to help
the municipal authorities achieve the three goals during his last year in
office.</P>
      <P>"The greater Taichung area will never be absent from the central government's
cross-strait charter flight service program along with Taipei and Kaohsiung, "
Chen vowed.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu voiced his hope that Chingchuankang Airport in neighboring
Taichung County could be converted to an international airport as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>Describing it as very important that an international airport be built in
central Taiwan for the some 6 million people living there, Hu, however, pointed
out that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has yet to include
Taichung in its program for opening direct cross-strait charter flights.</P>
      <P>Hu told the president that the central government should help upgrade
Chingchuankang Airport to international standards so as to offer both cargo and
passenger charter flights between Taiwan and China as soon as possible.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Bush Proposes Goal to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions

President Bush, fending off international accusations that he was ignoring
climate change, proposed for the first time on Thursday to set "a long-term
global goal" for cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and he called on other high-
polluting nations to join the United States in negotiations aimed at reaching an
agreement by the end of next year.

If carried through, such an agreement would be the first in which the United
States, the world's biggest source of the emissions that scientists say are
warming the planet, has committed itself to a specific target for cutting them.

Wall Street Journal: Seeking Lift, Coke Turns Focus Back to Bottlers

This spring, Coca-Cola Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer E. Neville
Isdell visited here to put a struggling local bottler into what he calls the
"hospital ward."

Filipinos drink more soda per capita than people in just about any other
emerging market, a habit cultivated by more than 40 years of American colonial
rule. But hamstrung by a lack of investment and weak marketing practices, Coke's
Philippine bottler saw sales plummet. Poor results in the country, Coke's 11th-
largest market, shaved a full percentage point off the company's global volume
growth in 2006, which was 3.9%.

Mr. Isdell's plan to fix the Philippines is central to his strategy for
reversing nearly a decade of sluggish performance at the soft-drink giant.</TEXT>

      <P>A visiting British education official said Friday that he was impressed by the
high levels of performance of Taiwanese students and encouraged more Taiwanese
students to go to U.K. to pursue higher education.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese  students can attain high levels of performance, particularly in
mathematics and science subjects, said Andrew Adonis, U.K. Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State for Schools.</P>
      <P>Adonis was speaking during a private visit to Taipei to look at the strengths of
the Taiwanese education system, in particular the factors that explain the
sustained high attainment of Taiwanese children in standard international tests.</P>
      <P>The schools he visited -- Jianguo Senior High School and Renai Junior High
School -- have seen substantial increases in creativity education in their
curricula, as well as self-directed learning and life skills learning, Adonis
said, adding that this is something the U.K. education system can learn from.</P>
      <P>He also spoke at National Chengchi University about the U.K. experience of
education reform, noting that there are moves to give schools greater autonomy
in school management and to give parents greater choice in terms of the types of
schools on offer.</P>
      <P>The U.K. government has placed "great emphasis on education" since Prime
Minister Tony Blair assumed office 10 years ago, he claimed. One of the key
priorities in U.K. education reform has been to "get the right leadership and
teachers in schools, " Adonis said.</P>
      <P>Among the practical measures taken are increasing teachers' salaries by 20
percent and those of principals by 25 percent, he said. Currently there are
40,000 more teachers than there were 10 years ago, he added.</P>
      <P>In terms of higher education, the U.K. government is seeking to expand the
numbers of universities and work-related degree courses and to increase funding
and investment on leading-edge science.</P>
      <P>Adonis visited Hong Kong and Singapore prior to his arrival in Taiwan. On
Saturday he is scheduled to discuss aspects of Taiwan's education reform with
academics and experts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural officials, rice farmers and traders held a ceremony Friday in Pitou
rural township in Changhua County, central Taiwan, to kick off the year's first
harvest Japanese "Dream Beauty" rice.</P>
      <P>In the ceremony, Changhua Magistrate Chuo Puo-yuan and other local officials
reaped rice from the middle of a paddy as part of a symbolic harvest.</P>
      <P>The county's director of agricultural affairs, Chiu Shi-ping, said half of the
total production from the 70-hectare contracted rice fields growing "Dream
Beauty" will be sold to Japan after a series of strict pesticides tests.</P>
      <P>The plantation is a cooperative program between a local rice marketing company
and a Japanese enterprise to grow the premium strain of Japanese rice in Taiwan.
Chiu explained that rice production in Japan often fails to meet domestic demand
because there is only one harvest per year in that country.</P>
      <P>Japanese businesses therefore seek other countries in which they can grow their
own rice, Chiu said, noting that the contract for Pitou to grow "Dream Beauty"
has provisions that the soil, water and farmers' agricultural techniques are as
good as those in Japan.</P>
      <P>While 250 tons, or 50 percent of the rice will be marketed in Japan in the form
of small packages, consumers in Taiwan are expected to be able to purchase the
rice by July in local markets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ban on interracial marriage brokerage to be implemented by the government is
"the right thing to do, " but accompanying measures and enforcement of the law
are even more important, a Vietnamese representative in Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government has always opposed interracial marriage brokerage,
said Nguyen Cong Manh, deputy head of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office
in Taipei (VECO) -- the Vietnamese representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nguyen was responding to an amendment to the Immigration Law in which
legislators agreed Thursday to put an end to the controversial interracial
marriage brokerage industry.  Effective immediately, cross-border marriage
brokers will be banned from doing business and offenders will be subject to
punishment.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 100,000 Vietnamese women married to Taiwanese men living
in Taiwan at present, and one in three foreign spouses in Taiwan comes from
Vietnam, Nguyen said.</P>
      <P>"While most of them have happy marriages, there's no denying that problems such
as abuse, fraudulent marriages and human smuggling are happening, which is why
we, as a government, agree with the amendment, " he said.</P>
      <P>The number of cross-border marriages between Taiwan and Vietnam reached a very
high level from 1993-2003 before the Taiwan and Vietnam governments started
implementing stricter regulations on marriage applications, Nguyen said, adding
that the number has been stable ever since.</P>
      <P>However, the demand was always there and Nguyen stressed that the governments of
both sides will have to cooperate and work out a solution for those Taiwanese
men who want to legally marry Vietnamese women.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, most of the brokerage companies will go `underground' and still do
the same things under the guise of travel agencies or friendship societies," he
said.</P>

      <P>Hsieh's campaign office staff said the first leg of the tour will last until
mid-June. He is scheduled to visit Jenwu township in Kaohsiung County, Hsinpu
township in Hsinchu County, Shengkang township in Taichung County, Wanan

      <P>Hsieh will be showing his concern for the aboriginal and Hakka peoples, the

      <P>The next legislative elections are set to take place next Jan. 12, a spokesman
for the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CEC Deputy Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the announcement after a CEC
commissioners meeting.</P>
      <P>As the tenure of the current legislators will expire Jan. 31, 2008, Teng said,
the next Legislative Yuan must be elected before Jan. 21 to meet the provision
of the current Public Officials Election and Recall Act that succeeding public
functionaries must be elected 10 days before the expiration of incumbents'
tenure.</P>
      <P>According to a proposed amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall
Act being mulled by the legislature, only those who have resided in a specific
constituency for six months are eligible to vote.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Teng said, the voting date for the next legislative
election must be decided six months in advance. As a result, Dec. 1 this year
will have to be excluded.</P>
      <P>A consensus reached at a special meeting held by the Executive Yuan last October
to review electoral affairs concluded that the voting date for central and local
elections should be set either for the second or fourth Saturday of the selected
month.</P>
      <P>"Taking all these factors into account, Jan. 12 is the most suitable day for the
next legislative election," Teng explained.</P>
      <P>As to whether the next legislative and presidential elections should be held
simultaneously, Teng said it will be put forward for the next CEC commissioners
to decide. The term of the present CEC commissioners will expire June 16.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps generally approved of the
CEC's choice of Jan. 12 for the next legislative elections.</P>
      <P>As to whether the legislative and presidential elections should be held on the
same day, Hsu Shao-ping, a main opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus whip,
said the KMT would support either option so long as consensus is reached among
lawmakers of all political stripes.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers had yet to reach consensus
on the issue. According to DPP Legislator Wang Shu-hui, her colleagues from
southern Taiwan constituencies tend to support the combination of the two
critical elections to save social costs, while DPP lawmakers from northern
districts generally oppose the proposal.</P>

      <P>The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) passed a resolution Friday in
support of Taiwanese reporters' rights to cover the World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>The IFJ also condemned the United Nations for discriminating against Taiwanese
reporters in this regard.</P>
      <P>The moves came after the Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) initiated a
proposal at the IFJ World Congress in Moscow to win the IFJ's backing of
Taiwanese reporters' rights to cover the annual WHA, the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>More than 100 member countries passed the proposal, while issuing a condemnation
on the U.N.'s refusal to give Taiwanese journalists WHA press passes.</P>
      <P>The U.N. has refused to issue the press passes since 2004 on the grounds that
Taiwan is not a U.N. member and is thus not allowed to enter any U.N. building,
ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said at the congress.</P>
      <P>The U.N. has violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and sacrificed
the freedom of the press, Chen said, adding that the Taiwan people should be
entitled to such rights.</P>
      <P>Also noting that Taiwan withdrew from the U.N. in 1971, but the U.N. waited
until 2004 to shut Taiwan out of the WHA, Chen attributed the reason to the fact
that the U.N. came under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>The IFJ passed the proposal unanimously and agreed to continue to mount pressure
on the U.N. and to ask the U.N. to agree to allow Taiwanese reporters with
international press passes issued by the IFJ to cover the WHA.</P>

      <P>Apart from the two major international airports in northern and southern Taiwan,
airports in other parts of the country will also be assessed for future direct
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the comment during a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after President Chen Shui-bian told Taichung City Mayor Jason
Hu earlier in the day during a meeting at the Presidential Office that the
central government will definitely include Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung
County for evaluation for its cross-strait charter service plan.</P>
      <P>"The greater Taichung area in central Taiwan must not be excluded from the
central government's cross-strait cargo and passenger charter service program,"
Chen pledged.</P>
      <P>In response to the president's comments, Liu said that airports in the rest of
Taiwan, such as Chingchuankang Airport and Makung Airport on the outlying island
of Penghu, will also be included in the program if their facilities can be
improved to international standards.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Taoyuan Taiwan International Airport and Kaohsiung
International Airport have to date been the two major airports considered for
opening direct cross-strait charter services. Taiwan and China have held seven
rounds of negotiations concerning the issue.</P>
      <P>"More airports in Taiwan could be included in the cargo and passenger charter
service program in the future after the ongoing bilateral negotiations
surrounding the two main airports in Taiwan and their counterparts in China have
wrapped up, " Liu said, adding that "it will be more pragmatic to touch on other
airports only after the talks centered on the Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports are
complete."</P>

      <P>Taiwan has donated funds for the Panamanian government to build elementary
schools in remote rural regions, repair highway surfaces and expand prison
facilities as part of a bilateral cooperation program between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Hou Ping-fu,  the Republic of China ambassador to Panama, presented the funds on
behalf of the ROC government in a ceremony held at Panama's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs Thursday.</P>
      <P>Panamanian first lady Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, Minister of Public Works
Benjamin Colamarco and Minister of the Interior and Justice Olga Golcher
received the donations on behalf of the Panamanian government. All of them
delivered "thank-you" speeches at the ceremony in appreciation of the ROC
government's generous aid.</P>
      <P>A portion of the aid will finance construction of 90 elementary schools in
remote countryside as the Panamanian government is actively promoting compulsory
education in the country's rural and distant communities, Hou said.</P>
      <P>The fund will also be used to finance a project to repair a 20-kilometer section
of a highway leading to the indigenous community of Darien in eastern Panama,
Hou said, adding that the repair project will make it easier for aborigines to
go to see doctor in urban areas and help improve their living conditions.</P>
      <P>As many of Panama's prisons are overcrowded, Hou said the remaining fund will be
used to foot the bills for a prison facility expansion and renovation project.</P>
      <P>"All of these aid projects are based on humanitarianism aimed at helping
disadvantaged children receive education as well as assisting in renovating
Panama's public facilities," Hou added.</P>

    <TEXT>: The Straits Times: Climate change a long-term security threat: PM.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday highlighted a new dimension to the
problem of climate change. He sees it as a potential long- term threat to world
security, not just an economic or environmental worry.

The Lianhe Zaobao: Climate change may provoke the international conflict: warned
PM Lee.

Global climate change is traditionally viewed as an environmental or economic
issue, but it has serious security implications, and it can cause social
upheavals and civil strife.

Between countries, competition for scarce resources and displacement of
populations across borders can deepen tensions, and provoke conflict and wars,
warned Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday in his speech at sixth Asia
Security Conferencel.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next legislative elections are set to take place next Jan. 12, a spokesman
for the Central Election Commission (CEC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CEC Deputy Secretary-General Teng Tien-you made the announcement after a CEC
commissioners meeting.</P>
      <P>As the tenure of the current legislators will expire Jan. 31, 2008, Teng said,
the next Legislative Yuan must be elected before Jan. 21 to meet the provision
of the current Public Officials Election and Recall Act that succeeding public
functionaries must be elected 10 days before the expiration of incumbents'
tenure.</P>
      <P>According to a proposed amendment to the Public Officials Election and Recall
Act being mulled by the legislature, only those who have resided in a specific
constituency for six months are eligible to vote.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Teng said, the voting date for the next legislative
election must be decided six months in advance. As a result, Dec. 1 this year
will have to be excluded.</P>
      <P>A consensus reached at a special meeting held by the Executive Yuan last October
to review electoral affairs concluded that the voting date for central and local
elections should be set either for the second or fourth Saturday of the selected
month.</P>
      <P>"Taking all these factors into account, Jan. 12 is the most suitable day for the
next legislative election," Teng explained.</P>
      <P>As to whether the next legislative and presidential elections should be held
simultaneously, Teng said it will be put forward for the next CEC commissioners
to decide. The term of the present CEC commissioners will expire June 16.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition camps generally approved of the
CEC's choice of Jan. 12 for the next legislative elections.</P>
      <P>As to whether the legislative and presidential elections should be held on the
same day, Hsu Shao-ping, a main opposition Kuomintang legislative caucus whip,
said the KMT would support either option so long as consensus is reached among
lawmakers of all political stripes.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers had yet to reach consensus
on the issue. According to DPP Legislator Wang Shu-hui, her colleagues from
southern Taiwan constituencies tend to support the combination of the two
critical elections to save social costs, while DPP lawmakers from northern
districts generally oppose the proposal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) passed a resolution Friday in
support of Taiwanese reporters' rights to cover the World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>The IFJ also condemned the United Nations for discriminating against Taiwanese
reporters in this regard.</P>
      <P>The moves came after the Association of Taiwan Journalists (ATJ) initiated a
proposal at the IFJ World Congress in Moscow to win the IFJ's backing of
Taiwanese reporters' rights to cover the annual WHA, the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>More than 100 member countries passed the proposal, while issuing a condemnation
on the U.N.'s refusal to give Taiwanese journalists WHA press passes.</P>
      <P>The U.N. has refused to issue the press passes since 2004 on the grounds that
Taiwan is not a U.N. member and is thus not allowed to enter any U.N. building,
ATJ President Chen Hsiao-yi said at the congress.</P>
      <P>The U.N. has violated the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and sacrificed
the freedom of the press, Chen said, adding that the Taiwan people should be
entitled to such rights.</P>
      <P>Also noting that Taiwan withdrew from the U.N. in 1971, but the U.N. waited
until 2004 to shut Taiwan out of the WHA, Chen attributed the reason to the fact
that the U.N. came under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>The IFJ passed the proposal unanimously and agreed to continue to mount pressure
on the U.N. and to ask the U.N. to agree to allow Taiwanese reporters with
international press passes issued by the IFJ to cover the WHA.</P>
      <P>Delegates from China attended the congress but make no comments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE AIRPORTS MIGHT BE INCLUDED IN CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER SERVICES: MAC</HEADLINE>

      <P>Apart from the two major international airports in northern and southern Taiwan,
airports in other parts of the country will also be assessed for future direct
cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight services, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-hsun made the comment during a routine news conference.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after President Chen Shui-bian told Taichung City Mayor Jason
Hu earlier in the day during a meeting at the Presidential Office that the
central government will definitely include Chingchuankang Airport in Taichung
County for evaluation for its cross-strait charter service plan.</P>
      <P>"The greater Taichung area in central Taiwan must not be excluded from the
central government's cross-strait cargo and passenger charter service program,"
Chen pledged.</P>
      <P>In response to the president's comments, Liu said that airports in the rest of
Taiwan, such as Chingchuankang Airport and Makung Airport on the outlying island
of Penghu, will also be included in the program if their facilities can be
improved to international standards.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, Taoyuan Taiwan International Airport and Kaohsiung
International Airport have to date been the two major airports considered for
opening direct cross-strait charter services. Taiwan and China have held seven
rounds of negotiations concerning the issue.</P>
      <P>"More airports in Taiwan could be included in the cargo and passenger charter
service program in the future after the ongoing bilateral negotiations
surrounding the two main airports in Taiwan and their counterparts in China have
wrapped up, " Liu said, adding that "it will be more pragmatic to touch on other
airports only after the talks centered on the Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports are
complete."</P>

      <P>Two procurement delegations formed by Taiwan's agricultural  and industrial

      <P>During their stay in the U.S. capital June 5-7, the delegations will call on
U.S. government officials and members of Congress and sign letters of intent or
agreements with their U.S. counterparts for the procurement of various
agricultural and industrial products, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The agricultural delegation is expected to sign four letters of intent with the
U.S. side for the procurement of soy beans, corn, wheat and beef for 2008 and
2009 -- deals worth a total of US$3.9 billion, up US$800 million compared with

    <HEADLINE>DRUG-RELATED CRIME SERIOUS IN TAIWAN: INVESTIGATION BUREAU</HEADLINE>

      <P>The rampant drug trafficking activities and rising repeat rate of drug-related
crime in Taiwan remain major challenges for law enforcement authorities in the
country, an Investigation Bureau official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking during the 2007 International Drug Control Symposium held in Taipei,
Wang Hua-fu, director of the bureau's narcotics control center, noted that
heroin, amphetamine and ketamine accounted for the largest amount among all the
kinds of illicit drugs seized by Taiwan police over the past four years.</P>
      <P>In the most recent two years, the amount of ketamine seized by police has been
increasing rapidly, making it the most common abused substance in the country,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>According  to Wang,  since China stepped up its crackdown operations against
amphetamine abuse in 2000, many amphetamine producers have moved back to Taiwan
or to Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Investigation  Bureau has arrested many amphetamine makers
over the past several years in Taiwan indicates that amphetamine production is
still very prevalent here, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, new kinds of abused substances, such as ecstasy pills, flunitrazepam,
nimetazepam,  zolpidem and surazepam, have been discovered by police during
their raids on bubble tea houses, KTV parlors, bars and night clubs, Wang said,
adding that there is a rising trend among drug users to take several kinds of
illicit drugs at one time to enhance the intoxicating effect.</P>
      <P>Compared with traditional drugs, the emerging synthetic drugs are cheaper and
more lucrative because of their low production costs, which increases their
potential of being abused by a greater number of people in the future, he
warned.</P>
      <P>Over the last five years, the ratio of repeat or serial drug-related crime has
averaged more than 65 percent, and it is rising every year, with the ratio
registering more than 70 percent for 2005, he said.</P>
      <P>The symposium was organized by the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Ministry of Education and the Department of Health, with the
participants including drug-fighting officers and experts from the United
States, Canada,  France, Australia, Japan and major Southeast Asian countries.</P>

      <P>The 'pan-green camp" led by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
yet to forge a consensus on whether to hold the next legislative and
presidential elections simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Wang Tuoh, a major whip in the party's legislative caucus, said Saturday that
although he expects the DPP to support a combining of the elections, the party
has yet to reach a consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>Wang's remarks came one day after the Central Election Commission (CEC) decided
that the next legislative elections will be held Jan. 12, 2008.</P>
      <P>As the term of the present CEC commissioners will expire June 16, they left the
question of whether to hold the legislative elections alongside the 2008
presidential election to the next CEC.</P>
      <P>Wang said the DPP should approve the combining of the elections, otherwise the
party will face difficulties in the legislative elections, especially because
the party's legislative candidates produced through a controversial primary may
not have a broad base of support and will have to rely on the presidential
election to build up the momentum of support for the party.</P>
      <P>If the two elections are held separately, the DPP will have difficulty winning
more than half of the seats in the streamlined legislative elections, which in
turn will be detrimental to the party's chances in the presidential election,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Kuo Lin-yung, a major party whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, said that the
legislative elections are traditionally held in December, and the CEC's decision
to hold the legislative elections later than usual is probably due to the fact
that it is working in tune with the wishes of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Kuo urged the DPP to coordinate with his party, saying that holding the
elections simultaneously will be favorable to the major political parties
fielding presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>The major opposition Kuomintang should also coordinate with its ally, the People
First Party, on the matter, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Jao Yung-ching said that for caution's sake, it is
better to discuss the matter thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Jao said that if a new president is elected in January, he will have to wait for
four months to assume the presidency in May, which the legislator noted will
pose problems for the current president as well as cause difficulties in the
transferring of power.</P>

      <P>A Chinese-language smoking cessation Web site set up by the John Tung Foundation
will officially open Sunday, foundation officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Foundation CEO Chou Yi-heng said the group came up with the idea of establishing
the Web site to help smokers quit the habit after seeing that many anti-smoking
organizations in Canada, Australia, Britain and the United States have made
similar moves.</P>
      <P>However, as most of the existing smoking cessation Web sites are in English,
they are of little help to ethnic Chinese communities, Chou said.</P>
      <P>He said the Web site to be launched by the foundation targets the 350 million
smokers in China, 5 million in Taiwan and 800,000 in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the Web site can only be viewed in traditional Chinese
characters, and the simplified Chinese character version will be available in
October, Chou said.</P>
      <P>In one of the services to be provided, the Web site has prepared a total 56
letters written by smoking cessation experts for delivery to smokers planning to
quit smoking, he said.</P>
      <P>With each smoker expected to receive one letter a day, the service is aimed at
helping smokers overcome the physical or mental discomfort experienced in the
process of quitting the habit, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Kuo fei-jang, a family physician at National Taiwan University Hospital, pointed
out that the assistance of experts is essential for smokers to persist in their
efforts to quit the habit.</P>
      <P>While less than 5 percent of smokers can succeed in quitting smoking on their
own within six months, the success rate increases to 10 percent for those that
have consulted with doctors, and further to 20 percent for those who participate
in a smoking cessation program provided as part of the outpatient service at
certain hospitals, Kuo said.</P>

      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Saturday that
for the sake of national security, the waiting period for Chinese spouses of
Taiwan nationals to obtain ROC citizenship should not be shortened to four years
from the present eight years.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chang Ching-hui made the remarks as a Legislative Yuan committee
is set to review an opposition-initiated draft amendment to the Statute
Governing the Relations between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area June 6 to cut the waiting period in half.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the DPP, as the ruling party, should consider the views of the
Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of the Interior before deciding on how
to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>She said that in addition to considering national security, one should also
consider the cross-strait situation and the population density in Taiwan, adding
that she has reservations about the amendment, especially in the wake of reports
of Chinese women coming to Taiwan to engage in prostitution under the guise of
marriage to Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>The current regulations state that Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens can apply
to stay in Taiwan as a dependent after being married for two years. After an
additional four years of residing in Taiwan for at least 183 days in each of
those years, they can apply for a long-stay visa. After two more years, they can
apply for citizenship, if they do not have a criminal record.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chu Feng-chi, who is one of the authors of
the draft amendment, said that the waiting period should be shortened based on
human rights considerations.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Lee Chin-an, noted that under the current immigration
law, foreign spouses of Taiwan citizens can obtain ROC IDs after four years,
questioning why Chinese spouses have to wait for eight years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CAR-FREE' TOUR LAUNCHED TO RAISE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS</HEADLINE>

      <P>To promote the idea of a "Car-free Asia" and environmental awareness, 20 people
from around the world, including eight from Taiwan, will launch a four-month
"car-free" tour from Beijing to Paris, traveling on bicycle most of the way, on
June 10 at Beijing's Tiananman Square.</P>
      <P>The "Beijing to Paris (B2P) Car-free" tour is about "celebrating better
mobility, " said Wu Yi-ting, one of the participants in the event, along with
New Zealander Olly Powell, at a press conference. As the first group of
participants have already started their tour, in April, Wu said, the second
group will start the 100,000-kilometer expedition June 10, adding that they
expect to arrive in Paris in October.</P>
      <P>In 1907, three Italians completed the first Beijing-Paris trip by automobile. Wu
and Powell came up with the idea of traveling the same route because "automobile
transportation has changed the world in many ways and changed people's way of
life, led to over-consumption of energy, and destroyed the environment, " said
Wu, who has been living a carefree life and who has cycled across South America.</P>
      <P>"This event will draw attention to one of the most important issues today.
Nothing is more important than the issue of global warming. If we don't change
the way we live, we'll have to build a memorial hall for the life we lost, "
said Canadian composer Matthew Lien, who has been vocal on environmental issues
and who has voiced support for the event.</P>
      <P>The goal of this activity is to travel without cars or "support vehicles, " but
it's up to the individual participants to make their travel plans and choose
their routes.  Most participants have indicated they will cycle all the way.
Others will take trains and ferries on some sections of the journey.</P>
      <P>Thus far, there are three likely three routes that will be traveled. Some
participants are planning to go via the "middle route" -- through China,
Kyrgystan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Poland. Wu and the other participants from
Taiwan will take a more northern route to avoid visa complications in Eastern
Europe and will enter Europe via Finland. Some participants have suggested that
they will take the classic Silk Road route, via Central Asia, Iran and Turkey.</P>
      <P>"This event gives me the opportunity to fulfill my lifelong dream of cycling
from Asia to Europe and to raise environmental awareness among Taiwanese, " said
32-year-old Aaron Huang, who quit his job of 15 years as an Air Force mechanic
to take part in the activity.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, I can arrive in Paris on September 22 -- which is World Car-free
Day, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>A number of representatives of environmental groups, as well as the chairman of
Mongolia's Green Party Erdenechuluun Zorigt, also attended the press conference
to show their support for the event.</P>
      <P>"This initiative by a Taiwanese girl gives us a perfect example of Taiwan's
meaningful participation in international affairs, " said Pan Hen-sheng,
secretary-general of the Green Party Taiwan.</P>

      <P>More than 80 volunteers will start paying home visits in July to new immigrant
families in Taipei City and Taipei County in a program that seeks to help new
arrivals adjust to Taiwan's environment and culture, organizers said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The volunteers, who are mostly retired workers, will try to collect information
and learn about the problems that foreign spouses face and tell stories to
children in their upcoming home visits under the program organized by the Eden
Social Welfare Foundation, said Huang Juo-sung, executive director of the
foundation.</P>
      <P>Four foreign spouses -- three from Vietnam and one from Indonesia -- and two men
who are married to Vietnamese women are among the most notable volunteers in the
program.</P>
      <P>Huynh Trang Phuong Thuy, who came to Taiwan five years ago when she was just 20,
said she decided to join the program because she understands how difficult it is
adjusting to a new environment. As happy and comfortable as she is now, Huynh
said she felt the urge to reach out a helping hand to her "Vietnamese sisters."</P>
      <P>Lin Jian-chung, who is married to a Vietnamese women, also joined the program,
determined to help thousands of new immigrant families like his own.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen Wei-te, a graduate student at National Taiwan University, said he
joined the program "to involve myself more in social activities, rather than
just focusing on studying."</P>
      <P>Volunteers like Huynh Trang, Lin and Yen will be assigned to different regions,
such as Sanchong and Sindian,  and provide counseling,  story-telling  and
Chinese-language  learning  book distributing services. Having received just
three days of training and being fully aware of the possibility of being turned
away at the door on their visits to the homes of new immigrants, the volunteers
said they are still upbeat about the task they will embark upon Saturday.</P>
      <P>"This is only the beginning of a massive and important project that tries to
respond to a national issue, " said Huang.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) statistics, an estimated average
of 12,000 Vietnamese women arrive in Taiwan every year in mixed marriages, Huang
said, adding that currently, one out of every four babies born in Taiwan is born
into a new immigrant family.</P>
      <P>"The new immigrant issue has been ranked in the top three of the ten most
important social issues of the future by analysts and observers, which means the
government and civil groups have to look at and deal with the issue seriously as
soon as possible, " he noted.</P>
      <P>The program is mainly being sponsored by Cathay Life Charity Foundation.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who has been hospitalized since suffering a minor
stroke April 26, will remain in hospital for two more weeks for further
rehabilitation, a city government official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of the Kaohsiung City government's
Department of Information,  Chen's doctors at the Kaohsiung Medical Hospital
advised Chen to build up strength in her right leg and lose more weight before
being discharged from the hospital.</P>
      <P>"Accepting her doctors' advice, the mayor has decided to stay at the hospital
until mid-June," Hsiao said, adding that Chen originally asked to be discharged
June 4 in order to be able to attend the closing ceremony of the city council's
current session on June 7.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said Chen has been recovering well. Quoting an assessment by Chen's
medical team, Hsiao said Chen can now easily walk 100 to 200 meters.</P>
      <P>"But the doctors hope that the mayor can stay for two more weeks to gain more
strength in her right leg so that she will be able to stand for longer periods
of time and walk farther, " Hsiao said, adding that the doctors also want to see
Chen shed some pounds before being discharged from the hospital.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said Chen now attends three rehabilitation sessions per day, including
cycling on a stationary bike, walking up and down a set of stairs, and
embroidering.</P>
      <P>Noting that all these rehab programs have borne satisfactory results, Hsiao said
Chen's condition has greatly improved. "She now can read and sign official
documents as usual," he added.</P>
      <P>At present, Hsiao said, important documents are forwarded to Chen by Deputy
Mayor Chiu Tai-san. In some cases, department chiefs are required to brief the
mayor on certain key projects to avoid delay in processing.</P>
      <P>Over the past month, Hsiao said, Chen has occasionally made inspection tours of
some city development projects in the company of her aides and security guards
or visited her personal friends.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:U.S. Puts Limits on Lenders' Ties to Universities @ The Education
Department, criticized for lax oversight of student loans, released proposed
rules yesterday that would set new standards for universities and ban lenders'
marketing practices that have resulted, in some cases, in loan company payoffs
to university officials.

The 225-page package represents a change in direction by the department, which
for years had ignored calls by its inspector general, Democratic lawmakers and
even some loan-industry officials for it to be more aggressive in policing the
$85 billion student loan industry.

Wall Street Journal: Behind the Bancrofts' Shift at Dow Jones

When members of Dow Jones &amp; Co.'s controlling Bancroft family gathered 10
days ago for a meeting at a Boston hotel, they expected a fight. Some wanted to
entertain a $5 billion bid for the company by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., but
Michael Elefante, a powerful Dow Jones director and family trustee, had opposed
it.

Instead of a rebuff, the family members got a huge surprise: Mr. Elefante had
switched sides. @ Mr. Elefante, a partner at a law firm that had represented the
family for decades, told the group that for Dow Jones to remain competitive, he
now believed the family needed to explore a sale to Mr. Murdoch or another
bidder, according to people familiar with the presentation.</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan exported NT$6.79 billion (US$205.75 million) worth of medical equipment
in the first quarter of this year, up 10.77 percent over the level for the same
period last year, the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) of Taiwan
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>ITRI analyst Wu Hsin-jui said the growth was due mainly to an increase in export
orders,  noting that international  medical equipment giants have continued to
subcontract their orders to counterparts in the Pacific and that demand in
emerging markets has continued to increase.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's main medical equipment exports included vehicles for disabled people,
accounting for NT$630 million, or 15.1 percent, of the total, as well as parts
and accessories for medical instruments, other equipment for experimental use or
medical treatment, and contact lenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also imported NT$8.52 billion worth of medical equipment in the first
quarter, down 0.93 percent from NT$8.6 billion for the same period last year.
Taiwan mainly imported catheters, canular, contact lenses, artificial dialysis
equipment, artificial bones, parts and accessories for dentistry and other

Vikings."

1937: The Central Standing Committee of the ruling Kuomintang approves the

1937: The Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII of Great Britain, marries
his American sweetheart, Wallis Warfield Simpson, in Paris.

sinking four Japanese aircraft carriers and battleships as well as six transport
ships.

1946: Chen Kung-po, former acting president of the Nanking government, is

says that the 1989 crackdown on the unarmed pro-democracy students in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square is a major factor which has driven the Chinese communists

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three kinds of errors to which men are
liable when in the presence of their superiors. First, to speak out when one is
not called upon to speak: that is called being forward. Second, to keep silent
when called upon to speak: that is called being disingenuous. Third, to speak
out without taking into consideration the expression in the eyes of the person
spoken to: that is called blindness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>VIETNAMESE WOMAN DEDICATED TO NARROWIING TAIWAN-VIETNAM GAP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Vietnamese woman married to a Taiwanese man is challenging the widely held
idea among the Taiwanese that Southeast Asian wives are poor women with low
education who can hardly speak Mandarin, as she has just earned a master's
degree from the Graduate School of Family Studies and Child Development at Shih
Chien University in Taipei and has vowed to serve as a cultural bridge between
Taiwan and her homeland.</P>
      <P>The circumstance that led Tran Thi Hoang Phuong to her master's began a decade
ago when she was a student at the National Law School of Ho Chih Minh City in
Vietnam. She worked part-time after school and encountered a young Taiwanese
man, Chien Chih-chung, who was posted there by a Taiwanese firm.</P>
      <P>She married Chien in 1993 and raised two children in Ho Chih Minh City until
2001, when she moved to Taipei with her husband.</P>
      <P>As a university graduate with a bachelor's degree in law, Tran Thi has good
command of Chinese language because of the affinity between Vietnamese law and
Chinese law, which stood her in good stead while trying to adapt to life in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>However, she was annoyed by local news stories about "foreign brides" -- a term
used by local people to refer to Southeast Asian women who married to Taiwanese
-- as most of them are negative, portraying these women as being treated by
their in-laws as tools for breeding, caring for disabled family members, earning
money, or working as prostitutes.</P>
      <P>In order to help those foreign brides, Tran Thi began to serve as a voluntary
interpreter at the Women and Children's Hospital in Taipei, which has opened a
clinic exclusively for foreign brides.</P>
      <P>Tran Thi's experiences at the hospital offered her a chance to make friends with
many Vietnamese women who confided in her about their miserable lives in Taiwan,
mainly relating to getting along with husbands and in-laws, raising children,
adapting to local society and obtaining social support.</P>
      <P>From these women's stories,  one gets the impression that Taiwanese are
unfriendly, shameless and cruel, but Tran Thi thought this could not be right as
she had seen many Taiwanese volunteers in the hospital who are generous,
considerate and compassionate.</P>
      <P>Believing  the cause of the problem lies in the lack of understanding between
Taiwanese men and their foreign spouses -- such men do not get to know their
wives but simply buy them from brokers -- Tran Thi began to teach Vietnamese
language voluntarily to help local people to know about her homeland, first in
classes opened by the Taipei city government at the Wanhua Household
Registration Office, then at the Chungshan Community College, National Open
University and National Chen Chi University.</P>
      <P>Her students include Vietnamese womens' husbands and children, businessmen
interested in exploring the Vietnamese market and university students engaged in
Southeast Asian studies.</P>
      <P>At the same time she decided to enroll at the Shih Chien University graduate
program because she wanted to offer professional counselling to foreign brides
who encounter difficulties in marriage rather than just giving them a
sympathetic ear.</P>
      <P>While studying at Shih Chien University, she organized the Development
Association of Vietnamese Women in Taipei and published the Vietnam Women
monthly catering to her female compatriots living in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tran Thi said local people should value the alien culture brought in by these
foreign brides and put it to good use in enriching the culture of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign brides, Tran Thi said, should be proud of their own culture and
teach their children to treasure their opportunities of being exposed to two
different cultures.</P>
      <P>After getting the master's degree this summer, Tran Thi plans to pursue
adoctoral degree so that she can help more people, not least the foreign brides.</P>

    <TEXT>: Bush's Push on Immigration Tests His Base

President Bush's advocacy of an immigration overhaul and his attacks on critics
of the plan are provoking an unusually intense backlash from conservatives who
form the bulwark of his remaining support, splintering his base and laying bare
divisions within a party whose unity has been the envy of Democrats.

It has pitted some of Mr. Bush's most stalwart Congressional and grass-roots
backers against him, inciting a vitriol that has at times exceeded anything seen
yet between Mr. Bush and his supporters, who have generally stood with him
through the toughest patches of his presidency. Those supporters now view him as
pursuing amnesty for foreign law breakers when he should be focusing on border
security. enditem</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER OPEN TO IDEA OF HOLDING NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Sunday that he is open to the notion of the
Legislative Yuan holding a no-confidence vote against him to topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chin-de of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed the
no-confidence motion last week with the aim of toppling the Cabinet so as to
allow President Chen Shui-bian to dissolve the legislature.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang, speaking to reporters at the Grand Hotel after attending a
national drug control conference, said he respects the ideas of the lawmakers
and President Chen on whether the Cabinet should be toppled to pave the way for
President Chen to dissolve the Legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the president may, within 10 days after
legislative approval of a no-confidence vote against the premier, dissolve the
legislature.</P>
      <P>As of Friday, a total of 46 of the 83 DPP lawmakers had endorsed Legislator
Chen's motion, leaving it 26 signatures short of the one-third threshold
required to send the motion to the legislature. Chen has said that he will
continue to work to get more DPP lawmakers onboard.</P>
      <P>On the reasons behind introducing the motion, Chen said that the long-term
disorder in the "pan-blue alliance"-dominated Legislative Yuan has seriously
hindered administrative operations, adding that "now is the time to put an end
to the farce."</P>
      <P>However, several DPP legislators have expressed doubts about the no-confidence
motion proposal, which has also drawn flak from opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said Saturday that it is
strange that lawmakers from the ruling party are trying to topple the Cabinet,
stressing that any major decision involving the party should be debated and
passed by the DPP legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, a spokesman for the opposition People First Party, asked the DPP
Friday why it is aiming to hold a no-confidence vote against the premier,
instead of against the president himself.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT's) Central Policy Committee, said Sunday that the KMT will not make any
response to the no-confidence motion proposal until it determines whether the
proposal is "just a political facade" on the part of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Responding to these reactions to his proposal, Chen Chin-de said Sunday that it
is constructive that the DPP members have different opinions on issues, adding
that this reflects the "nature of the DPP as a great party."</P>
      <P>Chen, however, reiterated his resolve to continue working to get the required
number of endorsement signatures for his no-confidence vote motion to be sent to
the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, a no-confidence vote should be held within three
days after the motion is sent to the legislature.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) welcomed its 5 millionth passenger
Sunday, five months after it launched its passenger service between Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the two largest cities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 70-year-old passenger, identified as Chen Feng-hsiung, walked out of Panchiao
Station a happy man after receiving his prizes -- a model high speed train and
10 business-class tickets valid for one year -- at a ceremony from Chia Hsian-
teh, a deputy manager of the THSRC in charge of public relations.</P>
      <P>Chen was traveling with his family and a group of 40 friends from his
neighborhood in Changhua in central Taiwan. He said that he had booked the
tickets for himself and his family at the end of May for a one-day sightseeing
trip from Wujih in Taichung County to Panchiao and that he was surprised to be
informed on the train that he was the 5 millionth passenger.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had already ridden a high speed train six times and felt quite
comfortable with the services, adding that he will use the 10 open-end tickets
for more sight-seeing trips with his family.</P>
      <P>The THSRC, which began its passenger service Jan. 5 this year, has twice
increased the number of trains each day to enhance its services. On March 31, it
increased the number of trains going in each direction from 19 to 25 per day. On
June 1, the company again increased the number of trains in both directions from
25 to 31 daily.</P>
      <P>THSRC executives said they estimate that the total number of high speed train
passengers transported since Jan. 5 will surpass the 10 million mark in
September.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) defended  its program  to help  foreign
news  workers  study Chinese-language in Taiwan with scholarship Sunday, saying
that it will help bolster international exchanges and eventually increase
foreign media's understanding of the country.</P>
      <P>The GIO is collaborating with the Ministry of Education to offer monthly grants
of NT$25,000 (US$757) to each of the initial 10 recipients beginning in April,
GIO Deputy Minister Yih Jung-tzung said in a written statement.</P>
      <P>The Chinese learning program will let members of international media outlets
perceive that Taiwan is the best place in the world to learn the Chinese
language and gain a better understanding of Taiwan's democratization,  the
diversity of Taiwan society and amiability of the Taiwan people, Yih said.</P>
      <P>As of April this year, Yih said, journalists from seven renowned media outlets
in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Turkey and Thailand
had applied for the scholarships.</P>
      <P>Yih described as "farfetched" an Apple Daily report Sunday claiming that the GIO
is trying to "curry favor" with foreign reporters by offering them a three-month
grant of NT$75,000 for the Chinese learning program, which at normal language
centers operated by several leading universities would cost only around
NT$30,000.</P>

      <P>The Yilan County government has decided to designate all the county grown rice
to be harvested after July as "Yilan Rice" before putting it on the market as
part of its efforts to develop the county's own brand, government officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In addition to designating the rice as "Yilan Rice, " the government will also
require that information about the rice be included, such as the "rice taste
value, " on the package labels in order to enhance consumer confidence in the
safety and quality of the products, according to the official.</P>
      <P>The "rice taste value is obtained by using a near-infrared grain analyzer to
study the chemical composition of the rice samples, the spokesman explained.</P>
      <P>At present, there are many varieties of Yilan rice packaged under different
names, including Dongnung Rice and Shanshui Rice by the Dongshan Farmers'
Association, and Yuekuang Rice and Wunung Rice by the Wuchie Farmers'
Association, making it difficult to ensure the quality of the rice products, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Besides the package labeling requirement, the county government has also decided
to adopt stricter measures to regulate the amount of chemical  substances  used
in growing rice to further protect consumers, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>The number of drug abusers in the country has substantially declined over the
past one year following the launch of a new anti-narcotics program in June 2006,
Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Eleven months after its implementation, the program -- focusing on reducing
demand for illicit narcotics, rather than supply -- has helped cut the number of
drug abusers put under observation in substance abuse prevention centers by
2,699, or 22.6 percent, Shih said in a speech at the opening of the 2007
National Drug Control Conference.</P>
      <P>The program has also witnessed a decline in the number of drug abusers placed in
substance abuse treatment programs at the centers by 355, or 12 percent, Shih
added.</P>
      <P>He said that the administration declared war on illicit drugs in 1993 but that
it has only had limited success in its campaign.</P>
      <P>The Executive  Yuan Drug Control and Prevention  Committee submitted a proposal
last June to allow the government to adopt a new strategy to control and prevent
illicit narcotics, and the sharp decline in the number of drug abusers over the
past 11 months has proved that the strategy works, Shih noted.</P>

      <P>More than 27 percent of elementary and junior middle school pupils in Taiwan
have experienced physical punishment in school in the first half of this year,
according to the results of a survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Humanistic Education Foundation conducted the survey between mid-April and
the end of May among 1,817 students from 302 elementary schools and 62 students
from 161 junior middle schools around Taiwan. The survey has a margin of error
of plus or minus two percentage points at a 95 percent level of confidence.</P>
      <P>Executives of the foundation deplored the widespread use of physical punishment
in schools despite the fact that the Education Basic Law was amended near the
end of 2006 to ban any form of corporal punishment in school.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that 27.3 percent of the respondents said they were punished
with blows to the body, such as flogging, spanking, slapping of the face,
pinching or jabbing.</P>
      <P>Some teachers ordered other pupils to hit their classmates for their
misbehaviour or asked pupils being punished to slap each other's face.</P>
      <P>Although the 27.3 percent represented a substantial drop from the 51 percent
physical punishment rate for 2005, foundation officials indicated that they take
no satisfaction in the figure.</P>
      <P>In addition to physical punishment, 35 percent of the pupils said they were
subjected to a mild form of punishment -- standing in a corner for 10 minutes or
longer. Another 15 percent said they were deprived of food and water or not
allowed to go to the restroom, while 12.3 percent said they were ordered to do
squat jumps or pushups as punishment.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that Taichung County has the highest physical punishment
rate at 69.1 percent, while Taipei City's rate of 36.7 percent is the lowest
among all cities and counties in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's promise to negotiate
with Beijing to launch direct flights across the Taiwan Strait if elected was
made based on concerns that Taiwan faces the serious threat of being
marginalized, a KMT executive explained Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jun-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's policy committee,  made
the remarks in response to a report in the Chinese-language United Daily News
Sunday that Ma claimed in a recent interview with foreign media that if elected
president in 2008, he will immediately engage in negotiations with China for the
opening of direct cross-strait flights within one year after assuming office.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma had said on previous occasions that he would make direct cross-
strait flights a reality within two years after assuming the presidency, Chang
explained that Ma moved up the deadline to one year as most of the political
concerns related to direct links with China have been alleviated with KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's three visits to China over the past three years
and because the success of direct cross-strait charter flights during holiday
periods has made direct flights year-round more feasible.</P>
      <P>Chang further said that foreign enterprises operating in Taiwan have frequently
called for the government to move forward with opening direct cross-strait
flights, adding that the United States has even stated that it has no willingess
to sign a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan if the government refuses
to do so. He said the government has turned a deaf ear to Washington's calls,
which he claimed is stunting the island's economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chang added that Ma has also come up with an effective policy to open Taiwan up
to Chinese tourists with the goal of developing its economy and avoiding Taiwan
becoming marginalized in terms of regional economic integration.</P>

      <P>Hsu Jen-tu, a confidant of Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh, will be named as DPP deputy secretary-general replacing
Tsai Huang-liang who has tendered his resignation, DPP sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The sources said, Hsu who acts as chief of Hsieh's Southern Taiwan Office had
served as DPP deputy secretary-general during Hsieh's term as DPP chairman
between 2000 and 2002. His new post at DPP headquarters will provide Hsieh a
better grip on the party apparatus during his presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Tsai who was a four-term lawmaker before being named by DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun
as DPP deputy secretary-general in 2006 tendered his resignation last week. He
has been listed by DPP as DPP first choice for lawmaker at large and thereby is
almost certain to resume his role as a lawmaker after Jan. 12 legislative
elections, according to the sources.</P>

      <P>A new industrial park for precision instrument makers is expected to be
developed in Chiayi County beginning this year to create another high-technology
manufacturing arm in southern Taiwan, Chiayi County Magistrate Chen Ming-wen
said Monday.</P>
      <P>As of the start of this month, 24 companies have expressed an interest in
investing in the new industrial park, and these companies are scheduled to meet
with Chiayi County officials June 7 to sign letters of intent on their planned
investment, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A potential industrial park covering an area of 439 hectares in Tapumei,  Talin
township near the Chungshan Freeway's  Meishan Interchange was first zoned by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 2000 as the future site of a high-technology
industrial park.</P>
      <P>The development project, however, failed to get off the ground until last year,
when the Chiayi County government decided to alter its plans and make the area
into a center for biotechnology manufacturing and precision instrument
production, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A total of 86 hectares of land at the site was rezoned as a future biotech
manufacturing center, with land preparation work then getting underway in June
2006, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He added that some 150 hectares of land at the site was recently rezoned as the
base to house precision instrument manufacturing companies.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Steve R.L. Chen and executives of the Republic of
China Instrumental Machinery Association are expected to travel to Talin June 7
to witness the signing of letters of intent, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER PLANNING TO ORGANIZE NEW 'MIDDLE WAY' GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4 (CNA)
06/04/07  14:49:49
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Tang Fei is planning to organize a new "middle way" political
group representing middle-class individuals and intellectuals who are not
supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) or any of the
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Tang, who was the first premier of the DPP administration after Chen Shui-bian
became the first DPP president in 2000, is organizing the new "Taiwan Future
Prospects Society" and calling for members of the middle class and intellectuals
who have lost hope in the current state of Taiwan politics to "grasp their
future in their own hands."</P>
      <P>Wang Hsin-nan, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said he offers his blessing
to Tang over the initiative but added that he is afraid that Tang's new group
may not survive given the tense situation in Taiwan's current political climate.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on Tang's plan, DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang said Tang's
ambition to solve the long-term deadlock between the "pan-green camp" of the DPP
and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, and the "pan-blue alliance" of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally, the People First Party, is
applaudable. However, he added that if Tang is unable to tackle the issue of
national identity, his "middle way" advocacy will lead his followers nowhere.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Shao-ping, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, also offered her
blessing to Tang, saying that Tang's call for "rational middle voters" to step
forward to cast their votes in the 2008 presidential  election is more well-
intentioned  than the mentality harbored by the group calling for people not to
go to the polls at all.</P>
      <P>Chou Shou-hsun, a deputy convener of the KMT legislative caucus, said that
Tang's initiative is welcome, particularly at a time when all the country's
citizens are disillusioned with the sitting DPP administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAVELERS TO CANADA ADVISED TO GET VACCINATED AGAINST MUMPS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City health officials on Monday advised people who are preparing to
travel to Canada in the near future to get vaccinated against mumps before their
departure as that country is experiencing an outbreak of the highly infectious
disease, with about 300 cases being reported in May.</P>
      <P>Mumps is an acute viral disease which is spread among human beings  by saliva
droplets  or direct contact  with articles contaminated with infected saliva.
Children aged nine or younger are prone to the disease. While symptoms are
generally not severe in children, nearly 30 percent of male adults who are
infected with mumps develop orchitis, while about 5 percent of female patients
develop ovaritis.</P>
      <P>The incubation period is usually 12-25 days, with affected persons suffering
from fever and painful swelling of the salivary glands, according to Lin Pi-fen,
deputy chief of the city disease control department.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Taiwan began free inoculation services against mumps in 2004.
Since then, the infection rate of the disease has significantly decreased on the
island, with only five cases being reported in 2006.</P>
      <P>Although mumps is usually not a fatal disease, Lin said, the disease is used as
a public health indicator. He advised that all infants aged 12-15 months should
be vaccinated against the disease and that anyone planning to travel to affected
areas get vaccinated at least two weeks before departing on their trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, VIETNAM SIGN MOU ON HIGH-TECH COOPERATION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Vietnam signed a memorandum of understanding Monday aimed at
bolstering high-technology exchanges and cooperation between the two countries,
the non-profit Institute for Information Industry (III) reported.</P>
      <P>The memorandum -- mainly calling for increased Taiwan investment in Vietnam's
information technology industry -- was inked by III Chairman Ke Chih-sheng;
Hoang Le Minh, deputy director of Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Posts and
Telecommunications, and Pham Ngoc Tuan, an executive manager of the Saigon High-
Tech Park, in a ceremony held at the III headquarters.</P>
      <P>Relocating part of Taiwan's investments to Vietnam will help reduce the risks
from concentrating too much investment in China and create a win-win situation
for Taiwan and Vietnam, Ke said during the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Ke, who led III officials to Vietnam for a fact-finding trip in January, said
that Vietnam, with a hardworking labor force, has witnessed ever-expanding
economic growth over the past several years, averaging 7-8 percent annually.</P>
      <P>He quoted International Telecommunication  Union tallies as indicating that
Vietnam has registered the world's second highest growth in the
telecommunication industry in recent years, behind only China.</P>
      <P>The III head attributed Vietnam's success mainly to the fact that the country
has abundant and inexpensive human resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which remains the largest investor in Vietnam, will also benefit by
continuing to increase its investment in Vietnam, Ke noted.</P>
      <P>For his part, Pham said that Vietnam, a relative "newcomer" to the high-
technology industrial sector as compared to Taiwan, hopes to strengthen
exchanges with Taiwan in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to III tallies, as of the end of November 2006, Taiwanese companies
had channeled US$8.128 billion into Vietnam for various investment projects,
constituting 13.74 percent of all foreign investment in Vietnam. The figure made
Taiwan the largest foreign investor in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Vietnam applied to join the World Trade Organization at the end of 2006 and
gained entry into the organization at the beginning of this year. The country's
entry into the WTO has so far attracted investment from Japan, South Korea,
Europe and the United States amounting to over US$12 billion, III officials
said.</P>
      <P>Besides, they said, the Vietnamese government has announced that it will lower
import tariffs on 330 categories of information technology and telecommunication
products between 2008 and 2010 to attract more foreign investment to help
accelerate the development of its high-tech industries.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has asked all levels of investigation authorities
to wipe out the theft of water gates that has had a serious impact on farmland
irrigation and flood prevention, an MOJ official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said each local district prosecutors office set up a team in
February 2005 to clamp down on this type of crime involving public property
including water gate theft, but the MOJ has made major efforts to curb such
thefts more effectively.</P>
      <P>The MOJ has asked the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office to supervise investigations
by local district prosecutors offices on water gate thefts and work out plans
and strategies for effective prevention and investigation, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Local district prosecutors offices will need to help local police departments
to establish  teams  to reinforce  contacts  with investigation authorities, and
will need to appoint a prosecutor to be in charge of water gate theft
investigation cases, if necessary, he went on.</P>
      <P>All investigations need thorough follow-ups in order to find out if the thefts
are being committed by criminal gangs, as stealing huge public facilities like
water gates is unlikely to be easily done by individuals, the spokesman said,
adding that investigations also need to shed light on other irregularities
related to the theft of the high-value steel gates.</P>
      <P>Local district prosecutors offices should also enhance monitoring of people with
criminal records and should assist local police departments to find out where
the stolen gates are being sold, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) held a news conference Monday
to accuse the Central Election Commission (CEC) of creating chaos by setting the
date for the seventh legislative elections for Jan. 12, 2008.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, KMT legislative caucus whip, said at a Legislative Yuan news
conference that electoral affairs regarding the coming legislative and
presidential elections should be decided by the next CEC, as current CEC members
have to step down June 16 -- the expiry date of their terms given that a draft
CEC Organic Law concerning the lineup of body has yet to clear the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The CEC set the date during a June 1 meeting and said that it will soon notify
the Executive Yuan of its decision to put off the legislative elections,
originally scheduled for Dec. 11 this year, to next January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CANDIDATE VOWS TO TALK WITH BEIJING ABOUT TAIWAN'S SPACE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2008 presidential candidate of the opposition Kuomintang said Monday that if
he is elected as the next president of the Republic of China, he will talk
seriously with Beijing about Taiwan's space and status in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a workshop with representatives of Taiwanese business associations
in China,  Ma Ying-jeou said Taiwan's diplomatic resources should not be wasted
"for nothing" any longer and that if elected, he would strive to negotiate with
the Beijing leadership to reach an agreement on Taiwan's participation in more
global organizations.</P>
      <P>That agreement, Ma said, would not be a zero-sum consensus but a pragmatic
problem-solver.</P>
      <P>Ma said his campaign team has hammered out bilateral and multilateral solutions
on the issue. For example, he noted, Taiwan should first try to gain accession
into the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, the first thing he would like to talk with Beijing is
about the cross-Taiwan Strait security issue, adding that he would seek to
negotiate with Beijing officials based on the so-called  "92 consensus"  in
order to reach an agreement on cross-strait security.</P>
      <P>That agreement, he said, would mainly feature a mutual trust military mechanism
aimed at ending cross-strait hostility in the shortest possible period.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if he is elected, he will definitely improve business and trade
ties across the strait, normalize business and trade relations, negotiate over
the opening of direct air links and allow Taiwan's banking institutions to
operate in China.</P>
      <P>He said he will also seek agreements with China on investment guarantees,
double-taxation  exemption and related measures to facilitate the establishment
of a cross-strait common market.</P>
      <P>He expressed  hope that Taiwan will increase cultural and educational exchanges
with China, including mutual recognition of academic degrees conferred by
schools on both sides and allowing Taiwan institutes to recruit students from
China.</P>
      <P>Ma accused the ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) administration of
failing to do anything constructive for the Taiwan people over the past seven
years, saying that the DPP is simply an electioneering machine that never
delivers its campaign promises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROBES INTO DPP OFFICIALS' `SPECIAL ALLOWANCE FUND' CONTINUING: PANEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 4 (CNA)
06/04/07  19:39:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Probes into alleged misuse of discretionary "special allowance funds" by several
prominent figures in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are
continuing and are being conducted in an impartial way, a special investigation
panel under the Supreme Prosecutors Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yun-nan, director of the panel, said the investigations into DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, Vice President Annette Lu, former Premier Su
Tseng-chang, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Tan Sun Chen, former secretary-general
to President Chen Shui-bian, have not stalled.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a news conference after Minister of Justice Shih Mao-
lin instructed the Supreme Prosecutors Office to explain the progress of the
probes that day. Fielding questions at a legislative committee May 31, Shih was
asked by legislators why the probes seem to be progressing slowly.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that other high-profile probes into the alleged misuse of the
"special affairs fund" involving President Chen Shui-bian and first lady Wu Shu-
jen, as well as the "special allowance fund" involving main opposition
Kuomintang presidential  candidate Ma Ying-jeou, took several months before the
prosecutors formally pressed charges.</P>
      <P>"An individual  case takes several months,  let alone the investigations into
several cases simultaneously, " Chen said, adding that some of the allegedly
misused funds were claimed over a period of seven or eight years, which will
take even more time to investigate.</P>
      <P>"The special investigation panel has not been dragging its feet," Chen said,
adding that "there are no political considerations in the probes."</P>
      <P>He said the panel has followed the principle of caution during the
investigations and has not explained the progress at any time, which he said
could be the reason leading to the impression of a slow pace.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since the panel assigned the cases April 14 to a team of three
prosecutors including Hou Kuan-jen, the team has been working assiduously.</P>
      <P>Hou is the key figure behind the March 13 indictment of Ma, a former Taipei
mayor, over his alleged misuse of the "special allowance fund" during his
mayoral term between 1998 and 2006. The indictment forced Ma to resign as KMT
chairman, although he has denied any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that since the cases were assigned, they have asked the Ministry of
Audit to provide original invoices or receipts for verification and have
instructed financial institutions as well as relevant companies to provide
transaction records.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors have to pore over all relevant documents, which he pointed out
is both time-consuming and laborious.</P>
      <P>Chen also said the prosecutors have so far summoned various accountants and
cashiers to testify 52 times in an attempt to shed light on the use of the
previously little-understood "special allowance fund," although he admitted that
none of the targeted DPP officials had yet been summoned by the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>All executives  holding public office are given a special allowance fund every
month. Although the spending of the money is left up to the administrative
chief's discretion, half of the fund can be reimbursed without any proof of
spending, while use of the other half must be substantiated with invoices or
receipts.</P>

      <P>Computex Taipei 2007 will open Tuesday at the World Trade Center, with some
130,000 people expected to visit the world's second-largest computer show,
including 30,000 potential buyers, according to the organizer, the semi-official
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>TAITRA officials estimated Monday that the value of orders placed during the
June 5-9 fair is expected to surpass US$15 billion.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,926 stalls have been set up at the Computex venues, which cover
three exhibition halls of the World Trade Center and the Taipei International
Convention Hall, with most of Taiwan's leading businesses in the sector,
including Acer Inc., AsusTek Computer Inc. and the Foxconn Technology Group,
having a presence at the show.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Secretary-General Yeh Ming-shuei said that as the annual Computex
is defined as a professional trade fair, it won't be open to the general public
until the last day of the exhibition. He noted that buyers usually place their
orders during the fair for the up-to-date products showcased in CeBIT, the
world's largest computer exposition held every spring in Hanover, Germany.</P>
      <P>Under the trend, trading deals valued at US$12.7 billion in total were forged
during the 2006 Computex, Yeh said, assessing that the value of orders will grow
significantly this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that the country's anti-drug war will be
long and tough, and he urged more people to join the authorities' efforts to
stamp out illegal drugs.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving individuals and groups who have
contributed to drug-fighting efforts over the past year.</P>
      <P>He said that although the government's  efforts to combat narcotics have borne
some fruit, crime related to narcotics, as well as ensuing problems, have become
more complex. This, coupled with new types of narcotics available, means that
"no-one should let down their guard" and more people should take part in anti-
drug efforts, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the government has set 2005-2008 as "the years for waging war
against narcotics."</P>
      <P>The government has also set a new anti-drug strategy since last year which he
said put the emphasis on cutting the demand for narcotics.</P>
      <P>The government now divides drug control work into four major areas: drug-

      <P>The public was urged Monday not to use the newly built Yuchang highway in the
eastern county of Hualien as the highway is not yet officially open for public
use, according to officials from the Directorate General of Highways.</P>
      <P>The remarks came after the officials found that barricades blocking either end
of the highway had been removed and that people were using the road.</P>
      <P>Although safety inspections of the highway have been completed, the officials
said, the public should not use it, in order, they claimed "to prevent
accidents."</P>
      <P>However, local police said that as no stop signs have been set up at the
entrances to the highway, they cannot impose penalties on anyone choosing to use
the road.</P>
      <P>Those responsible for constructing the highway should set up warning signs, or
will be held responsible for any accidents that occur on the highway, the police
officials noted.</P>
      <P>The 16.26-km highway links Yuli township in Hualien County and Changbin township

      <P>Most areas of Taiwan can expect "extremely heavy rain" until Tuesday because of
a plum rain front that has remained stationery over Taiwan, the Central Weather
Bureau predicted Monday.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists warned that people in northern, northeastern, eastern,
western and central regions of Taiwan could see tremendous downpours in short

mudflows.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's plum rain season this year began May 17 and is expected to last through

Monday.</P>
      <P>The office said Ma will call on business and industrial leaders during his visit
to India before heading for Singapore to meet with business leaders and visit
economic facilities there.</P>
      <P>The press release said that over the past seven years under the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration, Taiwan's economy has undergone dramatic
regression, and claimed that this has been due to the DPP's "obsession with
ideology and its incompetence in good governance."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth ranked at the bottom among Asia's Four Little Dragons,
which also include Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore, and even trailed behind
those of Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, it claimed.</P>
      <P>The DPP's maneuvering over the issue of a "de jure Taiwan independence" has also
turned the island into a "troublemaker" internationally, the press release
claimed.</P>
      <P>Ma thinks that only by adopting a more flexible and pragmatic "dynamic  economy,
" lowering  the  ideological  struggle  and strengthening exchanges in economy,
trade, culture and tourism with other Asian countries, can it break out of its
isolation and re-invent its economic miracle, the press release said.</P>

      <P>The presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vowed Monday
to implement direct charter flight services on weekends between Taiwan and China
should he be elected president in 2008.</P>
      <P>Former KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who was nominated May 2 by the KMT as its
candidate for the 2008 presidential election, made the pledge after attending a
seminar with more than 40 chairmen and representatives of China-based Taiwan
businessmen's associations.</P>
      <P>As opening direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait has become an
issue of major concern among a variety of Taiwan people, Ma said that he will do
his best to implement direct charter flights between the two sides should he win
the election and that he will immediately start two-way talks on establishing
full airlinks across the strait.</P>
      <P>If the KMT regains power in 2008, Ma said, the party will get rid of ideological
strife and bear down to implement a wholly liberal economic policy.</P>
      <P>Under the rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over the past seven
years, Taiwan's economy has rapidly worsened, taking the country to the bottom

annual economic growth rate from the current level of 5 percent to 6 percent and
raise the per-capita annual income to US$20,000 by 2011. The KMT harbors an
ambition to make the country a global business operations hub for Taiwan

      <P>A package of draft amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Law cleared a
legislative committee Monday with the aim of allowing the country to better
contribute to global anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering efforts.</P>
      <P>The law amendment will also list suspects engaged in money laundering of more
than NT$5 million as criminals, a tightening of the previous level of NT$20
million that is designed to crack down on economic crime.</P>
      <P>The package will also criminalize the financing of terrorist acts, including
murder, arson, hijacking of trains, ships and airplanes or planting bombs for
religious, racial or ideological reasons.</P>
      <P>In addition, people caught profiteering through fraud or scams will also be
charged as major economic criminals.</P>
      <P>The draft package further requires financial institutions to record and report
the identities of customers engaging in suspicious deals or currency
transactions to units under the Executive Yuan and to keep receipts of all such
transactions.</P>
      <P>Both outbound and inbound travelers must declare their holdings in foreign
currency and travelers checks above a certain ceiling set by the government to
customs authorities. Under the current law, departing or entering passengers
cannot carry more than US$10,000 with them.</P>
      <P>According to government officials, the law revision is expected to help Taiwan
solidify its position in the Egmont Group, as it is feared that China might try
to force a name change of Taiwan in the group. They pointed out that the group
wrote to its 20 members in early May asking them to complete relevant
legislation or face suspension of their membership rights.</P>
      <P>To better help the international battle against money laundering, the Bureau of
Investigation under the Ministry of Justice joined the Egmont Group in 1998

      <P>Citizen participation has been long overlooked but will be an important factor
in our living in the new millennium as well as an integral part of urban design

      <P>Three groups of workshop participants presented their ideas and plans on the
themes of rivers, garden city and community public spaces in the final
presentation of a five-day workshop titled "Living and Housing in the 3rd

German architect Klaus Luig.</P>
      <P>"All human beings are responsible for our future with the objective of enhancing
quality of life. While nature and sustainable growth know no borders, it's
essential to exchange ideas, " Luig said, adding that modern day urban
development often ignores the citizens.</P>
      <P>The workshop, organized by the German Cultural Center in Taipei, brought
together participants from different generations, nationalities and professional
backgrounds to work on ideas for Taipei's future during five days of discussions

civic participation, " said Janice Chen, who was in a group that developed a
plan to better make use of the riverside park on the Hsintien river.</P>
      <P>"It's time to let the real users -- the citizens -- participate in the
development, management and design of their communities and environments, " she
added.</P>
      <P>The other groups worked out plans to redevelop New Garden City, an old community
in suburban Taipei, and the sustainable utilization and management of community
public spaces in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Some of the ideas these participants came up with are actually workable and
will be a very good source and reference for the government, while some of them
are pretty idealistic, " Luig commented after the presentation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expected to retain its third-place ranking in terms of foreign
exchange reserves, ahead of South Korea's, officials of the Taipei-based Central
Bank of China (CBC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials made the prediction on the eve of its announcement of the nation's
foreign exchange reserves as of the end of May.</P>
      <P>As the CBC has in recent days continued to sell its U.S. dollars to stem a
further slide in the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback, May's foreign
exchange reserves are expected to be further down from those in April, although
still be higher than South Korea's, the officials said.</P>
      <P>South Korea announced Monday that its foreign exchange reserves stood at
US$250.74 billion as of the end of May, up US$3.48 billion from the end of
April.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves stood at NT$266.54 billion at the end of
April, ranking third in the world behind only China -- which stood at US$1.2
trillion at the end of March -- and Japan's US$915.6 billion at the end of
April.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Commanders Say Push in Baghdad Is Short of Goal

Three months after the start of the Baghdad security plan that has added
thousands of American and Iraqi troops to the capital, they control fewer than
one-third of the citys neighborhoods, far short of the initial goal for the
operation, according to some commanders and an internal military assessment.

The American assessment, completed in late May, found that American and Iraqi
forces were able to "protect the population" and "maintain physical influence
over" only 146 of the 457 Baghdad neighborhoods.

Wall Street Journal: How H-P Reclaimed Its PC Lead Over Dell

Hewlett-Packard Co. is riding high today as the world's undisputed leader of
personal-computer sales, but that's not how Todd Bradley found things when he
joined the company in 2005.

Dell Inc. was the top PC maker that year, when H-P Chief Executive Mark Hurd
hired Mr. Bradley to run the company's PC business. H-P's PC operations were
barely profitable, morale was foundering and some investors were suggesting H-P
get out of PCs altogether.@</TEXT>

      <P>A local environmental group launched a "plant a tree for me" program Monday to
encourage local people and corporations to make donations for tree planting as
part of efforts to protect Taiwan's climate and natural environment.</P>
      <P>Under the program,  National  Taiwan  University's  (NTU's) Experimental Forest
Administration will plant a tree for every individual or corporation who makes a
donation of NT$500 (US$15.15) , said a spokesman for the Environmental Quality
Protection Foundation (EQPF).</P>
      <P>According to EQPF Chairman Liu Ming-lung, the foundation will cooperate with the
NTU Experimental  Forest Administration  in encouraging local people to join
forces to help slow global warming and protect Taiwan's climate by contributing
funds for tree planting.</P>
      <P>The "plant a tree for me" program is also a response to the "Plant for the
Planet: Billion Tree Campaign" launched by the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) earlier this year aimed at encouraging countries around the
world to plant a total of 1 billion trees in the fight against global warming,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the program spotlights the vital importance of voluntary collective
action in the fight against climate change, Liu said that taking small but
practical steps to combat global warming by planting trees is critical to
protecting Taiwan's climate from drastic changes.</P>
      <P>Wang Ya-nan,  director  of the NTU's  Experimental  Forest Administration (EFA)
, said tree planting can bring about multiple benefits, including reducing
carbon dioxide, promoting the ecological balance, providing additional tourist
attractions, slowing global warming and facilitating soil and water
preservation.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the EFA has designated a plot of land covering 55 hectares
for the "plant a tree for me" program under which a seedling of Taiwan endemic
plant species will be planted for anyone who donates NT$500.</P>
      <P>"All the trees planted under the program will be incorporated into the national
forestry system to ensure their survival for at least 40 years, " Wang
explained, adding that a hectare of land can accommodate 1,500 trees.</P>
      <P>Noting that the first five months of the year are the best period for planting
trees, Wang said the EFA will not begin carrying out the program until next
March.</P>
      <P>A single tree can reduce an average of 465 kg of carbon dioxide during a 40-year
life span, Wang said, adding that the forest to be created under the "plant a
tree for me" program will be tentatively named "Protect Taiwan Climate
Commemorative Forest."</P>
      <P>Prospective donors are welcome to deposit donations in the EFA's bank account at

      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while visiting the southern county as part of a
nationwide campaign tour.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation to the people in the county's Renwu township for
supporting him in the DPP's presidential primary, saying that in the 2004
presidential election, President Chen Shui-bian won 55 percent of the vote in
Kaohsiung County and over 58 percent in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>The former premier said that Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing has
promised to serve as chief of his election campaign headquarters in Kaohsiung
and that he hopes the vote percentage can be raised to 60 percent.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou is "unable to
unify his party" and often uses opinion polls to show that he is in the lead at
critical moments, Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he knows better than Ma how to protect Taiwan, Hsieh said Ma
supports the opening of direct links between Taiwan and China, but his own
belief is that there should be "complementary measures" and that both sides
should negotiate on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's criticism that the DPP only have slogans but nothing of
substance, Hsieh said the DPP government has solved flooding problems in flood-

Kaohsiung City's mass rapid transit (MRT) system soon.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taipei Mayor Hau Long-bin is still talking about cleaning up
the Tamshui River, which his predecessor Ma also talked about eight years ago,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Ma's remarks that Taiwan should learn from Singapore, Hsieh pointed
out that the city state is not as democratic as Taiwan, and that Taiwan should
learn how Singapore became independent instead.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as premier in 2005, Hsieh said he introduced an eight-year,
NT$80 billion (US$2.42 billion) flood-prevention project to take care of
minority groups.</P>
      <P>In addition, he initiated a four-year, NT$40 million plan to improve old
classrooms in central and southern Taiwan, rather than in northern Taiwan, where
he claimed "there are no old classrooms."</P>
      <P>If elected president, he vowed to continue to take care of the disadvantaged and

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's cross-
Taiwan Strait platform has neither feasible assessments nor detailed action
plans, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Monday, describing the
platform as a "campaign gimmick."</P>
      <P>The remarks came after Ma said that if elected next year, he will immediately
embark on negotiations with China and hopes to reach a peace accord on the basis
of the so-called "1992 Consensus."</P>
      <P>The 1992 Consensus, which the KMT claims was reached in Hong Kong between Taiwan
and China during its rule, refers to an understanding that there is only one
China, but with both sides free to make their own interpretations of what "one
China" really means.</P>
      <P>Ma proposed his platform at a meeting in Taipei with Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China.</P>
      <P>The MAC official responded that the normalization of cross-strait relations has
always been the government's stance and that the government has "an overall plan
to promote the policy goal."</P>
      <P>Any issues can be promoted through formal negotiations between the two sides,
the official said.</P>
      <P>However,  Beijing  insists on basing talks on cross-strait exchanges and
interaction on its "One China" principle.</P>
      <P>Under this principle, relations between Taiwan and China are part of China's
"internal affairs, " and cross-strait dialogue and negotiations can only be
conducted under the political framework set by Beijing, the official said,
adding that this is unacceptable to a majority of Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Negotiations over direct flights and further trade cooperation between the two

      <P>Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate the Olympic torch relay route, the nation's
top China policy charter said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tong, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the remarks when
he was interviewed by the Hong Kong China News Agency, set up in 1956 in Hong
Kong to offer news services to newspapers in Chinese in Hong Kong, Macau and
foreign countries, as well as newspaper supplements.</P>
      <P>Reports quoted Chen as saying that after Taipei rejected the torch relay route,
Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of Beijing Organizing Committee for the
Games of the XXIX Olympiad, said there is still a year before the start of the
relay and both sides could talk about the matter.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate and is now waiting for Beijing to
float a new proposal and convey sincerity in wishing to restart the talks.</P>
      <P>Chen said that when both sides of the Taiwan Strait discussed the torch relay
route early this year, they signed meeting minutes. The Taiwan delegate brought
back the planned route for study and gave written agreement to the plan in
March, although the plan at the time did not include Macau.</P>
      <P>Chen said Macau is not a member of the International Olympic committee (IOC) and
that the route plan turned Taipei into a "domestic leg" of the relay.</P>
      <P>Beijing's reference of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee as "Taipei, China"
is also unacceptable, Chen said.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "taking part in IOC-sponsored activities is our right as a
member of the IOC and we'll surely attend the 2008 Games."</P>
      <P>He said that when Beijing bid for the 2008 Olympics, Taipei also cast a "yes"
vote, but the torch relay route shows that Taiwan's goodwill gesture has not
received a reciprocal response from China.</P>
      <P>According to China's plan when it announced the torch relay route in April 26,
the Olympic torch will travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then
continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving
in the host city, Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected the route planning at that time, saying that the route is
unacceptable as it deliberately downgrade Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wants the torch to come to Taipei via a third country and travel on to

      <P>Taiwan is expected to retain its third-place ranking in terms of foreign
exchange reserves, ahead of South Korea's, officials of the Taipei-based Central
Bank of China (CBC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials made the prediction on the eve of its announcement of the nation's
foreign exchange reserves as of the end of May.</P>
      <P>As the CBC has in recent days continued to sell its U.S. dollars to stem a
further slide in the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback, May's foreign
exchange reserves are expected to be further down from those in April, although
still be higher than South Korea's, the officials said.</P>
      <P>South Korea announced Monday that its foreign exchange reserves stood at
US$250.74 billion as of the end of May, up US$3.48 billion from the end of
April.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves stood at NT$266.54 billion at the end of
April, ranking third in the world behind only China -- which stood at US$1.2
trillion at the end of March -- and Japan's US$915.6 billion at the end of
April.</P>

    <TEXT>Today is Tuesday, June 5, or the 20th day of the fourth month of the Year of the
Pig according to the lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events

1723:  Adam  Smith,  the  Scottish political economist and philosopher, is born.
His "Wealth of Nations" was the foundation of classical free-market economic
theory.

1883: British economist John Maynard Keynes is born. He proposed that high
unemployment, being a result of insufficient consumer spending, could be
relieved by government-sponsored programs.

1926: Chiang Kai-shek becomes commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary
Forces in China.

1945: The supreme commanders from the United States, Great Britain, France, and
the Soviet Union sign a statement in Berlin that divides Germany into four
occupation zones under their respective controls.

1947: An Outer Mongolian cavalry battalion, aided by planes with Soviet
insignia, attack Chinese troops at Peitashan in eastern Sinkiang.

1999: Yugoslav and NATO officers meet in Macedonia to discuss the withdrawal of
Serb forces from Kosovo.

adviser to President Chen Shui-bian.

2001: Chen Poh-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, says that in addition to financial aid, the Republic of China is to
offer economic advice to its allies in the same way the United States helped the
island some 50 years ago.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "There are three things which a wise and good man
holds in awe. He holds in awe the Laws of God, persons in authority, and the
words of wisdom of holy men. A fool, on the other hand, does not know that there
are Laws of God; he, therefore, has no reverence for them; he is disrespectful
to persons in authority, and condemns the words of wisdom of holy men."</TEXT>

      <P>President Chen bestowed medals on Su, former Executive Yuan Secretary-General
Liu Yu-shan as well as former Minister of National Defense Lee Jye in
recognition of their contributions to the nation. Su, who stepped down shortly

his Cabinet to resign en masse last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE PAPER PROPOSES CHILD-RAISING SUBSIDY TO BOOST BIRTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  5  (CNA)
06/05/07  13:23:08
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government  may begin offering child-raising subsidies as part of efforts to
stave off a looming low birth rate crisis, population administration officials
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is scheduled to
release a white paper on population policy late this month, in which a child-
raising subsidy is proposed as a measure to encourage married couples to have
more children.</P>
      <P>Referring to practices adopted by advanced countries,  the MOI-drafted white
paper proposes a progressive child-rearing subsidy system, under which families
with children aged six and under will be entitled to a monthly child-raising
allowance, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In terms of the initial MOI proposal, families with a child aged under six will
be offered a monthly subsidy of NT$2,000 (US$60.6) , while those with two young
children will be given a monthly allowance of NT$3,000. Those with three or more
young children will receive a monthly subsidy of NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>MOI officials said the child-raising subsidy proposal is based on the findings
of a series of public opinion polls conducted by the ministry and major academic
institutions, in which more than 50 percent of the respondents consistently
advocated the financial support measure as an effective step to encourage
childbirth.</P>
      <P>The population policy white paper also proposes many other feasible ways and
incentives to boost childbirth, with the goal of boosting the fertility rate
from the present 1.2 children born to each woman over the course of her life to
1.6 children born to each woman over a period of 10 years, the officials said,
adding that when the goal is achieved, the number of newborns will reach an
estimated 300,000 a year.</P>
      <P>As the MOI has received letters from many concerned citizens asking for early
disclosure of the contents of the white paper, the officials said, the MOI will
hold public hearings in northern, central and southern Taiwan, respectively,
from Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOI will refer to all the expert views and public opinions presented at the
hearings when putting the final touches on the population white paper, which the
ministry has spent NT$8 million preparing, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to measures proposed in the white paper, families with three or more
young children will be given a special identification card for their cars so
that they can enjoy either deductions or exemptions for roadside parking and
freeway tolls.</P>
      <P>Families with multiple children will also be offered preferential rates in using
public educational, recreational and entertainment facilities, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The white paper also suggests that men who have deferred performing their
mandatory military service because of education and who have children can opt
for alternative services without lot drawing and can choose to serve at military
bases adjacent to their homes.</P>
      <P>The white paper proposes that over the long run, equal maternity and paternity
leave benefits be offered to both female and male employees. By so doing, the
report says, the cost of employing male and female workers will be almost the
same, which will ultimately contribute to gender equality in employment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Reactions were mixed among ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers
to reports Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian is coordinating between DPP
presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and former Premier Su Tseng-chang for them to
form a ticket to run in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Hsieh won the DPP presidential primary May 6 by beating three other hopefuls,
including Su, who finished second.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has yet to announce his running mate, although there has been much
speculation that he will choose Yeh Chu-lan, a former vice premier and former
acting Kaohsiung mayor, given their longstanding cooperation as well as the fact
that Yeh is a woman and Hakka.</P>
      <P>The Hakka people represent the second largest ethnic group in Taiwan, behind
only the Hoklo people.</P>
      <P>The China Times, a local newspaper, reported Tuesday that the president has
suggested that Hsieh pair up with Su in the belief that their cooperation will
help mend fences after the bitterly contested presidential primary and that Su
will complement Hsieh in terms of expanding support base to boost Hsieh's
chances of winning the presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih, who is a protege of Hsieh, said that Yeh would be
the best partner for Hsieh.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said in Hakka that Hsieh has no need "to pronounce"
his running mate right now, adding that too much talk will be harmful in terms
of future cooperation.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien, yet another of Hsieh's proteges, said that if
most of the Hakka people support Yeh, then Yeh will be the best choice, although
he added that the most important factor will be the strategy employed for the
presidential campaign, and not who will run with Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Wu Ping-Jui, who is a protege of Su, said that
although one should respect Hsieh's views in choosing a running mate, Su would
definitely be a boost to the DPP presidential candidate's chances of winning the
2008 election.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian named former Premier Su Tseng-chang Tuesday as his
envoy to attend the funeral of Malawian first lady Ethel Mutharika.</P>
      <P>Mutharika, wife of Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika, passed away Monday

scheduled to return home June 13.</P>
      <P>This will be Su's second visit to Malawi -- one of Taiwan's five diplomatic
allies in Africa. His first visit was in July 2002 when he accompanied President

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE PROTESTS DOWNGRADING OF TAIWAN'S OIE MEMBERSHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 5 (CNA)
06/05/07  15:28:13

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution Tuesday to express strong protest
against a recent move by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to
downgrade Taiwan's membership to the level of a "non-sovereign regional member"
under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>Also, the legislature condemned China for resorting to political manipulation to
dwarf Taiwan's status as a sovereign country and suppress the country's
participation in international organizations.</P>
      <P>As an organization prompting animal health, the OIE should not have discussed
and even voted on any political motions that violate its mission, the
legislature said in the resolution.</P>
      <P>Noting that there aren't any so-called "non-sovereign regional members" in the
existing OIE charter, the legislature claimed the OIE's decision is totally
illegitimate.</P>
      <P>The legislature urged the OIE to correct its decision and ensure that Taiwan's
membership rights are not undermined to facilitate the prevention and control of
animal diseases around the world.</P>
      <P>On May 25, the 169-member, Paris-based OIE voted in favor of a resolution
according to which Taiwan is requested to continue its participation in the OIE
as a "non-sovereign regional member" under the new name of "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Taiwan gained accession to the OIE in 1954 under the name of "Republic of China
(Taiwan) " but was forced to change the name to "Taipei China" after Beijing was
admitted to the organization in 1992.</P>
      <P>However, China remains dissatisfied with the alteration. In an attempt to push
the OIE to make further concessions on changing Taiwan's membership name, China
has refused to participate in OIE activities and pay its membership fees.</P>
      <P>To try to resolve the problem, the OIE International Committee adopted a
resolution in 2003 to change Taiwan's membership name from "Taipei China" to
"Separate Quarantine Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. "</P>
      <P>At that time, Taiwan made clear that it would accept the new name, but China
refused to accept the resolution and did not take part in the final vote on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Since then, the two sides have been using their membership names that were
chosen in 1992.</P>

      <P>Shih also mentioned that future anti-drug efforts will focus on prevention and
education, rather than on stiffening penalties, as experts in drug-fighting have
suggested that teaching people about the harmful effects of drugs is a more
effective way to encourage people to say no to drugs.</P>
      <P>The MOJ will also enhance cooperation with the Council of Labor Affairs in

      <P>The Executive Yuan has asked Taiwan Salt Industrial  Corp.  not to raise  the
price of salt,  Cabinet Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to reports that quoted Taiwan Salt Vice President Huang
Ching-ju as saying that the company is considering hiking salt prices by between
10 percent and 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the company has not raised the price of salt for over 20 years.
Even after the company became privatized, it has continued the no price hike
policy, although soaring world raw material prices have pushed the cost of
production higher since early this year, according to reports.</P>
      <P>Chen said he called Taiwan Salt Chairman Lin Ching that day to point out that
salt is a basic daily necessity and that if the price is raised, it could
trigger a wave of price increases of other daily necessities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Salt promised not to raise the price and will explain other complementary
measures, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to reports, Taiwan people consume around 100,000 tons of salt a year.
Even after the opening to foreign salt imports in 2004, salt produced by Taiwan
Salt still has a domestic market share of 85 percent.</P>
      <P>Salt products account for only 47 percent of Taiwan Salt's revenues. But as the
prices of salt have been kept low, low net profits have been registered for
salt, although products the company has diversified into, such as cosmetics,
have seen much healthier profits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Mental Health Law Tuesday to
protect the rights of mental patients.</P>
      <P>The amendment saw the removal of an article in the original law that allowed for
the chemical castration of mental patients.</P>
      <P>The amended law forbids people from deserting mental patients, abusing patients
physically or mentally, leaving mental patients with self-care disability in
dangerous environments, coercing or beguiling the patients into marriages,
committing crimes against the patients and using the patients to commit crimes.</P>
      <P>Offenders can be fined up to NT$150,000, with their names being publicized,
while the authorities can also require that offenders accept domestic education
and guidance lessons for up to 50 hours, the law stipulates.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the  law  prohibits  the media  from  using discriminatory
references and descriptions while making reports about mental illness.</P>
      <P>Reports that are not based on fact and those that can mislead their readers or
audience into discriminating against mental patients are also forbidden,
according to the law.</P>
      <P>Media organizations that violate these rules can be fined up to NT$500,000 and
can be ordered to make corrections. Those who fail to comply within a deadline
can be fined repeatedly, the law stipulates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the law states that health authorities around the country should set
up community mental health centers that will be responsible for educating the
public about mental health, training mental health professionals,  providing
counseling and transfer services for mental patients and carrying out the
prevention and control of suicide and substance abuse.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Wang Jung-chang said the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The amount of the minimum wage increase will be finalized this week and put into
practice July 1, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chen Chin-jun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Executive Yuan is now listening views from all quarters, taking
into consideration a proposal by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , the views
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, and suggestions by
business and industrial groups.</P>
      <P>According to the CLA's proposal, the minimum wage should be raised from the
present NT$15,840 (US$476) by 9.09 percent to NT$17,280 per month, while the
hourly wage should be raised from the current NT$66 to NT$95, although trade
groups that visited the Executive Yuan that day complained that the level of
increase is "much too high."</P>
      <P>The CLA believes that the level of hourly wage increase should not be separate
from that of the monthly increase, and should be increased at one time, not in a
piecemeal way.</P>
      <P>But to lessen the burden of the employers and for the sake of a comprehensive
plan, the CLA has also proposed several sets of complementary measures.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung recently said that the minimum wage is aimed at
protecting the livelihoods of laborers and maintaining their purchasing power,
noting that the minimum wage has remained unchanged since 1997.</P>
      <P>He further  said  the minimum  wage hike will  take into consideration the basic
needs of laborers, the impact on Taiwan's industrial competitiveness and
consumer price fluctuations.</P>
      <P>However, major business and industrial groups called for a minimum wage increase
of no more than 5 percent, with a minimum hourly wage of no more than NT$82.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly-built fish ladder in Shinwulu Creek, Taitung County has been helpful
in preserving the endangered Varicorhinus alticorpus -- a species of fish
endemic only to Taiwan, ecologists based in the eastern county reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The species  of fish was discovered  in 1920 by Japanese researchers. Since that
time, its numbers have been decreasing around the island due to overfishing and
habitat destruction caused by human activity. Shinwulu Creek and Beinan River in
Taitung have remained as the only two unthreatened major habitats for the fish
species in recent years.</P>
      <P>However, members of local environment groups noted that "the environment along
Shinwulu Creek has been in jeopardy since a water intake reservoir was built
some years ago."</P>
      <P>"Since that time, " they continued, "fish have died in large numbers every
summer in the creek, including the rare Varicorhinus alticorpus, because the
badly-designed reservoir often leads fish into following dead-end courses."</P>
      <P>In order to prevent further mass die-offs, the Water Resources Agency under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs appropriated funds last year to build a fish ladder
to help fish bypass the reservoir.</P>
      <P>After several months of observation, the local ecologists claimed that the
number of trapped fish has declined since the construction of the fish ladder
was completed early this year.</P>
      <P>"However, there is still much more that can be done to save the Varicorhinus
alticorpus, " they noted, adding that "these measures should be taken before the
species becomes extinct."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of respondents to a public opinion poll complained about lingering
economic doldrums, declining income, inflating consumer prices and the widening
wealth gap, pollsters said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey conducted by the China Times, a Taipei-
based Chinese-language daily, 69 percent of the respondents said they feel the
domestic economy is in bad shape, while 21 percent said the economy is "so-so,"
and only 4 percent gave the economy a positive review, with 6 percent refusing
to answer the question.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll was conducted from May 30-June 1 among randomly chosen
adults, with 829 valid samples collected and a margin of error of 3.5 percent
recorded.</P>
      <P>Compared with the findings of a similar survey conducted by the newspaper in
mid-February, the ratio of those who perceived the economy as "sluggish" rose 21
percent while the percentage of those who felt the economy was "in good shape or
robust" decreased 13 percent.</P>
      <P>The survey findings marked a sharp contrast to official growth figures.
According to statistics released by the government, the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) posted a 4.15 percent gain year-on-year in the first quarter of
this year.</P>
      <P>Superficially, Taiwan's economy has continued to grow, but the poll found that
few respondents are upbeat about their economic well-being. According to the
poll results, 47 percent said they are worried about a possible decrease in
their real household income; 36 percent said they expect their family income to
remain almost the same as last year; while only 9 percent said they think their
income is likely to increase.</P>
      <P>While the government has often touted a steady decline in the unemployment rate,
but fear of job losses has continued to haunt many wage earners. The survey
results show that 54 percent of the respondents said they are afraid of losing
their jobs, compared to 43 percent who said they have no such worries.</P>
      <P>Asked about their views on the current consumer price levels, 56 percent said
they can hardly endure the present upward spiral; 32 percent said they perceive
the price hikes to be moderate; 7 percent said they feel the price levels have
remained almost unchanged; and only a tiny number of respondents said they feel
consumer prices are falling.</P>
      <P>The increasing wealth gap between rich and poor is now widely perceived,
according to the poll. Up to 88 percent of those surveyed said they think the
rich-poor gap has been widening seriously while only 5 percent said the problem
is not very serious.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's current socio-economic structure, 56 percent perceived
themselves as middle class in the social hierarchy, compared to 1 percent who
perceive themselves as upper class and 35 percent who said they are at the
bottom of society.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 81 percent said they agree with the comment that Taiwan's middle
class has disappeared, with wealth getting more concentrated among fewer people,
while the poor are getting poorer. However, 11 percent said they disagree with
the observation.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, 46 percent said their current livelihoods are roughly same
as the previous year; 40 percent said their living standards have declined and
only 13 percent said their living quality has improved.</P>
      <P>As for major obstacles to Taiwan's economic development, 42 percent said
"government inaction due to partisan strife" is the most serious problem
hindering economic development; 32 percent said official corruption and
incompetence  is to blame;  7 percent attributed the current woes to
international competition; and 6 percent said cross-Taiwan Strait issues are the
main hindrance.</P>
      <P>Economists also attributed the gap between bright economic growth figures and
bleak popular perception to a combination of factors, including the country's
excessive reliance on exports for economic growth, relocation of a number of
manufacturing industries to China and other areas to lower production costs,
flagging private consumption and investment, zero growth in salaries for a large
number of wage earners; and most of the economic growth benefits enjoyed by
capitalists and corporate owners.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Revenues of domestic airlines plying western Taiwan routes have continued to
decline, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CAA officials made the observation despite the fact that domestic airlines have
been trying to attract more passengers with major discounts aimed at closing the
gap with fares on the high speed railway and that four domestic airlines allow
their air tickets to be used on each other's flights on the Taipei-Kaohsiung
route.</P>
      <P>The officials said domestic airlines have been badly affected by soaring oil
prices and the slower economy in recent years. Since the launch of the high
speed rail system earlier this year, which cut the rail travel time between
Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes from the previous four-and-a-half hours, the
impact was even more serious.</P>
      <P>The number of air passengers in western Taiwan has continued to drop over the
past three months, the officials said, noting that the number of passengers was
207,000 in March, dropping to 189,000 in April and to 173,000 in May.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-Kaohsiung route has the largest share of air passengers. The number
of passengers on the route was 137,000 in March, 124,000 in April and 113,000 in
May, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Faced with the dwindling revenues, the airlines can do little, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. said it will increase the number of trains
in September, while world oil prices have continued to be high, domestic
airlines will have little leeway for further price cuts, the official said.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines stopped flying the Taipei-Taichung route last month. Although
no other airlines have stopped flight routes so far, the officials expressed
worry that their competitiveness might be getting weaker and that even if they
do not suspend flights altogether , they may have to cut the number of flights,
the officials added. ENDITEN/J</P>

      <P>A Singaporean couple were arrested Monday at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport for attempting to smuggle heroin from Thailand into the country, customs
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the smuggled heroin, weighing about 3.7 kg, was
found hidden inside a tapestry in the couple's luggage when they arrived on a
flight from Bangkok.</P>
      <P>The couple told police that they contacted drug dealers in Bangkok and were to
deliver the smuggled heroin to someone in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The old-fashioned smuggling technique of hiding contraband in tapestries has
made a comeback because now is the peak season for drug demand due to the summer
vacation, the officials said, adding that the customs and aviation police will
reinforce drug detection work.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Military Judges Dismiss Charges for 2 Detainees

The governments new system for trying Guantanamo detainees was thrown into
turmoil Monday, when military judges in separate decisions dismissed war crimes
charges against two of the detainees.

The rulings, the latest legal setbacks for the governments effort to bring war
crimes charges against detainees, could stall the militarys prosecutions here.

Wall Street Journal:In Murdoch's Career, A Hand on the News

As Rupert Murdoch advances in his bid to buy The Wall Street Journal and its
parent, Dow Jones &amp; Co., a central issue is whether he will preserve the
independence of its news operations -- and keep his own views and commercial
interests from coloring what appears in the paper's news pages.

Since his $5 billion offer became public last month, some members of the
Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, have expressed skepticism about his
promise to preserve the paper's independence. Another big shareholder, James
Ottaway Jr., declared that Mr. Murdoch has long "expressed his personal,
political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations."
Even as the family shifted last week from opposing the bid and met with Mr.
Murdoch yesterday to discuss his offer, it began talking about ways to set up a
mechanism for safeguarding the paper's editorial independence.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MAY CPI DROPS 0.03% YEAR-ON-YEAR</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) for May dropped 0.03 percent from the same
month of last year, marking the first time that the CPI has declined after
rising for six consecutive months, according to tallies released Tuesday by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Compared with April, the CPI for May increased 0.21 percent, DGBAS officials
said.</P>
      <P>For the first five months of this year, the CPI gained 0.72 percent over the
same period of last year, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>For May, the core CPI -- excluding fruit, vegetables, fish, shellfish and energy
-- went up 0.65 percent year-on-year, they said.</P>
      <P>By category,  medical  costs for May jumped  4.93 percent year-on-year; food
prices climbed 2.54 percent; clothing prices rose 1.86 percent; and housing
costs increased 0.7 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, a section chief at the DGBAS's Third Department, said Taiwan's
current consumer prices remain at a moderate level and that the chances of
comprehensive hikes are slight.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed the hike in food prices for May to the rise in imported crops such
as corn and soybeans.</P>
      <P>However, because of the good weather so far this year, the prices of fruit and
vegetables for May dropped 18 percent over the same month of last year, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Other items that became cheaper in May also include communication equipment,
digital cameras and televisions, whose prices declined 12.6 percent, 10.1
percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) for May soared 7.59 percent compared
with the same month of last year, owing to hikes in the prices of primary
metals, chemicals, and oil- and coal-based products, according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>While the prices of domestically produced products intended for domestic
consumption rose 5.96 percent year-on-year in May, the prices of imports jumped
10.31 percent, due to a 4.53 percent year-on-year depreciation of the new Taiwan
dollar against the U.S. dollar for the period, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The prices of exports climbed 6.57 percent, they added.</P>
      <P>For the first five months of this year, the WPI moved up 7.39 percent over the
year-earlier level, they said, adding that the DGBAS has predicted that the WPI
for the whole of 2007 will rise 3.9 percent.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long and representatives of 16 large
enterprises signed an endorsement for an energy efficiency campaign Tuesday,
promising to wear casual dress in the office and to turn down air conditioning
by one degree Celsius in both the workplace and in their homes.</P>
      <P>During the signing ceremony held by the Bureau of Energy (BOE) to mark World
Environment Day, which falls on June 5, Chen claimed that the measures could
lower Taiwan's electricity consumption by 2.5 billion kilowatt hours in summer,
noting that this would be enough to power Penghu County for 7.5 years.</P>
      <P>Saving this much energy is also equivalent to avoiding 1.73 million tons of
carbon dioxide emissions, Chen added.</P>
      <P>He reiterated Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's  recent call for government officials
to wear casual dress to the office unless they need to host meetings with
foreign guests. Chang also suggested that air conditioning in offices be
maintained at 26-28 C as part of efforts to promote the Summer Energy Efficiency
campaign.</P>
      <P>Under the BOE's assessment, the power load for air conditioning accounts for 30
percent of the total peak load in summer. Based on research, the air
conditioning for people wearing suits and ties has to be 1.6 C lower than that
of people wearing casual clothing, the BOE said.</P>

      <P>Farmers in the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung are urging the government to
control the population of protected Formosan macaques in order to lessen the
damage they cause to crops.</P>
      <P>Making the appeal on behalf of the farmers during a county council  meeting
Tuesday,  Councilor  Lin Fu-pao  called  for government-supervised action to
cull the monkeys that roam freely in the county's rural townships and ravage
fruit and other crops.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that a colony of the monkeys ruined nearly 3,000 banana plants
on a farm in a single night, while guava and mango orchards in Chishan and
Liukuei townships also lost all their fruit to the animals.</P>
      <P>He said the government should work out a system to permit monkey culls during
specific seasons.</P>
      <P>When told by agriculture officials that Article 21 of the nation's Wildlife
Conservation Law allows farmers to catch or kill the monkeys that ravage their
crops but must report their actions to local authorities, Lin said farmers
cannot do the killing because the law does not allow them to own firearms.</P>
      <P>He said the county government should form a task force to help farmers catch or
shoot the monkeys.</P>
      <P>The Formosan rock monkey is a species of macaque endemic to Taiwan. Under the
Wildlife Conservation Law, those who hunt or trap the animals -- other than
people coveredd under Article 21 of the law -- face up to five years in prison
and fines of up to NT$1 million (US$30,200).</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Cabinet-level  Council of Agriculture in 2001,
Taiwan's rock monkey population totaled about 250,000 at that time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALARM BELL RINGING ON ROC-COSTA RICA TIES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
06/06/07  10:29:15
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Alarm bells are ringing on relations between the Republic of China and its
Central American ally of Costa Rica, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official warned Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the longstanding ROC-Costa Rican diplomatic ties are
at a crossroads and may see a change in the near future.</P>
      <P>"Both the MOFA and the ROC diplomatic staff stationed in Costa Rica have been on
full alert and are keeping close tabs on relevant developments," said the
official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica has been in close contact with China in recent years as it needs
China's support to realize its goal of becoming a non-permanent member of the
U.N. Security Council, the official analyzed, adding that the vast Chinese
market is yet another incentive to draw Cost Rica closer to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Last September, the official recalled that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
held a tete-a-tete with then-Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing while both of
them were attending the annual U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>On May 14 this year, the Costa Rican ambassador to the World Health Organization
(WHO) even cast a "no" vote in the world health regulatory body's annual
assembly in Geneva on the issue whether to include Taiwan's membership
application into its meeting agenda.</P>
      <P>"All these incidents were bad omens for our bilateral ties" the official said,
adding that the latest intelligence collected by the ROC Embassy in San Jose
also shows that Costa Rica indeed intends to accelerate normalization of its
relations with China.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the official said, Taiwan must be prepared for any worst-
case scenario.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944 and the two
countries have since maintained a cordial relationship until recently.</P>
      <P>When Arias, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, was elected president for a second
time in May 2006, he declared that his administration will review its policy
toward China based on Costa Rica's national interest. His declaration was seen a
signal of the activation of Costa Rica's move toward normalizing ties with
China.</P>

      <P>Chiayi County in southern Taiwan received 116.5 mm of rainfall between midnight
Tuesday and 8: 30 a.m. Wednesday, marking the largest amount of rainfall around
the island during that period of time, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
reported.</P>
      <P>The amount of rainfall nearly met the CWB's definition of "extremely heavy rain,
" which means that a place receives over 130 mm of rain within 24 hours, CWB
meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently under the influence of a plum rain season frontal system,
with torrential rainfall expected in western and northeastern regions of the
island, the meteorologists forecast.</P>
      <P>The frontal system will continue to linger until next week, they said, warning
of possible flooding in low-lying areas and possible landslides in mountainous
areas.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Wednesday that the minimum wage will be
raised by 9.09 percent on July 1.</P>
      <P>With the hike, the minimum wage will be NT$17,280 per month and the hourly wage
will be NT$95, Chang said during a regular Cabinet meeting at the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Relevant administrative units, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, are planning to hold a press conference later in the day to explain
the new measure and their preparations for the possible impact of the
adjustment, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>In response to business groups' opposition to a hike exceeding 5 percent, the
CLA has proposed several sets of complementary measures to lessen the burden on
employers.</P>
      <P>Chang recently said that the minimum wage is aimed at protecting the livelihood
of laborers and maintaining their purchasing power, noting that the minimum wage
has remained unchanged since 1997.</P>
      <P>However, major business and industrial groups called for a minimum wage increase
of no more than 5 percent, with a minimum hourly wage of no more than NT$82.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. URGED TO MAINTAIN 'STRATEGIC AMBIGUITY' POLICY ON TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 5 (CNA)
06/06/07  12:19:51
(By Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should continue its policy of "strategic ambiguity" on the
Taiwan issue, former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Baker noted that since the U.S. government switched recognition from Taipei to
Beijing in 1979, Washington has adopted "strategic ambiguity" as its guiding
principle in dealing with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under this policy, Washington will not specify what action it will take on the
question of China's possible use of force against Taiwan, while making clear to
both sides of the Taiwan Strait that the United States expects a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan issue, Baker said.</P>
      <P>According to Baker, the Taiwan issue will find its own resolution eventually,
and what the United States needs to do is to maintain the cross-strait status
quo.</P>
      <P>Baker reasoned that as long as the trade and business activities between Taiwan
and China continue, cross-strait relations will develop in a positive direction
and reach a resolution in the end.</P>
      <P>Baker, who served as secretary of state between 1989 and 1992 in the
administration of then U.S. President George Bush, made the remarks in response
to a question from a reporter, after delivering a speech titled "The Future of
Sino-American Relations" during a U.S.-China Business Council luncheon in
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Baker's remarks came in the wake of observations made by many American  think
tanks  that the cross-strait  policy  of the administration of President George
W. Bush is turning from one of "strategic ambiguity" to one of "strategic
clarity."</P>
      <P>In a report titled "U.S.-China Relations: An Affirmative Agenda, A Responsible
Course" released in April, the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations
suggested that the United States continue the policies of "dual restraint" and
"dual assurance" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>These mean "deterring Chinese aggression and opposing Taiwan's steps toward
independence while at the same time assuring China that the United States does
not seek to perpetuate Taiwan's separation from the mainland and assuring Taiwan
that the United States does not seek to pressure it into negotiating a final
resolution, " according to the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  in an annual report on China's military power published in May, the
U.S. Defense Department pointed out that although the principal focus of China's
military modernization in the near term appears to be preparing for potential
conflict in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing is increasingly surveying the strategic
landscape beyond Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) arrested two drug "mules" and a "fund
provider" in Taichung City, central Taiwan Wednesday, confiscating 28 bricks of
high-grade heroin with an estimated street value of nearly NT$100 million (US$3
million) in the process.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the CIB central Taiwan operations, Lin Jui-yi, a
behind-the-scene fund provider, sent a huge sum of money to a drug dealer in
Vietnam in early May for the purchase and process of the heroin bricks.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsien-min and Wu Chun-chieh, the two traffickers, then traveled to Vietnam
to pick up the heroin. Wang and Wu reportedly first packed the heroin bricks in
the bellies of fish, then froze the fish and sent the "frozen seafood" to a
Taiwan-bound fishing boat heading for the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Unaware that a CIB mobile unit had been monitoring them since late May, Wang, Wu
and Lin were arrested in Taichung City Tuesday while the shipment of fish
containing the heroin was being delivered from Kaohsiung to a house located on
Taichung City's Loyeh Street where they were expecting to receive the shipment.</P>

      <P>A senior defense official said Wednesday that it is not optimistic that China
will remove its missiles targeting Taiwan to pave the way for cross-strait
talks.</P>
      <P>Vice Chief of the General Staff Peng Sheng-chu made the remarks while giving a
report on how to cope with high-tech development of the military at a meeting of
the Legislative Yuan's National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-feng of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) noted that KMT
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said recently that China removing the
missiles is a prerequisite for the holding of cross-strait talks, asking Peng to
give his comment on Ma's remarks.</P>
      <P>Peng said that he cannot give his personal opinion but that the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) is not optimistic that China will easily remove the
missiles.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that China has 11 guided missile bases at which missiles aimed at
Taiwan have been deployed, asking Peng which of the bases poses the greatest
threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Peng said that the point is not which base poses the greatest threat, noting
that any missiles that can reach Taiwan proper represent a threat.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently called for China to honor the Olympic spirit
of fostering world peace by removing all the nearly 1,000 missiles it has
deployed against Taiwan. Beijing will host the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers reviewed Wednesday a proposed amendment to the Animal Protection Law
that would increase the penalty for abusing or deserting animals.</P>
      <P>The bill, which was discussed by the Legislative Yuan's Economics and Energy
Committee, would introduce a jail sentence of up to one year, in addition to a
fine of up to NT$50,000 in the current law, as punishment for perpetrators of
various offensive or violent acts against animals that result in severe injuries
or death of the animals. These would include pet owners who allow their pets to
be harassed, abused or harmed; pet owners who desert their pets; and people who
harass, abuse or harm animals.</P>
      <P>Repeat offenders would also be subject to the prison sentence, even if their
acts do not cause severe injuries or death of the animals.</P>
      <P>Other repeat offenders subject to the jail sentence would include pet owners who
fail to provide necessary health care for injured or ill animals and anyone

      <P>These include failure by pet owners to register their pets' birth, ownership,
transfer, loss or death information within a set deadline;  violation of rules
concerning the transportation of animals; and allowing pets to visit public
places in the absence of care by a person above seven years of age or without
proper protective measures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLA PUTS FORWARD FIVE MEASURES TO COPE WITH WAGE HIKE'S IMPACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/06/07  15:16:53
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) put forward five measures Wednesday to help
alleviate the impact on small- and medium-size enterprises of the 9.09 percent
minimum wage hike announced earlier the same day by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin said that lower class workers and their families are
expected to benefit when the country's minimum wage is hiked to NT$17,280
(US$523.64) per month and the hourly wage is raised to NT$95 on July 1, but he
added that the hike may have a negative impact on small- and medium-size
enterprises.</P>
      <P>To offset the expected negative impact, Lu said, the CLA has decided to
subsidize  owners of certain businesses,  including fast-food chains,
restaurants, supermarkets and gas stations, with a working staff of less than 50
people. The owners will be entitled to subsidies of NT$10 per hour per head when
the staff members work less than 32 hours a week. This subsidy incentive will be
implemented for one year on a trial basis, he added.</P>
      <P>The CLA has also decided to offer subsidies of NT$5,000 per month per head to
owners of companies which employ disadvantaged workers, including physically and
mentally challenged people and senior citizens.</P>
      <P>To deal with the possibility that many workers may lose their jobs because of
the hike in the minimum hourly wage, the CLA will also work to help
disadvantaged workers find employment, receive vocational training and receive
unemployment subsidies, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>The CLA will also see to it that the food and accommodation allowance provided
to foreign laborers working in Taiwan is raised from the current NT$4,000 per
month to NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>CLA vocational training subsidies will also be raised as the fifth measure to
deal with the impact of the hike in the minimum wage, which has remained
unchanged since 1997, Lu said.</P>

      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui has been invited to address the
Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) this weekend, FCCJ officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee will speak on Japan's foreign policy and then take questions from the media,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The event will replace an original plan by Lee to hold a news conference June 9,
the same day he is scheduled to wrap up his 11-day visit and return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The change in itinerary indicates that his Japan visit has attracted a high
level of media attention, observers said.</P>
      <P>The FCCJ was founded in 1945 and has more than 300 members. It often invites
Japanese or foreign celebrities to speak at the club.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian held a video conference with the club in July 2005, and
opposition Kuomintang then-Chairman Ma Ying-jeou addressed the club during a
visit to Japan in July 2006.</P>
      <P>This is Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in May 2000.
However, the trip marks the first time he has visited Tokyo and the first time
he has made a public speech in the country.</P>
      <P>On June 1, he addressed an audience in Tokyo after he was awarded the first
Shimpei Goto Prize by the Japanese publisher Fijiwara Shoten's Goto Shimpei
Organization in recognition of his contribution to Taiwan's urbanization and
democratization.</P>
      <P>Lee was scheduled to deliver a speech at Akita International University
Wednesday on the final stop of a tour of northeastern Japan, after which he was
expected to return to Tokyo.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, he will visit Takushoku University in Tokyo and address the Friends
of Lee Teng-hui Club on the global situation in 2007 and after.</P>
      <P>He has also indicated his desire to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in
Tokyo to pay his respects to his older brother who died fighting for the
Japanese colonial government during World War II. It was uncertain if Lee will
realize the plan. The shrine also reveres executed Japanese war criminals.</P>

Italy, for which he was scheduled to leave Wednesday evening, city officials
said.</P>
      <P>Hau's assistants said that the chances of the mayor departing on the trip over
the next few days are low because torrential rainfall has been forecast in the
city. They added torrential rainfall caused flooding in many low-lying areas of
the city early Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>Citing a Central Weather Bureau (CWB)  report,  City Fire Department Director
Hsung Kuang-hua said northern Taiwan monitoring stations  detected  storm clouds
over the Zhuzihu district on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei, as well as over
the districts of Shipai, Guandu, Tienmu, Shilin and Waishuangxi early in the
morning.</P>
      <P>CWB meteorologists have therefore forecast more rainfall over the next several
days and warned people living in low-lying areas of possible flooding, Hsung

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative caucus voiced
grave concern Wednesday over a possible "domino effect" in Taiwan's foreign
relations following reports of a likely change in Taiwan-Costa Rica ties.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers, including legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping, Su Chi and John
Chiang, issued the warning in a Legislative Yuan news conference after Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)  officials revealed the previous evening that "two-way
Taiwan-Costa  Rica relations might undergo a twist in the near future."</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA officials, the Republic of China Embassy in that Central
American country has swung into full alert and is closely watching developments.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who is a former foreign minister, said he is worried that a "domino
effect" might take place among Taiwan's  diplomatic partners, mostly in Central
and South America and Africa, if Costa Rica shifts its diplomatic recognition
from Taiwan to China.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica, which has maintained diplomatic links with Taiwan for 63 years, is a
symbolic stronghold of Taiwan's diplomatic offensive in the region, Chiang said,
adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) administration
should apologize to the Taiwan people over the uncertainty in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers also predicted that the DPP is very likely to rehash the issue of
the country's bid to join the United Nations in the name of "Taiwan" prior to
the legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP taking such an approach to fuel political issues instead of devoting
energy to improving Taiwan's economy will not benefit Taiwan's people and will
only further squeeze the country out of the international community, they
contended.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian predicted Wednesday that China will never budge on the
issue of Taiwan's sovereignty and said it will have to be Taiwan that
capitulates and surrenders its own sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received a delegation of U.S. China
experts led by David M. Lampton at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>"As Taiwan's president, I can't forego the national sovereignty of Taiwan," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He also  told  the presidential  candidates  for the 2008 presidential election
that they must not harbor any illusions about any softening of China's basic
stance.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China's obstruction of Taiwan has always been relentless
irrespective which party is in power and he claimed that the plight has
"remained unchanged" from the period of the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and
Chiang Ching-kuo down to former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>He noted that the National Unification Council (NUC) -- a government agency to
promote Taiwan's eventual unification with China -- was founded in 1990 during
Lee's time as president, but China still test fired missiles into waters near
Taiwan ahead of the country's first popular presidential election in 1996.</P>
      <P>Chen scrapped the NUC in early 2006, along with the National Unification
Guidelines.</P>
      <P>He said his own experience over the past seven years has taught him never to
harbor any illusions about China.</P>
      <P>China's basic stance is "clear, steadfast and has never changed over the years,"
which is that Taiwan is not a sovereign state and that Taiwan is part of the
People's Republic of China, the president said.</P>
      <P>"For China, Taiwan is a local government, a special administrative region and a
second Hong Kong," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that China is doing its best to marginalize Taiwan, citing the examples
of Taiwan's setback in bidding for World Health Organization membership due to
China's obstruction and a recent move by the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) to downgrade Taiwan's membership to the level of a "non-sovereign
regional member" under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>"The question now is whether or not to insist on Taiwan's sovereignty, whether
or not to resist the notion of Taiwan as a part of the People's Republic of
China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed the presidency in 2000, his administration has rejected the
"one China" principle espoused by China, as well as eventual unification with
China, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDUSTRIAL, BUSINESS SECTORS FRET OVER WAGE HIKE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the country's trade and industrial sectors were at loggerheads with
the administration Wednesday over the issue of a 9.09 percent minimum wage hike,
fretting that the increase might trigger an industrial exodus.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's announcement earlier in the day that
the country's minimum wage is to be hiked to NT$17,280 (US$523.64) per month and
the hourly wage raised to NT$95 July 1, Ho Yu, a standing board member of the
Taipei-based Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) , said the
business sector will bear the brunt of the wage hike but the impact will in turn
send shockwaves through the industrial manufacturing sector, which could
eventually cause an industrial exodus.</P>
      <P>Ho said that although the minimum wage is poised to be raised by 9.09 percent,
business and industrial operators are expected to witness an increase of 11
percent in their salary and benefit payments to their workers as premiums for
labor insurance and health insurance will be hiked and contributions to
employees' retirement pensions will also be raised.</P>
      <P>This incur upon them an extra financial burden to the tune of NT$36 billion
nationwide each year, Ho estimated.</P>
      <P>He added that the 9.09 percent hike is not expected to affect the industrial
manufacturing sector too seriously, with only about 70,000 people impacted.</P>
      <P>However, operators of retail businesses, including department stores,
restaurants, chain stores and supermarkets, are expected to be affected the
most, because most of them employ part-time or hourly paid workers.</P>
      <P>Ho said members of the CNFI groups will not organize street protests over the
issue but warned that they will simply lay off workers and change their business
strategies in order to lower their operational overheads.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce, also expressed worry over the imminent
wage hike.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) should make more careful studies
when trying to put forward coping measures to help alleviate the impact of the
hike on small-  and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin said that same day that about 1.41 million "marginal"
members of the country's workforce -- including foreign laborers, part-time
workers,  senior citizens who have returned to the employment arena after
retirement and female workers -- are expected to benefit from the wage hike.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) in Hsinchu City is to establish a new
research center for intelligent prosthetics, specializing in assisting the
physically impaired with advanced bionic devices or biomedical technology, NCTU
President Wu Chung-yu announced Wednesday at a press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu also noted that the center will be headed by Liu Wen-tai, a professor at the
University of California, Santa Cruz. Liu, who has been devoted to the research
and development of electronic eyes for years, said that with the help of the
center, the improvement project on the existing generation of electronic eyes
should provide fruitful results.</P>
      <P>The first generation of electronic eye -- developed and tested in the United
States -- employs a 16-pixel chip as an artificial light receptor. When
implanted into the eye, the device can replace a dysfunctional retina, providing
partial vision to the patient.</P>
      <P>For the second-generation work, the light-sensing matrix will be expanded to 8x8
pixels to provide wider vision and the power will be provided by wireless
transmission to allow greater head movements. The improved version will soon
enter human testing both in the U.S. and Taiwan, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>Besides visual enhancement devices, Liu noted that the center will also focus on
non-medical electronic devices, such as ones that can help paralyzed patients
regain body control by invigorating body parts with electric currents, or ones
that can alleviate syndromes related to depression by stimulating certain areas
of the brain.</P>

      <P>Programs being offered by hospitals in Tainan city and county to help heroin
addicts kick their habits with methadone substitution have achieved good
results, a doctor at National Cheng Kung University Hospital said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-ting, who has been treating heroin addicts with the methadone
substitution program at Cheng Kung University Hospital, quoted statistics as
showing that from September 2006 until February this year, hospitals in the
Tainan area had treated 225 heroin addicts with methadone.</P>
      <P>Before joining the programs, 67 percent of the 225 drug abusers had committed
criminal offenses, but after receiving the methadone treatment, the criminal
recurrence rate dropped to 0.02 percent, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>He added that Cheng Kung University Hospital has treated 35 new heroin addicts
in the past two months but has found that about 70 percent of them have
contracted HIV, hepatitis or syphilis -- mostly through intravenous injection of
opiates.</P>
      <P>Noting that intravenous injection has replaced sexual contact as the No. 1 cause
of HIV transmission in Taiwan, Wang cited statistics, saying that more than
2,000 people in Taiwan contracted HIV in 2005 from using contaminated needles or
syringes to inject heroin.</P>
      <P>Methadone substitution is a relatively inexpensive method used by many countries
to treat opiate addiction. Unlike heroin, which must be smoked or injected,
methadone can be prescribed as a liquid syrup or in the form of pills. It is
designed to suppress chronic addicts' narcotic withdrawal and reduce their
dependence on heroin.</P>

      <P>Over half of Taiwan's families have tried Chinese medicine, Western medicine and
folk therapy as medical treatment options have become more diversified, official
of National Cheng Kung University hospital said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Family medicine Dr. Huang Ying-hsiang said that a study on the medical treatment
of 2,000 families around the country found that nearly half of rural families
and nearly two-thirds of urban families have sought the three different forms of
treatment.</P>
      <P>Western medicine is still the mainstream therapy in Taiwan, although traditional
Chinese medicine has become the most commonly sought after treatment after
Western medicine, while the use of subsidiary and alternative therapies have
also become popular.</P>
      <P>The results  of a survey  conducted  in 2003  show  that three-quarters of the
respondents said they would seek at least one kind of subsidiary or alternative
therapy.</P>
      <P>Those who have received higher education, are middle class and in poor health,
and those who are women, who suffer from anxiety, chronic pain or urinary
problems, are more often likely to seek alternative therapy, the study found.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition-initiated draft amendment to a statute that would halve the
waiting period for Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals seeking identification
cards would be "too lax" and would be "unfair, " the nation's top China policy-
planning body said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed the view as a Legislative Yuan
committee was set to review the amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations
between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area later that day that
would cut the waiting period from eight years to four.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said that according to the amendment, Chinese spouses would in
fact have to stay in Taiwan for only one-and-a-half years before they get ID
cards, compared with women from other foreign countries married to Taiwanese
men, who would have to stay here for two-and-a-half years before getting ID
cards.</P>
      <P>MAC officials noted that foreign women married to Taiwanese men have to reside
in Taiwan continuously for three years to get ROC nationality,  and then only if
they give  up their  original nationalities and pass naturalization tests. After
that, they can get ID cards after actually staying in Taiwan for more than two-
and-a-half years, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that foreign women married to Taiwanese men and Chinese
spouses are different immigrants, noting that the statute does not demand that
Chinese spouses pass naturalization tests.</P>
      <P>"This is why we should not take the example of `foreign spouses' as reference
for adjusting the system for Chinese spouses, lest it cause chaos," the
officials added.</P>
      <P>The number of Chinese spouses has exceeded 290,000, while the number of foreign
women married to Taiwanese men has exceeded 130,000, the officials said. If the
waiting period for Chinese spouses to obtain ID cards is shortened, the number
will balloon, which will seriously impact Taiwan's social welfare resources, job
market and social security overall.</P>
      <P>Moreover, if the Chinese spouses obtain ID cards, they can apply for their
direct kin aged over 70 and under 12 to come to Taiwan, so that the ensuing
influx of Chinese will increase dramatically, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that at present, the people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait are wide apart in terms of cultural background, social and education
environment, living conditions and core values.</P>
      <P>In addition, the problem of bogus marriages, or marriages of convenience among
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, is still serious, while statistics
released by the Ministry of the Interior show that the number of divorces in
cross-strait marriages exceeds 7,000 couples over the past two years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno denied Wednesday news reports that
alarm bells are ringing on diplomatic relations between Costa Rica and the
Republic of China, saying that Costa Rica's ties with Taiwan remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Stagno said Costa Rica will continue to cement ties with Taiwan but will not
exclude the possibility of continued strengthening of business exchanges with
China.</P>
      <P>Stagno also rebutted recent news reports that Costa Rica and Taiwan are in a
spat over several matters.</P>
      <P>An AFP Spanish-language report said the day before that Costa Rica and Taiwan
have been at odds recently because on May 14, the Costa Rican ambassador to the
World Health Organization (WHO) cast a "no" vote in the world health regulatory
body's annual assembly in Geneva on the issue of whether to include Taiwan's
membership application on its agenda.</P>
      <P>Defending his nation's position on that incident, Stagno said Costa Rica has
rendered its support for Taiwan every year since 1993 on Taiwan's bids to join
the WHO and the United Nations. However, he went on, Taiwan changed its
strategies in its WHO and U.N. bids this year without giving Costa Rica
sufficient advance notification.</P>
      <P>Instead of applying for admission into the World Health Assembly -- the top
decision-making body of the WHO -- as an observer, Taiwan directly filed for
full membership in the WHO in the name of "Taiwan" this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rafael Ramirez, a consultant to the Costa Rica Chamber of Exporters,
said during an interview with the AFP recently that Costa Rica has maintained a
"strategically important" relationship with Taiwan that should not be changed
under any circumstances.</P>
      <P>Ramirez added that although China has a seductively huge market, many
expectations are only "illusory."</P>
      <P>Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944 and the two
countries have since maintained cordial relations until recently.</P>

      <P>Chen made the comments while answering inquiries from reporters after two
proposed amendments to the Statute Regarding the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the People of the Mainland Area, put forward respectively by
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Wu Chih-yang and Lee Chiang-an to
serve that end, failed to pass a legislative meeting for substantial screening.</P>
      <P>One of the amendments called for a shortening of the existing requirement of
eight-year residence in Taiwan to four years for Chinese spouses to gain
Republic of China ID cards, while the other proposed that Chinese immigrants be

their household registered in Taiwan for more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, it is not prudent to rashly push for policy shifts at the
current time as the existing rules have been in place for years, and a sudden
change may bring additional complications due to the special and delicate
relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The two amendments were boycotted by "pan-green" lawmakers of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
and the meeting was dismissed following a vote by the "pan-green" camp to
adjourn the session.</P>

I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney and
one of the principal architects of President Bush's foreign policy, was
sentenced Tuesday to 30 months in prison for lying during a C.I.A. leak
investigation that became part of a fierce debate over the war in Iraq.

The sentence ordered by Judge Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court and his
refusal so far to delay its enactment means that Mr. Libby may have to report to
prison in about two months. That was expected to prompt Mr. Libby's supporters
to accelerate their calls for Mr. Bush to grant him a pardon, although a White
House spokeswoman offered a discouraging view of that possibility Tuesday.

The letters to the judge about I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby came from nearly 200

Mr. Libby helped her with her septic field. The majority urged leniency for the
former Dick Cheney aide.

      <P>The official said Taiwan's average unemployment rate was higher than 4 percent
during 2001 to 2005, which had an impact on college graduates' starting pay. In
addition, a research report compiled by the Organization for Economic

      <P>Japanese figure skater Shizuka Arakawa, the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics gold
medallist in the Women's Singles event, and the 2004 World Champion, will
perform in Taiwan for the first time in August, organizers announced in a press
conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Arakawa and other well-known Japanese figure skaters, including Takeshi Honda
and Junko Yaginuma, will skate in six shows of the Prince Ice World 2007 Tour in
Taipei, to be held Aug. 3 - 5 at the Taipei Arena.</P>
      <P>Arakawa, 26, is the first female skater born in Asia to win the Olympic gold
medal in figure skating, and the second oldest woman to win the Olympic figure
skating gold. She announced her retirement from amateur figure skating and
turned professional in May 2006, joining the Prince Ice World Team.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a large group of reporters, Arakawa said she would like to promote
the beauty of figure skating to the people of Taiwan through this tour. She also
encouraged young Taiwanese skaters to "endure the pain and handwork in daily
practices with a positive attitude."</P>
      <P>"The basic approach to sports is to enjoy the happy side of it and forget the
pain and sorrow, " she said.</P>
      <P>Arakawa, one of the tallest female figure skaters at 5 feet 6 inches, is known
for her spins and jumping ability, especially her triple-triple combination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-TAIWAN FTA 'A MATTER OF TIME': REPRESENTATIVE TO U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative to the United States, Joseph Wu, said the
signing of free trade agreement (FTA) between Taiwan and U.S. is "a matter of
time," and that Taiwan has to wait patiently until the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at Twin Oaks estate in Washington, D.C. where he feasted
Taiwanese agricultural and industrial delegations visiting U.S. to solicit the
support of U.S.enterprises on FTA matters.</P>
      <P>The feast was attended by about 80 people, including representatives of Taiwan
and U.S.enterprises like Uni-President Corp., Taiwan Power Co., U.S. Wheat
Associates, and Westinghouse Electric Corp.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters that the visiting agricultural delegation will sign a letter
of intent to pursue a procurement project worth of US$3.9 billion, and the
industrial delegation, which will sign a contract for a procurement project
costing US$127.09 million, will also propose another cooperative project worth
US$ 11.34 billion.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan has been importing more goods from the U.S. since 1993 and has
since become increasingly tied to American agricultural market, with 95 percent
of Taiwan's imported cereals coming from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Director-general of Foreign Trade Bureau Huang Chih-peng, who is leading the
industrial delegation to the U.S., said the idea of an FTA between Taiwan and
the U.S. has the support of American media outlets and enterprises, and there is
still a chance to sign an FTA with America, because the American government has
not rejected the idea, though nor has it said yes to it, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-hsien, Taiwan's ambassador at-large who is leading the agricultural
delegation to U.S., said he hopes that Taiwan's frequent agricultural
cooperation with America will contribute to the bilateral FTA which should bring
economic benefits to both sides.</P>

Wednesday in the eastern county of Taitung in hopes of developing more
professional grassroots coaches to establish asolid foundation for Taiwanese
soccer.</P>
      <P>These coaches will provide their expertise in conditioning, techniques, tactics

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ASKS CHINA TO RESUME TALKS ON CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  6  (CNA)
06/06/07  22:52:03

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan  has asked China to resume negotiations on three bilateral issues and is
awaiting Beijing's reply, according to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Chen Ming-tong.</P>
      <P>Whether the issues can be resolved will serve as an indicator of the possibility
of opening discussions on other cross-Taiwan Strait issues, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks Monday during an interview with Hong Kong China News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Chen said that soon after assuming his position he twice used existing channels
to ask China to return to the stalled negotiations on allowing Chinese tourists
to visit Taiwan, as well as on cargo and passenger chartered flights.</P>
      <P>Before assuming his chairmanship, Chen said that the MAC had engaged in seven
rounds of negotiation on cargo and passenger chartered flights, and five rounds
on allowing visitors from China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Basic technical problems have been resolved, according to Chen, however, the two
sides cannot reach an agreement on the wording of the agreement.</P>
      <P>During the fourth round of talks, Beijing included a statement saying that
"residents in mainland China visit Taiwan, China" in their version of agreement,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Also, Jia Qinglin, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said late April that private visits
between Taiwan and China are not journeys between two countries, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>Taiwan regarded the statement and Jia's remarks as unacceptable "political
framework," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Taipei proposed its own version of the agreement in the wake of the fourth round
held early February, and has yet to receive any response from Beijing, Chen
said, adding that the Taipei version uses neutral, non-contentious wording.</P>
      <P>Chen also responded to China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Li Weiyi's May 16
remarks by reiterating that Taiwan has made two requests to resume the talks
with China and is awaiting a reply.</P>
      <P>Li said that Taiwan has not yet replied to Chinese proposals made during the
fifth round of talks.</P>
      <P>Describing the three issues as "very important, " Chen said that allowing
Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan will increase the mutual understanding of
peoples on both sides of the strait and that the opening of the chartered
flights could act as a prelude to cross-strait direct transport.</P>

      <P>Four soccer coaches from Paraguay began to pass on their expertise to their
Taiwanese counterparts and students Wednesday as part of the Taiwanese
government's efforts to promote the sport at local schools.</P>
      <P>The coaches will provide guidance to local trainers and students at three
training camps in eastern, southern, and central Taiwan, June 6-16.</P>
      <P>The camps are part of a collaboration between Taiwan and its South American
ally, Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng announced a day earlier at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) hopes that the exchange will help enhance the
quality of instruction offered by local soccer coaches so that the ministry can
achieve its goal of successfully promoting the sport in schools at all levels,
Tu said.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian once proposed the idea of sending 20 student soccer
players to Brazil, a plan that is still being studied by the Chinese Taipei
Football Association, Tu noted.</P>
      <P>Currently, the first step is to invite soccer coaches from advanced countries to
offer instruction to provide a boost to the sport in Taiwan, Tu went on.</P>
      <P>Tu said that he has never played soccer, but thinks that soccer is a good sport
because it builds one's physical strength and endurance.</P>
      <P>Soccer is also a suitable sport for Taiwanese players because height is not an
essential factor, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has over 600 soccer teams, Tu said, adding that 500 of these are
based in primary schools.</P>
      <P>The MOE hopes that the promotion of the sport can begin in primary schools,
according to the minister.</P>
      <P>Paraguay's national soccer team currently ranks 16th in the world, and 3rd in
South America.</P>
      <P>Paraguayan  Ambassador Ramon Antero Diaz Pereira,  who has contributed to the
soccer exchange, said he believes that the four distinguished coaches from his
nation will be conducive to the development of soccer in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Health Minister Hou Sheng-mou arrived in Sydney Wednesday at the head of a
delegation of health officials and medical professionals to attend a
ministerial-level meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Hou said Taiwan delegates will share Taiwan's experience in fight against
contagious diseases and promote cooperation with other APEC members in epidemic
control during the two-day APEC health ministers meeting scheduled for Thursday
through Friday.</P>
      <P>"We'll  speak  on three  topics,  namely  interdisciplinary cooperation,
regional and global cooperation in avian flu prevention, and socio-economic
impact of AIDS in the Asia-Pacific area, " Hou said,  adding that the Taiwan
delegation  will share Taiwan's successful experience in stemming spread of AIDS
in addition to expressing its hope for further cooperation with other countries
in avian flu prevention.</P>
      <P>According to Hou, Taiwan has succeeded in driving down the number of new AIDS
infections through intensified efforts in containing spread of the deadly virus
among drug addicts by providing them with clean syringes.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Hou said, the Department of Health has cooperated
closely with the Narcotics Hazard Control Center and Drug Control Center in
curtailing AIDS spread among drug addicts. "We feel compelled to provide our
experience in this regard for other APEC countries to emulate," he added
proudly.</P>
      <P>Hou said he will also suggest other countries to step up inspection of carry-on
luggage to avert spread of communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's cooperation with Australia and several other APEC member states in
avian flu prevention drill last year was a great success, Hou said he will
suggest that similar exercise be held again this year to hone emergency or
disaster response skills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA GOING ALL OUT TO MAINTAIN TIES WITH COSTA RICA: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 6 (CNA)
06/07/07  01:30:16
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is pulling out all the stops to stabilize diplomatic relations
with Costa Rica amid signs that the Central American country may switch its
allegiance to Beijing, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Briefing media outlets on the latest diplomatic situation, Huang said the
country's relations with Costa Rica are at a "sensitive" stage and that the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is doing "everything within our power" to
consolidate bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>At present, Huang said, various bilateral communications channels still function
smoothly.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Costa Rica have maintained diplomatic relations for more than six
decades. As both are democratic countries, we harbor high expectations of future
cooperation. We'll do everything in our power to keep the ties, " Huang said,
adding that given its good international reputation, Costa Rica is not expected
to do anything that could seriously impair Taiwan's national interest.</P>
      <P>Although the Republic of China's ambassador to Costa Rica, Wu Tzu-dan, has
offered to resign to assume political responsibility for the recent disturbance
and uncertainty in ROC-Costa Rican relations, Huang said he has rejected Wu's
offer.</P>
      <P>For the sake of boosting diplomatic staff's morale, Huang said, the ministry has
no personnel replacement plan at this critical juncture.</P>
      <P>Even though Costa Rica has been in frequent contact with China, it has
invariably stressed in its public statements its willingness to maintain
friendly ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said relations between the two countries are indeed at a
crossroads. It is hoped that the two countries can communicate in a frank and
sincere manner, Huang said, adding that the MOFA is eager to know the
discrepancies between Costa Rica's publicly stated goals and its real thinking
or stance.</P>
      <P>"So far our ties with Costa Rica are OK, but there have been some unusual signs
lately that we should closely monitor and be on our guard," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Among the warnings was Costa Rica's unexpected "no" vote at the World Health
Organization's annual assembly in Geneva in mid-May on a proposal to include
Taiwan's membership  application  into its discussion agenda.</P>
      <P>For all the pall over the ROC-Costa Rican ties, Huang said the government is
unlikely to take the pre-emptive move to ditch Costa Rica as some media outlets
have speculated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE AT 9 A.M. ON COSTA RICA TIES</HEADLINE>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will hold a news conference at 9 a.m.
Thursday to brief the press on the government's response to Costa Rica's
decision to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to a CNA report from Panama City, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
announced his administration's decision to establish diplomatic relations with
China shortly after urgently summoning Republic of China Ambassador Wu Tzu-dan
to inform him of the decision.</P>
      <P>While announcing his government's decision to forge ties with China, the CNA
report said, Arias said that his government will maintain unofficial ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Arias announced at 5: 15 p.m.
Wednesday (local time) that Costa Rica has broken diplomatic ties with Taiwan
and established relations with China.</P>
      <P>Arias' announcement came a day after Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno
was quoted by a Spanish-language wire service report as having denied that his
country's relations with Taiwan would have a "major twist" soon.</P>
      <P>Wu said China has relentlessly strive to use its economic clout to lure away
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, including Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>Since he assumed the ambassadorial post, Wu said pro-China Costa Rican
politicians and celebrities have shuttled between San Jose and Beijing to boost
bilateral engagements. Over the past year, Wu said, Costa Rican and Chinese
diplomats have held many rounds of meetings in private.</P>
      <P>Before the opening of the World Health Organization's (WHO) annual assembly in
Geneva May 14, Wu recalled that he had held three rounds of meeting with Stagno
and two rounds of talks with the Costa Rican health minister on Taiwan's
decision to apply for WHO membership. Both of them promised to support Taiwan's
bid, but they backed off the promise. The Costa Rican ambassador to the WHO gave
an unexpected "no" vote at the WHO assembly on a proposal to include Taiwan's
membership bid into its discussion agenda.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica established diplomatic ties with the ROC in 1944. A Taiwanese
diplomat stationed in Central America said he is worried that Costa Rica's
switching of diplomatic recognition could trigger a "domino effect" and affect
Taiwan's ties with its other Central American allies.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Thursday he has offered to resign
to assume responsibility for the latest diplomatic setback, namely Costa Rica's
switch of diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Huang said he had informed President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-
hsiung of his decision to resign, but he didn't say whether his superiors have
agreed to his offer.</P>
      <P>Huang just said President Chen and Premier Chang have instructed the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs to handle the aftermath properly.</P>
      <P>Costa Rican President Oscar Arias announced his administration's decision to
forge diplomatic relations with China 5:15 p.m. Wednesday (local time) shortly
after he urgently summoned Republic of China Ambassador to Costa Rica Wu Tzu-dan
to inform him of the decision.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and his Costa Rican
counterpart  Bruno Stagno already  signed a joint communique in Beijing June 1
on establishing formal diplomatic ties. However, the Costa Rican government
failed to inform Taiwan of such an unfriendly event until 4:00 a.m. Thursday
(Taipei time).</P>
      <P>For the sake of upholding national interest and dignity, Huang said, the ROC
government has decided to terminate formal relations with Costa Rica and cease

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang announced Thursday the government's
decision to sever diplomatic relations  with Costa Rica after the Central
American  nation proclaimed the establishment of diplomatic ties with China.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed regret at Costa Rica's decision, which he called the result of
"threat and financial temptation" by China.</P>
      <P>"For the sake of upholding national interests and dignity, the government of the
Republic of China (Taiwan) has decided to terminate formal relations with the
Republic of Costa Rica and cease all cooperation projects between the two
countries, " Huang said, reading from a prepared statement during a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Since forging diplomatic relations with Costa Rica in 1944, Taiwan  had actively
assisted  Costa  Rica in improving  its infrastructure and promoting national
development, Huang said.</P>
      <P>However, with disregard for the longstanding friendship with Taiwan, Costa Rican
President Oscar Arias has held several secret talks with China on the
establishment of diplomatic ties since his inauguration in May 2006, Huang
noted.</P>
      <P>Huang said despite Taiwan's efforts to communicate with the government of Costa
Rica with utmost sincerity, Costa Rica still decided to cling to its own way and
chose to "discard the universal values of peace, freedom and human rights
commonly treasured by Taiwan and Costa Rica, and to turn to ally with the
totalitarian communist China."</P>
      <P>Huang claimed that Arias's move goes against the founding spirit of Costa Rica
and the ideals of the Nobel Peace Prize, which Arias won in 1987 for his efforts
to end civil wars then raging in several Central American countries.</P>
      <P>Huang further condemned  China for resorting  to checkbook diplomacy to suppress
Taiwan's participation in the international community, a practice which he said
"seriously hurts the feelings of the Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>He pledged that Taiwan will continue to promote pragmatic diplomacy to enhance
the country's international profile and to safeguard the country's interests and
its people's well-being.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica signed a joint communique on the establishment of diplomatic
relations with China June 1 but did not publicize the news until June 6.</P>
      <P>After severing formal diplomatic ties with Costa Rica, Taiwan now has a total of
24 diplomatic allies around the world.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said Thursday that Costa Rica's decision
to swith diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing is not expected to have a
"domino effect" on Taiwan's overall diplomatic standing.</P>
      <P>Huang made the optimistic  forecast  after announcing  the government's decision
to break off diplomatic relations with Costa Rica following the Central American
country's establishment of official ties with China earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Claiming that China has spent an astronomical amount of money to lure Costa Rica
to shift diplomatic allegiance, Huang said Taiwan has no intention of waging a
"checkbook diplomacy" battle with China.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Costa Rica's unfriendly move would spark a "domino effect, " Huang
said he believes that Costa Rica's decision is only an isolated case, adding
that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered all of the country's overseas
diplomatic missions to cement relations with diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and his Costa Rican

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang accused Costa Rica Thursday of
repeatedly "cheating" Taiwan in the process of its forging diplomatic relations
with China.</P>
      <P>Huang described the manner in which Costa Rican President Oscar Arias handled
the matter as an irony, considering the fact that Arias is a Nobel Peace Prize
winner.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that even before his inauguration in May 2006, Arias had
harbored the idea of establishing diplomatic ties with China.</P>
      <P>In what were considered alarm signals of possible change in Taiwan-Costa Rica
relations, Arias met with Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing during last
year's United Nations meeting held in September, and Costa Rica opposed Taiwan's
bid to gain membership in the World Health Organization during this year's World
Health Assembly held in May, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Even before flying secretly to Beijing in late May, Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Bruno Stagno lied to the media that his country's relations with Taiwan remained
unchanged, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Stagno signed a joint communique on the establishment  of diplomatic relations
between Costa Rica and China with his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in
Beijing June 1. But Costa Rica did not publicize the news until June 6.</P>
      <P>In response to the development, Huang on Thursday announced Taiwan's decision to
sever diplomatic ties with Costa Rica and cease all cooperation projects between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>In Costa Rica Wednesday, Taiwan's embassy in the Central American nation lodged
a strong protest over the Costa Rican government's "extremely unfriendly" move
of switching recognition to Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The Costa Rican government should bear the responsibility and all consequences
for betraying the 63-year-long friendship with Taiwan," the embassy said in a
written statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will close down its embassy in Costa Rica, terminate all aid projects for
the Central American nation and recall its technical corps there, according to
the statement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has cooperated with the United States to break up a cross-border human
trafficking ring and arrest 12 suspects, the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>CIB agents said the ring is suspected of smuggling Taiwan women to the United
States and other countries for prostitution and other forms of sexual
exploitation.</P>
      <P>The agents said the ring's mastermind, Lin Ming-tang, his accomplice Chen Jung-
kee and 10 others were arrested in raids in Taoyuan, Taipei and Keelung a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The suspects included those who are from Tu's group, a major pornography ring
associated with Lin's ring.</P>
      <P>They noted that U.S. customs and immigration authorities in San Francisco have
since February 2006 caught 12 Taiwanese women engaging in prostitution, leading
them to suspect that these women might have been "exported" by human
traffickers.</P>
      <P>The United States, which has stepped up screening measures on foreign visitors
in the wake of the 911 terrorist attacks, sent officials to call on CIB
Commissioner Huang Mao-sui to seek his assistance in helping to track down the
human traffickers.</P>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), which represents U.S. interests in
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic relations, also looked into the visa
application and auditing procedures of the women.</P>
      <P>The CIB set up a task force which confirmed that the women were cheated and
threatened by the ring and that they used forged papers to get visas under the
name of tourists or students, allowing them to travel to major U.S. cities.</P>
      <P>The task force also found that women repatriated by the United States and Japan
numbers more than 100, although the actual number could be higher.</P>
      <P>Agents found that Lin's ring set up "phantom" companies between 2005 and 2006
that helped the women use forged work papers to apply for visas from AIT. The
task force found that the ring had used the method to obtain more than 100 U.S.
visas.</P>
      <P>Lin also extended his operations to Britain, Canada, Japan, Australia and Guam,
and collaborated with Tu's group, the country's largest pornography supplier.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday that Beijing should be held accountable
for the severing of Taiwan-Costa Rica ties.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang announced earlier the same day Taipei's
termination of diplomatic relations with Costa Rica shortly after the Central
American country's formal announcement of establishment of diplomatic links with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Although Lu said that the development was "predictable" due to Taiwan's
difficult situation in the international community as a result of Beijing's
suppression, she added that many people in Taiwan are turning a blind eye to
this and are seeking to placate Beijing.</P>
      <P>She said Beijing's international isolation of Taiwan is a severe problem that
Taiwan's people have to face up to, and questioned how a certain opposition
presidential candidate can attempt to tie Taiwan's fate to Beijing's control.
She also voiced her grave concern that the candidate will be unable to lead
Taiwan through the many difficulties and challenges ahead if he is elected head
of state.</P>
      <P>"It is not prudent to pass the buck to the government, as Beijing is expected to
further pressure Taiwan and aggressively challenge Taiwan on a wide range of
fronts," Lu said, urging Taiwan's people to maintain cool heads and draw a clear
line between the two sides.</P>
      <P>As Lu is slated to visit Paraguay in July at the invitation of Paraguay's vice
president and parliament speaker to mark the 50th founding anniversary of the
Republic of China (Taiwan) -Paraguay diplomatic partnership, she promised to
help explore and solidify Taiwan's diplomatic standing on the tour.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui visited a controversial Japanese shinto shrine for
war dead Thursday to pay his respects to his older brother, who died fighting
for the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.</P>
      <P>Lee entered the Yasukuni Shrine -- where the name of his deceased brother is
listed -- in the company of his wife and Japanese writers Ayako Sono and Miura
Shumon. He stayed there for approximately 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>According to Lee's companions, Lee, who is a Christian, did not perform any
shinto rites but only bowed and prayed silently in memory of his brother.</P>
      <P>While explaining his decision to visit the shrine earlier that day, Lee said the
visit was personal and had nothing to do with political or historical issues.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million soldiers who died fighting for
Japan during World War II, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan which was
under Japan's colonial rule at that time. It has drawn controversy mainly
because executed war criminals are also enshrined there.</P>
      <P>For Asian countries such as China and South Korea which were affected by
Japanese invasions, the shrine is a symbol of Japanese imperialism.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Taiwan's aboriginal representatives have made several
trips to Japan to demand that the Japanese government remove the names of their
ancestors from the shrine.</P>
      <P>Lee's visit attracted a crowd of nearly 100 Japanese and foreign reporters,  and
some Japanese  television  stations  even sent helicopters to cover the event.</P>
      <P>Japanese Cabinet spokesman Yasuhisa Shiozaki declined to comment on Lee's visit
to the shrine, on the grounds that it was a private activity.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Lee is in Japan for cultural and academic activities, Shiozaki
said his visit to the shrine would not affect a planned meeting between Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Hu Jinto slated for June 8 in
Germany on the sidelines of the G8 summit.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that China will not relax its suppression
of Taiwan when the country's new president is elected next year.</P>
      <P>Chen said China's diplomatic suppression of Taiwan has been consistent
irrespective of which political party is in power and it is unlikely to change
with a new president.</P>
      <P>The president's remarks came in a news release as Foreign Affairs Minister James
Huang announced earlier that day the decision to sever diplomatic relations with
Costa Rica after the Central American country switched diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing, ending a 63-year diplomatic relationship.</P>
      <P>Chen said the changes in diplomatic ties with Costa Rica did not come as a
surprise, noting that there were warning signs in that Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias met with then-Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing during last
year's United Nations meeting in September, while Costa Rica opposed Taiwan's
bid to gain membership in the World Health Organization (WHO) during this year's
World Health Assembly conference last month.</P>
      <P>The president said that in addition to stepping up its military threat against
Taiwan, China has also used every means to block and contain the country
diplomatically.</P>
      <P>"China is attempting to blot Taiwan out of the international community
completely by luring away all its diplomatic allies, containing any maneuvering
space of Taiwan and squeezing all its bargaining chips in negotiations," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He also said that faced with the suppression, isolation and downgrading attempts
by China, he has "engaged in diplomatic battles with China daily" since first

      <P>The United States will send two senior officials to Taiwan later this month to
hold preparatory talks with their local counterparts for a sixth round of Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) negotiations scheduled for the second
half of the year, a Taiwanese official said in Washington, D.C. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade, made the
remarks at a press conference before leading a delegation to visit the Office of
the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and U.S. lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and Taiwan plan to convene the TIFA meeting in Washington later this
year, Huang said, adding that John C.C. Teng, the chief negotiator of Taiwan's
Office of Trade Negotiations, will lead adelegation to the U.S. for the event.</P>
      <P>It is not clear that whether the U.S. Congress will extend the Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA) , which will expire June 30, Huang pointed out.</P>
      <P>The TPA gives President George W. Bush the authority to negotiate trade
agreements with other nations.</P>
      <P>In this situation, Taiwan will continue to express willingness to sign a free
trade agreement (FTA) with the U.S., Huang noted, adding that the sixth round of
TIFA talks is critical because its success can further U.S.-Taiwan substantive
relations.</P>
      <P>Both sides have fully discussed the agenda for the TIFA talks, while the
specific date for the negotiations will be announced following confirmation with
the U.S., according to Huang.</P>
      <P>Despite no progress having been made in the bid for an FTA, Huang said both
sides are satisfied with the results of last year's TIFA meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has assured the U.S. that it takes the interests of U.S. companies
seriously with regard to intellectual property rights and drug reimbursement
costs of Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The TIFA negotiations will focus on the signing of a bilateral investment
agreement, an avoidance of double taxation agreement and a government
procurement agreement, Huang continued.</P>
      <P>Aside from face-to-face meetings, both sides have also held three
videoconferences on the bilateral investment agreement, and will also hold
videoconferences on the two other agreements, Huang said.</P>
      <P>There is no timetable for the signing of the three agreements, according to
Huang, although he added that the two sides are willing to carry on the talks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) initiated Thursday an "LED lighting
standards and quality R&amp;D alliance" both to boost the market share of
locally made LED lighting equipment and to integrate the upstream and downstream
manufacturers in the industry, Economics Minister Steve R.L. Chen announced at a
press conference that day.</P>
      <P>Chen also announced that the ministry has appropriated NT$170 million
(approximately US$5 million) to establish Taiwan's first comprehensive LED
lighting measuring system that will facilitate technological improvements in LED
packaging and lighting.</P>
      <P>LEDs, or light emitting diodes, are described as an eco-friendly and energy-
saving method of lighting. As the global demand for LED lighting equipment has
surged in recent years, Taiwan's total production value for LED lighting topped
NT$21 billion last year, representing 10 percent of the global market value.</P>
      <P>Chen also noted that LED lighting equipment can be a niche for Taiwan-based
manufacturers, as well as a superb instrument for better energy efficiency
around the nation.</P>
      <P>"If all traffic lights were replaced with LEDs, it would mean power savings of
85 percent, " Chen continued. "If all streetlamps were replaced with LEDs, it
would lead to power savings of 41 percent," he added.</P>
      <P>"The energy saved in both areas could equal 10.7 billion kilowatt-hours, or the
annual output volume of an entire nuclear power generating unit," Chen said.</P>

      <P>Japan's Interchange Association (IA) Kaohsiung Office Director Hiromichi Kambe
wound up a two-day visit to Penghu County Thursday that he made to gain a better
understanding of the offshore county's tourist industry.</P>
      <P>Kambe visited Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa the previous day and
exchanged views with him on the county's tourism development and its "mini three
links," which allow Penghu residents to travel to China's Fujian Province via
direct ferry routes through Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>Wang told Kambe that environmental protection and marine resource preservation
have been taken by the county government and local residents as important
directions for the development of tourism. The protection of natural beauty
should attract more tourists to visit the county's world-class attractions such
as its basalt columns, Wang added.</P>
      <P>He noted that a delegation of the county's cross-Taiwan Strait exchange
association visited Fujian in April via the "mini three links" to promote Penghu
tourism, and added that a group of about 119 members to be led by Fujian
officials will visit Penghu County June 11.</P>
      <P>He also said construction of many five-star hotels will be completed within two

      <P>Kambe suggested that in addition to five-star hotels, the county government
could consider building clubs to provide comfortable long-stays with lower
prices to backpackers. He also promised to help promote Penghu tourism.</P>

      <P>Videoland Movie Channel, Taiwan's first cable television channel dedicated to
showing Chinese-language films, announced Thursday that it will set aside NT$1
billion (US$30.18 million) to produce 100 digital films over the next five
years.</P>
      <P>Hu Kuan-chen,  president of Videoland Movie Channel,  told reporters that her
company will also spend millions to recruit writing talent.</P>
      <P>Hu, 38, is a former actress who has starred in 18 films. She made the
announcement two days after the channel celebrated its 15th anniversary.</P>
      <P>Her deputy, Yao Ching-kang -- a playwright who has written 36 plays -- said
Videoland will begin to shoot films in different genres in Hong Kong, Taiwan and
China this year, and that the company will place more emphasis on good plays
than on the latest stars.</P>
      <P>Videoland has a library of more than 1,200 Chinese-language films and shows an
average of about 120 titles each month. In 2004, the channel ventured into the
production of digital films and scored success with two titles -- "Bodyguard for
a Corpse" and "Dear Corpse" -- followed by two more hits in 2005 -- "Playful
Ghost" and "Ghost Mama." In 2006, Videoland Movie Channel produced "Puppy Love"

      <P>Outgoing Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung denied
Thursday that a "conspiracy" was behind the CEC's decision to hold the next

      <P>Chang brushed off the allegation while answering questions from lawmakers after
having reported on the CEC's programming of the next legislative and

      <P>In response to main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers' suspicion that the
date for the seventh Legislative Yuan has been put off to Jan. 12, 2008 from the
originally projected December this year to hobble KMT supporter turnout, Chang
replied that the date was set based on a majority agreement after thorough study

      <P>"There is absolutely not any conspiracy behind the decision and it is the best

      <P>Commenting on the possibility that the date for the legislative election could

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) issued a statement Thursday condemning
Beijing's constant suppression of Taiwan, saying that China's bullying of Taiwan
will only drive the two countries further apart.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced earlier
in the day the termination of Taiwan-Costa Rica diplomatic ties after the
Central American nation proclaimed its establishment of diplomatic links with
Beijing hours earlier.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the severance of Taiwan-Costa Rica diplomatic ties -- Taiwan's
latest setback in its diplomatic war against China -- the MAC called on the
public not to harbor any illusions about China, given Beijing's apparent
ambition to swallow up the country.</P>
      <P>Beijing's objectives of making Taiwan a province of China and excluding Taiwan
from the international arena is obvious, it said, pointing out that Beijing's
growing military buildup aimed at Taiwan and its increasing squeeze of Taiwan
internationally are the prime barriers to any improvement in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing's two-pronged approach -- paying lip service to two-way exchanges to
court the Taiwan people while seeking to impose a full blockade of Taiwan on the
world stage -- is ubiquitous, the MAC said, adding that "some people's wishful
thinking" of holding negotiations with China will only provide Beijing with a
pretext to further suppress Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's series of "uncouth and barbarian" reactions against Taiwan are doomed
to fuel resentment among Taiwan's people and the communist Chinese regime must
be held responsible for the growing alienation between the two sides, according
to the MAC.</P>

In a surprising advance that could sidestep the ethical debates surrounding stem

medicine, the conversion of a patient's cells into specialized tissues that

The advance is an easy-to-use technique for reprogramming a skin cell of a mouse

As hurricane season gets under way, a dramatic shift in the way homeowners

Private insurers have been fleeing the shoreline, wary of costly storms and
often fed up with government regulations that prevent them from pushing rates

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan registered a trade surplus of US$1.59 billion in May, the 15th
consecutive month in which the country recorded a trade surplus since March
2006, the Ministry of Finance said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Financial officials cited customs' tallies to show that exports in May totaled
US$19.58 billion, up 3.5 percent month-on-month. The figure was the seventh
largest for a single month.</P>
      <P>Imports in May totaled US$18.19 percent, down 0.1 percent from the same month
last year, or the third largest total in years.</P>
      <P>Officials attributed the increased exports in May to greater exports to China,
six member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Europe,
which rose 5.2 percent, 3.3 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan increased its imports from China, the United States and Europe
by 14.0 percent, 12.5 percent and 12.2 percent respectively in May over the same
month the year before, imports from the six member countries of the ASEAN and
the Middle East decreased by more than 11.0 percent, and crude oil imports from
Angola, Africa decreased by 40.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Officials said that exports in the first five months of this year totaled
US$93.86 billion, up 6.8 percent year-on-year, mainly because exports to Asia
increased by 7.5 percent, including increased exports to China, Japan, South
Korea and six member nations of the ASEAN by 6.7 percent, 3.1 percent, 7.1
percent and 10 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Exports to Europe also increased by 10.9 percent, although exports to the United
Stated were cut by 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Imports in the first five months totaled US$84.73 billion, up 4.1 percent over
the same period last year.</P>
      <P>One  noteworthy  phenomenon  is  that  information  and telecommunication
product exports in May were down by 15.1 percent from the same month last year,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that negative growth has become a norm since July 2006 due to outflow
of manufacturers, and that double-digit decreases have become the norm, with a
decrease as high as 22 percent in November.</P>
      <P>Electronic product exports in May showed an unusual decrease of 2.5 percent from
the same month last year, which the officials attributed to the high comparison
base of last year's performance. Last year's electronic product exports averaged
a 23.16 percent increase over the previous year.</P>

company's Taiwan office announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-San Francisco route will be served by Boeing 777s, UA officials in

Taiwan with access to more than 200 destinations in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Chicago-based carrier began to fly the Taipei-San Francisco route in 1987

      <P>UA decided to resume the Taipei-San Francisco route after the company's recent

    <TEXT>
      <P>The collection of biometric data -- finger scans and digital photographs -- will
be required for all U.K. visa applicants in Taiwan from July 26, the British
Trade and Cultural Office (BTCO) in Taipei announced in a press conference
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new visa application process is to help combat visa
fraud, the abuse of the U.K.'s immigration and asylum system and a part of anti-
terrorism measures, BTCO Director Michael Reilly said.</P>
      <P>The new process means two changes in the way BTCO deals with visa applications.
All applicants will have to lodge their applications at new visa application
centers in Taipei and Kaohsiung and applications will not be accepted at the
BTCO in Taipei after July 20, said Reilly.</P>
      <P>Second, all visa applicants, regardless of nationality, will need to apply in
person to have their fingerscans and digital photographs taken. The whole
procedure should take no more than five minutes, he said.</P>
      <P>"Biometric visa data provides a higher standard for security and will in time
make entry clearance into the U.K. simpler and easier. We have introduced the
new process in 64 countries and are confident it will work smoothly here in
Taiwan, " Reilly said.</P>
      <P>Applicants will be able to track their application status online and will have
shorter waiting times and more payment options, he said.</P>
      <P>Current valid U.K. visa holders will not be asked to provide biometric data when
they enter the U.K., Reilly added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the Philippines are among the first Asian countries to implement the
new application process, he said, adding that by the end of the year, the
process will be rolled out to other Asian countries such as Japan, China and
South Korea.</P>
      <P>All member states of the European Union are expected to implement biometric
visas in the spring of 2008, he noted.</P>
      <P>The U.K. issued about 36,000 visas to Taiwanese visitors in 2006, including
9,653 Taiwanese student visas, Reilly said. The U.K. accounts for around 30
percent of the Taiwanese overseas study market.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) presidential candidate Thursday expressed
his deep regret over the termination of Taiwan-Costa Rica diplomatic ties,
blaming both Beijing and Taiwan's ruling party for the development.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, a former KMT chairman who stepped down from the post in February
and was nominated in early May to run as the party's candidate in the 2008
presidential election, made the comments in a press release issued by his
campaign office.</P>
      <P>Calling it a major setback for Taiwan to sever its 63-year-long diplomatic
partnership with the Central American state known worldwide for its democracy
and openness, Ma ascribed the event to China's ubiquitous suppression of Taiwan
and to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) populist brand of
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Ma blamed China for hurting the feelings of the Taiwanese people by using its
growing economic  clout to block Taiwan in the international arena, and also
criticized the DPP for practicing so-called "hit-and-run" diplomacy since it
came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>China's relentless efforts to muscle Taiwan off of the world stage have
seriously shaken the foundation of mutual trust, while the populist diplomatic
strategy adopted by the DPP has caused many of the country's diplomatic allies
to lose faith in Taiwan, Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>While urging Beijing to stop bullying Taiwan and try to build better two-way
relations, Ma also urged the DPP to take the initiative and contact China in a
pragmatic and professional style so as to best serve the Taiwan people's
interests.</P>
      <P>Speaking earlier the same day at a Legislative Yuan news conference, KMT
lawmaker John Chiang, a former minister of foreign affairs, voiced grave concern
that Panama and Nicaragua might follow in Costa Rica's footsteps by breaking off
diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following the loss of Costa Rica, Taiwan maintains diplomatic links with 24
countries, most of whom are in Latin America, the South Pacific and Africa.</P>

      <P>Two of Taiwan's diplomatic allies in Central America, Guatemala and El
Salvadore, have each announced that they will maintain diplomatic relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two countries made their announcements after Costa Rica, formerly another
ally of Taiwan in Central America, switched its diplomatic allegiance from
Taipei to Beijing Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Spanish news reports by the Associated Press, Salvadoran President
Antonio Saca said at a news conference Wednesday that his nation would like to
develop relations with China, but only on the condition that China not ask his
country to cut its ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Guatemalan Presidential Office Spokeswoman Crista Kepfer told the EFE--the
leading Spanish news agency-- that Guatemala's government has no comments on
Costa Rica's diplomatic decision, but added that Guatemala will maintain
diplomatic relations with Taiwan. She also said that Guatemalan President Oscar
Berger will visit Taiwan June 17 at the invitation of the Taiwanese government.</P>
      <P>Berger's visit to Taiwan later this month aims to strengthen relations with
Taiwan and to enhance bilateral cooperation on infrastructure construction and
free trade, Kedpfer said, adding that the two countries signed a free trade
agreement last year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Kepfer said Berger has indicated repeatedly that Guatemala will not
sacrifice its ties with Taiwan to seek better trade relations with China.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) will hold a grand ceremony Oct. 24 to
celebrate reaching full daily service capacity, the company's top executive said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing said that currently trains are making 31 daily runs in
each direction on the north-south high-speed railway between Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the country's two largest cities.</P>
      <P>Full utilization of the system's capacity will raise that total to 88 commercial

      <P>The number of daily trips in each direction on the high-speed rail system is
scheduled to increase to 41 or 42 per day in July, Ing said, adding that the
number will expand further to 61 in September to meet the requirements set forth
in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract the company signed with the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications in the late 1990s. The high-speed
rail is the country's first infrastructure project built under the BOT formula.</P>

      <P>The grand ceremony is also designed to mark the 99th anniversary of the

      <P>The high-speed railway, which uses Japan's Shinkansen "Bullet Train" core

principle I have heard." "But men who live in retirement in order to study their
aims and who practice righteousness in order to carry out their principles: The
expression of such principles I have heard, but I have not seen such men."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan will not at present consider establishing any other liaison office in
Costa Rica now that the two countries have severed formal diplomatic relations,
Deputy Foreign Minister Chang Hsiao-yue said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a question and answer session at the Legislative Yuan, Chang said
Taiwan announced Thursday that it was severing formal diplomatic  relations
with Costa Rica and ceasing all cooperation projects between the two countries
immediately after the Costa Rican government's "extremely unfriendly" move of
switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Despite the diplomatic fiasco, Chang said, the day-to-day lives of Taiwan
expatriates in Costa Rica, including Taiwan students studying there, will not be
affected.</P>
      <P>Answering a question raised by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Kuo
Lin-yung on whether the Foreign Ministry will continue to strive to maintain
certain number of countries maintaining formal diplomatic relations with its
allies following Costa Rica's decision to sever ties "simply for money, " Chang
said the ministry will not engage in a "dollar diplomacy" battle with China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, in addition to continuing to work to safeguard Taiwan's
formal relations with its diplomatic allies, the Foreign Ministry will also
strive to deepen ties with the United States, Japan and other countries with
which Taiwan does not maintain formal diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang accused Costa Rica the day before of
repeatedly "cheating" Taiwan in the process of its forging diplomatic relations
with China. Huang said it is ironic that Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, who
is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, chose to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing
simply because of China's promise to offer "better financial help."</P>

      <P>Two agricultural and industrial delegations from Taiwan signed letters of intent
with their American counterparts Thursday for various procurement plans.</P>
      <P>The signing ceremony took place on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., with many
members of the U.S. Congress witnessing.</P>
      <P>The deals concern a plan by the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. to procure US$100
million worth of nuclear power plant equipment from Westinghouse Electric Corp.
and plans by Taiwan's agricultural sector to procure a combined US$3.9 billion
worth of soybeans, corn, wheat and beef from the United States.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese signatories of the agricultural deals included the Taiwan
Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association, the Taiwan Feed Industry Association
and the Taiwan Flour Mills Association. The American signatories were the U.S.
Grains Council, the U.S. Wheat Associates, the American Soybean Association and
the U.S. Meat Export Federation.</P>
      <P>Sun Ming-hsien, an ambassador-at-large for agricultural affairs who serves as
leader of the agricultural delegation, noted that Taiwan and the United States
not only maintain close agricultural relations but also share a lot of common
values.</P>
      <P>Sun expressed the hope that the strong agricultural relations between the two
countries will lead eventually to the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade
agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Bureau of Foreign Trade Director-General Huang Chih-peng, leader of the
industrial delegation, noted that all the members of his delegation are
representatives  of important Taiwan state-owned enterprises and that they are
expected to further procure products worth a total of US$11.34 billion from the
United States over the next few years.</P>
      <P>During the current U.S. visit, the state-owned CPC Corp. signed a memorandum
with Honeywell  International  in Houston  for the procurement of petrochemical
processing and control equipment worth US$1 billion, while Aerospace Industrial
Development Corp. signed various contracts in Los Angeles and New York for the
procurement of aircraft components and chemicals worth a total of US$28 million.</P>
      <P>Asked during a news conference held in the U.S. capital Thursday whether the
U.S. visit by the two procurement delegations will be helpful in paving the way
for the establishment of a Taiwan-U.S. FTA, Taiwan's representative to the
United States, Joseph Wu, said the visit has helped the United States reconfirm
Taiwan's status as an important trade partner.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that during their visits to various U.S. states, the delegations
were received by state governors, members of state legislatures and members of
Congress elected from the concerned states, which he said shows that the U.S.
side attaches great importance to the country's trade relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that establishing a Taiwan-U.S. FTA involves some difficulties and
that progress isn't expected in the foreseeable future, adding, however, that
this does not mean the goal is unattainable.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, U.S. administration officials agree that the United States is
not reluctant to start FTA talks with Taiwan but that the timing is a problem.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan should continue to work on getting the message across to
Washington that a Taiwan-U.S. FTA is not only important to Taiwan but also in
the best interests of the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS NO PLAN TO DEVELOP MEDIUM-RANGE MISSILES: ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 7 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan doesn't have any plan to develop medium-range missiles or deploy weapons
of mass destruction, the Republic of China representative to the United States
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Joseph Wu reminded the United States and the international
community that the military balance in the Taiwan Strait is tilting in favor of
China whose intensified military buildup is threatening regional peace and
stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is a menace while Taiwan is a defender, Wu said the United
States and the international community should demand that China halt its
threatening military deployment rather than impose various restrictions on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during the representative office's routine monthly news
conference.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan conducted computerized war games as part of its annual Han Kuang
military exercise in late April, then-Defense Minister Lee Jye mentioned that
"Taiwan should use medium-range missiles."</P>
      <P>However, the United States reportedly disagreed with Lee's views and dissuaded
Taiwan from launching such a development project.</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Wu was asked whether the representative office has
received any information from U.S. authorities concerning the issue. In
response, Wu said that he met with Pentagon officials recently, but neither side
brought up the medium-range missile issue. Nonetheless, Wu said he has come to
know through indirect channels that U.S. officials have indeed expressed
concerns about the reported project.</P>
      <P>Wu said that to the best of his understanding, Taiwan has no plan to develop any
medium-range missiles or deploy or stockpile weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the issue regarding Taiwan's military build-up should be
considered from two angles. First of all, he said, Taiwan needs to consult with
its strategic partners, particularly the United States, to cope with any
possible Taiwan Strait conflicts.</P>
      <P>Second, Wu said, the reasons behind Taiwan's mulling of acquiring some offensive
or strategic weapons lies in the fact that China has deployed various types of
missiles along its southeastern coastline targeting Taiwan and that many of its
new naval weapons, such as new destroyers and submarines, are also targeted at
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu said it's unfair to unilaterally restrict  Taiwan's
access to offensive  weaponry systems while assisting or turning a blind eye to
China's menacing military build-up moves.</P>
      <P>Wu further cited a recent Pentagon report on China's growing military strength
and sophistication to stress the gravity of China's military threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the annual Pentagon report, Wu said, China's success in destroying
a satellite in low-Earth orbit early this year represents a threat to the
interests of all space-faring nations. The Pentagon also said the People's
Liberation Army is building a greater capacity to launch pre-emptive strikes. It
cited as examples China's acquisition of long-endurance submarines, unmanned
combat aircraft and additional precision-guided air-to-ground missiles. By 2011,
China will have aircraft carriers, the report also said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has consistently conveyed similar information to U.S. authorities over
the past several years, Wu said, adding that hopefully, the United States and
the international community will no longer question Taiwan's strategic thinking
about its self-defense plans and instead ask China to cease moves that pose a
threat to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's setback incurred from the severance of diplomatic  relations with Costa
Rica will not affect the operations of the Democratic Pacific Union (DPU) , Vice
President Annette Lu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu, who played an instrumental role in bringing about the establishment of the
DPU two years ago, noted the number of countries in the 26-member DPU that do
not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan is greater than the number
of countries that do, adding that all countries are welcome to join the DPU so
long as they are peace-loving and recognize the value of democracy.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in light of Taiwan's latest diplomatic setback -- as a result of
Beijing's unmerciful suppression of Taiwan -- the people of the country should
close ranks and pay more attention to international affairs and have more
concern for the future of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPU -- a non-governmental organization designed to serve as a platform for
exchanges among the Pacific Rim countries in the promotion of democracy, peace
and prosperity, and other common values -- was inaugurated on Aug. 14, 2005.</P>
      <P>Lu called for the people of the country, particularly members of the media and
the government, to not spend too much time and energy on elections, saying that
elections should be left to the candidates. She said the country's people should
be more attentive to efforts aimed at making Taiwan a greater and stronger
nation.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during an interview with media members at I-Shou University
located in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recent criticism by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias about Taiwan's foreign aid
proves that Taiwan has not engaged in checkbook diplomacy, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said it is regrettable  and "ungentlemanly" of
Arias to criticize Taiwan immediately after his country severed diplomatic
relations with Taiwan to forge ties with China.</P>
      <P>Reiterating  that Taiwan has never entered  any "financial competition" with
China in the international arena, Wang said Arias' remarks indicate that Costa
Rica has switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing simply to obtain more aid
from China.</P>
      <P>According to an AFP report filed in San Jose, Arias told local station Radio
Monumental Thursday that Taiwan has provided too little aid to its diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>"I have been critical of Taiwan in the sense that if they have diplomatic
relations with fewer than 30 countries, they should be more generous," Arias was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>After maintaining formal ties with Taiwan for decades, Costa Rica secretly
signed a joint communique with China on the establishment of diplomatic
relations June 1 in Beijing. Arias officially publicized the news Wednesday and
announced his country's decision to break relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Arias' announcement, Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang
proclaimed in Taipei Thursday the government's decision to terminate formal
relations  with Costa Rica and cease all cooperation projects between the two
countries.</P>

      <P>The season for the endangered green turtle to return to lay eggs on beaches of
Penghu has arrived, and tourists should refrain from entering their protected
areas, a conservation official warned Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-lung,  a section  chief with the Penghu  County Government's
Department of Ecology and Conservation, said that every year between May and
October, green turtles come to Penghu's seashore to nest.</P>
      <P>Penghu County is the area in Asia where green turtles most regularly come each
year to nest, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The county has set aside an area of 23.328 hectares in Wanan township for the
threatened species to lay eggs undisturbed, hoping to eliminate the interference
of the tourists in the turtles' egg-laying and hatching process.</P>
      <P>Chen said that tourists are banned from entering the area between May 1 and Oct.
31, and that violators face severe penalties in accordance with the Wildlife
Conservation Law.</P>
      <P>Although there has been no indications of green turtles coming ashore to lay
eggs so far this year, Chen said that they are expected to do so shortly.</P>
      <P>He urged local residents and tourists to follow the relevant regulations and not
to intrude out of curiosity.</P>

      <P>Eleven six-grade students of Haituan Elementary School in the southeastern
county of Taitung bade farewell to their parents and school juniors Friday,
setting off for a journey of independence -- the last lesson before their
graduation.</P>
      <P>The lesson is imparted over a 140-km-long, three-day bicycle trip from the
Haituan rural township to Liyutan -- a scenic attraction in neighboring Hualien
County in eastern Taiwan -- where the five boys and six girls will be presented
with their graduation diplomas.</P>
      <P>At around 9: 00 a.m., Wang Lai-kuei, the oldest oracle of the Bunun tribe in
Haituan, officiated over a tribal ceremony, praying for blessings for the youths
while holding the right hand of each in the hope that they will have a happy
journey and return safely.</P>
      <P>Haituan Elementary School Principal Lee Chih-kuo stressed that no matter how
foul the weather, the journey must continue because it is a test for the
tenacity and willpower.</P>
      <P>It will be a chance for the students to learn independence, their last lesson
before graduation, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The students, in the company of their class teacher and the school principal,
are to ride north along the Provincial Highway No.9 for 60 km to the rural
township of Jueisuei, Hualien, on the first day of the trip. On the second day,
they will ride another 70 km to Hualien City where they will spend the night.</P>
      <P>On the final day, the brave youths will ride from downtown Hualien to Liyutan,
the terminal point of the challenging ride, to collect their diplomas before
heading home by bus.</P>
      <P>Lee said that before departing for the bike tour, designed to allow the students
to know better their hometown and neighboring lands, the boys and girls had all
to undergo tough physical training, which included jogging for a distance of 2
or 3 km everyday.</P>
      <P>One of the young cyclists, Yu Wen-lung, who stands less than 140 cm tall, rides
a borrowed bike which is also the smallest in the group. Nevertheless, Yu said
without hesitation that he is confident of riding through the challenge.</P>
      <P>Yu's classmate Lee Cho, riding on a leased bike, also expressed confidence in
his own ability to finish the journey, for which he has trained by making forth-
and-back rides between Haituan to Taitung City and Chipen, in Taitung county.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A north-bound bullet train from Zuoying, in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
which should have arrived 90 minutes after departure in Banciao, in northern
Taipei county, arrived 95 minutes late, resulting in full refunds for all those
aboard.</P>
      <P>The Zuoying-departing bullet train, No. 406, was scheduled to arrive in Banciao
at 10 a.m. Friday, enabling many passengers to attend a morning meeting in
Taipei, but instead arrived at 11: 35 a.m., more than an hour and a half behind
schedule.</P>
      <P>The delay -- the longest in the six-month history of Taiwan's high speed rail
services -- forced the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) to refund in full
all of the 800 passengers aboard Train 406.</P>
      <P>According to the THSRC authorities, train operators slowed the vehicle when they
discovered an abnormal safety reading on a detector monitoring the condition of
the bogies -- one of the most important parts of a train -- just after No. 406
passed the Tainan station. Operators then allowed the bullet train to run at a
much slower speed until it arrived in Taichung, central Taiwan, where it was
found that the abnormal reading did not indicate the presences of any safety
issues and the train was accelerated to 120 km per hour.</P>
      <P>This delay was followed by a second incident the same day, which saw passengers
taking bullet train No. 114 from Zuoying arrive in Banciao 30 minutes behind
schedule. All passengers aboard that train received a 50 percent refund.</P>
      <P>THSRC officials said that the safety alarm on train No. 114 was triggered when
the train passed Miaoli, prompting the operators to bring the train to a halt.
The operators resumed the train's journey, at a speed of 45 km per hour, after
checking all relevant conditions and finding that slopes supporting the railroad
near Miaoli had been eroded by flood, but that the eroded area -- 5 meters long,
with a depth of about 25 centimeters -- had occurred in an isolated area, was
not running, and would not cause any safety issues, THSRC officials said.</P>
      <P>Two other south-bound bullet trains, No. 407 and No 505, were also delayed due
to the slope erosion in Miaoli Friday.</P>
      <P>The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung, inaugurated in January this
year, has reduced rail travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90
minutes from the previous four-and-a-half hours.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh was
questioned by prosecutors Friday in connection with political donations he
received between September and December 2002 while serving as the mayor of
Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Lee Ying-yuan, manager of his presidential campaign, Hsieh
arrived at the office of the Supreme Prosecutors Office at 9.55 a.m. and left at
11 a.m.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from journalists waiting outside the office, Hsieh said
the funds at the center of the investigation were donated to an organization of
his supporters for the use of his election campaign.</P>
      <P>All those funds have been retained in a special bank account since being
received and have neither been spent nor transferred to his personal account,
which corroborates his claims that this funds were not given in return for any
specific favor, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>As the DPP's standard bearer in the upcoming 2008 presidential election, Hsieh
said he is willing to subject his integrity to the public scrutiny, and promised
to cooperate with the investigators.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh took issue with some media outlets which have urged the
prosecution not to drag feet on their probe of Hsieh in light of the fact that
former Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou who is set to run on the KMT's
party ticket in the 2008 presidential elections has been indicted for alleged
lining his pocket with public funds.</P>
      <P>He urged his critics to come up with convincing evidence when they file
complaints with prosecutors against him in order to spare prosecutors the
trouble of searching evidence.</P>
      <P>Hsieh reportedly sought political donations from businessmen who had been
awarded with contracts by the Kaohsiung City government while he served as the
city's mayor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile an aide to Hsieh cried foul that some media outlets have been urging
prosecutors to accelerate their probe into the case, and that the prosecutor's
office leaked its decision to question Hsieh on Friday to the media.</P>
      <P>Chao Tien-lin, a spokesman at Hsieh's campaign headquarters, said the leak is
obviously an attempt to dampen Hsieh' election campaign and that Hsieh is
mulling whether to retain a group of lawyers to defend his interests in the lead
up to the presidential elections.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese expatriates in Costa Rica urged the Republic of China government
Friday to open a representative office here following the severance of
diplomatic ties between the two countries the day before.</P>
      <P>Out of a concern that their interests might be affected because of the
termination of the 63-year-old diplomatic partnership between Taiwan and Costa
Rica, Taiwanese nationals in the Central American state asked the ROC government
to set up an economic and cultural office in San Jose to take charge of consular
and document verification affairs.</P>
      <P>"Establishing a representative office here will help Taiwanese people maintain
close links and strong affiliation  with the motherland," said one Taiwan
businessman.</P>
      <P>According to Ku Chung-hsiao, head of a Taiwanese association, the closure of the
ROC Embassy and the departure of the ambassador is of great concern to them. "We
will feel deserted by the government if it fails to open a representative office
here," he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are some 60,000 ethnic Chinese in Costa Rica, some 4,000 of
whom are immigrants from Taiwan and mainly work in the foreign trade,
restaurant, sundry and tourism-related sectors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan decided to terminate its diplomatic ties with Costa Rica Thursday, hours
after Costa Rica announced its establishment of diplomatic links with China.</P>
      <P>Following the loss of Costa Rica,  Taiwan still maintains diplomatic relations
with 24 countries.</P>

      <P>The Philippines government is rolling out a series of promotions in the hope of
attracting more Taiwanese tourists, an official from the Philippine Department
of Tourism said on the sidelines of a Philippines travel guide launch ceremony
Friday.</P>
      <P>"We will try to present various tour packages to attract different types of
Taiwanese tourists. Some of them visit the Philippines purely for sightseeing,
while some come to play golf, " said Ireneo H. Reyes, Senior Tourism Operation
Officer of the Department of Tourism.</P>
      <P>Reyes estimated that more than 100,000 Taiwanese tourists visited the
Philippines last year. The latest statistics from this year show a 7 percent
increase in the number of tourists from the same period of last year, he said,
adding that the bureau is expecting a record-breaking year in 2007.</P>
      <P>However, there should be a lot more Taiwanese tourists visiting the Philippines,
he said, adding that the low number of tourists is due to Taiwanese lack of
understanding about its closest neighbor to the south.</P>
      <P>The Manila Economic and Cultural Office collaborated with the China Times
Publishing Company to publish the Chinese-language guide titled Inside Guide:
Philippines. "We hope that the readers will gain a better understanding of
Filipinos," he said.</P>
      <P>The book contains features on Philippine history, culture, traditions, faith,
way of life and other information collected by the Discovery Channel and Inside
Guides -- two of the world's best information providers, he said.</P>
      <P>Reyes noted that some of Taiwan's media reports have brought the Philippines a
lot of negative publicity and have affected Taiwanese people's views of the
Southeast Asian country.</P>

      <P>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) launched an afternoon coffee program
Friday, the first of its kind, in the hope of bringing together people from
various fields to share their thoughts and induce innovative thinking.</P>
      <P>NCKU President Michael M.C. Lai, who floated the idea, said the program, dubbed
"Ecko," takes place at between 3: 30 p.m. and 5 p.m. every Friday.</P>
      <P>There will be a speaker each time talking about a specific subject, but they
will only speak for five minutes and the rest of the time will be left for
participants to mingle and chat over tea or coffee, the U.S.-educated scholar in
molecular biology said.</P>
      <P>Lai said that he took his cue from the tradition of afternoon tea in Britain,
saying that although  research funds for British universities are not as big as
their counterparts in Taiwan, British students are very innovative in research
work, which he attributed to what he claimed is their "afternoon tea practice."</P>
      <P>He said starting the university's coffee program is designed to "set up a
culture and a concept."</P>
      <P>Students can make use of the informal occasion to get to know each other and
gain access to areas other than their own, he added.</P>
      <P>The program has won the support of business tycoon Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the
Chi Mei Group. The first speaker Friday was a member of the Chi Mei Mandolin
Orchestra, who spoke about the mandolin. The speaker received a free coffee,
while the other attendees got a 40 percent discount on their drinks.</P>
      <P>The university welcomes anyone to speak at the "Ecko" time, saying that several
NCKU professors have already registered to speak.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun asserted Thursday
his resolve to make Taiwan a "normal country,"  describing it as the only way to
ensure the country's continued presence on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner party with DPP supporters in the San Francisco Bay area, he
said that "promoting a 'normal country' resolution is the right thing to do and
will help boost the chances of the party's candidate in the 2008 presidential
election." Yu ascribed the problems that Taiwan faces at present to its lack of
status as a "normal country."</P>
      <P>"Only by transforming Taiwan into a normal country can the nation continue to
survive, " Yu told more than 300 supporters attending the banquet.</P>
      <P>In response to suspicions that the DPP has shown signs of division after the
party's presidential primary in early May, Yu disagreed and said that time will
prove that the DPP can withstand the test of time.</P>
      <P>He urged DPP backers to return to Taiwan early next year and cast their ballots
for the party's candidates  in the presidential election, and vowed to continue
to promote the "normal country" resolution for the sake of Taiwan's survival.</P>
      <P>Yu first broached the idea that the DPP should adopt a resolution on making
Taiwan a "normal country" during his campaign prior to the DPP's May 6
presidential primary, which he lost to Hsieh in a direct vote by party members.
He has repeatedly vowed to continue promoting the resolution within the party
despite his defeat in the primary.</P>

      <P>United Airlines (UA) of the United States resumed nonstop service between San
Francisco and Taipei Thursday after a nearly four-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>UA organized a gala party in front of the Thursday noon flight's boarding  gate
to mark  the  resumption  of the  daily  San Francisco-Taipei nonstop combined
passenger and cargo service, which was suspended in the fall of 2003 following
an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan earlier that
year.</P>
      <P>The party was jointly presided over by Hank Krakowski, vice president of UA
parental company's flight operations, and Liao Wei-ping, representative of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco.</P>
      <P>Addressing those attending the event, Krakowski said that nearly 600,000 Taiwan
citizens visited the United States last year, of whom more than 190,000 visited
California.  The resumption  of San Francisco-Taipei nonstop flights will not
only benefit such visitors, but will also help bolster cultural and economic
ties between people from the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the party, Liao called on American passengers taking the
nonstop UA flights from San Francisco to Taipei for business reasons to make the
most of their time in Taiwan. "Tap into Taiwan's rich tourism resources and
Taiwan will touch your heart, " Liao said.</P>
      <P>Passengers and others attending the gala party came away with great impression
after obtaining brochures highlighting some of Taiwan's top tourist attractions
and being treated to Taiwanese snack delicacies, including pineapple cakes and
tapioca "pearl tea."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Mark Schwab, vice president of UA's Pacific operations,
the UA is delighted to resume nonstop service over the summer season when
customers demand for seats to the United States is traditionally high.</P>
      <P>The resumption of the UA nonstop Taipei-San Francisco service alsl underscores
UA's ongoing commitment to the Asia Pacific region where nearly a quarter of the
company's capacity is currently deployed, Schwab said.</P>
      <P>UA will continue to offer a daily service from Taipei to Tokyo Narita, which
will in turn offer smooth connections to Washington, D.C., Chicago, Seattle, Los

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese woman has been quarantined at a medicine center in southern Taiwan
after being diagnosed with measles that she caught during a visit to Japan May
16-20.</P>
      <P>According to a probe by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) into the case --
the first of imported measles infection in Taiwan this year, the woman fell ill
around May 24 after returning home from the trip, which had taken her to Osaka
and Kobe in western Japan.</P>
      <P>However, the patient was not diagnosed until June 4, CDC officials said Friday,
stating that the woman made eight visits to doctors from May 28-June 3, all of
whom failed to make an accurate diagnosis.</P>
      <P>So far, none of the other members of the woman's tour group, the people who live
with her or her co-workers have developed symptoms, according to the CDC probe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began mandatory inoculation against measles in 1978. The patient missed
the vaccination because she was born in 1976, CDC officials said.</P>
      <P>Japan has been affected by a massive measles outbreak since May, with hundreds
of people falling sick. Deputy CDC Director-General Lin Ting suggested that
people who are planning to travel to that nation study their personal
inoculation history, as the Japanese outbreak has been found mainly to have
affected adults.</P>
      <P>Lin also advised local doctors to report to the CDC any cases of patients who
had visited Japan over the past few weeks developing one or more of the major
measles symptoms -- fever, coughing, runny nose and conjunctivitis.</P>
      <P>The incubation period for measles ranges from 10 days to two weeks and the
disease leaves patients vulnerable to middle ear infections, pneumonia and
encephalitis.</P>

The sweeping immigration overhaul endorsed by President Bush crumbled in the
Senate on Thursday night, leaving the future of one of the administration's
chief domestic priorities in serious doubt.

After a day of tension and fruitless maneuvering, senators rejected a Democratic
call to move toward a final vote on the compromise legislation after Republicans
complained that they had not been given enough opportunity to reshape the
sprawling bill. Supporters of cutting off debate got only 45 of the 60 votes

Wall Street Journal:Western Liquor Makers Eye Rich Indian Market

Vijay Mallya calls himself the King of Good Times, and he has the credentials.
The biggest maker of both whisky and beer in India, he wears gold necklaces and
a diamond bracelet, surrounds himself with film stars, and holds liquor-soaked
parties on his 165-foot yacht, once owned by Elizabeth Taylor.

Such behavior didn't square with the anti- alcohol ethic in India when Mr.
Mallya inherited a family liquor business 24 years ago. Some states required a

      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, visiting chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party

      <P>Yu made the comments in San Francisco -- the first leg of a swing through  the
United States to solicit support  from Taiwanese expatriates for the DPP in the
presidential race.</P>
      <P>Yu said he strongly believes in Frank Hsieh's innocence and called for unity to

2006 and won the party's May 6 presidential primary.</P>

mayor of Kaohsiung from 1998-2005.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was questioned by prosecutors of a special investigation unit under the
Supreme Prosecutors Office for the first time over monetary donations remitted
to his special election bank account during the September-December period of
2002.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a one-hour probe, Hsieh maintained his innocence and said that he

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that a Chinese official's remarks
that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy has come from the authorization of the
central government indicates a "regression of Hong Kong democracy."</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Teh-shun was referring to remarks by Wu Bangguo, chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in a seminar on Hong
Kong Basic Law in Beijing Wednesday during which he said that "the high degree
of Hong Kong autonomy comes from the authorization of the central government"
and is not "inherent."</P>
      <P>How much power the special administrative region of Hong Kong gets is solely
dependent on how much power the central government allows it, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since the return of the former British colony to Chinese rule in
1997, the authoritarian nature of the Chinese regime and what he described as
the democratic system in Hong Kong have run contradictory courses.</P>
      <P>Even though China proposed that "Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and have a high
degree of autonomy, " the contradiction of "one country, two systems" is all too
apparent, and the conflicts have deepened, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>He noted that it has been a decade since Hong Kong reverted to China, but said

      <P>The world's largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380, landed at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport Friday where it will be on display for three days
as part of an Airbus company world tour.</P>
      <P>The press and local airline companies will be invited to take a tour of the
double-decker superjumbo, which is scheduled to leave Taiwan June 10 and return
to Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse, France.</P>
      <P>The jet can carry 525 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 853
passengers in a single-class economy configuration.</P>
      <P>However, local airliners might not be interested in placing orders for the A380
because of market concerns, airline sources said.</P>
      <P>The only possible route for the A380 in Taiwan would be Taipei-Hong Kong, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the superjumbo's huge passenger capacity would decrease the number of
flights between the two places, which would be inconvenient for travelers, the
sources continued.</P>
      <P>In addition, there might be changes in the Taipei-Hong Kong route in the future,
according to the sources, so that local carriers still need to assess the future
of the market.</P>
      <P>Airbus has received 160 confirmed orders for the A380 from 14 carriers in
Singapore, Thailand, China, France, Malaysia and various other countries.</P>
      <P>The French company will deliver the first superjumbo to Singapore Airlines in
October, two years behind schedule.</P>
      <P>The delivery problem has caused quite a few carriers to switch to Airbus'
American rival, Boeing, for their orders.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has urged local tea farmers and tea companies not to
be short-sighted by taking quality Taiwanese tea seedlings and know-how to other
countries, an act that he said will be detrimental to the long-term development
of Taiwan's tea industry.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal Thursday at a ceremony to award Taiwan's top 10 best tea
brands of this year.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Council of Agriculture (COA) has been pushing for
certification of origin labels for Taiwanese tea products to stem
counterfeiting, an effort that he said deserves recognition.</P>
      <P>In his capacity as chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Chang said

      <P>An overwhelming majority of Chinese tourists have been satisfied with their
visits to Taiwan, according to the results of an opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Tourism Bureau as part of its efforts to upgrade
travel service quality for Chinese tour groups and ensure their travel safety.</P>
      <P>Copies of the questionnaire were distributed from last November to arriving
Chinese tourists at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Kaohsiung
International Airport along with a tourism publicity leaflet. As of May 18, 960
valid samples had been collected from departing Chinese tourists at the two
airports -- Taiwan's two main gateways.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 95.5 percent of the respondents said they were
satisfied with overall services offered by their travel agencies.</P>
      <P>Local tour guides' professional attitudes and good customer service skills
received the highest approval rating of 98.1 percent, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the survey found that 98 percent of the respondents were pleased with
tour guides' on-the-spot explanation skills.</P>
      <P>Up to 95.1 percent gave a thumbs-up to traffic services and arrangements, while
lodging services also received a 91.5 percent approval rating and 89.8 percent
said they were generally satisfied with the content of local tour packages.</P>
      <P>In comparison, food and beverage services received the lowest rating, but the
percentage of those who gave a positive assessment still accounted for 85.6
percent of the total.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that travel costs for a seven-day, six-night tour package
for Chinese tour groups ranges between NT$34,482 (US$1,046) and NT$43,096 per
head.</P>
      <P>The number of shopping stops arranged by travel agencies for Chinese tourists
mostly ranged between five and six throughout their stays, according to the
survey results.</P>
      <P>Nearly 40 percent of the respondents  said they felt the merchandise prices were
generally higher at outlets arranged by travel agencies, while 35 percent said
the prices at those outlets were fair.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 72.2 percent said local tour guides usually took them to stores
bearing a "secure shopping guarantee" mark, while less than 2 percent said their
tour guides took them to stores bearing no such certificate.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau began to implement a new travel cost, service quality and
shopping guarantee system last November after a tour bus crash Oct. 2 that year
claimed six lives, including five Chinese tourists from Dalian City. Under the
new regulatory system, the minimum travel cost for Chinese tour groups is set at
US$80 per person per day to ensure good customer service, travel quality and
safety.</P>
      <P>In a separate survey of 508 randomly chosen Chinese tourists, conducted by the
Tourism Bureau last year to explore their shopping and travel preferences, most
respondents also gave good reviews of their Taiwan travel experiences. The only
unpleasant thing they cited was what they described as the slowness of Taiwan's
visa processing.</P>

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that a Chinese official's remarks
that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy has come from the authorization of the
central government indicates a "regression of Hong Kong democracy."</P>
      <P>MAC spokesman Liu Teh-hsun was referring to remarks by Wu Bangguo, chairman of
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in a seminar on Hong
Kong Basic Law in Beijing Wednesday during which he said that "the high degree
of Hong Kong autonomy comes from the authorization of the central government"
and is not "inherent."</P>
      <P>How much power the special administrative region of Hong Kong gets is solely
dependent on how much power the central government allows it, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since the return of the former British colony to Chinese rule in
1997, the authoritarian nature of the Chinese regime and what he described as
the democratic system in Hong Kong have run contradictory courses.</P>
      <P>Even though China proposed that "Hong Kong people rule Hong Kong and have a high
degree of autonomy, " the contradiction of "one country, two systems" is all too
apparent, and the conflicts have deepened, according to Liu.</P>
      <P>He noted that it has been a decade since Hong Kong reverted to China, but said
that "the 10 years have passed in vain in terms of democracy, " adding that what
democracy Hong Kong might have had has regressed.</P>
      <P>He said the international community, including Taiwan, is willing to offer Hong
Kong assistance, but added that the voice of the Hong Kong people for freedom
has become weaker.</P>
      <P>"We worry that Hong Kong residents have become accustomed to the situation after
10 years," he said.</P>

      <P>As the Taiwan population ages,  the increasing number of elderly is expected to
bring lucrative business opportunities, the nation's top economic policy charter
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said that as of March
this year, there were 1.25 million people aged between 55 and 59 and 1.65
million aged between 50 and 54. It is estimated  that 2.9 million will reach the
age of compulsory retirement at 65 within a decade.</P>
      <P>The growing number of elderly is expected to bring about lucrative business
opportunities, as retired people are usually financially secure and can afford
to spend money, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>They said the elderly attach great importance to safe and comfortable living
environments, adequate medical care and travel, and that they have become the
emerging spending group in the market.</P>
      <P>The officials added that the government's "mega investment, mega warmth" project
has heeded the demands of an aging population and will promote related
industries.</P>
      <P>Medical care has been listed as an emerging industry under the project,  and
related sectors will include medical  equipment, pharmaceuticals and health food
for the elderly, they went on.</P>
      <P>In a 10-year care program under the project, it is estimated that by 2015, the
number of professional and para-professional caregivers, social workers, nurses
and therapists will have reached 83,000, they added.</P>

      <P>Taipei Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, heading a 23-member group, launched a search
Saturday in a mountainous area of Linkou rural township in northern Taiwan for
an unidentified animal that has been killing domestic goats there.</P>
      <P>County police received a report the previous day from a goat farmer in Linkou
saying that eight of his 100 goats had been mauled to death by "some kind of
large feline" earlier that day, while two others had neck injuries.</P>
      <P>A foreign worker who witnessed the incident claimed that she saw an animal "like
a tiger, " but could not be 100 percent sure it was actually a tiger, police
said.</P>
      <P>The killing raised concerns over public safety, prompting Chou to mobilize
county officials, police and veterinarians to take part in the search of the
area.</P>
      <P>County officials said they hoped to catch the animal alive and that they were
equipped with a cage, tranquillizer guns, blowpipes and flashlights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN `TOO COWARDLY' ON YASUKUNI SHRINE CONTROVERSY: EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  9 (CNA)
06/09/07  16:56:49
(By Mike Chang, Yang Ming-chu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui accused Japan Saturday of
behaving in a "too cowardly" manner in dealing with the controversy surrounding
the Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>Lee addressed the issue during a news conference held at the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) to mark the conclusion of his 11-day visit
to this country. The event attracted more than 200 journalists.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that the controversy is a product created by China and South Korea
owing to their inability to deal with their own domestic problems.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, it is a matter of course for politicians to pay their respects
"to soldiers who die fighting for their country" and it is unreasonable that
Japan should be subject to criticism by foreign governments for visits to the
shrine by the country's leaders for such purposes.</P>
      <P>Pointing to his own experience, Lee noted that during his 12 years as president,
he visited the Martyr's Shrine in Taipei twice a year to pay his respects to the
heroes who died in a revolutionary movement against the Ching Dynasty in 1911 in
China, even though the movement had nothing to do with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine is dedicated to the 2.5 million soldiers who died fighting
for Japan during World War II, including more than 28,000 from Taiwan, which was
under Japan's colonial rule at that time.</P>
      <P>The reason for the controversy is that the shrine also honors executed Japanese
war criminals who committed inhuman atrocities in China, Korea and many other
countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee visited the shrine Thursday to pay his respects to his older brother, who
died fighting in the Japanese Imperial Army, and said the move had nothing to do
with political or historical issues.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's relations with China, Lee said Taiwan is already an independent
country and that it is unnecessary for Taiwan to "declare independence again."</P>
      <P>While Beijing claims Taiwan is part of China and the United States "probably
thinks so too, " the people of Taiwan are the true owners of Taiwan's
sovereignty, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said it is uncertain when and how the cross-Taiwan Strait issue can be
resolved, but added that it is very important for the people of Taiwan to stick
strongly to "their belief that Taiwan is independent."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan must continue its democratic development and urged China to
democratize its political system to grant its people a higher level of freedom.</P>
      <P>It was Lee's third trip to Japan since his presidency ended in May 2000.
However, the trip marked his first visit to Tokyo in 22 years and the first time
he has made a public speech in the country.</P>
      <P>Also during the visit, he was awarded the first Shimpei Goto Prize by the
Japanese publisher Fujiwara Shoten in recognition of his contribution to
Taiwan's urbanization and democratization.</P>
      <P>Lee told the FCCJ that the visit has been the most satisfactory among all the
foreign tours he has made.</P>
      <P>He said he felt very honored to be presented the Shimpei Goto Prize, adding that
Goto's contribution to Taiwan's modernization has connected himself spiritually
with the late Japanese colonial administrator.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed the hope that he will be able to visit Japan again next year or
some other time to finish a half-accomplished tour that retraced a journey made
by haiku poet Matsuo Basho in 1689 based on which his famous work "Oku no
Hosomichi" was written.</P>
      <P>Lee said the unique Japanese culture is something to be treasured and that he
will continue to study Japanese culture based on what he learned during his
trip.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Saturday the country's plan to apply for

to China's obstruction, Taiwan applied for full WHO membership for the first

    <TEXT>
      <P>College graduates are finding it more difficult to land jobs than they had
imagined and are ending up pursuing further education or preparing for civil
service exams rather than entering the job market, a job information magazine
reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Sheng-yuan, editor-in-chief of Career magazine, said that according to the
survey conducted by the magazine, 80 percent of the college graduates questioned
said that they had difficulty landing jobs and that they put off the pressure by
pursuing advanced studies at home or abroad or preparing for civil service or
other professional examinations.</P>
      <P>If this group of graduates is counted, the actual jobless rate among college
graduates could be higher than the published figures, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that many college graduates "look like they have jobs," but do not
have full-time jobs. They often receive a monthly salary of less than NT$12,000
(US$364) because they cannot find full-time jobs, or they have to scrape by
working at home on short term projects, auctioning items on the Internet or
doing odd-jobs.</P>
      <P>"Their income is not even on par with the minimum wage level of NT$15,840
(US$480) for foreign laborers," Chang said, adding that "the worsening of the
job quality" among college grads is not fully reflected in the jobless rate.</P>
      <P>The pace for "non-traditional hiring" has quickened and the number of full-time
jobs is falling, Chang predicted on the employment trend for 2007 college
graduates.</P>
      <P>Chang said government statistics show that the number of hourly wage earners
increased drastically to 180,000 in 2006 from 70,000 and that they received on
average only NT$14,700 per month.</P>
      <P>The number of dispatch or hourly paid jobs has increased drastically as
employers try to save costs, Chang went on.</P>
      <P>On the personnel recruited by companies, Chang said companies are in need of
high-end elite and low-end laborers, and have no need for mid-level talent.</P>
      <P>Preparatory programs to nurture future executives has extended from foreign
companies to all trades, Chang said, adding that boss are hoping to establish
high-quality successor teams through the rigorous screening and training
programs.</P>
      <P>He said these "para" executives often get promotion 10 or 20 years ahead of
regular staff, and the time for "younger executives leading older staff" has
come.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that Taiwan youths in their 20s are part of an egotistic "me"
generation who tend to think only of themselves and change jobs frequently.</P>
      <P>They tend to have every excuse when they make mistakes and ask more from others
than they are prepared to give themselves. They have no respect for their
superiors and have low EQ. They are immature and have trouble getting along with
others.</P>
      <P>To cope with them, more and more companies have begun to employ aptitude tests,
believing that "personality attributes" are as important as "professional
ability," he said.</P>

      <P>The nation's top economic planner said Saturday that she will call on Minister
of Foreign Affairs James Hung to exchange views on a government project aimed at
encouraging investment in Central and South America.</P>
      <P>Ho Mei-yueh, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) , was referring to the "co-prosperity" project in the wake of Taiwan's
announcement that it had severed diplomatic ties with Costa Rica Thursday after
the Central American nation switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Ho said the CEPD, which is in charge of the project, has examined related
investments following the severance of ties.</P>
      <P>She said the CEPD will have to review whether Costa Rica's role in the project
is diminished or whether to increase investment in other countries in Central
and South America.</P>
      <P>"The CEPD has no preset stance and will conduct  further discussions with the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, " she said, adding that the council will work in
tune with the country's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>The project was unveiled by President Chen Shui-bian in 2005 at the fifth ROC-
Central America summit meeting in Managua, Nicaragua. Under the project, Taiwan
earmarks US$250 million for investment in the region, with the money coming from
the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) and the Executive
Yuan's Development Fund.</P>
      <P>The project is aimed at helping Taiwan businessmen invest in sectors with
potential in Central and South America, with the ceiling for government
investment in each investment case set at 49 percent.</P>
      <P>But officials said promotion of the project has not been smooth, noting that so
far, only Nien Hsing Textile has been approved to invest in Nicaragua in late
2006,  with the Development Fund earmarking NT$900 million and the ICDF
earmarking NT$450 million.</P>
      <P>The officials said they were elated that the first investment under the project
would take place, but Nien Hsing later backed out, citing concern over market
development in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>"As of now, the co-prosperity project has not invested any of its funds," they
admitted.</P>

      <P>Two south-bound high speed trains departed from Taipei arrived at their
destinations more than 30 minutes late Saturday, and nearly 1,000 passengers
received a 50 percent refund for the delay, the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) reported.</P>
      <P>THSRC officials said that days of torrential rain have triggered warning signals
when trains passed Kueishan Station in Taoyuan County, warning drivers to slow
down when passing that station, as well as the Miaoli section, where slopes
supporting the railway near the station had been eroded by flooding. A day
earlier, 4,500 passengers received a 50 percent or full refunds due to the
delays.</P>
      <P>The officials said the Saturday train departed from Taipei at 7 a.m. and arrived
at Taichung 47 minutes behind schedule. It arrived at Zuoying 44 minutes behind
schedule.</P>
      <P>Another train departed from Taipei at 7: 30 a.m. and arrived at Taichung station
31 minutes late, but made up the delay by accelerating through the following
south-bound stations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the north-bound trains arrived at Banciao and Taipei between two and
five minutes behind schedule, they added.</P>
      <P>The 345-km railway linking Taipei and Kaohsiung, inaugurated in January, has
reduced rail travel time between Taiwan's two largest cities to 90 minutes from

      <P>China is trying to pressure Taiwan's South Pacific allies into severing ties
with Taipei through Australia and New Zealand, Vice President Annette Lu claimed
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a symposium on Taiwan's ties with South Pacific
states, Lu said China is trying to win Canberra and Wellington's co-operation in
its diplomatic plotting against Taiwan by promising to support them to improve
regional stability.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lu said, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao promised to offer US$400
million aid over three years to states in the South Pacific during a trip to the
region last year in an attempt to attract states into China's fold.</P>
      <P>The vice president also accused Beijing of luring Costa Rica to switch

      <P>The Taiwan-born co-founder of the popular video sharing Web site YouTube said in
a "Web 2.0" summit in Taipei Saturday that the "user first" philosophy has
always been his and his company's priority.</P>
      <P>Steve Chen said the philosophy could very well be the reason for the success of
YouTube. The summit invited heavyweights in the information and communication
technology (ICT) industry to discuss various topics such as Web 2.0,  Web 3.0,
Web services and software/hardware in the Web 2.0 phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Chen, who was visiting Taiwan for the first time in two years, questioned the
terms of Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, however, saying that while it is difficult to
define Web 1.0 and Web 2.0, personalization is the real Web trend.</P>
      <P>This, he went on, is why YouTube has always maintained a user-first mentality
and why he and his other co-founder Chad Hurley decided to sell the company to
Google last year -- because Google also shares the same value and is capable of
providing YouTube with solid technical support.</P>
      <P>Chen and Hurley sold the company to Google for US$1.65 billion in October 2006.</P>
      <P>However, the 29-year-old did not lose his motivation after becoming a
billionaire overnight. Chen said his motivation came from always believing in
the product and always trying to improve it.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that by the end of 2008, a lot more videos will be viewed on
mobile devices and said YouTube has been working toward this direction as well.</P>
      <P>Chen, who currently holds the position of Chief Technology Officer for YouTube,
was born in Taiwan and emigrated to the U.S. with his family aged 15. He left
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign without graduating to work for
online e-commerce Web site PayPal, where he met Hurley and Jawed Karim. The
three founded YouTube in 2005.</P>
      <P>In 2006, he was named by Business 2.0 magazine as one of the "the 50 people who
matter now" in business. Earlier this year, he was named by Time magazine as one
of the world's most influential people.</P>
      <P>The summit participants also included Chunghwa Telecom Chairman Ho Chen Tan,
Intel's Director of Marketing and Technical Services in Taiwan Stanley Huang,
Google Taiwan's Head of Sales and Business Development Rebecca Kuei and
Institute for Information Industry Executive Director Chen Ming-syan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lambasted Beijing's constant suppression of Taiwan
Saturday by means of its military threat and diplomatic schemes and reiterated
that Taiwan will not "act as a rich fathead, " while China buys Costa Rica's
diplomatic recognition for US$430 million.</P>
      <P>Chen said in Tainan City, southern Taiwan that Beijing has never given up the
idea of annexing Taiwan by force and noted that China deployed 200 missiles
targeting Taiwan in 2000, increasing the number to 988 by 2007.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, Chen went on, China has not ceased its efforts to carry
out its "clearing out" policy aimed at shutting Taiwan out of the international
community by buying off Taiwan's diplomatic allies and destroying all Taiwan's
bargaining chips for reciprocal negotiations.</P>
      <P>Over the past 11 years, Taiwan has not stopped making efforts to join the World
Health Organization (WHO), but is still rejected from WHO activities, even as an
observer, due to China's opposition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he added, during the SARS outbreak of 2003, Chinese officials even
asked publicly "who cares about you? " in response to Taiwan's request for
international  assistance in stemming the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Speaking  of Costa Rica's recent  switching  of diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing, the president said China has spent a lot to "buy" diplomatic
relations, but claimed that Taiwan would never want to buy friendship even it
had the money to do so.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Chairman of Joint Chiefs Will Not Be Reappointed

The Bush administration said Friday that it would not reappoint Gen. Peter Pace
to a second term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making him the
highest-ranking officer to be a political casualty of the fight over Iraq.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the decision was reached in order to
avoid bitter hearings in a Democratic-controlled Senate that is already
confronting the White House over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Wall Street Journal:Economists See Housing Slump Enduring Longer

Economists are giving up on the idea that the U.S. housing slump will be quick
and relatively painless.

Instead, more are concluding, the downturn that began nearly two years ago will
last at least through the end of 2007, remaining a major drag on the U.S.
economy. The culprits: a glut of homes for sale and growing caution among
lenders who now regret being so free with their mortgages during the boom.</TEXT>

Saturday.</P>

the spiritual leader.</P>
      <P>At the airport, Lee defended his decision to accept the Shinpei Goto Prize in

    <HEADLINE>HAKKA DIALECT BECOMES INCREASINGLY POPULAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 10 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Learning to speak the Hakka dialect and gaining  a better understanding  of
Hakka culture have become increasingly popular in Taiwan in recent years,
Taiwan's top official in charge of Hakka affairs said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-teh, chairman of the Council for Hakka Affairs, said both ruling
Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Frank Hsieh and opposition
Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou passed a Hakka language
proficiency test, beginner's level, during the past two years, demonstrating
that not just non-Hakka natives, but politicians have also become increasingly
enthusiastic about learning the Hakka dialect, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee made his remarks at the National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences,
southern Taiwan,  where he oversaw the 2007 nationwide Hakka language
proficiency test. The one-day test was being  held simultaneously  in all major
cities  and counties island-wide Sunday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the annual language test, Lee said he feels overwhelming that the
number of people attending this year's test increased by some 2,600 people over
last year's 5,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the number of test-sitters under 40 years of age increased
by 51 percent over last year's level, indicating that the council's  efforts to
promote Hakka language and culture, particularly among the younger generations,
have begun to bear fruit.</P>
      <P>Most of the 2007 Hakka language proficiency test takers were civil servants,
teachers and students. In addition to Hakka native speakers and Hakka offspring,
many non-Hakka people, and even a few foreign nationals, took part in Sunday's
test.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, only 11.6 percent of Hakka children under the age of 13 could
speak their mother tongue in 2002, but in 2004 the percentage rose to 13.8
percent, thanks to the establishment of the Council of Hakka Affairs and the
launch of a TV channel that uses Hakka exclusively.</P>
      <P>The council has been trying to prevent the Hakka culture and dialect from
further waning while also helping enrich the country's cultural diversity, Lee
added.</P>
      <P>He quoted the results of a demographic census as indicating that the number of
people identifying themselves as Hakka natives stood at around 3.8 million in
Taiwan in 2004, but that this number increased noticeably to 4.41 million in
2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROUP PUSHES FOR 'PEACEFUL INDEPENDENCE','DEMOCRATIC UNIFICATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
06/10/07  17:28:47
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of political activists advocated "peaceful independence"  and
"democratic unification" Sunday as "concrete" means to secure peace across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan Chief Executive Chien Hsi-chieh said the people
of Taiwan should seek to free themselves from the shackles of the political
domination of the "pan-green" camp, led by the ruling Democratic  Progressive
Party,  and the opposition "pan-blue" alliance, led by the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Noting that civic society should not be consumed by "binary confrontation, "
Chien said the "pan-greens" and the "pan-blues" have for long monopolized the
discourse on issues of unification and independence, and continue to widen the
gulf between the camps through their discourse.</P>
      <P>Chien said that in order to gain the upper hand in their political struggles,
the "pan-green" and the "pan-blue" politicians have ceaselessly manipulated
issues concerning ethnic and communal group differences.</P>
      <P>He said hopes of cross-strait peace lie not in the balance of military might,
nor in the calculation of diplomatic victory or defeat, but in the two sides'
ability to communicate and secure societal cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chien said that although Taiwan has a preliminary self-defense capability, the
country should strengthen its non-military national defense, or civilian-based
defense, and educate the Taiwan citizens to resist invaders by means of non-
cooperation and civil disobedience rather than armed struggle. Doing so, he
said, would allow the peaceful people of Taiwan to more easily gain the support
of the international community.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks at a news conference held in advance of a forum on
"Democratic and Peaceful Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations" that the foundation will
sponsor later this month.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the news conference, Hsu Si-chien, an assistant researcher with
Academia Sinica's Institute of Politics, said that political provocation
intended to elicit a harsh response from the other camp is a"cheap aphrodisiac"
politicians use to drum up support.</P>
      <P>If the pursuit of unification would cause cross-strait or regional conflict, Hsu
said, such kind of "unification" would be undesirable; likewise, if pursuit of
independence would compromise or harm democratic principles, such kind of
"independence" would also be undesirable.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsu said, the timing to advocate pursuit of democratic
unification and peaceful independence would mature when the strife between "pan-
greens" and "pan-blues" get ever more intense.</P>
      <P>Fan Yun, an assistant professor in sociology with National Taiwan University,
said that peace and democracy could form the greatest possible common ground for
both Taiwan's major political camps, adding that advocacy of "peaceful
independence" and "democratic unification" should form the basis of new
guidelines for the administration, worked out from the perspective of the
people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADVOCACY GROUP PROTESTS HIGH COLLEGE TUITION FEES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An advocacy group staged a protest at the Ministry of Education (MOE)  Sunday
against the high cost of university education, calling for no tuition hikes in
the coming academic year.</P>
      <P>Nearly 30 students belonging to the Coalition Against High Tuition in Taiwan
protested in front of the MOE headquarters to condemn the increasing
commercialization of education, arguing that "education is by no means a
commodity" and "tuition fees should not be adjusted in accordance with consumer
price index."</P>
      <P>The demonstrators condemned a number of colleges and universities in the country
for taking special funding from the Education Ministry on one hand while
orchestrating fee hikes on the other.</P>
      <P>They were referring to 23 universities which have received funding under a five-
year, NT$50 billion-dollar higher education subsidy program and a teaching
excellence subsidy program.</P>
      <P>They chanted slogans and waved posters and banners calling for the government to
address the problem of the rising cost of education by levying a tax on
corporate dividends and establishing a special educational fund to help the
underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Responding to the demonstrators' appeal, MOE officials said that the consumer
price index, which has seen an average yearly growth of 3 percent, certainly
should not be the only figure on which tuition fee hikes are based, and that all
school fee hike plans are subject to the ministry's final approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials said that interest rates for student loans will be further
lowered this upcoming academic year, falling 0.35 percent, and those students
applying for loans under NT$500,000 to finish their college educations may also
ask for an extension of the loan period.</P>
      <P>On the demonstrators' suggestion that the government tax private corporations on
their dividends, MOE officials said this involves the design and operations of
the nation's taxation system and it is not an issue under the control of the
Ministry of Education.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO WAIT AND SEE ON DPP PROPOSAL FOR EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a news report that the "pan-green camp" may propose an extra session
after the current legislative session adjourns Friday, the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday that the party will take a wait-and-see attitude
for the time being.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun, a KMT lawmaker and legislative caucus whip, made the comments while
answering reporters' questions on the issue.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the KMT has not even yet started discussing the issue given
that the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , should first submit a proposal and
gain sufficient support to make a motion if they really hope to hold an extra
meeting in late July to address the 2007 central government budget bill.</P>
      <P>Before that happens, lawmakers of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP)  will temporarily hold off addressing the
issue, Kuo said, adding that most of the KMT and PFP lawmakers are opposed to
holding an extra session next month.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the DPP and the TSU lawmakers must not pass the buck for the
delayed passage of the annual budget, she said that the "pan-green" lawmakers'
boycott of the passage of the draft Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic
Law was the major reason behind gridlock in the legislature and the dealy in the
passage of the budget bill.</P>
      <P>Kuo also said she suspected that the DPP's plan to call for an extra legislative
meetings was politically  motivated  as the legislative and presidential
elections are approaching.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Tsahn-deng, the TSU's legislative caucus whip, said that his
party is supportive of the DPP's idea of holding an extra session in July to
deal with the annual budget bill.</P>
      <P>Tseng also urged the KMT and the PFP to respond positively to the idea so as to
allow the legislature to quickly deal with the annual budget bill, that has been
stonewalled for more than seven months.</P>
      <P>"Pan-green" and "pan-blue" lawmakers have repeatedly clashed over the 2007
central government budget bill and the draft CEC Organic Law during every
legislative sessions in recent months.</P>
      <P>The "pan-green camp" accused the "pan-blue alliance" of ignoring the people's
livelihoods by deliberately putting off the budget bill's passage in order to
push the "pan-greens" to compromise over the passage of the KMT-PFP version of
the CEC Organic Law.</P>
      <P>On the other side,  "pan-blue" lawmakers criticized  their "pan-green" peers for
insisting on the approval of the DPP-version of the CEC Organic Law, which they
characterized as an attempt to influence the coming legislative and presidential
polls.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has seen its total fertility rate (TFR) drop by over 60 percent over the
last 30 years, as its TFR dwindled from 3.4 children in 1975 to 1.4 in 2005,
according to the Cabinet-level  Directorate  General of Budget,  Accounting  and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 60.2 percent fall in TFR -- the average number of babies born to women
during their reproductive years from 15-49 -- was greater than the world's
average 40.7 percent decline during the same 1975-2005 period, from 4.5 to 2.7
children, the DGBAS reported.</P>
      <P>In Asia, South Korea registered the largest decrease in TFR, at 71 percent,
followed by Hong Kong at 67.5 percent and China at 65 percent, the DGBAS said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CONCERNED OVER LACK OF CHINA LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
06/10/07  18:53:44
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), Sunday voiced his concern over the lack of direct shipping links between
Taiwan and China, saying that the development of Taiwan's two key ports will be
hobbled if the links are not quickly put in place.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments during a visit to Taipei Port in Taipei County, accompanied
by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei and KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng.</P>
      <P>Expressing his deep concern that the development of the Taipei and Kaohsiung
ports will be affected markedly should Taiwan fail to open direct maritime
links, in particular cargo services, with China, Ma said he is worried that as
much as US$100 billion in cross-Taiwan Strait trade will be targeted by other
competitors.</P>
      <P>According  to Ma,  Kaohsiung Port has been lagging behind Singapore, Hong Kong,
Shanghai, Shenzhen and Busan in recent years, in terms of the cargo handling
volumes. Kaohsiung Port, once ranking among  the world's  top five container
ports,  has seen its competitiveness  rapidly  decline  due to the lack  of
direct cross-strait transport links, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma promised to break the present cross-Taiwan Strait gridlock and develop Taipei
Port in accordance with the blueprint drawn up by the KMT when it was in power
before May 2000 and make both Taipei and Kaohsiung ports world-class maritime
hubs if he is elected president.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's inquiries, Taipei County officials in charge of managing
Taipei Port acknowledged that cargo volumes handled by the port have noticeably
dwindled since China's Fujian Province banned gravel exports to Taiwan. Gravel
was one of the prime cross-strait transshipment items handled by the Taipei
facility.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHUNGHWA TELECOM SET TO TAP OVERSEAS MARKET: CEO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Co. (CTC) will actively tap overseas markets, with serving
overseas Taiwanese business people as its main target, the chief executive
officer of the partially government-controlled company said Sunday.</P>
      <P>CTC Chairman Hochen Tan made the remarks while briefing the media on the
findings of his recent overseas market inspection tour that took him to the
United States and Sweden.</P>
      <P>During his visit in Sweden, Hochen attended a Taiwan-Swedish economic
cooperation conference and toured TeliaSonera AB -- the dominant telephone
company and mobile network operator in Sweden and Finland and is also active in
other countries in Northern and Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>Hochen said he was impressed by TeliaSonera's productivity and competitiveness.
The company's work force only outnumbers Chunghwa's by 10 percent, but its
annual turnover reaches US$12 billion, an amount that doubles Chunghwa's annual
sales, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that TeliaSonera's  revenues primarily come from its overseas operations,
Hochen said Taiwan's telecommunications service providers should step up
exploration of overseas markets.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's largest telephone and mobile network operator, Chunghwa Telecom will
take the lead in tapping overseas markets, Hochen said, adding that the company
will first focus on exploring markets that have a large concentration of
Taiwanese business people.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that telecommunication service subscribers on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait have similar consumer culture and habits, Hochen said Chunghwa
Telecom intends to cooperate with smaller-sized Chinese  telecommunications
operators  or added value  service providers to tap the flourishing Chinese
market.</P>
      <P>As the government still imposes many restrictions on investing in China, Hochen
said, Chunghwa Telecom will consult with the Mainland Affairs Council --
Taiwan's top China policy planning agency -- and other relevant government
institutions before launching its overseas expansion drive.</P>
      <P>Anyway,  Hochen said,  Chunghwa  Telecom will follow legal procedures in tapping
the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>And Vietnam will be Chunghwa Telecom's another priority target, Hochen said,
adding that Vietnam has enjoyed robust economic growth in recent years and that
many Taiwan companies have set up footholds there.</P>
      <P>As Vietnam's telecommunication infrastructure and management are relatively
backward, Hochen said Chunghwa Telecom stands a good chance of tapping into that
market and that the company will focus on investing in telecommunication
infrastructure  construction  in Vietnam's large industrial zones.</P>

Nearly a decade after the government began its landmark effort to break up
Microsoft, the Bush administration has sharply changed course by repeatedly
defending the company both in the United States and abroad against accusations
of anticompetitive conduct, including the recent rejection of a complaint by
Google.

The retrenchment reflects a substantially different view of antitrust policy, as
well as a recognition of major changes in the marketplace. The battlefront among
technology companies has shifted from computer desktop software, a category that
Microsoft dominates, to Internet search and Web-based software programs that
allow users to bypass products made by Microsoft, the world's largest software

      <P>Construction of Taipei Harbor, formerly known as Tamsui Harbor,  has not been
delayed,  Ministry  of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) officials said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou slammed the Democratic Progressive  Party
(DPP)  administration  for what  he called snail's-paced construction of Taipei
Harbor, which began in 1993 when the KMT was still in power.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the DPP has failed to complete construction of certain
expressways  linking Taipei Harbor to major cities or neighboring districts. The
expressway construction delay has prompted private investors in a container
storage center at the harbor under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract to
ask for NT$4.3 billion in compensation.</P>
      <P>Ma said three shipping companies -- Evergreen, Yang Ming and Wanhai -- have
signed the BOT contract with the MOTC for the container warehousing project
under which seven wharves will be built at the Taipei Harbor.</P>
      <P>In terms of the contract, Ma said, the government has to build Pali-Wuku
expressway to facilitate Taipei Harbor's traffic services. However, the highway
project has lagged far behind the schedule.</P>
      <P>In response, Hsiao Ting-hsun, director of the Keelung Harbor Bureau, said the
MOTC has not delayed in building the expressway. The budget for the project was
not passed until August 2004. Construction began in September that year and is
scheduled to be completed late next year.</P>
      <P>He also denied that the three shipping companies have asked for a NT$4.3 billion
compensation. Acutally, he said, the three firms asked for NT$347 million in

    <HEADLINE>HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION IN COSTA RICA WILL CONTINUE: TAIWAN BUILDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Jose, Costa Rica, June 10 (CNA)
06/11/07  12:48:36
(By Ramon Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The construction of a highway in Costa Rica that was initiated with aid from
Taiwan in 2005 will continue in accordance with related contracts despite the
severance of diplomatic ties between the two countries, the highway builder said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chih-kang, an official of Taiwan-based Ret-Ser Engineering Corp. who is
heading the project, said that unless Taipei issues new directives, Ret-Ser will
continue to carry out the contracts to finish the building of the Carretera
Naranjo-San Carlos Highway -- a 29.73-km highway slated to be completed by April
2010 with a price tag of US$61 million.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if Ret-Ser were to renege on the contracts by halting
construction, all related bank deposits held as guarantees would be confiscated
by Costa Rican government.</P>
      <P>Under two cooperative contracts, covering the use of bank loans and funds that
Taiwan promised to give to Costa Rica, signed by the Taiwan and Costa Rican
governments in 2004, Ret-Ser began building the highway in October 2005,
according to Chang.</P>
      <P>As of last week, Chang said, the construction work was 28.5 percent completed,
adding that the original scheduled date for completion had earlier been put off
from Oct. 27, 2009 to April 12, 2010 due to weather factors.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice Foreign Minister Chang Siao-yue said June 7, one day after Costa
Rica switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, that Taiwan will
not at present consider establishing any other liaison office in Costa Rica and
that it has decided to cease all cooperation projects between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Responding to the vice foreign minister's announcement, Taiwanese expatriates in
Costa Rica have since urged the government to open a representative office in
Costa Rica's capital, San Jose, out of concerns that their interests might be
affected because of the termination of the 63-year-old diplomatic partnership
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The expatriates,  including  Taiwanese  business people and students, urged the
government to at least set up an economic and cultural office in San Jose to
take charge of consular and document verification affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  according to a report in the local weekly El Financiero on Sunday,
Costa Rican Minister of Foreign Trade Marco Vinicio Ruiz said that bilateral
trade between Costa Rica and Taiwan will not be affected by the severance of
diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Costa Rica will continue to ship products to Taiwan, and all investors from
Taiwan will be protected by Costa Rican laws, Luiz was quoted as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE SPOUSES NEED TO PRODUCE CLEAN BILLS OF HEALTH FROM SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens who apply to make their first-ever
"reunion visit" to Taiwan will have to produce a clean bill of health from Sept.
1, a National Immigration Agency (NIA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Department of Health (DOH) has decided to impose
the new requirement after a Chinese spouse who had come to Taiwan for a "reunion
visit" was diagnosed as having tuberculosis (TB).</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese spouses applying to make short-term "reunion visits" need
not present a clean bill of health. The TB-infected Chinese spouse living in
eastern Taiwan didn't develop symptoms until some time after her arrival in
Taiwan, the official said.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, only Chinese citizens who apply to stay in Taiwan as
a dependent of their local spouses are required to present a clean bill of
health. Presently, Chinese spouses have to wait for two years to qualify for
applying to stay in Taiwan as a dependent.</P>
      <P>As Chinese spouses make an average of more than 13,000 "reunion visits" to
Taiwan annually, the NIA official said, the government needs to formulate a new
"health threshold" to plug any possible holes in the country's epidemic
prevention network.</P>
      <P>Starting Sept. 1, Chinese spouses intending to make their first "reunion visit"
to Taiwan have to produce a clean bill of health issued by a state-run hospital,
legally licensed private hospital or university-affiliated  hospital and
certified  by an officially designated Chinese notary agency.</P>
      <P>The clean bill of health must also be certified by Taiwan's quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation to prove the document's validity, the NIA official
said, adding that the NIA will not begin to process Chinese spouses' entry
applications until after all those health-related documents are available.</P>
      <P>The health checkups must include screening for AIDS, rubella, TB, prevalent
intestinal parasites and leprosy, the official added.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday that the Executive Yuan stands on the side
of farmers and fisherman in requesting that the opposition-controlled
legislature reconsider amendments governing farmers' and fishermen's
associations that it passed early last month.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks one day before the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to
vote again on the amendments to the Farmers' Association Law and Fisherman
Assoiciation Law that it passed May 11.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Chang said the country's farmers and fishermen
are not a part of "black gold" politics, and instead are "the pride of Taiwan, "
adding that the Executive Yuan decided to formally request the reconsideration
May 30 in an effort to protect the rights and interests of farmers and
fisherman.</P>
      <P>The amendments would abolish the three-term limit for secretaries general of the
associations and guarantee that any association staff standing trial would not
be removed from their post until they are convicted in the final verdict in
their case. Currently, indicted association staff members are discharged if they
are convicted in a second trial.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the Executive Yuan has the right to request that
the legislature reconsider a passed bill if it deems the passed bill too
difficult to execute.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, over 1,000 farmers and fishermen from around the island gathered at
the Legislative Yuan headquarters Monday to condemn the ruling DPP for treating
them as "second-class" citizens.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the request for reconsideration  of the amendments  was
nothing more than "mudslinging"  and political maneuvering ahead of the next

    <HEADLINE>KMT VOWS TO PUSH FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORT LINKS REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 11 (CNA)
06/11/07  17:33:55
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislative caucus vowed Monday to push for a
nationwide referendum on the issue of opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>The legislators expressed the hope that a cross-strait direct transportation
links referendum can be held in tandem with the presidential election slated to
take place next year.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping claimed that the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) administration has led Taiwan nowhere in terms of
economic development and diplomatic achievement since it took power seven years
ago.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will fall even lower should the DPP be allowed to continue to rule the
country based only on ideology, Hsu claimed.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that the KMT believes opening direct cross-strait transport links is
pragmatic and conducive to Taiwan's economic development, prompting the main
opposition party to push for a national referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung said opening the links would undoubtedly benefit
Taiwan's domestic economy, adding that the DPP is sticking its head in the sand
by opposing the passage of an amendment to a statute to pave the way for direct
links, while being unable to rev up the flagging domestic economy.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said the KMT is not aiming at entering a "referendum
race" with the DPP by putting forth the cross-strait links referendum plan to
challenge a referendum plan on retrieving the KMT's ill-gotten assets proposed
by the DPP.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that the Taiwan people are able enough to decide in referendums
whether they prefer economic progress to "political word games."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lo Shih-hsiung noted that Kaohsiung Harbor's container handling
capacity ranked third in the world when the KMT was running the country, but has
fallen to sixth since Taiwan has been in the hands of the DPP.</P>
      <P>He lamented that an amendment to a free trade harbor zone bill proposed by him
to pave the way for China-originating semi-finished products to be processed in
Taiwan's free trade harbor zones for re-export was boycotted by DPP lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the KMT's intention to push for a cross-strait links
referendum, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng -- formerly a KMT vice
chairman -- said the KMT and the DPP have equal rights to push for the
implementation of referendums on major issues concerning the people's rights and
welfare, so long as they can muster enough signatures to pass the threshold of
requirement for a referendum to take place.</P>
      <P>Wang added, however, that a final decision on the opening of direct transport
links would be a matter for the governments on the two sides of the strait and
would require meetings and negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Hsin-nan, a whip of the ruling DPP legislative caucus, told the
KMT not to "fool the Taiwan people" by playing with a referendum plan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the DPP administration could announce in 24 hours Taiwan's
opening of direct links with China without holding a nationwide referendum
should the KMT and the Taiwan people accept the notion defined by Beijing that
Taiwan-China air and shipping links are part of China's domestic routes and that
Taiwan is part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.</P>

will provide ethanol gasoline from 2011.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan has a large number of motorcycles, but noted that
motorcycle engines are unfit for ethanol gasoline. The ministry is also studying
incentives to encourage private motorists to use ethanol gasoline.</P>

      <P>If corrupt staff members of farmers' and fishermen's associations are allowed to
stay in their posts until they are convicted in a final verdict, the banking
institutes run by those associations would be ruined by them and taxpayers would
be forced to carry the can, Legislator Wang Tu-fa of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Monday.</P>
      <P>Flanked by his friends Charles Chiang and Wu Ming-ming, also DPP lawmakers, Wang
told a news conference that more than 13 staff of the country's farmers' and
fishermen's associations who are involved in criminal cases have been convicted,
although final verdicts have not yet been delivered.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of them are charged with cutting corners in extending
association loans to their cronies, Wang said the longer these people remain in
their posts, the more irreversible the damage they will cause to the
associations.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the ratio of bad loans of these associations' baking sections
stood at 14.53 percent in 2000 when the DPP came to power. It was down to 7.6
percent as of last month after the DPP administration used NT$50 billion
(US$1.51 billion) to bail out unliquidated banking sections of these
associations over the last seven years.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to help these groups regain their health will be
undermined unless corrupt personnel are fired when they are found guilty at
their second trials, Wang claimed.</P>
      <P>The three lawmakers urged the public to support the Executive Yuan's request for
a legislative reconsideration of an amendment to the law governing the farmers'
and fishermen's association, which was enacted in May to allow staff to stay in
their posts unless convicted in the final trial.</P>
      <P>The request was opposed by the opposition in the legislature and the leaders of
the associations, who claimed that these organizations are private groups and
that the restriction to be done away with by the amendment is tougher than a
similar restriction imposed on government officials, as government officials
cannot be removed before they are found guilty in their last trial.</P>
      <P>The legislature is set to vote Tuesday on the Executive Yuan's request.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HAS FAITH IN CANDIDATE, NO PLAN TO REVISE PARTY CHARTER: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
06/11/07  19:35:35
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has every confidence in the
integrity of its presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, and there is no plan to
revise the party charter, DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to reports that Hsieh's presidential candidacy might be in
jeopardy if he is indicted over several high-profile corruption allegations
during his 1998-2005 stint as Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>The trio of cases -- in connection with the MRT system in Kaohsiung, political
donations and his mayoral "special allowance fund" -- are being investigated by
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had said earlier that if he is indicted over the "special allowance fund"
for his discretionary use,  he will quit the presidential race, but he dismissed
Sunday the idea of pulling out of the race if he is indicted over the political
donation case.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Hsieh had explained his part in the cases at a meeting of the
DPP's Central Standing Committee, and said the DPP members believe he is
innocent.</P>
      <P>The DPP charter states that if a member is indicted for alleged illicit gains or
illicit profiteering, an integrity committee will suggest that a central
advisory committee punish the indicted member by suspending his or her party
rights at the minimum.</P>
      <P>Lin said he believes in Hsieh's integrity and that the party will proceed
"according to the its charter,"</P>
      <P>He urged respect for the judicial procedure and the party system, adding that
"the party has no question of discussing the revision now."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Wang Tuoh, a major whip of the legislative caucus,
said the party's Central Advisory Committee will have the final say, noting that
the committee has acted "consistently and rigorously in the past." First lady Wu
Shu-jen and Ma Yung-cheng, former deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, had their membership rights suspended one-and-a-half years after their
indictment late last year.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin also said the party will not revise the charter for a
specific person, as that would "make it as decadent" as the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The KMT recently revised its charter to bar only those who are found guilty in
the third trial, instead of the original first trial, from representing the
party in presidential elections, with the express purpose of allowing its
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou off the hook. Ma has been indicted in
February over his alleged misuse of his "special allowance fund" during his
mayoral term.</P>
      <P>However, DPP Legislator Cheng Yun-peng said it would be better to revise the
party charter before an indictment takes place, as he claimed that doing
otherwise would "give the impression that the revision has been tailored for a
specific person."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wild dogs were identified Monday as the killers of goats in Linkuo, a township
in the northern county of Taipei, after a dog was caught in a trap cage early
this morning, while two others fled when spotted mauling goats.</P>
      <P>In the morning attack, 14 goats were killed and four others injured, calculated
their owner, who lost eight goats Friday when his farm was first invaded by
"some kind of large beast, " which was earlier thought to be a tiger.</P>
      <P>The county government soon then launched efforts to hunt down the creature
killing goats out of concerns for public safety, including the installation of
three large trap cages at the Linkuo goat farm.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chung-yi, a county official responsible for animal disease control, said it
is almost certain that the mid-sized wild dogs were the culprits behind the
attacks after catching one of them on the spot. But he added that a double check
of the killers' tracks left at the scene is still needed to close the case.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) will replace paper alien resident
certificates (ARCs) with electronic cards embedded with advanced anti-forgery
microchips in two stages beginning July 1, NIA officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the move will be congruent with world trends, noting that it
will contribute to the nation's anti-terrorist and anti-forgery efforts.</P>
      <P>Officials also announced the format of the photos for the new cards, which will
be the same as the newly replaced IDs for local citizens, with the face of the
person covering between 70 percent and 80 percent of a photo taken within the
last six months.</P>
      <P>The officials said that during the first stage, from July 1 through Dec. 31, it
will only issue new ARCs with integrated circuit (IC) chips to new applicants
and those who apply to replace older, lost ARCs.</P>
      <P>The approach is in line with international practices and will avoid having lost
certificates forged or used by others, the officials said, adding that it is
estimated that 120,000 new electronic alien resident cards will be issued during
this stage.</P>
      <P>In the second phase, from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2008, the official went on, all
existing ARC holders will be notified to exchange their old paper cards for the
new electronic ones.</P>
      <P>The official said the new ARC measures will also apply to the more than 330,000
international blue-collar workers employed by local manufacturing and
construction companies and caregivers working for families with members in need

      <P>New Government Information Office (GIO) Minister and Executive Yuan spokesman
Shieh Jhy-wey said Monday that he will perform his two new jobs according to
different codes of conduct in order to fulfill his double duties successfully.</P>
      <P>As the Executive Yuan spokesman, Shieh said, he will precisely convey the
government's stances on various policy initiatives and issues of national
concern; while in playing the role of GIO minister, Shieh went on, he will
infuse the agency with new thinking and new idea, as the acronym GIO also stands
for "Great Idea Office."</P>
      <P>Shieh,  who just ended a two-year stint as the country's representative to
Germany, made the remarks at a changeover ceremony in which he took his new
official seals from acting GIO Minister William J. Yih, who will continue to
serve as GIO deputy minister.</P>
      <P>A German literature professor-turned-official, Shieh has always been known for
his quick wit and sense of humor. His 17-minute speech at the changeover
ceremony was full of "pearls of wisdom and sparkling sayings, " drawing
incessant laughter from those present at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Shieh said he will treat his new job as a challenge that can bring new
opportunities and changes. As a novice to GIO work, Shieh said he will need the
support and assistance of all GIO staff. "We need teamwork  to fulfill  our
duties and I'll wholeheartedly appreciate your help," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting the President Chen Shui-bian's administration is entering its final year,
Shieh said that although there has been criticism of the administration, he
still sees hope and sunshine ahead.</P>
      <P>His two years of experience as Taiwan's representative to Germany also allowed
him to see what role Taiwan can play on the world stage, Shieh said confidently.</P>
      <P>"What I have been doing in Germany over the past two years is to introduce
things-related to Taiwan to Germans. As the GIO head, I would have to sell
Taiwan to all countries around the world. I need good ideas to accomplish my
duties," he added.</P>
      <P>For him, he said, the "ROC" of the Republic of China can also stand for
"republic of confidence. "I hope all of our people will remain confident in our
country's future," he added.</P>

      <P>Anti-human trafficking police have done commendable jobs over the past few
months in cracking down on human smuggling rings, Minister of the Interior Lee
Yi-yang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Following a China Times daily report earlier that day that Taiwan has been on a
global human trafficking blacklist since the beginning of this year, Lee said
law enforcement agencies, including the National Police Administration, have
cracked down on 80 human trafficking cases involving 626 "snakeheads" or
smugglers, ring operators and illegal brokers in the first five months of this
year.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a 16-fold increase over the figure posted for the same
period of 2006, Lee said, describing the China Times report as "groundless."</P>
      <P>In a written statement, Lee said the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
maintained coordination operations with local governments of the 24 cities and
counties around the country with regard to anti-human trafficking efforts.</P>
      <P>So far, 11 victims from outside Taiwan have been given temporary accommodation
in shelters operated by private organizations with the assistance of local
governments, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, a total of 1,585 foreign workers who have fallen victim to
illegal labor brokers have been put up at 13 foreign laborers' halfway homes
around the country.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOI has been overseeing the implementation of 52 measures to
prevent human trafficking, track down traffickers and protect victims since Nov.
8, 2006, when the administration announced a supra-ministerial anti-human
trafficking plan.</P>
      <P>He added that in its 2007 global human trafficking report released in January,
the U.S. State Department also confirmed that the Taiwan authorities have made
some progress in efforts to crack down on human trafficking.</P>

With the four-month-old increase in American troops showing only modest success
in curbing insurgent attacks, American commanders are turning to another
strategy that they acknowledge is fraught with risk: arming Sunni Arab groups
that have promised to fight militants linked with Al Qaeda who have been their
allies in the past.

American commanders say they have successfully tested the strategy in Anbar
Province west of Baghdad and have held talks with Sunni groups in at least four
areas of central and north-central Iraq where the insurgency has been strong.

Wall Street Journal:Horseshoe Crabs In Political Pinch Over Bird's Future

On the high tides of spring, horseshoe crabs crawl out of the water to go about
the business of making more horseshoe crabs. The crab has been at this for three
or four hundred million years, a record of tenacity that accounts for its pet
name: the cockroach of the sea.

From the crab perspective, the best beaches on earth ring Delaware Bay, where a
bird called the red knot also takes a spring break during its world-record
migration, a 9,300-mile tour to the arctic from the southern tip of South
America. The crabs lay trillions of pebbly, fat-filled eggs. The birds peck a
few billion out of the sand, then go on their way.</TEXT>

      <P>The government  should help local information and communications technology
(ICT) companies develop their own brands as part of efforts to deal with
declining exports of Taiwan's ICT products, local scholars said Monday.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the appeal after the Ministry of Finance (MOF) recently
released statistics showing that Taiwan's ICT exports have reported a negative
growth for the 11th consecutive month as of May, despite an increase in overall
exports.</P>
      <P>Although the negative growth in ICT exports has become a long-term trend, the
impact has been limited because ICT exports account for a very small proportion
of Taiwan's total exports, they said.</P>
      <P>This negative growth will not be a problem if total exports continue to rise,
the experts said.</P>
      <P>ICT exports in May decreased by 15.1 percent over the same period last year,
generating a total value of US$707 million, according to statistics.</P>
      <P>At the same time, total ICT exports during the first five months of this year
also showed a year-on-year decrease of 15.1 percent, or US$4.058 billion in
total value, statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>Since last July, negative growth in Taiwan's ICT exports has become the norm due
to the relocation of local ICT companies, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Double-digit loses have been repeatedly reported in ICT exports during the past
few months, the officials said, adding that last November showed a drop of 22
percent.</P>
      <P>Kung Ming-hsin, deputy director of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research,
said that this negative growth is not a short-term phenomenon as the problem
began to emerge in 2004.</P>
      <P>There were periods of positive growth since then, probably due to the strong
exports of cell phone products, according to Kung, however, ICT exports started
a regular slide in 2006.</P>
      <P>Although the negative growth has become a long-term trend, Kung noted it has had
a limited impact on total exports as ICT exports accounted for a small
percentage -- 3.6 percent -- of May exports.</P>
      <P>Electronic product export makes up a large part of Taiwan's total exports, Kung
explained.</P>
      <P>Hsu Song-ken, professor of industrial economics at Tamkang University, said that
from a short-term perspective, the ups and downs in the exports of ICT products
were due to business cycles and launches of new ICT products.</P>
      <P>The relocation of local companies also contributed to the negative growth, Hsu
went on.</P>
      <P>Noting that the production of desktop computers has moved to China, Hsu urged
the government to take proactive measures to deal with the economic fallout.</P>
      <P>However, he also noted that if the government wants companies to develop
stronger brands, it should think about how to achieve that goal as local
production capabilities continue to move overseas.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan said Monday that she will respect the will of
Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate,
in choosing his running mate.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks one day after saying that if Hsieh taps her as the running
mate, she would "embrace it gladly." Some have interpreted her statement, after
having been tight-lipped for some time in response to reports she would join
Hsieh on the ballot, as a sign that a Hsieh-Yeh ticket is now certain despite
earlier reports that President Chen Shui-bian had wanted Hsieh to team up with
former Premier Su Tseng-chang to boost the DPP's chances of winning the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is a Hakka, explained Monday that her words came "in response to" the
expectations of the Hakka, the second largest ethnic group in Taiwan after the
Hoklo, as well as those of the nation's women.</P>
      <P>She stressed that "all will have to respect the decision of Hsieh."</P>

party is to respect the decision of the presidential candidate in choosing his
running mate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1ST CLUSTER OF SAPOVIRUS INFECTION IN TAIWAN REPORTED</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reported the first cluster of Sapovirus
infection in Taiwan, with 55 faculty members of a college in northern Taiwan
being infected with the disease.</P>
      <P>Sapoviruses  are caliciviruses  which,  together  with  the noroviruses, are the
leading causes of acute viral gastroenteritis in humans. The virus is named
after Sapporo, Japan where the virus was first recognized during an outbreak at
an orphanage. It generally causes only mild gastroenteritis in young children.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said that the virus is hard to diagnose, and that the center only
became capable of testing for the virus after cooperating last year with Japan's
National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases to co-develop the
means to do so.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they are not ruling out the possibility that others
might have been infected with the virus at an earlier date, but that such an
outbreak went unrecognized.</P>
      <P>Officials said they were notified by the Department of Health of the Taipei
County Government in May that a cluster of 55 people had shown the symptoms of
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and that the possibility of food poisoning had
been initially ruled out.</P>
      <P>Fecal specimens from eight infected people were sent to a laboratory for a
series of tests that presented negative results to the initial battery of tests.
The samples were then retested using the recently developed test for Sapovirus
and seven of the eight showed a positive result.</P>
      <P>Officials said that the virus is often transmitted through feces and oral
contact, and that the cases often arise in nurseries and kindergartens in
foreign countries, but it is rare in colleges and university.</P>
      <P>Currently, there is little research on Sapovirus, and the prevalence rate is
unclear, officials said, urging the public to wash their hands, and maintain a
healthy diet and personal hygiene to stave off the virus.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has named former Premier Frank Hsieh to head a
delegation to attend the late Japanese lawmaker Motoo Shiina's funeral, a
Presidential Office news release said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the press statement, Hsieh, who is also the ruling Democratic
Progressive  Party's (DPP)  candidate for the 2008 presidential election, will
depart for Tokyo June 19 to attend Shiina's memorial service scheduled for June
20.</P>
      <P>Shiina was a prominent member of the House of Councilors -- the upper house of
Japan's Diet. He was very friendly toward Taiwan. Hsieh, who has doctoral degree
in law from Kyoto University, will read an eulogy in remembrance of Shiina at
his funeral on behalf of President Chen.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told an international news conference earlier in the day that if he is
elected Taiwan's next president, he will push Japan to legislate a law patterned
after the United States' Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to regulate its engagement
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Through such a legislation, the substantive Taipei-Tokyo ties will be upgraded
to a level based on the rule of law," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Since Japan switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972,
Taiwan and Japan have maintained unofficial ties. Without the support of a legal
act, Hsieh said, bilateral exchanges have been restricted to a lower level.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and Japan share common strategic  interests  in maintaining regional
security and stability, Hsieh said Japan needs to legislate a TRA-like law to
allow for higher-level exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said he is scheduled to visit the U.S. in July as part of his
campaign tour.</P>

      <P>Former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan said Monday that she will respect the will of
Frank Hsieh, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's presidential candidate,
in choosing his running mate.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks one day after saying that if Hsieh taps her as the running
mate, she would "embrace it gladly." Some have interpreted her statement, after
having been tight-lipped for some time in response to reports she would join
Hsieh on the ballot, as a sign that a Hsieh-Yeh ticket is now certain despite
earlier reports that President Chen Shui-bian had wanted Hsieh to team up with
former Premier Su Tseng-chang to boost the DPP's chances of winning the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is a Hakka, explained Monday that her words came "in response to" the
expectations of the Hakka, the second largest ethnic group in Taiwan after the
Hoklo, as well as those of the nation's women.</P>
      <P>She stressed that "all will have to respect the decision of Hsieh."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislator, Wang Tuoh, said Monday that the tradition of the

      <P>"While India boasts a large software talent pool and robust economic strength,
Singapore also plays an important role in global trade and regional politics. We

      <P>Given India's excellence and prominence in computer software production, Ma said
India can complement Taiwan, one of the world's top computer hardware suppliers,

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE VOTES TO UPHOLD AMENDMENTS ON GRASS-ROOTS ASSOCIATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
06/12/07  12:20:01
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan voted Tuesday not to overturn
amendments to the law governing farmers' and fishermen's associations,
delivering a blow to Premier Chang Chun-hsiung who assumed office May 21.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's vote, the legislature voted 115-96 to uphold the amendments, with
one invalid ballots.</P>
      <P>The amendments, passed by the opposition-controlled legislature on May 11,
cancel the three-term limit on secretaries-general of the associations and lower
the requirements of employment renewal. They also stipulate that indicted
association staff are not to be relieved of their jobs until a final verdict has
been delivered in their trial. Currently, indicted association staff members are
discharged if they are convicted in the second stage of their trial.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the amendments would hamper the government's efforts to clear the
grass-roots farmers' and fishermen's groups of corrupt politicians, Chang's
Cabinet decided May 30 to request that the legislature reconsider the
amendments.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Wang Tu-fa claimed that many of
these organizations, which tend to support the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and People First Party, have been dominated by corrupt local
politicians who have been charged with criminal offenses and are currently
standing trial.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if these politicians are allowed to remain in their posts until
they are convicted in the final stage of their trial, then the associations,
along with the banking institutions run by these associations, will be ruined,
and taxpayers will be forced to flip the bill.</P>
      <P>He noted that more than 13 senior officials of the country's farmers' and
fishermen's  associations  have been indicted and convicted, although verdicts
have yet to be delivered in their final trial.</P>
      <P>Noting that most of these officials have been indicted for cutting corners to
extend association loans to their cronies, Wang said the longer these officials
remain in their posts, the more irreversible the damage to the associations will
be.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that the ratio of bad loans of these associations' banking sections
stood at 14.53 percent in 2000 when the DPP came to power and that the figure
had been reduced to 7.6 percent as of last month after the DPP administration
used NT$50 billion (US$1.51 billion)  to bail out unliquidated  banking sections
of these associations over the last seven years.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet's request for reconsideration of the amendments was opposed by the
"pan-blue" lawmakers and leaders of the associations, who claimed that these
organizations are private groups and that the restrictions to be done away
through the amendments are tougher than those imposed on government officials,
as government officials cannot be removed from their posts before they are found
guilty in their last trial.</P>

      <P>Law enforcement authorities should step up their crackdown on contraband
smuggling via the Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, both of
which lie closer to China's Fujian Province than Taiwan proper, Minister of
Justice Shih Mao-lin said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, many Kinmen and Matsu fishermen have been illegally involved
in small-scale trade in daily necessities, raw materials, contraband goods and
firearms across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Smuggling via the two outlying island areas has become so rampant that locals
tend to refer to their fishing vessels as part of the "North Sea Fleet," he
added.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years,  Shih continued,  only 82 cargo transshipment cases in
the Kinmen-Matsu area have been reported for customs clearance, indicating that
most of the area's cargo imports and exports have not been processed by customs
authorities.</P>
      <P>Shih said he has informed Minister of Finance Ho Chih-chin of this finding and
asked him to probe into possible tax evasion related to this phenomenon.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Shih said, contraband drugs smuggled from the Golden Triangle
in northern Thailand via the Chinese provinces of Yunan, Guangxi, Guangdong and
Fujian have been seized in Kinmen on many occasions.</P>
      <P>Shih said he has ordered the Ministry of Justice's prosecutorial department to
coordinate with the Coast Guard Administration and other relevant government
agencies to take precautionary measures to prevent the two outlying  islands
from becoming "golden" drug trafficking channels.</P>
      <P>Noting that 80 percent of the world's opium crop is produced in Afghanistan and
that the opium trade is a major source of income for the  notorious  al-Qaida
terrorist  organization,  Shih  said Afghanistan-originating opium has been
smuggled from China's Xinjiang and southeastern provinces to Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Shih said he has asked law enforcement authorities to heighten their alert to
prevent any such contraband  drugs from being transshipped via Taiwan's outlying
islands to other areas around the world.</P>

      <P>Many businesses have expressed concern that their minimal profit margins could
further dwindle over the next decade, with the possible arrival of an era of
"zero profits, " according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by 104 Job Bank, Global Views Monthly and 30 Monthly on
1,058 business representatives from May 21-25. It has a margin of error of plus
or minus 2.21 percent.</P>
      <P>Just over 80 percent of the respondents predicted that their businesses will
face a crisis of "profitless operations" by 2015.</P>
      <P>This sense of crisis  is most evident  among small-  and medium-sized businesses
with 20-100 employees, with 89 percent of representatives of these businesses
sharing this view.</P>
      <P>Asked to rate their confidence in the future development of the business
environment on a 100-point scale, the respondents gave an average score of 57.8.</P>
      <P>Among businesses with 100 or fewer employees, over 40 percent gave a failing
mark of less than 60.</P>
      <P>On the factors in Taiwan's overall environment that are critical to the
continuation of their businesses, 58.1 percent of respondents mentioned
government efficiency, 54.1 percent named the level of internationalization, and
51.6 percent pointed to the country's economic strength.</P>
      <P>To cope with the possible arrival of a "zero profits" era, 54.5 percent of
respondents said they will recruit and train talent, 42.5 percent will prepare
to tap the international market, and 33 percent will adopt a creative business
model.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that technological development, cross-Taiwan Strait interaction
and businesses' position in globalization are the top three choices among the
respondents in seeking opportunities for business development.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang will visit Taiwan's five diplomatic
allies in Africa next month to extend invitations to the leaders of these
countries to attend a summit to be held in Taipei in September, an official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a regular press conference held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) ,
Chang Yun-ping, director-general of the MOFA's Department of African Affairs,
said Huang will serve as a special envoy of President  Chen Shui-bian  to invite
the leaders to participate in the summit between the Republic of China and its
African allies.</P>
      <P>In Africa, Taiwan now only maintains diplomatic ties with Burkina Faso, Malawi,
Swaziland, The Gambia, and Sao Tome and Principe.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Africa, Huang will also attend activities to mark the
national days of Malawi and Sao Tome and Principe, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>In response to reports that China is discussing a cooperation project on oil
exploitation with Sao Tome and Principe, Chang said it comes as no surprise to
Taiwan as China has been working to establish relations with all the oil

      <P>Chang added that although the government expects that the matter will not have
an impact on Taiwan's officials ties with the African country, the MOFA is
trying to learn more about the details of the situation.</P>
      <P>Huang announced in late April that the summit meeting between Taiwan's head of

      <P>A local  research  team has made breakthroughs in the application of quantum
encryption to telephone and the Internet data transmission,  allowing  greater
privacy protection in daily communications, sources at National Central
University (NCU) in Taoyuan County said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>NCU Professor Li Pei-wen, the leader of the nanotechnology research  and
development  team,  said that quantum  encrypted communications have been widely
used in many areas to prevent phone tapping or computer hacking, and that the
team has modified the equipment to allowing its use in daily life.</P>
      <P>Li explained that messages sent in quantum communication are first coded and
transmitted with a photon emitter, and then decoded by receiver with electron
transistor -- if anyone "intercepts" the message, the sequence of photons will
be altered and the sender and receiver can thus easily recognize a security
breach has occurred.</P>
      <P>With the quantum encryption techniques, everyday communications using phones or
the Internet can be much safer, Li added.</P>
      <P>According to NCU, the single-photon emitter and single-electron transistor
developed by the team has already achieved high accuracy and efficiency, with 92
percent efficiency for single-mode light emission and 99 percent purity for
single photons. Also, the size of the transistor has been reduced to less than
three nanometers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Professor Hsia Liang-chou, a specialist in veterinary medicine and animal
husbandry, asserted Tuesday that stray dogs must be the culprits behind the
recent goat killing in Linkuo, Taipei county, while a witness to the attack
continued to insist that she saw a tiger, not dogs.</P>
      <P>Hsia, director of the animal husbandry and veterinary medicine division  of the
National Pingtung University  of Science and Technology (NPUST) in the southern
county of Pingtung, also heads the NPUST-operated stray dogs home. He indicated
that it's not unusual to see stray dogs attack other animals.</P>
      <P>Some released or escaped dogs may become aggressive, but later generation strays
are much more violent and wolfish than those which were once pets, Hsia said,
citing a case that occurred in Pingtung years ago in which more than 10 mid-
sized hogs and dozens of goats were killed by stray dogs in a single night.</P>
      <P>Hsia explained how those strays mauled one of their victims, attacking its neck,
and flinging it to the ground.</P>
      <P>The most aggressive stray dogs are those of later generations, which are not all
in large size, the professor noted. While attempting to attack farm animals,
canines will usually rally others of their kind before striking, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsia also indicated that it is easy to identify the attacker from the paw prints
and bite wounds left on the scene. If dogs were responsible for attack on the
goats in Linkuo Friday, there would be tooth marks left on the victim, whereas
if it was a tiger, there should also be lacerations due to the creature's claws,
Hsia noted.</P>
      <P>Another dog was caught Tuesday morning in a trap cage at the Linkuo goat farm,
owned by a man surnamed Hung, following the capture of a white stray nabbed the
previous day at the farm, where eight goats were mauled to death by some kind of
"unidentified large beast" Friday.</P>
      <P>A foreign maid witnessed the killing and insisted that she saw a tiger launch
the attack.</P>
      <P>Fourteen goats at the farm were killed by animal bites Monday, but the owner saw
wild dogs at the scene on that occasion.</P>
      <P>Examining the two captured strays, neither was found to have paw prints matching
the tracks left at the farm Friday, which appeared to be larger, Taipei county
officials said.</P>
      <P>The tracking operation will therefore continue until larger dogs, with paws
matching the prints on the site, are captured, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U.S.-based ethnic Chinese forensic scientist Henry Lee suggested hair
or bite wounds left on the mauled goats would provide evidence revealing the
species of the animals responsible for the Linkuo attacks.</P>
      <P>Lee made the suggestion in response to media inquiries during his visit to the
central county of Changhua Tuesday, where he was invited to deliver a speech to
local police.</P>

      <P>Both Taiwanese and Chinese university students enjoy purchasing brand-name
luxury goods, and 90 percent of them favor enhancing their spiritual cultivation
by means of travel, according to the results of a recent survey released
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a growing number of enterprises are simultaneously
investing in consumer markets across the Taiwan Strait, the Pilot Group
conducted the survey on Taiwanese and Chinese university students' consumption
behavior to allow the companies to better know the consumption characteristics
of students in the two markets.</P>
      <P>The survey collected 977 valid samples from university students in Taiwan and
911 valid responses from Chinese students.</P>
      <P>The most notable findings of the survey showed that students on both sides are
in the habit of buying brand-name products, with Taiwanese students spending 17
percent of their living expenses on purchasing brand name products, while
Chinese students spend 29 percent on such goods, according to Wu Yi-chen, a
pollster in charge of the Taiwanese poll.</P>

importance to promoting spiritual cultivation than buying brand names, then
added that the survey should help alleviate public concerns that university
students are unable to afford brand names purchases as they continue to indulge
in puchasing their favorite goods.</P>
      <P>In addition, as more and more high quality, low cost commodities have been
introduced to the Taiwanese market, Taiwanese university students have become
much more quality-oriented instead of solely focusing on brand names, Wu noted,
adding that the reliance Taiwanese students place on brand name products is not
as high as their Chinese counterparts.</P>

      <P>A resident in Taipei County has developed measles after a recent visit to Japan,
the second overseas measles infection this year, health authorities reported
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The patient, a 26-year-old woman living in the county's Panchiao City, is a
Chinese citizen who has not been vaccinated against measles, according to
officials of Taipei County Public Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>The case was reported to the bureau last week, the officials said, adding that
test results confirmed the diagnosis Monday.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the woman visited Japan with her Taiwanese husband May
17-24, she probably caught measles in Japan, which has been affected by a
measles outbreak since May, the officials said.</P>
      <P>While the patient is receiving treatment in an isolation ward in a local
hospital, health authorities are tracing the other travelers who were part of
the woman's tour group, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, deputy director-general of the Department of Health's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) , said a 28-year-old man who had contact with the patient
has a rash and that further examination is required to determine if he is
infected with measles.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that in Taiwan, measles vaccination coverage averages more than 95
percent, with almost all people born after September 1976 having received
inoculation.</P>
      <P>While a measles outbreak is unlikely in Taiwan, people are advised to avoid
taking infants who have not been vaccinated to measles-affected countries such
as Japan, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The incubation period for measles ranges from 10 to 14 days and symptoms include
a runny nose, cough, fever, red eyes and a red blotchy rash.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the CDC confirmed the country's first overseas measles infection,
which involved a woman in southern Taiwan who also traveled to Japan last month.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's top official responsible for cultural affairs bestowed the 11th Taiwan-
France Cultural Award on French puppeteer Jean-Luc Penso Monday at a ceremony
held at the French Academy in Paris,  France's  most prestigious  academic
institute.</P>
      <P>Wong Chin-chu,  chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of Cultural Affairs
(CCA) , said Penso will be awarded 25,000 euros for his contribution to the
arts, combining both Oriental and Western features in his puppetry.</P>
      <P>Penso, who learned puppet technique from Taiwanese puppet master Li Tien-lu,
founder of Yi Wan Jan Puppet Theater, for five years, established his shadow
puppet troupe "Theatre du Petit Miroir" in France in 1978.</P>
      <P>After spending 30 years in puppetry, Penso's shows, featured both in Taiwanese
and Western traditional stories, have been played in more than 100 countries.</P>
      <P>Wong congratulated Penso for winning the award co-sponsored by the CCA and the
French Academy, and extended gratitude to the academy and other foreign friends
for their contribution to Taiwan-French cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wong said that cultural cooperation between Taiwan and France offers a good
platform for Taiwanese and Europeans to better understand one another.</P>
      <P>Michel Albert, an executive of the French Academy, who was also present  at the
ceremony,  said the French Academy  has been successfully  assisting Europeans
to better understand Taiwan's current situation through a series of cooperative
projects staged with Taiwan's CCA over the last decade.</P>
      <P>Albert said it was a wonderful  experience  to know that traditional puppetry,
which was already being bypassed by the Taiwanese people, could be continued by
a French young man and his show halfway around the world.</P>
      <P>For his part, Penso stressed that he was content to perform Taiwanese puppet art
in other parts of the world, adding that he planned to use the prize money to
create a new drama featuring an episode from the noted Chinese historical novel
"the Three Kingdoms" for ethnic Chinese in the French colony of Reunion to mark
the 100th anniversary of a Gaundi Temple there next year.</P>

      <P>A Taichung county government proposal to seek upgrading the county's status to a
special municipality without taking Taichung City into account was adopted
Tuesday during a meeting attended by all township chiefs and representatives in
the central county.</P>
      <P>The county government will organize a status-upgrading promotion commission as
soon as the proposal passes the county council's review and before it is
delivered to the Executive Yuan for certification, county officials said.</P>
      <P>Addressing the advantages of being a special municipality, Taichung  County
Magistrate  Huang Chung-sheng  said a special municipality can receive more
money from the central government for construction projects.</P>
      <P>The county government's organic structure will also be expanded, Huang said,
explaining that if the county is upgraded to a special municipality, the
municipal government will be allowed to hire 4,230 additional employees to
upgrade its services.</P>
      <P>In December 2002, the Taichung County Council passed a resolution to bid for the
special municipality status together with Taichung City. However, the county has
been unable to get the resolution implemented because it would require re-zoning
of the country's administrative districts.</P>
      <P>According to the Act on Local Government Systems, an area with a population of
over 1.25 million and with special political, economic, cultural and urban
development may obtain special municipality status, the highest of three levels
of local government organizations The county is now home to more than 1.5

    <TEXT>New York Times: Judges Say U.S. Cant Hold Man as Combatant

The federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled yesterday that the president
may not declare civilians in this country to be enemy combatants and have the
military hold them indefinitely. The ruling was a stinging rejection of one of
the Bush administrations central assertions about the scope of executive
authority to combat terrorism.

The ruling came in the case of Ali al-Marri, a citizen of Qatar now in military
custody in Charleston, S.C., who is the only person on the American mainland
known to be held as an enemy combatant. The court said the administration may
charge Mr. Marri with a crime, deport him or hold him as a material witness in
connection with a grand jury investigation.

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed hope Tuesday that China will
negotiate the Olympic torch relay route as soon as possible out of consideration
for "the peace and freedom of the Olympic Games."</P>
      <P>The nation's top China policy planning agency made clear its stance in a written
statement.</P>
      <P>"As long as China expresses sincerity in a substantive way and proposes a
solution, we are willing to coordinate with China as soon as possible," it said.</P>
      <P>"Although China has said openly that it is willing to negotiate with us, it has
yet to put it into practice," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that the government "has always insisted that it will
safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty. If there will be negotiation with China on the
torch relay for the 2008 Olympic Games, the talks must be held under the
principles of safeguarding the nation's sovereignty, dignity, and cross-strait
parity."</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Chen Ming-tong, in an interview with Hong Kong media last week,
also said that Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate the torch relay route with
China so long as Taiwan's national status is not downgraded.</P>
      <P>According to China's plan when it announced the torch relay route April 26, the
Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then
continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving
in the host city, Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected the route planning at that time, saying it deliberately

      <P>The Executive Yuan regrets the Legislative Yuan's decision to vote down its
request to reconsider amendments to the law governing farmers' and fishermen's
associations, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh  made  the  remarks  after  the opposition-controlled legislature voted
115-96 to uphold the amendment, with one invalid ballot. The premier will have
to comply with the legislature's decision.</P>
      <P>Shieh said the Executive Yuan requested reconsideration of the amendments May 30
because it did not want to let corrupt association heads get off scot-free.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet accepted the result of the legislature's decision "with regret," he
said, adding that the "public will have their own judgment."</P>
      <P>He claimed that the main opposition Kuomintang "has lost more than it has
gained, " saying that the KMT's recent move to get its presidential candidate Ma
Ying-jeou off the hook has already raised public eyebrows and that "it is now
allowing rogue elements to remain in grassroots organizations by upholding the
amendments."</P>
      <P>He was referring  to the  party's  easing  of its strict anti-corruption party
charter to allow Ma to stay in the presidential race. Ma was indicted in
February for allegedly embezzling from the "special allowance fund" for his
discretionary use during his term as Taipei mayor 1998-2006.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed that the legislature's
rejection of the reconsideration request shows that the opposition camp is
trying to retain its connections with corrupt "black gold politics" with the aim
of cementing grassroots support for Ma in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary Hsu Jen-tu said that during the five-decade rule of the
KMT, it kept its grip on grassroots organizations, resulting in injustices in
the election process of officials in such associations.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT took the Executive Yuan to task for "wasting resources and
time" by requesting reconsideration of the amendments.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, KMT legislator and the party's Policy Committee executive
director, said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung "should take political responsibility,
" although he did not elaborate on what responsibility he was referring to.</P>
      <P>The amendments, passed by the opposition-controlled legislature May 11, cancel
the three-term limit on secretaries-general of the associations and lower the
requirements for employment renewal. They also stipulate that indicted
association staff are not to be relieved of their jobs until a final verdict has
been delivered in their trials. Currently, indicted association staff members
are discharged if they are convicted in the second stage of their trial.</P>
      <P>The Executive  Yuan requested  a reconsideration  from the legislature May 30.
According to the Constitution, the Executive Yuan has the right to request that
the legislature reconsider a passed bill if it deems the bill too difficult to
execute.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet  said the amendments  give strong backing  to association officials
mired in lawsuits or those who have criminal intentions, saying that if the
Cabinet cannot forestall potential disputes resulting from the organization of
the associations, they could expand into a systematic crisis, affect the
sustainable development of the grassroots organizations  and undermine the
government's efforts to reform grassroots organizations.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan estimated that 13 officials of farmers' and fishermen's
associations have been indicted and convicted in the first trial, although
verdicts have yet to be delivered in their final trials.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's bid to apply for United Nations membership under the name of Taiwan
will help the world understand Taiwan's wish to be recognized as a normal
country, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a meeting with foreign journalists stationed in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that this year, the DPP administration adopted a different strategy
in launching its U.N. bid, using the name Taiwan instead of the official name
"the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>This strategy will let the international community know that Taiwan wishes to be
recognized as a normal country, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Describing the strategy as peaceful and legitimate, Hsieh said that if Taiwan
wants to win the world's support, it should not cause any harm or "violate
humane principles."</P>
      <P>He predicted that the world will eventually change its stance on Taiwan and
added that China is facing many challenges and that Taiwan should be patient and
persevere.</P>
      <P>China will not be completely satisfied with anything Taiwan does unless Taiwan
surrenders, Hsieh claimed, adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait need to
negotiate and compromise.</P>
      <P>China might care about Taiwan's new strategy but it will not be nervous because
China has U.N. veto power and is more influential than Taiwan, Hsieh pointed
out.</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan's strategy is also aimed at underlining what he
described as China "saying one thing while doing another."</P>
      <P>China says that as long as Taiwan accepts Beijing's "one China policy, " Taiwan
can have its own interpretation of the meaning of "one China," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He noted that the structure of the Republic of China Constitution is based on
"one China" -- the ROC. However, the People's Republic of China does not admit
this Constitution and does not give any room for the ROC, he added.</P>
      <P>In order to gain more room, Hsieh said Taiwan needs to change its strategy,
which he described as "a passive act."</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said there are many possibilities in cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
describing himself as less conservative than the late President Chiang Ching-
kuo, who insisted on a "three noes" policy -- no negotiating, no compromise and
no contact with the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Now, many Taiwanese businessmen invest in China, Hsieh said, adding that in
order to achieve a balance between the two sides, he agrees that Chinese people
should be allowed to invest in or purchase property in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to recent remarks made by his rival, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
candidate Ma Ying-jeou, Hsieh said it would be "contradictory" if Ma selects a
DPP member to serve as premier should he win the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said there "might be a misunderstanding" because international
media has reported that he is corrupt and under investigation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh noted that not everyone who is investigated is corrupt or guilty of any
wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he did not do anything illegal, Hsieh said that he is under
investigation simply because he is being sued by KMT members. He added he is
confident that the public will have faith in him if he is not prosecuted.</P>

digestion problems.</P>
      <P>The dietician suggested making them at home with low-fat, healthy ingredients
like brown rice, to ensure their quality and cleanliness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FATE OF AMNESTY BILL UNDECIDED</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fate of a Cabinet-proposed amnesty bill remained undecided Tuesday as the
ruling and opposition parties failed to reach consensus on key points.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced April 24 that the government would implement
a sentence commutation program to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident of 1947 and the 20th anniversary of the lifting of 38 years of martial
law in 1987.</P>
      <P>Although the Legislative Yuan's Judicial Committee passed the first reading of
the amnesty bill presented by the Cabinet, the ruling and opposition parties
remained divided over the threshold for sentence commutation and the reasons for
the amnesty.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) disagreed with the inclusion of the 228
Incident commemoration as a reason for amnesty and demanded that the threshold
for amnesty be expanded to include those who have been sentenced to one-
and-a-half years.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident is a notorious dark chapter in Taiwan's history perpetrated by
the KMT under the leadership of the late President Chiang Kai-shek, in which a
popular uprising was brutally crushed by KMT troops.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-proposed bill, only those sentenced to a year or less
would be eligible for commutation.</P>
      <P>If the KMT's proposal is accepted, KMT Legislator Chiu Yi, who is serving a
16-month jail term for his role in a violent protest at Kaohsiung District Court
in 2004, will benefit from the bill.</P>
      <P>During a cross-party consultation session presided over by Legislative Yuan
Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, both the KMT and the ruling Democratic  Progressive
Party legislative  caucuses refused to compromise on their stances.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, the two camps came to a decision that a showdown vote
will be held Friday -- the last day of the current legislative session -- to
determine the amnesty bill's fate.</P>
      <P>As the KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" partner -- the People First Party -- hold
a slim majority in the legislature, the chances of the bill clearing the
legislature are slim, analysts said.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Justice data, if the Cabinet-proposed amnesty bill is
passed, 10,287 inmates can be released immediately, while another 7,699 will
have their sentences halved. If the KMT-proposed one-and-a-half-year threshold
is adopted, 14,795 inmates can be released immediately and 10,140 will have
their sentences cut by half.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REMOVED FROM U.S. WATCH LIST FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 12 (CNA)
06/13/07  12:38:41
(By Chiehyu Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has removed Taiwan from a watch list for human trafficking in
view of the country's "significant efforts" to tackle the problem over the past
year, according to an annual report released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of
State.</P>
      <P>The Trafficking in Persons Report 2007 places Taiwan on a list of "Tier 2"
countries, noting that Taiwan is primarily a destination for men, women and
children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation.</P>
      <P>"While the island's trafficking problems remain daunting, Taiwan authorities
over the last year showed clear progress in addressing trafficking for both
sexual and labor exploitation," the report says.</P>
      <P>However, the report continues, much more remains to be done to bring Taiwan into
compliance with the minimum standards, with Taiwan authorities needing to
demonstrate greater political will in dealing with the trafficking problem.</P>
      <P>The report urges Taiwan to grant victims of trafficking formal protection,
including  access to justice  in order to obtain compensation from their
traffickers or exploitative employers and the right to work while awaiting court
cases.</P>
      <P>It suggests that the Council on Labor Affairs stop addressing acts of
involuntary servitude with administrative penalties and instead refer these
serious crimes to the appropriate law enforcement authorities  for  criminal
investigation  and,  if  warranted, prosecution.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan authorities should do more to eliminate the ability of labor
brokers and employers to deport workers involuntarily, the report says.</P>
      <P>The 2007 report rates 141 countries and regions and places them in three lists,
based primarily on the extent of government action to combat trafficking.</P>
      <P>While governments that fully comply with the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking are placed in "Tier 1, " governments that are making
significant efforts to meet the minimum standards are placed in "Tier 2."</P>
      <P>Governments that do not fully comply with the minimum standards and are not
making significant efforts to do so are placed in "Tier 3" and may be subject to
certain sanctions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was ranked among the list of "Tier 1" countries in the 2003 and 2004
reports but was downgraded to "Tier 2" in the 2005 report.</P>
      <P>In the 2006 report, Taiwan was placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully
complying  with the minimum standards  for the elimination of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Addressing a news conference on the release of the 2007 report Tuesday, U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the Department of State has brought
global attention to the problem of human trafficking by making an assessment of
the problem annually since 2001.</P>
      <P>"Millions more people know about human trafficking today than when the first
report was issued in 2001, and we hope that this greater awareness translate
into greater prevention," Rice said.</P>
      <P>Mark P. Lagon, a senior advisor on trafficking in persons at the Department of
States, called a raid in Taiwan last week a "real success story" that
demonstrated a "welcome new attitude."</P>
      <P>In the case, Taiwan worked closely with U.S. law enforcement authorities to
break up a cross-border trafficking ring, arresting 12 people suspected of
trafficking women to the United States and other countries where they were
exploited in the sex and pornography industry.</P>
      <P>Lagon said countries that have established credentials in good governance and
rule of law, such as Taiwan, are more likely to move quickly in protecting
victims of trafficking and bringing exploiters to justice.</P>
      <P>In contrast, China, where there is a lack of rule of law, has resisted joining
the international community in upholding universal anti-trafficking standards,
he said.</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged
Taiwanese people living in New York or other cities and states in the United
States to return to their home country to vote in the next presidential election
in 2008.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun made the call Tuesday in a speech to more than 400 DPP supporters in
New York, the last leg of his eight-day visit to the United States aimed at
seeking overseas Taiwanese people's support for Frank Hsieh, the DPP's
presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Yu called for the DPP supporters to fly back to Taiwan to cast their ballots for
Hsieh, describing him as a person who can help transform Taiwan into a "normal
country."</P>
      <P>According to the DPP's assessment, around 25,000 DPP supporters living overseas
returned to Taiwan to cast their ballots in the 2004 presidential election. That
year, President Chen Shui-bian was re-elected. Yu said it is hoped that the
number of DPP supporters returning to Taiwan for the next presidential election
will be even higher.</P>
      <P>Yu arrived in San Francisco June 6 for his U.S. visit, which then took him to
Los Angeles and Houston. He is scheduled to fly back to Taiwan from New York

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush shook hands and chatted with Joseph Wu, Taiwan's
representative to the United States, Tuesday while attending the dedication of a
memorial to those killed by communist regimes around the world.</P>
      <P>Wu was among the roughly 1,000 guests invited to the dedication ceremony for the
Victims of Communism (VOC) Memorial near a square in front of the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Bush was invited to deliver a speech on the occasion. He greeted other guests
after his speech. When it was Wu's turn, Wu introduced himself to Bush by
saying: "I'm Ambassador Joseph Wu from Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Wu also took the opportunity to thank Bush for his support for Taiwan and said
Taiwan firmly supports U.S. efforts to spread the ideals of freedom and
democracy around the world.</P>
      <P>Bush thanked Wu and said: "It's good to see you here, " while tapping Wu's chest
with his fist. He then autographed a VOC Memorial manual and gave it to Wu.</P>
      <P>Since the United States switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
in 1979, Taiwan's representative to the United States has had few opportunities
to chat or shake hands in public with any sitting U.S. president. Tuesday's
brief encounter marked the first face-to-face exchange between Bush and Wu.</P>
      <P>The VOC Memorial was more than a decade in the making. The U.S. Congress passed
an act in 2003 on the establishment of the Victims of Communism Memorial
Foundation to raise funds from around the world to build the monument in memory
of the more than 100 million people killed by communist regimes, from China and
the now-defunct Soviet Union to Cambodia and North Korea.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has donated money to the foundation in the name of the
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy. When a groundbreaking ceremony was held in
September 2006, then-ROC Representative to the U.S. David Ta-wei Lee was also
invited to witness the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The dedication ceremony was co-chaired by Lee Edwards, chairman of the VOC
Memorial Foundation; Rep. Tom Lantos, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee; and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher spoke on the 20th anniversary of one of President Ronald Reagan's
most famous moments -- a speech at the Berlin Wall in which he challenged Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev to "tear down this wall." It was the ultimate challenge
of the Cold War, and the wall fell in 1989 as communist rule collapsed in East
Germany and Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.</P>
      <P>For his part, Bush said it was time to recall the lessons of the Cold War,
namely "that freedom is precious and cannot be taken for granted, that evil is
real and must be confronted, and that given the chance, men commanded by harsh
and hateful ideologies will commit unspeakable crimes and take the lives of
millions."</P>
      <P>At the center of the memorial is the figure of a woman holding what Bush called
a "lamp of liberty."</P>
      <P>"She reminds us that when an ideology kills tens of millions of people and still
ends up being vanquished, it is contending with a power greater than death,"

      <P>Wu said he attended the monument dedication with empathy as Taiwan, like many
other countries, has been a victim of communism and now still faces serious
military, security and health threats from communist China.</P>
      <P>Because of China's obstruction, Wu said, the health of Taiwan's 23 million

    <HEADLINE>TSU LAWMAKERS APPEAL FOR AMNESTY FOR 'RICE BOMBER'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislators appealed to President Chen
Shui-bian Wednesday to grant amnesty to "rice bomber" Yang Ju-men on the grounds
that Yang's conscience led him to break the law and that he never meant to hurt
his fellow compatriots.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lai Shin-yuan said the TSU came up with a proposal at Tuesday's
cross-party consultations that President Chen grant a special pardon to Yang,
which Lai claimed received the support of caucus whips of various parties.</P>
      <P>The "bombs" Yang planted in protest of rice imports "were more like
firecrackers" and that he turned himself in after planting the explosive
devices, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The legislature is scheduled to once again review the amnesty draft bill Friday.</P>
      <P>Lai said Yang should not be considered a common criminal since Yang had no
intention of hurting the people of Taiwan while expressing his displeasure with
the World Trade Organization's "exploitation of the disadvantaged" and his
concerns about the current uncertainties facing Taiwan's agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>Yang always left a note or a letter at the scene, identifying himself as an
opponent of the government's rice import policy, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Lai said, a Taipei court still sentenced Yang to five years and
ten months in jail and handed him a fine of NT$100,000 (US$3,030) for placing 17
explosive devices in public places in northern Taiwan during a one-year period
from November 2003.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lin Chih-chia said Yang's motive was aimed at raising public
awareness of the plight of Taiwan's farmers. Noting that Yang has already served
more than three years of his term, Lin said the president can consider granting
him a presidential pardon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the whip  of the opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) legislative caucus
said that because Yang would not be entitled to benefit from any articles of the
Cabinet-drafted amnesty bill even if it were to be passed into a law, the KMT
caucus would cooperate with other parties' caucuses to jointly push for a
special amnesty granted by the president.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced April 24 that the government would implement
a sentence commutation program to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the 228
Incident of 1947 and the 20th anniversary of the lifting of 38 years of martial
law in 1987.</P>
      <P>Although the Legislative Yuan's Judicial Committee passed the first reading of
the amnesty bill presented by the Cabinet, the ruling and opposition parties
remained divided over the threshold for sentence commutation and the reasons for
the amnesty.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin reiterated Wednesday the city government's resolve to
provide toilet paper in all public restrooms around the city.</P>
      <P>Noting that more than half of the 10,500 public restrooms in Taipei City
currently do not provide toilet paper, Hau said it is tantamount to punishing
law-abiding people for those who manage public restrooms not to provide toilet
paper out of concerns that the supply will be stolen.</P>
      <P>Toilet paper is now provided free of charge at almost all public hospitals and
MRT stations around Taipei, but it is still not provided at most of the
restrooms in markets, parks and other public facilities.</P>
      <P>Hau said the city government will try harder to improve the situation by
demanding that public restroom management make sure that every toilet in public
restrooms is stocked with toilet paper while also coming up with measures to
more effectively deal with the problem of theft of toilet paper from the

      <P>Hau also appealed to the people of the city to display more public mindedness by

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung pledged Wednesday that the government will step up its
efforts to combat human trafficking, following the country's removal from a U.S.
watch list for the trafficking problem.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said the fact that the
United States has removed Taiwan from the "Tier 2 Watch List" indicates that the
United States has noticed the country's hard work in fighting human trafficking
over the past year.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan must not be complacent about the achievement, Chang said, adding
that it is the Cabinet's goal in the coming year to continue to work to have
Taiwan's ranking upgraded to "Tier 1."</P>
      <P>In the Trafficking in Persons Report 2007 released by the U.S. Department of
State Tuesday, Taiwan has been reinstated on the list of "Tier 2" countries
because while the island's trafficking problems remain daunting, Taiwan
authorities showed clear progress in addressing trafficking for both sexual and
labor exploitation over the past year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was placed on the list of "Tier 1" countries in the 2003 and 2004 reports
but was downgraded to "Tier 2" in the 2005 report.</P>
      <P>In the 2006 report, Taiwan was placed on the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully
complying  with the minimum standards  for the elimination of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Chang instructed the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to meet with concerned
authorities to review and improve the government's measures against human
trafficking.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOI should cooperate with the Ministry of Justice to work out a
law on the prevention of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Also, to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers, the Council of Labor
Affairs should review its policy toward foreign workers, such as the method in
which foreign workers are imported into the country, the restrictions faced by
foreign workers in changing employers and the penalties for law-breaking
employers, Chang said.</P>

(ICG) slated to be held in Reykjavik, Iceland June 20-24.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-chi, director of the city government's Department of Education, will

July 19.</P>
      <P>Athletes from a total of 66 cities around the world will compete in the games,
which are aimed at strengthening friendship among schoolchildren around the
world via sports.</P>
      <P>Taipei City will send 17 athletes to vie for medals in four events -- swimming,
badminton, judo and golf. Wu predicted that the Taipei team should be able to
win more than five gold medals.</P>
      <P>Hau encouraged the Taipei athletes to strive for victory while also trying to
make friends during the event.</P>
      <P>As an incident occurred at last year's ICG held in Bangkok in which Chinese

Taiwanese athletes at a medal presentation ceremony, Hau asked the team members
to inform city representatives immediately if a similar incident occurs at this

      <P>Stressing that sports should be kept separate from politics, Wu said the ICG
organizers decided after last year's incident that they will set no restrictions
on the displaying of national flags of any country at any venue of the games.</P>
      <P>As Beijing will not send athletes to this year's games, with only a team from

      <P>A Taiwanese financial analyst warned Tuesday that Taiwan might risk missing out
on a global economic boom if its leader fails to negotiate with China to launch
direct flights across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Chin-ho, executive director of Wealth magazine, made the remarks while
delivering a speech at a monthly luncheon hosted by the European Chamber of
Commerce in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Since 2000,  most countries around the world have enjoyed unprecedented economic
growth, according to Hsieh, who added that except for Thailand, Japan and
Taiwan, other Asian countries have recorded brilliant performances, with the
stock market index in many countries posting a whopping five-fold increase.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's economic performance is undermined by the government's
mismanagement of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The opening of cross-strait links is "unavoidable, " Hsieh claimed, saying that
he has suggested that main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-

      <P>The DPP candidate has a much more open attitude on relaxation of cross-strait
restrictions than President Chen Shui-bian and many other DPP heavyweights, as
he advocates cross-strait conciliation and co-existence, according to Hsieh.</P>

      <P>Work to hunt down Chinese magpies in mountainous areas of central Taiwan in an
effort to protect Taiwan's endemic species has begun to bear fruit, Taichung
county government officials reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>So far this year, three adult Chinese magpies, four young and six eggs of the
species have been found by "ecological police" authorized by the Endemic Species
Research Institute (ESRI) under the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The captured birds have been temporarily housed at the ESRI headquarters before
being handed over to Taipei Zoo, the officials with the Taichung County
Department of Agriculture said.</P>
      <P>The sweeping action, sponsored by the ESRI, the COA Forestry Department and the
Taichung County Department of Agriculture, has been focusing on the Wulin area
in deep mountains of Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The department began hunting down the Chinese magpies over the last year after
receiving complaints by mountain climbers and wildlife conservationists that the
birds have often been spotted in the Wulin area and out of concern that their
growing numbers could pose a serious problem to the Formosan blue magpie, which
is an endemic species.</P>
      <P>Chinese magpies were reportedly spotted for the first time in 2002 in the area.</P>
      <P>Since sightings have continued to be reported despite the capture of some birds,
the officials said the hunt will continue.</P>
      <P>Magpies, whose chattering is said to signify good news, is a symbol of happiness
in Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Adult Formosan blue magpies have steel blue coloring on their wings and shining-
black crests, while the Chinese magpies have white crests.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved Wednesday a package of draft acts and bills and
agreed to earmark NT$100 billion (US$3 billion) to reform rural areas in the
coming 10 years.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced the passage of the draft acts and bills
during a weekly Cabinet meeting and called on the Legislative Yuan to screen
them and give its final approval as soon as possible to help the Executive Yuan
step up its pace of improving the people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to live up to its promises to take care of the needs of
the underprivileged and boost development in rural regions, Chang said, the
government will do its utmost to improve infrastructure in the countryside and
upgrade the living standards of rural residents.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan approves the measures, the government estimated that
public infrastructure in some 4,000 farming villages can be improved and more
than 500,000 houses in such villages can be renovated, he said.</P>
      <P>With the completion  of the high-speed  railway  and more expressways, the
increasingly comprehensive traffic network can more effectively connect city
centers and rural areas around the country, he said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will also allow more farmland to be rezoned for  constructing
high-end,  low-population  density  residency communities as long as doing so
will not hobble agricultural production and the rural environment, he went on.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the weekly Executive Yuan meeting, Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh said that NT$50 billion is
budgeted to subsidize reforms and build farmhouses, while another NT$50 billion
will be used for improving or constructing infrastructure in rural areas.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, at least 10,000 hectares of farmland across the country will be
rezoned in a decade for residential communities of at least 25 hectares each.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns over profiteering from land speculation,  Ho
replied that the government  will set strict thresholds for buyers wishing to
purchase farmland plots.</P>
      <P>If house developers fail to use land plots they have purchased within a certain
time limit, the government will be entitled to rescind their land development
rights and open fresh bids to search for new developers, she said.</P>

      <P>Relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong have been on the wane since the former
British colony was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a former Taiwan
representative to Hong Kong reportedly told a Hong Kong media outlet Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng An-kuo, former managing director of the Chung Hwa Travel Service -- the de
facto Taiwan liaison office in Hong Kong in the absence of formal bilateral
relations -- was quoted by the online Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Co.  as
saying that despite ever-closer private sector exchanges, overall ties have
regressed over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Cheng attributed the regression mainly to the facts that the Hong Kong
authorities have been lukewarm about cementing ties with Taiwan and the lack of
an efficient channel of contact between the two sides, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that after Hong Kong's transition, the number of Hong Kong students
seeking education  in Taiwan has also declined noticeably -- down from over
3,000 10 years ago to fewer than 900.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted some Taiwan businessmen as telling the broadcasting
company that after Hong Kong's transition, official ties between Taiwan and Hong
Kong became cooler and cooler and many Taiwanese businessmen chose to invest in
China as a result of "warmer and warmer" hospitality  that they received  from
the Chinese authorities.</P>

Communications  and Information  Technology Dayanidhi Maran and Minister of
Commerce and Industry Kamal Nath on the need to enhance cooperation in the

    <HEADLINE>`NO NEED TO OVERSPECULATE' ON BRIBERY SCANDALS: DPP LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is "no need to overspeculate" that lawmakers took bribes from the Taiwan
Dental Association (TDA) now that prosecutors are looking into the matter, a
lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, made the remarks after a
special investigation  unit under the Supreme Prosecutors Office raided a day
earlier 21 dental associations around the country and questioned 27 people,
including Nantou County Speaker Wu Chi-hsiang, a former executive director of
the Taiwan Dental Association, and Chen Shih-chung, vice minister of the
Department of Health (DOH) and a former president of the Taipei Dental
Association.</P>
      <P>The unit launched the raid after being tipped off that the TDA, fearing that the
second-generation national health insurance program might not cover dental care,
promoted an oral health bill that cleared the legislature in April 2003.</P>
      <P>The TDA solicited funds from its members to lobby for the passage of the bill
and investigators suspect that some funds might have been used as rewards for a
legislator identified only as Lai and his colleagues, while some might have
lined the pockets of TDA officials, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Ker, a lawmaker with a dental background, claimed that the bill "was never
controversial and had no interests involved. Now that the special investigation
unit has begun to probe the matter, there is no need to overspeculate or make
judgment."</P>
      <P>He also said that after the passage of the political donation law in 2004, any
groups can contribute as long as they comply with the regulations, adding that
the DPP is more concerned about political parties' donations to candidates.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lin Chin-hsin, who is a practicing doctor, claimed that it is
"only natural" that medical groups will chip in for legislators with medical
backgrounds during elections because they hope that the legislators would push
for bills relevant to their interests.</P>
      <P>"But if some legislators receive money for the passage of a specific bill, then
that is illegal," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator William Lai said he never received any illicit money
to help the passage of a bill during his three terms as a legislator.</P>
      <P>Lai said the oral health bill received the support of the DOH and that he
reviewed the bill in a professional way at the time. "Since no other lawmakers
had different views, its passage was only natural," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that coming from a medical background, he has received donations from
his friends in the medical sector for years, adding that he would have to check
which medical groups offered support when the oral health bill was passed four
years ago.</P>

      <P>The production  value of Taiwan's optoelectronics industry is expected to reach
NT$1.46 trillion (US$45 billion) this year, accounting for 14 percent of the
global share, according to statistics released Wednesday by the organizers of
the Photonics Festival Taiwan 2007.</P>
      <P>The Photonics  Festival Taiwan 2007,  which comprises  the International
Optoelectronic Exposition, LED Lighting Taiwan and Solar Taiwan, began that same
day at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>Several government officials and industrial  representatives attended the
opening ceremony of the event, which is being organized by the Photonics
Industry and Technology Development Association (PIDA), the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA), and the Taipei Computer Association (TCA).</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chao-yi, director-general of the Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the production of Taiwan's
optoelectronics industry totalled NT$1.27 trillion in 2006, with both the value
of its production and global share surpassing that of South Korea, Taiwan's
biggest competitor in this regard.</P>
      <P>Tai Chien, vice chairman of National Science Council (NSC) expressed hope that
the Photonics Festival can be combined with Computex Taipei, which was touted as
the world's second largest information technology products exhibition, in a bid
to further strengthen its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Noting that the optoelectronics industry is a key item that will help Taiwan
reduce its unemployment rate and make the nation's scientific parks grow
rapidly, Tai urged Taiwanese optoelectronics entrepreneurs to boost both
production and research and investigation amid strong competition from South
Korea.</P>
      <P>A total of 304 companies from around the world are participating in the
Photonics Festival, which will continue until June 16.</P>
      <P>As a sideline of the festival, the organizers will present a number of seminars
and conferences for the visitors, including a speech by Shuji Nakamura,  the
Japanese inventor of the blue light-emitting diode (LED), who is expected to
talk about the newest blue LED and LD technology.</P>
      <P>Seventeen LED experts from around the world, including Japan, the United States
and China, will also be invited to deliver speeches on LED technological
developments, market trends and patent issues.</P>
      <P>The organizers will for the first time hold a forum on thin film photovoltaic
(PV) products, in which foreign experts will be invited to share with
participants Germany's experience in developing solar power and elevating the
efficiency of solar cells.</P>

      <P>In response to a report that more of Taiwan's civil airline pilots will choose
to work for China-based carriers, a government official in charge said Wednesday
that it is a personal matter and that the government respects their career
development choices.</P>
      <P>Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) Director-General Billy K. C. Chang made
the comments after the Taiwan Civil Aviation Pilots Association revealed that
some 18 Taiwanese airline pilots are planning to work for China-based aviation
companies in the near term, possibly including Sichuan Airlines,  Shenzhen
AirLines, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the CAA fully respects civil airplane pilots' personal career
development plans, Chang said that they are free to choose to work for home-
based or foreign-based aviation companies.</P>
      <P>According to the association, salaries provided by China-based carriers are
quite attractive  to Taiwan pilots,  taking into consideration the cheaper
living costs in China and additional special monthly allowances provided by
Chinese aviation companies.</P>
      <P>It was understood that the 18 Taiwan pilots planning to work for Chinese
airlines will be offered a monthly salary of 60,000 yuan.</P>
      <P>Through the association's arrangement, eight pilots from several Taiwan-based
aviation companies opted in 2005 to work for Sichuan Airlines.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's civilian pilots have long been unhappy with the low monthly salaries
provided by local carriers compared to those enjoyed by their foreign
counterparts who receive an average monthly pay of at least US$10,000, in
addition to other benefits, according to association officials.</P>
      <P>The association has been pushing for the enactment of a "civil airplane pilot
law" with an aim of redressing the imbalance and addressing local pilots' rights
and interests, they explained.</P>

      <P>If you were able to work for 8.1 years consecutively without spending any money,
you might be able to purchase a house in Taipei, the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that average house prices were 8.1 times greater than the
average annual income in Taipei during the first quarter of this year, compared
with 6.6 times nationwide.</P>
      <P>Although the 8.1 times figure in Taipei may seem high, it is a decrease from 8.8
times the previous quarter, showing that house buyers have become more cautious
in purchasing houses.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University professor Chang Chin-oh said that housing loans
accounted, on average, for 29.9 percent of monthly income in the first quarter
of this year in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Both house prices and loans in Taipei were the highest among all cities and
counties in Taiwan, said Chang, noting that housing loans accounted for 37.1
percent of monthly incomes in the first quarter of this year in Taipei.</P>

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 57-year dog owner, surnamed Wu, did not have his door completely closed Jan.

a passing woman. The woman, who was injured on her left leg, filed a law suit

      <P>According to the ruling of Taipei District Court, Wu should have been aware that
dogs are aggressive in certain situations, and that owners should therefore
leash their dogs or muzzle them to prevent their animals from assaulting others.</P>
      <P>The judge found that the owner was responsible for failing to attend to his
dog's situation. However, the detention sentence can be commuted to a fine, at

Gunmen of rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah sharply escalated their
fight for supremacy on Tuesday, with Hamas taking over much of the northern Gaza
Strip in what is beginning to look increasingly like a civil war.

Five days of revenge attacks on individuals X including executions, kneecappings
and even tossing handcuffed prisoners off tall apartment towers X on Tuesday
turned into something larger and more organized: attacks on symbols of power and
the deployment of military units. About 25 Palestinians were killed and more

Wall Street Journal:How Blackstone's Chief Became $7 Billion Man

Stephen Schwarzman, who stands 5-foot-6, describes himself as a scrappy "little
man" who finds ways to win. When he pursues deals as the chief executive of
Blackstone Group, he says, he wants to "inflict pain" on and "kill off" his
rivals.

Later this month, the giant buyout firm intends to go public, offering many
investors their first opportunity to share the kill. If there was ever a doubt
about what investors will be buying, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
Monday cleared that up: Mr. Schwarzman utterly dominates the firm. He stands to
pocket as much as $677.2 million, and will retain a 23% stake in Blackstone,
likely to be worth more than $7.5 billion. enditem</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD ACT AS APEC MODEL IN MARKET OPENNESS: FORMER PREMIER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opening is the only way for Taiwan to have endless energy in promoting economic
development, therefore Taiwan should  try to open its market to all Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to display support for an APEC proposal for
a free trade area of the Asia Pacific (FTAAP) , former Premier Vincent Siew said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should try to act as a model in regional organization in the field of
market openness, said Siew, who is chairman of the Taipei-based Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research (CIER) , in a speech to the Taipei International
Economic and Trade Forum, held by the Importers and Exporters Association of
Taipei (IEAT).</P>
      <P>In the speech titled the "History and Future Prospects of Taiwan's Trade
Development, " Siew said the government should be aggressive and active in
opening doors to foreign investors and should make efforts to turn Taiwan into
the largest free trade zone in the world.</P>
      <P>Reviewing Taiwan's economic development over the past 300 years, Siew said
Taiwan began its foreign trading practices in the 17th century, when the Dutch
colonized the island. In those days, deerskins and sugar were exported in
massive amounts.</P>
      <P>Since then, Siew went on, foreign trade has been the water on which Taiwan
depends for survival.</P>
      <P>Taiwan created many economic miracles before China announced an opening and
reform-oriented policy in 1978. "While it (China) slept, we (Taiwan) ran, " Siew
said, adding that Taiwan had taken good advantage of development opportunities
during the era of a closed China.</P>
      <P>Addressing economic development in East Asia, Siew brought up the "flying-geese"
model, that originated from a view of Japanese scholars upon technological
development in Southeast Asia, looking at Japan as a leading power. He said
countries in the region have built a highly professional industrial
manufacturing network, with each of them making different contributions to the
network.</P>
      <P>The lead goose in this pattern is Japan, while the second-tier of nations
consists of South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong. After these two groups come the
emerging countries including China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has to continue its opening to secure its position in the flying-geese
line as the second important provider of key parts and components in Asia to the
global manufacturing sector following Japan, in the face of strong competition
from China, Siew said, advising Taiwan to secure key technologies by continuing
to seek technological upgrading and innovation.</P>
      <P>The economic forum was attended by representatives of the IEAT's sister
organizations in Britain, the United States and South Korea, as well as those of
Japanese and domestic business groups.</P>

      <P>Main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's
political donation case has been closed by the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office, according to a press release issued by the Taipei District Court
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the case was closed by prosecutor Chou Shih-yu Feb. 24,
2007, a move approved by the former Chief Prosecutor Yen Ta-ho. Therefore, the
case will not be transferred for trial at the Taipei District Court.</P>
      <P>The case stemmed from a complaint made by ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator Hsu Chia-chin who claimed that Ma Ying-jeou last November had
received illegal political funding during his run for the KMT chairmanship in
2005.</P>
      <P>Although Ma spent more than NT$20 million (US$605, 345) on campaign advertising,
Hsu claimed Ma's personal assets increased NT$4.4 million in that year. She
accused Ma of accepting electoral donations, which is not allowed while running
for party chairman because the position is not a part of the civil service.</P>
      <P>The Taipei District Court's statement said the prosecutor closed the case on the
ground that the allegations, even proved to be true, are punishable by
administrative sanctions and do not constitute a criminal case.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's efforts to combat human trafficking have been recognized but it must
demonstrate greater political will in dealing with the problem, the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Wednesday in a statement after the release of the
U.S. State Department's 2007 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.</P>
      <P>For 2007, Taiwan is classified as a "Tier 2" country and has been removed from a
U.S. watch list because of its significant efforts to eliminate trafficking, the
AIT said, adding that the most notable achievements are "the development of
Taiwan's first comprehensive plan of action that covers all forms of human
trafficking, plus the formation of an inter-ministerial committee to implement
the plan in coordination with non-governmental organizations."</P>
      <P>It pointed out, however, that trafficking victims should be granted formal
protection, including access to justice, in order to obtain compensation from
those who have exploited them, while victims should also have the right to work
while awaiting the outcome of court cases.</P>
      <P>It called for the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to stop addressing instances of
involuntary servitude with administrative penalties.  Instead,  it should refer
such cases for criminal investigation and possible prosecution. It also said the
Taiwan authorities should do more to eliminate the ability of labor brokers and
employers to deport workers against their will.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was placed on the list of "Tier 1" countries in the 2003 and 2004 reports
but was downgraded to "Tier 2" in the 2005 report. In 2006, Taiwan was placed on
the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully complying with the minimum standards for
the elimination of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>AIT said it will continue to increase public awareness of the suffering caused
by trafficking by working with Taiwan officials and non-government
organizations.</P>

      <P>More than 30 Asian correspondents from foreign media organizations visited
National Sun Yat-Sen University in southern port city of Kaohsiung Tuesday to
discuss elections as well as social and economic issues in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-cheng, dean of the university's Graduate Institute of Social Sciences,
Assistant Professor Liu Cheng-shan of the Graduate Institute of Political
Science and the city's Bureau of Urban Development Director-General Lin Chin-
rong exchanged their views with the representatives.</P>
      <P>Speaking on last year's Kaohsiung mayoral election, Liu said that in order to
improve the accuracy of opinion polls, the pollsters should ask those
interviewed which local TV station rather than which candidate they like most.</P>
      <P>During the mayoral election, many polls showed greater voter support for the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) candidate, so the outcome came as a surprise,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>This indicates that the polls were very inaccurate, according to Liu, who
claimed that polls conducted by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
were the most accurate.</P>
      <P>Expressing his views on voter preference in southern Taiwan, Lin Chin-rong said
that previous KMT national administrations focused their policies on the
development of the capital, Taipei.</P>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, DPP candidate for the 2008 presidential election, said that more
government resources should be allocated to southern Taiwan, an issue expected
to draw the attention of southern voters, Lin Chin-rong said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the foreign media's concern with the military standoff between
Taiwan and China, Lin Wen-cheng said that there is no denying that China has a
greater military power than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, as long as the people of Taiwan, across political spectrum, are united
he does not think that China will attempt to take over Taiwan, Lin Wen- cheng
noted, while adding that he believes no one in Taiwan will purposefully provoke
China.</P>

      <P>Eight college students from Costa Rica may continue their studies in Taiwan on
scholarships provided by the Republic of China government despite the recent
termination of diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lee Tian-shiang, vice president of Kung Shan University of Technology in Tainan
County, said that the eight students from Costa Rica will be able to carry on
with their studies at the university despite recent events.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, officials with the International Cooperation and Development
Fund (ICDF) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed a willingness to
continue providing university scholarships to the Costa Rican students during a
recent meeting to discuss their status.</P>
      <P>Before that meeting, the university was ready to offer its own scholarships to
the Costa Rican students so as to help them complete their studies, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although  Costa Rica and Taiwan  last week severed  their 63-year-old diplomatic
partnership, ICDF officials said that the ROC government was poised to continue
assisting these students and help them complete their academic pursuits in
Taiwan as part of its efforts to maintain good links between the private sectors
of the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to ICDF officials, the scholarships are provided to help Taiwan's
diplomatic partners educate their students and train them to acquire
professional skills to better serve their homelands.</P>
      <P>After learning the good news, the eight Costa Rican students held up banners and
posters expressing their love for Taiwan, the ICDF and the university, vowing to

    <HEADLINE>AIT URGES TAIWAN TO DEAL BETTER WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei June 13 (CNA)
06/14/07  10:48:27

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to combat human trafficking have been recognized but it must
demonstrate greater political will in dealing with the problem, the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said Wednesday in a statement after the release of the
U.S. State Department's 2007 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.</P>
      <P>For 2007, Taiwan is classified as a "Tier 2" country and has been removed from a
U.S. watch list because of its significant efforts to eliminate trafficking, the
AIT said, adding that the most notable achievements are "the development of
Taiwan's first comprehensive plan of action that covers all forms of human
trafficking, plus the formation of an inter-ministerial committee to implement
the plan in coordination with non-governmental organizations."</P>
      <P>It pointed out, however, that trafficking victims should be granted formal
protection, including access to justice, in order to obtain compensation from
those who have exploited them, while victims should also have the right to work
while awaiting the outcome of court cases.</P>
      <P>It called for the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to stop addressing instances of
involuntary servitude with administrative penalties.  Instead,  it should refer
such cases for criminal investigation and possible prosecution. It also said the
Taiwan authorities should do more to eliminate the ability of labor brokers and
employers to deport workers against their will.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was placed on the list of "Tier 1" countries in the 2003 and 2004 reports
but was downgraded to "Tier 2" in the 2005 report. In 2006, Taiwan was placed on
the "Tier 2 Watch List" for not fully complying with the minimum standards for
the elimination of human trafficking.</P>
      <P>AIT said it will continue to increase public awareness of the suffering caused
by trafficking by working with Taiwan officials and non-government
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Swiss authorities Wednesday returned to Taiwan US$34 million in frozen bank
deposits believed to be illicit kickbacks connected to the purchase of six
Lafayette-class frigates from France in 1991, Swiss officials said.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Swiss Department of Justice said the returned funds belonged to
two different holders but declined to identify them.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that according to Switzerland's Federal Act on International
Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, frozen capital assets can be released to
foreign authorities if the assets are evidently related to criminal activities.</P>
      <P>The funds were handed over to Taiwanese authorities on the condition that the
legal proceedings against the two concerned persons would comply with human
rights principles, they said.</P>
      <P>The sum is part of a total of US$520 million that Taiwan has sought to recover
from a number of frozen Swiss bank accounts belonging to several Taiwanese
holders involved in the scandal, including fugitive arms broker Andrew Wang and
members of his family, as well as former naval officer Kuo Li-heng and his
brother Kuo Wen-tien.</P>
      <P>Proceedings for the retrieval of the remaining funds are still underway, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Wang, the French arms supplier Thompson-CSF's agent in Taiwan, fled the country
following the death of Navy Capt. Yin Ching-feng under suspicious circumstances
in late 1993. Yin is believed to have been poised to blow the whistle on
colleagues who had allegedly received kickbacks from the Lafayette deal. Wang
has been wanted by Taiwan authorities on a murder charge since September 2000.</P>
      <P>Concluding a second-phase investigation into the arms procurement scandal in
September 2006, a special judicial panel in Taiwan indicted Wang and his wife,
Yeh Hsiu-chen, as well as their four children and the Kuo brothers on charges of
collecting illicit kickbacks from the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>According to the indictment, the Wangs opened more than 60 bank accounts in
Europe and Asia to launder US$520 million in illicit gains from the deal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to seek legal assistance from the Swiss government in 2001 in an
attempt to retrieve the funds frozen in several Swiss banks.</P>
      <P>Through a judicial aid agreement with Switzerland,  Taiwan prosecutors managed
to acquire a collection of bank files from a Swiss federal judge in November
2005. After nearly 10 months of close examination of the files, Taiwan
petitioned in September 2006 for the return of US$520 million from a total of
US$730 million frozen in the Swiss banks.</P>

      <P>China's missile programs are posing challenges to the United States and are
changing the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, a Pentagon official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Richard Lawless, deputy undersecretary of defense for Asia and Pacific affairs,
made the remarks while answering questions during a House Arms Services
Committee hearing on China's recent security developments.</P>
      <P>Citing an annual report on China's military power released last month, Lawless
noted that there are at least 10 varieties of ballistic missiles deployed or in
development in China, including over 900 short-range ballistic missiles in
garrisons opposite Taiwan with a capability of threatening Taiwan's defense and
disrupting the island's infrastructure.</P>
      <P>"I think that these are challenges that are being presented to our ballistic
missile programs, " Lawless said, adding that this year's military power report
discusses the threat facing Taiwan and how the United  States believes  the
threat is changing  the cross-strait status quo and creating a new dynamic in
the region.</P>
      <P>Lawless said China has made substantial progress in fielding road-mobile, solid-
propellant DF-31 intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs)  and
continued modernization of its sea-based deterrent with the JL-2 submarine-
launched ballistic missile (SLBM) program.</P>
      <P>"These changes will bring greater range, mobility, accuracy and survivability to
China's strategic forces capable of striking many areas of the world, including
the continental United States, " Lawless said.</P>
      <P>He said China's armed forces are rapidly developing capabilities designed to
coerce or compel a settlement of the cross-strait dispute while simultaneously
deterring,  delaying or denying effective intervention from a third party,
including the United States.</P>
      <P>Long-term  trends also suggest  that Beijing is generating capabilities  to
employ  military  force  for  other  regional contingencies, such as conflict
over resources or territory, he said.</P>
      <P>While China's nuclear force modernization is enhancing the People's Liberation
Army's capabilities for strategic strikes beyond the Asia-Pacific theater,
China's continued pursuit of anti-access and area denial strategies is expanding
from traditional land, sea and air dimensions of the modern battlefield to
include space and cyber space, Lawless said.</P>

      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials reminded members of the general
public Thursday to be aware of the new anti-terrorist measures adopted by the
British government when they apply for U.K. visas.</P>
      <P>According to the British representative office in Taiwan, U.K. visa applicants
of all nationalities will have to have their fingerprints and digital photos
taken at their visa application offices starting from July 26 as part of the new
anti-terrorist measures the British government has adopted worldwide.</P>
      <P>British officials stationed in Taipei said they have also implemented this
measure in 64 other countries.</P>
      <P>Sung Wen-cheng, deputy director-general of the MOFA's Department of European

government and apply for visas in advance to prevent any delays in their U.K.

      <P>As to whether other European countries will follow suit, Sung said that Germany
has been considering such a measure but that it has yet to impose the
requirement after the MOFA notified German authorities that doing so would cause

    <HEADLINE>'MUTUAL NON-DENIAL' IDEA NAIVE, FANCIFUL: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian derided as "naive, fanciful and ignorant nonsense"
Thursday a "mutual non-denial" idea that opposition Kuomintang presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou has put forward as a first step toward ending the cross-
Taiwan Strait political impasse.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Ma's proposal, made on the second day of a visit to India
Wednesday to promote bilateral trade between Taiwan and the world's most
populous democracy, Chen said he had "not the slightest idea" what Ma was
talking about.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a visit to grassroots representatives in the northern county of
Taoyuan, Chen said he does not know what Ma was talking about, claiming that
anything like "mutual non-denial" is simply a non-issue.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Ma is not in touch with reality if he expects China to let go
of its sovereignty claims on Taiwan, adding that while Taiwan recognizes China
as a nation, Beijing does not recognize Taiwan as a nation and mercilessly
suppresses Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Based on this backdrop, Chen said, there is no way the two sides could not deny
each other.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen appealed to the country to have faith in him and his
administration. He said many people believed his government would be toppled
when the anti-Chen  "red-clad  army" conducted  a round-the-clock sit-in in
front of the Presidential Office last year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen said, everything became "smooth and calm" after the protests,
proving his belief that democratic politics respects differing voices from
differing corners of society.</P>
      <P>Ma said during his India trip that if mutual recognition is impossible, mutual
non-denial may offer a way out, adding that the strategy might not be a
solution, but rather could be a preparatory step to resolving the differences
between China and Taiwan on the issue of the island's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Ma said the pragmatic approach to softening cross-strait tensions is to find a
mutually agreeable  middle ground and not keep fantasizing about de jure
independence. He was referring to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's goal
of establishing a "Taiwan Republic."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou arrived in
Singapore Thursday after wrapping up a whirlwind two-day visit to India.</P>
      <P>Ma told Taiwanese reporters  covering his two-leg overseas campaign tour that
his visits to India, a South Asian major power, and Singapore, a major Southeast
Asian economic powerhouse, reflect his broad vision in policy planning.</P>
      <P>Shortly  after his arrival in the city-state,  Ma visited Singapore's Maritime
and Port Authority, where he was briefed on the country's cargo transshipment
management.</P>
      <P>Noting that the port of Singapore tops all other Asian harbors in container
handling volume, Ma said Taiwan has much to learn from Singapore in sharpening
its competitiveness  in cargo shipping services.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former KMT chairman and two-term mayor of Taipei from 1998 through 2006,
was also scheduled to look into Singapore's casino management and visit some
major trade unions before concluding his visit Friday.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Ma was to meet later Thursday with Singapore Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. Ma refused to confirm the
reports and instead said he would meet with "old friends" for exchanges of views
on the general Asia-Pacific situation and the promotion of Taiwan-Singapore
relations.</P>
      <P>During his India visit,  Ma met with Indian Minister  of Communications  and
Information  Technology Dayanidhi Maran and Minister of Commerce and Industry
Kamal Nath to discuss the feasibility of enhancing bilateral cooperation in the
information and communications technology (ITC) industry.</P>
      <P>Ma also gave a speech titled "The Role of Taiwan's Economy in Regional and
International Environment" at the Indian Council of World Affairs, India's most
prestigious private think tank. His audience included India's incumbent and
former foreign affairs officials, according to Ma's aides.</P>
      <P>Ma's second day itinerary  in India included  a visit to Nationalist Congress
Party leader Dr. Karan Singh and a meeting with Rajnath Singh, chairman of the
largest opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of his India visit, Ma said Taiwan should consider operating
flights serving the route between Taiwan and Chennai -- India's technology
stronghold which also hosts a large number of Taiwanese businessmen -- to bring
convenience for future cooperation. He expressed hope that his two-day visit
will contribute to bilateral relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A controversial pastor who has spent time in jail for sexual molestation was
questioned by police Thursday after he was accused by several female followers
of sexually assaulting them, according to police.</P>
      <P>Police raided the church of Pastor Tang Tai-sheng, 60, in Chungli, Taoyuan
County and arrested him a day earlier, but he refused to answer questions at the
time.</P>
      <P>During Thursday's questioning, Tang denied any wrongdoing. Faced with the media
outside the police station, he said only that "it is God's will." Police have
turned the case over to the Taoyuan Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>Police also summoned eight female section chiefs in the church as witnesses. The
eight are said to be in charge of recruiting senior high school students or
college freshmen in front of bookstores to join the church.</P>
      <P>Police even arranged for two female pastors to talk to the eight chiefs one by
one, in the hope of learning more about the case.</P>
      <P>The women said they had full confidence in Tang, with some saying they had
followed Tang since they were senior high school students. They dismissed media
reports that Tang, under the cover of "sex counseling, " had fondled his female
followers or sexually assaulted them.</P>
      <P>All eight women said they suspected that Tang's accusers have a "private
vendetta" against him.</P>
      <P>Chen Pi-er, Tang's wife, said she has every confidence in her husband, and
claimed that all accusations against Tang have been "unfounded."</P>
      <P>Quiet a few followers went to the church for classes Wednesday evening, saying
that they believe Tang is innocent.</P>
      <P>Tang was first accused of impropriety during "sexual counselling" in 1999.
Prosecutors raided his home and church and found evidence that he had victimized
at least 300 women.</P>
      <P>After a long litigation process, the court gave its final verdict in 2004,
sentencing him to a prison term of three years and two months and ordering that
he undergo compulsory therapy for a maximum of three years. Tang was released in
2005, returned to his Taoyuan church and ceased the therapy.</P>

      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a KMT lawmaker and director of the party's Policy
Coordination  Committee,  said  that the matter  fully demonstrates the DPP's
ineptitude. "As the ruling party, how could the DPP paralyze the parliament with
such a farce?" he asked.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Hsu Shao-ping accused the DPP of "foul play" by
mounting such a trick a day before the Legislative Yuan is to screen the 2007
central government budget bill -- a bill that has been stonewalled by the KMT
for over six months and that the DPP has been eager to push through the
legislature.</P>
      <P>According to KMT lawmaker Pan Wei-kang, Chen's proposal to topple the Cabinet
fully reflects "the fact" that DPP lawmakers themselves are dissatisfied with
Chang. She accused the DPP of seeking to paralyze the Legislative Yuan and pass
the buck to the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First
Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Chen proposed a no-confidence vote May 29 to topple the Cabinet given that the
KMT and the PFP have deliberately boycotted the passage of several key bills,
including the annual budget bill, in an attempt to exchange for the passage of a
KMT-PFP proposed draft bill concerning the formation of the Central Election
Commission (CEC) , which the DPP strongly  opposes  on the ground of "violating
constitutional provisions."</P>
      <P>To highlight  the procrastinated  partisan standoff in the Legislative Yuan,
Chen said last week that he would initiate the no-confidence vote if the DPP's
legislative caucus refuses to do so.</P>
      <P>Chen's no-confidence proposal was endorsed by 74 lawmakers, most of them from
the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), surpassing the legal
threshold of one-third approval -- or 73 lawmakers -- to make it a motion for
the lawmakers to vote on within five days.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by DPP legislative caucus whips, Chen announced the withdrawal of
the proposal after the 74 lawmakers who signed the petition pulled out their
endorsement.</P>
      <P>Chen decided to rescind the proposal after being fiercely attacked by his DPP
peers earlier in the day, who accused him of "individualism" and "upsetting
party unity" for failing to have discussed the issue with them and the party
caucus before putting forward the proposal.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Wang Sing-nan also criticized Chen's move, saying
that launching a no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet at this point will
only create a constitutional crisis now that the "pan-blue alliance " has in
recent days agreed to allow the budget bill to pass the legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang asked Chen to withdraw the proposal 15 minutes after Chen submitted it upon
learning that all DPP and TSU lawmakers who endorsed the petition had pulled out
their signatures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>European Parliament-Taiwan Friendship Group Chairman Georg Jarzembowski urged
Germany, the European Union (EU)'s rotating president Wednesday to keep striving
for Taiwan's "meaningful participation" in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski, a German member of the European Parliament, also urged the EU to
make a request to WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to set up a center in
Taiwan in order to help Taiwanese people prevent and fight epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's application for full WHO membership under the name "Taiwan" was refused
by the World Health Assembly (WHA) this year because of China's obstruction,
Jarzembowski said, adding that the EU president's stance of supporting Taiwan's
"meaningful participation" was therefore turned down.</P>
      <P>The "meaningful participation" of Taiwan in the WHO means taking part in
technical-level  meetings under the framework  of the International Health
Regulations, joining the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and partaking in WHO-sponsored meetings
on food sanitation, avian flu and tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Jarzembowski said the EU supported Taiwan's application by quoting a principle
of the WHO Constitution that says "the enjoyment of the highest attainable
standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being."</P>
      <P>The European Parliament has been very supportive of Taiwan's participation in
the WHO and has voted many times to support Taiwan's WHA observer status, with
the last vote being a resolution passed May 18, 2006, Jarzembowski said.</P>

      <P>Ten Taiwanese companies will exhibit at the New York Licensing 2007
International June 19 - 21, and set their eyes on bringing in record-breaking
profits through licensing of cultural products and quality peripherals, the
National Science Council (NSC) and National Digital Archive Program (NDAP),
organizers of the Taiwan Pavilion said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Through collaboration between government agencies and industry, it is hoped that
the culture  industry  will become  another "trillion-dollar industry" for
Taiwan, NSC Deputy Minister Tai Chein said during a press conference introducing
products from ten exhibiting companies.</P>
      <P>This is the third straight year that Taiwanese companies have entered the annual
fair, and there have been impressive results in the previous exhibitions, said
Liu Tsui-jung, the NADP head who also serves as Vice President of Academia

million and NT$390 million at the global licensing fair in 2005 and 2006,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The ten exhibiting companies will appear in two major categories -- licensing of
brand names and innovative brand names -- with five companies each category.
Exhibitors  created various artworks, animations, characters, figurines, cartoon
images and merchandise, using either digital archives provided by the NADP or
their own original creations.</P>
      <P>Licensing  International,  which  is approaching  its  27th anniversary, is one

more than 500 exhibiting companies have been offered for licensing, realizing
potential profits of more than US$170 billion.</P>

Two explosions on Wednesday that appeared to have been set by Sunni extremists
with links to Al Qaeda toppled the twin golden minarets that were most of what
remained of one of Iraqs most revered Shiite shrines after a devastating bombing
by Al Qaeda last year.

That bombing 16 months ago proved a watershed, engulfing the country in a wave
of sectarian killing that pushed Sunnis and Shiites toward civil war. With
American and Iraqi forces unable to restrain soaring levels of killing that saw
as many as 3,000 Iraqi civilians dying every month by the end of 2006, President
Bush ordered nearly 30,000 additional American troops deployed here, aimed at
pulling the country back from the abyss.

Wireless phone carriers and the makers of hand- held gadgets like the BlackBerry

subscribers, putting it in the hands of millions. In turn, the carriers get to
charge their subscribers not just for voice but for pricier data service as
well.

Now, a turf war is looming between the two camps, as lucrative new services such
as video, games, and maps move onto mobile devices. Each camp wants to control

      <P>A Taiwanese man, who two years ago was recognized as a living, reincarnated
Buddha and given the holy title of The Third Tulku Palme Khyentse, is expected
to receive the first doctorate in Buddhism presented in Taiwan next month.</P>
      <P>Huang Ying-chieh, or the Third Tulku Palme Khyentse from the Palme Monastery of
China's Qinghai Province, has presented his doctoral thesis, an analysis and
survey on Buddhism's middle way, and is scheduled to sit an oral defense for his
doctorate, fielding questions from seven academics, at Huafan University on July
20.</P>
      <P>If he passes the oral test, Huang will be awarded the first Buddhism doctorate
from a Taiwanese institute, five years after the Ministry of Education permitted
local colleges to open departments of religions.</P>
      <P>Huang, 40, holds a bachelor of sociology from Fujen University. He has spent
most of his time during the past 10 years studying Tibetan Buddhism, shuttling
between Huafan University's Graduate Institute of Asian Studies and the
International Buddhism Institute in Nepal.</P>
      <P>In 1997, H.H. Sakya Trizin, the head of the Sakya Monastery in Qinghai, met
Huang during his first-ever visit to Taiwan. The leader of the Sakya school of
Tibetan Buddhism felt that Huang could be a reincarnated living Buddha, but he
never said so at the time.</P>
      <P>During Huang's every visit to Nepal, India and Singapore in the following years,
Sakya Trizin met him "accidentally, " and grew further amazed by Huang.</P>
      <P>Sakya Trizin submitted a proposal to H.H. Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche, the head of
the Drikung school of the Tibetan Buddhism, in 2004, saying that Huang was
likely to be the third reincarnated Palme Khyentse, the top man of the Palme
school.</P>
      <P>It took a year for Drikung Chetsang to recognize Huang. The verification process
included dreams, special feelings and written records handed down from the
Second Chetsang Drikung saying that the Third might be a "Han Chinese."</P>
      <P>H.H. Drikung Chetsang Rinpoche traveled to Taiwan in person in 2005 to ratify
Huang as the Third Tulku Palme Khyentse. The Tibetan word "tulku" means "a
reincarnated one."</P>
      <P>Huang has no idea why he has been involved in a Buddhist reincarnation system.
All he knows is that he has found Buddhism to be as important as his life since
he was first exposed to it.</P>
      <P>Huang's grandfather was a renowned calligrapher who wrote with brush for most of
the major Buddhism temples and monasteries around Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The labor participation rate of Taiwanese women has grown in recent years and
now ranks 35th in the world, a government report said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to analysis carried out by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), based on data compiled by the International
Institute for Management Development, the labor participation rate of Taiwanese
women increased to 42.45 percent last year, up from 40.45 percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Taiwan's ranking rose to 35th from 38th place, lagging
behind Thailand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, but outpacing Japan and South Korea,
the report showed.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies have been working on programs to help more women
find employment or open their own business, so as to meet strong demand for
manpower in many sectors, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, getting married and having children are the two major
factors most affecting women's willingness to work, the officials said, adding
that when sound social systems are in place, and society grants them equal
rights, women will be better able to take care of their families and work at the
same time.</P>
      <P>Against such a background, the issue of how to take advantage of women's power
to contribute to the workforce has been one of the focal points in the
government's human resources policy, which aims to create more job opportunities
for women and fully explore their workplace capabilities, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Judging from changes during the 1980-2006 period, Taiwanese women's labor
participation rates have steadily been rising, they said, pointing out that the
employment rate for married women with children under six years old doubled,
growing from 26 percent to 56 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS 2ND PHASE OF FINANCIAL REFORM NOT LINKED TO ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Thursday that the promotion of the second
phase of financial reform has nothing to do with the two major elections next
year.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks as he addressed the 60th anniversary of the
Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the reform is necessary, saying that it is a major policy of
the nation that aims at enhancing the international competitiveness of domestic
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Faced with criticism by some who allege that his decision to revive talks on
second phase of financial reform are a form of "election maneuvering, " he said
that "this couldn't be further away from the truth and is a vicious smear
campaign."</P>
      <P>Critics have lashed out at the financial reform, saying that several influential
family groups have benefited most from the merger of the financial institutes,
and that the government is providing them with astronomical financial gains,
from which it hopes to benefit in return during the elections.</P>
      <P>The president urged related government agencies to "continue on the right path
despite obstacles, " saying that "as long as they perform credibly, these
smearing campaigns will not stand.'</P>
      <P>He noted that a consensus  on creating a sound financial environment, including
the merger and the dissolution of financial institutions, had been reached at
two major national economic conferences.</P>
      <P>He said that the second phase of financial reforms will not only introduce
foreign financial expertise and products to Taiwan, but will also encourage
foreign enterprises to invest in domestic financial institutions or form
strategic alliances with them, which he said will raise the service quality of
domestic financial institutions to that of their international counterparts.</P>
      <P>"This kind of effort has nothing to do with the legislative or presidential
elections," the president stressed.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of financial reform, the government was able to achieve the
objectives of reducing the overdue loan ratios of domestic banks to below 5
percent and boosting their capital adequacy ratios to over 8 percent within two
years.</P>
      <P>The president announced in October 2004 the second phase of financial reforms,
setting the targets of halving the number of publicly-owned banks, helping at

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA PRESENTS NEW DRUGS FOR CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
06/14/07  22:03:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica -- Taiwan's top research institution -- has developed a new
immunotherapy for cancer, using newly-invented chemical compounds to enhance the
"targeted attacks" of natural killer T-cells (NKT) on cancer cells, sources at
the institution said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Most anti-cancer drugs come with distinct side-effects and often lead to the
development of drug resistance in patients, they noted, adding that by utilizing
NKT cells -- inherent components of the human immune system, the new method can
not only avoid the drawbacks of existing drugs but also avoid accidental damage
to normal cells.</P>
      <P>The compounds -- glycolipids with aromatic rings attached to the tail --  were
developed and tested by Chi-huey Wong --  the institution's  president,  Yu Lin-
tsing  --  a member  of the institution's Genomics Research Center, and Chang
Ya-jen -- a postdoctoral researcher at Yu's lab.</P>
      <P>The glycolipid drugs have proven effective in tests on rodents, prolonging  the
life expectancy of mice with lung cancer and inhibiting tumor growth rates by 75
percent in mice with breast cancer. The results were reported June 12 in the
Online Early Edition of the U.S.-based Proceedings of National Academy of
Sciences.</P>
      <P>According  to a press release from Academia  Sinica,  the inspiration behind the
development of cancer-curing compounds came from alpha- GalactosylCeramide
(alpha-GalCer), a material that exists in sponges, discovered by a Japanese beer
brewer in 1995.</P>
      <P>Alpha-GalCer was later found capable of boosting immune system and helpfully in
curing cancers. However, the most distinct effects occurred only during
experiments on rodents: in human tests, the effectiveness was limited because
substances induced by alpha-GalCer suppress immune functions and offset the
expected curing effects.</P>
      <P>Leaping forward from the experience drawn through the failure, the team led by
Chi-huey Wong first created 40 compounds based on the chemical characteristics
of alpha-GalCer and then attached aromatic rings to them to enhance the effects.</P>
      <P>After that,  these compounds  were sent to Yu Lin-tsing's laboratory for tests
in vitro and in vivo to determine which ones have the best curative effects.
Chang Ya-jen then examined the most promising compounds in the following tests
and proved some of them being even more effective than alpha-GalCer in fighting
lung and breast cancer cells on mice.</P>
      <P>While the drugs made from these compounds will soon enter multiple stages of
human testing, Academia Sinica has already filed patent applications for the
drugs in various countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES U.S. TO REAFFIRM 6 ASSURANCES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
06/14/07  23:47:28
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the United States Thursday to reaffirm at an
opportune time the "Six Assurances" it made to Taiwan in 1982 so as to
underscore that there has been no change in its stance on Taiwan's sovereign
status and prevent China from downgrading Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while meeting with Raymond Burghardt who, as the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) chairman, is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan
in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Chen told Burghardt, who arrived in Taipei Wednesday to inspect AIT operations
here, that the U.S. government's failure to insist on its support for Taiwan has
allowed the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) to alter Taiwan's status
in the body from a sovereign state to that of a non-sovereign regional member.</P>
      <P>Under pressure from China, the OIE passed a resolution at its annual conference
held in Paris last month which downgraded Taiwan's status to that of a non-
sovereign regional member and changed Taiwan's moniker in the organization from
"Taipei China" to "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>China originally pushed the OIE to change Taiwan's designation to "Taiwan,
China, " a title that implies Taiwan is under China's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Following  expressions  of grave  concern  from  the  Bush administration, Chen
said, the OIE later agreed to refer to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei, " a title that
Taiwan now uses in the International Olympic Games and doesn't imply Taiwan's
relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC).</P>
      <P>"Although we are not satisfied with the 'Chinese Taipei' title, we still very
much appreciate American assistance," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  Chen said it was regrettable that the U.S. government failed to
insist on its stance on Taiwan's sovereign status and eventually acquiesced in
the OIE's change of Taiwan's membership status at the world body.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, downgrading of Taiwan's status at the OIE violates the "Six
Assurances" the U.S. made to Taiwan in 1982. Those assurances include a promise
that the United States would not alter its position on the sovereignty of
Taiwan, which was that the question was one to be decided peacefully by the
Chinese themselves; that it would not pressure Taiwan to enter into negotiations
with China; and that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese
sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he earnestly hopes that the U.S. government can reaffirm at an
opportune time or in an opportune setting that its "Six Assurances" to Taiwan
remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said Taiwan looks forward to join the U.N. Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Regrettably, he said
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon rejected  Taiwan's  participation  and even
returned  Taiwan's application instrument.</P>
      <P>Even more outrageously, Chen said, Ban mentioned that the 1971 U.N. Resolution
No. 2758 recognized Taiwan as part of the PRC. That's a lie, Chen said,
insisting that Resolution 2758 didn't mention Taiwan's ties with the PRC. The
resolution only allowed Beijing to take the "China" seat at the expense of
Taipei.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, chen said the U.S. "one China" policy,
including its Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, and the Six Assurances of 1982,
never recognizes Taiwan as part of the PRC.</P>
      <P>During his talks with the AIT chairman, Chen also said that he will never back
off the "four noes" pledge he made in his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses to
the U.S. government and the whole world.</P>
      <P>Chen's now famous "four noes" pledge refers to a promise that so long as China
has no intention to use force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, not change Taiwan's title or national flag, not enshrine in the
Constitution the "two state" notion in addressing cross-Taiwan Strait relation
and not hold a "unification  versus  independence"  referendum  to change  the
cross-strait status quo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHIEF REAFFIRMS U.S. DEFENSE COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond F. Burghardt said
Thursday that the U.S. government attaches great importance to its relations
with Taiwan because it is committed to helping with Taiwan's defense.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Burghardt said it is very important for both sides to
maintain constant dialogue and communications while dutifully keeping their
communications transparent.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who as the AIT chief is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties, made the remarks  after meeting  with a
number of Taiwanese  political heavyweights, including President Chen Shui-bian,
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>President Chen told Burghardt that he looks forward to seeing the U.S.
government reaffirms its "Six Assurances" to Taiwan and thereby underscore that
there has been no change in its stance on Taiwan's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>The "Six Assurances" made by the Reagan administration to Taiwan in 1982 include
that the United States would not set a date for termination of arms sales to
Taiwan; not alter the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act; not consult with China
in advance before making decisions about U.S. arms sales to Taiwan; not mediate
between Taiwan and China; not alter its position about the sovereignty of
Taiwan; and not pressure Taiwan to enter into negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who arrived in Taiwan Wednesday to inspect AIT operations and get
first-hand information about Taiwan's latest developments, didn't make a direct
response to Chen's request. Instead he said he expects the Taiwan government's
long-stalled 2007 budget bill to clear the legislature soon.</P>
      <P>The budget bill includes partial funding for the acquisition of U.S.-built
submarine-hunting aircraft, the upgrading of the country's Patriot missiles and
the financing of a feasibility study as a first step toward purchasing diesel-
electric submarines.</P>
      <P>Burghardt said the passage of the budget bill is very important for fulfilling
U.S. commitment to aid Taiwan's defense. The United States is the only country
in the world that maintains security commitment to Taiwan, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS RAID EMG OVER SUSPECTED FINANCIAL SCANDALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Law enforcement officers searched the headquarters of Eastern Multimedia Group
(EMG) and other relevant premises Thursday as they probed the group's role in a
spate of suspected financial irregularities.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  led nearly  200 agents  from  the Bureau  of Investigation's
outposts in northern Taiwan cities and counties to search the EMG-related
premises and EMG Chairman Gary Wang's home for evidence of suspected corruption
and financial crimes.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lin Chin-tsun of the Taipei Prosecutor's Office said the EMG is
suspected of involvement in several scandals, including an alleged corruption
scandal involving its acquisition of the rights to operate the Taipei Arena, a
multi functional stadium built by the Taipei city government at a cost of NT$4.7
billion (US$142.42 million).</P>
      <P>EMG secured a nine-year contract to operate the stadium at a price tag of
NT$1.58 billion. Lin said prosecutors are probing whether the bidding process
involved profiteering, bid-rigging or other irregularities.</P>
      <P>The group was also suspected of involvement in corporate fund embezzlement
related with some Rebar Asia Pacific Group subsidiaries, including Asia Pacific
Broadband Telecom and Union Insurance Co., Lin said, adding that Gary Wang's
sale of EMG stakes to U.S.-based Carlyle Group is also under investigation over
suspected breach of financial laws.</P>
      <P>More than 20 EMG executives, including Gary Wang, and several Taipei city
government officials were questioned Thursday for their roles in those cases,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Gary Wang is a son of Wang You-theng, the fugitive Rebar group founder who has
been indicted together with 106 others for their implications in one of the
country's largest financial scandals.</P>
      <P>Gary Wang has repeatedly denied allegations that he embezzled Rebar group's
money and then shifted it to Eastern Multimedia Group, which he founded.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have sought a 30-year prison term for the 82-year-old Wang You-
theng, who has been detained in Los Angeles after his passport was revoked by
Taiwan for violating securities, accounting and other financial laws.</P>
      <P>The disgraced Rebar group founder also faces a fine of NT$1.7 billion dollars
for masterminding a scandal in which he had allegedly siphoned off a record
NT$73 billion in corporate funds into his personal or family accounts, according
to the indictment.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have also demanded a 28-year jail term and a NT$700 million fine for
Wang You-theng's wife Chin Shih-ying, a US citizen now living in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Among others charged were at least 10 members of Wang's family, including his
sons and daughters who had served as heads of different units in Rebar, one of
the largest conglomerates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The couple fled to China and later to the United States in December last year
shortly before the group's financial troubles came to light.</P>
      <P>The Rebar crisis became public in early January when two of its member companies
filed for bankruptcy restructuring with the Taipei District Court. The move
sparked a run on Chinese Bank, another Rebar subsidiary which has since been
taken over by the state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANCER REMAINS NO.1 KILLER, DEATHS FROM CHRONIC DISEASES DROP: DOH</HEADLINE>

06/15/07  09:26:30

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cancer remained Taiwan's top killer in 2006 for a 25th consecutive year, killing
37,998 people and accounting for 28.1 percent of total deaths, according to a
statistical report released by the Department of Health (DOH) Thursday.</P>
      <P>On average, cancer claimed a life in Taiwan every 13 minutes and 50 seconds, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>An encouraging sign was that the number of deaths caused by various types of
cancer, including lung cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer,
declined 1.4 percent compared with 2005, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The country's overall death rate also declined significantly last year, the
officials said. A total of 135,071 people died in 2006, a decrease of 3,886
people from the previous year, the officials said, adding that the 6.5 percent
drop was the steepest in the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>The death rates of all of the top 10 causes of death dropped last year compared
with 2005, with the exception of deaths caused by suicide which marked a 1.1
percent increase.</P>
      <P>The top 10 causes of death in 2006 and their rankings remained the same as in
the previous year, with cancer followed in order by stroke, heart disease,
diabetes, accidents, pneumonia, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, suicide
and hypertension-related diseases.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsiu-ying, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion,
attributed the decline in the total number of deaths mainly to an obvious drop
in the number of deaths caused by chronic diseases, such as cirrhosis, diabetes
and hepatitis.</P>
      <P>The death rates of the three diseases slumped 12.8 percent, 11.4 percent and
10.1 percent respectively, Wu said, adding that successes in disease prevention
programs that the bureau has promoted for the past few years should be credited
for the declines in deaths caused by chronic diseases.</P>
      <P>Although the number of suicide-caused deaths continued to rise in 2006, Wu said
the 1.1 percent increase rate was a substantial fall from the increase rate
registered in 2005, thanks to various suicide prevention projects launched by
the public and private sectors over the past year.</P>
      <P>The DOH tallies also showed that local people are living longer lives compared
with a decade ago. The average lifespan of Taiwan people was 77.5 years in 2006.
By gender, the average lifespan of a Taiwan man was 74.57 years, compared to
80.81 years for a local woman. Compared with 2005, the average lifespan of man
and woman rose 0.73 year and 1.01 years, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS 2ND PHASE OF FINANCIAL REFORM NOT LINKED TO ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Thursday that the promotion of the second
phase of financial reform has nothing to do with the two major elections next
year.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks as he addressed the 60th anniversary of the
Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the reform is necessary, saying that it is a major policy of
the nation that aims at enhancing the international competitiveness of domestic
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>Faced with criticism by some who allege that his decision to revive talks on
second phase of financial reform are a form of "election maneuvering, " he said
that "this couldn't be further away from the truth and is a vicious smear
campaign."</P>
      <P>Critics have lashed out at the financial reform, saying that several influential
family groups have benefited most from the merger of the financial institutes,
and that the government is providing them with astronomical financial gains,
from which it hopes to benefit in return during the elections.</P>
      <P>The president urged related government agencies to "continue on the right path
despite obstacles, " saying that "as long as they perform credibly, these
smearing campaigns will not stand.'</P>
      <P>He noted that a consensus  on creating a sound financial environment, including
the merger and the dissolution of financial institutions, had been reached at
two major national economic conferences.</P>
      <P>He said that the second phase of financial reforms will not only introduce
foreign financial expertise and products to Taiwan, but will also encourage
foreign enterprises to invest in domestic financial institutions or form
strategic alliances with them, which he said will raise the service quality of
domestic financial institutions to that of their international counterparts.</P>
      <P>"This kind of effort has nothing to do with the legislative or presidential
elections," the president stressed.</P>
      <P>In the first phase of financial reform, the government was able to achieve the
objectives of reducing the overdue loan ratios of domestic banks to below 5
percent and boosting their capital adequacy ratios to over 8 percent within two
years.</P>
      <P>The president announced in October 2004 the second phase of financial reforms,
setting the targets of halving the number of publicly-owned banks, helping at
least three financial institutions to grab a market share of at least 10
percent, halving the number of financial holding companies, and helping at least
one financial institution to list their shares on overseas stock markets or be
operated by a foreign owner.</P>
      <P>Due to the controversy surrounding the second phase of financial reforms, then-
Cabinet decided to make an overall review fo the reform before taking further

      <P>The European Union will terminate its anti-dumping tax on Taiwanese-made  CD-
ROMs this month when a five-year EU anti-dumping tax program expires, officials
from the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The European Commission,  the top decision-making EU body, announced recently
that a five-year anti-dumping tax on imports of CD-ROMS of Taiwanese origin,
imposed on June 18, 2002, will not be extended when the program expires on June
18 this year, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>Over the past five years, the European Commission has imposed anti-dumping
taxes, ranging from 17.7 percent to 38.5 percent, on Taiwanese-made CD-ROMs.</P>
      <P>The commission began a fresh investigation of CDs from Taiwan in March this
year, but received no inquiries nor complaints from any EU companies about such
imports, prompting the commission to decide to bring the retaliatory measure to
an end, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>According to BOFT officials, nearly all of Taiwan's CD-ROM makers and exporters
have steered clear of the European market since June 2002 as a result of the
anti-dumping tax.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aviation Act was amended Friday to allow private ownership of aircraft
and relax restrictions on foreign investment in the country's civil aviation
industry.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment adopted by the Legislative Yuan, individuals,
corporations and civic groups can own locally-registered airplanes, although
they are forbidden from using their aircraft for commercial operations or
leasing.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration should send staff to inspect personnel,
equipment and flight operations  of privately-owned aircraft regularly, the
amendment stipulates.</P>
      <P>Also, the amended law provides a legal basis for private business groups and
local governments to construct and operate airports, while allowing airline
companies to operate executive charter services to overseas destinations using
helicopters or aircraft with no more than 19 seats.</P>
      <P>To provide Taiwan's civil aviation industry easier access to capital, the
amendment relaxes the restrictions on foreign investment in the country's air
passenger, air freight and ground services.</P>
      <P>While the mandatory ratio of local shareholders was lowered from two-thirds of
the total to 50 percent, a single foreign shareholder is allowed to own no more

    <HEADLINE>WHO URGED TO TALK WITH TAIWAN ON IHR (2005) IMPLEMENTATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
06/15/07  13:30:26
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's health authorities once again called for the World Health Organization
(WHO) Friday to talk with Taiwan regarding the fact that Taiwan is a sovereign
state which has a strong intention of implementing the revised International
Health Regulations, or IHR (2005).</P>
      <P>The revised regulations, which were adopted by the World Health Assembly in May
2005, are set to be officially implemented Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Ting, a spokesman for the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the
Department of Health (DOH) , reiterated that China has no jurisdiction over
Taiwan and does not have the right to handle Taiwan's public health and disease
control affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has implemented the IHR (2005) ahead of schedule, Lin urged
the WHO authorities to talk with the government of Taiwan about the matter and
designate Taiwan's CDC as the country's national focal point for full
implementation of the IHR.</P>
      <P>Lin also appealed to the WHO authorities to repeal a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) that the WHO signed in 2005 with Beijing under the one-China principle so
that Taiwan can be allowed to take part in WHO activities more effectively and
make more contributions to the world's health efforts.</P>
      <P>The MOU sets limits  on Taiwan's  applications  to attend WHO-related
conferences, the rank of Taiwan officials to participate in such  gatherings,
and the use of the country's  official designation,  Lin said,  adding that even
if Taiwan files an application in advance, China usually delays its approval so
that Taiwan's representatives cannot receive an invitation from the WHO in time.</P>
      <P>Lin made the call after foreign wire services reported Thursday that David
Heymann, a WHO assistant director-general in charge of communicable disease
affairs, said in Malaysia earlier that day that the WHO will collaborate with
China to ensure that Taiwan will be included after the IHR (2005) is fully
implemented.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that China has no jurisdiction  over Taiwan, including its
territorial waters and airspace, adding that Beijing's claim that the IHR covers
Taiwan as part of China's territory is unilateral and inconsistent with the
facts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shen Lu-hsun, Taiwan's representative in Geneva, said Thursday that
the planned WHO-China cooperation in including Taiwan in the implementation of
the IHR (2005) is "only empty rhetoric."</P>
      <P>Noting that the IHR (2005) stipulates that all WHO member countries are
responsible for discovering, reporting and handling public health emergencies,
Shen said the issue of Taiwan implementing the revised regulations cannot be
compared to the issue of allowing Taiwan experts to take part in WHO technical
conferences, because only Taiwan has the right to handle its own internal
affairs.</P>
      <P>Shen also noted that some 80,000 ships from around the world call at Taiwan
seaports each year and that all the vessels must be issued quarantine
certificates by the Taiwan authority, asking whether Beijing has similar
measures in place.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and an agreement to
bolster bilateral exchanges Thursday upon the conclusion of a Taiwan-Russia

and his counterpart at the Russian Trading System (RTS) Stock Exchange, with
Chen Jung-chieh, Taiwan's representative to Russia, witnessing the signing.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU, the TFE and the RTS Stock Exchange agree to share stock market
information and experience, as well as help each other bolster marketing
efficiency under the principle of reciprocity.</P>

      <P>Four people died and 14 others were injured Friday in a train accident at the
Tali Railway Station in the northeastern  county  of Yilan  in which  two
tandem-connected locomotives ran into the ride of a train which was leaving the
station.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred at around 10: 30 a.m. The locomotives are suspected of
having run a red signal onto the traffic railway before hitting the second
carriage of the commuter train, according to the Taiwan Railway Administration
(TRA).</P>
      <P>TRA officials said it is believed that the accident was the result of human
error as the signal system at the scene operates well. However, they added that
as the locomotives had just recently undergone maintenance and repair work,  it
also possible that mechanical problems may have been the cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>The TRA has launched an investigation into the cause of the accident, the
officials said, adding that it also checking the names of injured passengers.</P>
      <P>The families of each of the four passengers who died in the accident will

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Insurance Law Thursday to allow
insurance companies in the country to invest a larger portion of their capital
in overseas financial markets.</P>
      <P>According to the amendment, the overseas investment limit of insurance companies
was raised from 35 percent of their total capital to 45 percent.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Financial Supervisory Commission estimated that insurers will
be able to channel an additional NT$700 billion (US$21.15 billion) to overseas
investment under the amended law.</P>
      <P>With excess capital in Taiwan amounting to more than NT$4 trillion, the capital
outflow is not expected to seriously impact the country's economy, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>In fact, they noted, almost half of the capital of the insurance industry has
been directed to the trading of foreign currencies even before the law's
amendment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the amendment  passed Thursday stipulates  that insurance companies
can purchase publicly issued shares, but the value of the shares purchased from
a single issuing company must not exceed 5 percent of the insurers' total
capital and 10 percent of the issuing company's paid-in capital.</P>
      <P>However, insurance companies are forbidden from becoming or appointing proxies

      <P>In addition, insurance companies cannot vote to support their associates or
their associates' board directors, supervisors or employees to become board
directors or supervisors of the invested companies. And insurance companies
cannot appoint any persons to serve as managers in the invested companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMIA SINICA ADJUSTS UPWARD TAIWAN'S GDP GROWTH FOR 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
06/15/07  15:55:28
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top research institute, raised its forecast Friday for
the nation's 2007 economic growth to 4.46 percent thanks to an optimistic global
economic outlook and rosier economic prospects in the United States.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Economics at Academia Sinica originally forecast Taiwan's 2007
economic growth rate would be 4.21 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-shu, a researcher with the institute, said at a news conference that
his institute decided to adjust the 2007 gross domestic product (GDP) growth
target upward by 0.25 percentage point to 4.46 percent on the grounds that
global economy is gaining momentum, fueled by a recovering U.S. economy while
Taiwan's export trade benefits from brisker global sales and a pick up in
consumption in the country's private sector.</P>
      <P>Wu said the 2007 consumption in the private sector is forecast to gain by 2.57
percent over the 1.45 percent posted in 2006, thanks to dynamic stock and real
estate markets.</P>
      <P>Growth in private investment, however, is forecast to shrink to 2.40 percent for
2007, down from 2006's 3.26 percent, mainly as a result of uncertainties
surrounding the legislative and presidential elections to be held in early 2008,
Wu noted.</P>
      <P>In foreign trade, Wu said, Taiwan's export trade is expected to grow by 7.63
percent in 2007 mainly as a result of a stronger global economy, but the
nation's import trade is forecast to advance by 4.81 percent, slightly lower
than the 2006 level of 5.42 percent.</P>
      <P>Inflation, he added, defined by the annual growth of the wholesale price index
for 2007, is expected to climb to 6.31 percent, up 0.67 percentage point from
the 2006 level of 5.64 percent, while growth of the consumer price index
expecting to rise to 1.43 percent, up 0.60 percentage point from the year-
earlier level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu forecast that the money supply M1B is expected to grow by 7.99
percent this year, compared to last year's 5.30 percent, largely fueled by a
much brisker stock market.</P>
      <P>Wu also forecast that the Taiwan's currency, New Taiwan dollar, will fluctuate
around NT$33 to US$1 throughout the year.</P>
      <P>All in all,  he said,  other uncertainties  --  including international oil

world's major economies, China's policy of constraining its over-heated domestic
economy, cross-strait relations and Taiwan's domestic politics -- could also

      <P>The first batch of Taiwan-grown tomatoes labeled with "produce traceability"
recently entered the market, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the tomatoes were cultivated on a farm in Taichung
County with the assistance of the COA's research center in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With growing concerns among consumers about the hygiene standards of
agricultural  products,  quality inspection labeling on the packaging of such
products has become a global trend, the officials said, adding that this is why
COA Chairman Su Jia-chyuan made implementing the "produce traceability" system
his top priority when he assumed his post in January last year.</P>
      <P>The COA's efforts in this regard have borne fruit, with more and more of
Taiwan's agricultural products bearing "produce traceability" labels.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Legislative Yuan passed the Agricultural Products Production and
Certificate Screening Management Law on Jan. 5 this year in a bid to further

      <P>One suspect was arrested Friday for allegedly  setting fire to President Chen
Shui-bian's  private residence on Ming Sheng East Road. No one was injured in
the incident.</P>
      <P>The suspect was detained by police shortly after he was seen tossing a five-kilo
gas canister into Chen's private house -- on the ground floor of an apartment.
No one has inhabited the house since Chen's daughter, Chen Hsin-yu, and her
family moved out last year.</P>
      <P>Although firemen men immediately rushed to the scene, the fire had already been
extinguished by policemen who arrived earlier and detained the suspect.</P>
      <P>No one was wounded in the fire, but a rain canopy in front of Chen's house was
totally destroyed, police said.</P>
      <P>Police have identified the suspect as a 32-year-old man, surnamed Hsu, who is
employed as a chef in Hsinchu. Authorities said that the suspect's statements
thus far have been contradictory and his motives remain unclear, adding that
they suspect that he may be mentally disturbed.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued later the same day, the Presidential Office thanked police
for detaining the suspect and called for the case to be closed as soon as

      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who once served as secretary-general of the Red
Cross Society of the Republic of China, rebutted Friday an accusation that the
organization has embezzled funds from its government-allotted budget for 20
years.</P>
      <P>Hau, who served as Red Cross Society's secretary-general between April 2005 and
February 2007, said he had seen to it during his stint that all income and
expenses were audited by certified public accountants, making embezzlement
impossible at that public-interest organization.</P>
      <P>Hau termed it as "immoral" that certain people fabricated a wholly untrue story
accusing Red Cross Society management of misusing funds allocated to the
organization from government coffers.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a report by the Taipei-based China Times daily Friday that
quoted ruling Democratic  Progressive  Party Legislator Wang Jung-chang as
saying that Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang has told him recently that an
investigation conducted by Ministry of the Interior officials had discovered
that Red Cross Society has misused government subsidies over the past 20 years
and that the ministry will work to retrieve the money.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang also submitted a proposal at the Legislative Yuan Friday
demanding that the Red Cross Society be removed from a list of organizations

      <P>The director-general of the National Police Agency Friday expressed confidence
in ability of the police to solve, in the near term, a case involving threats
targeting lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Hou Yu-ih said police have identified a suspect, whom they are preparing to
arrest in the near future.</P>
      <P>Hou made the remarks in response to media inquiries after Legislator  Huang
Chao-shun of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) received a threatening letter
attached to a bullet the previous day.</P>
      <P>Earlier Friday, Legislator Lee Chen-nan of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) received a similar "bullet letter", mailed by a self-named "Heiho
Association", which invited Lee to join the underworld as a branch chief of the
group.</P>
      <P>Lee said the bullet attached to the letter belongs to a rifle, a powerful weapon
which can shoot through a normal bullet-prove vest. If the letter is not a joke,
he believes it is a serious death threat, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Besides Huang and Lee, four other lawmakers who received the similar letters,
including Legislator  Eva Hsieh of the DPP, independent Legislator Lee Ao,
Legislator Lin Shu-fen of the DPP, and Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that in addition to himself, six other lawmakers received
similar letters at the same time Friday. Saying that the sender of the
threatening mail is too bold to respect the law, Lee urged police to break the
case as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the threatening letters have been assessed as having
been sent by a single individual -- likely a political fanatic dissatisfied with
the current political situation in the country -- because the Chinese characters
on the letters appear to have come from the same printer.</P>
      <P>The threatening letters triggered safety concerns among lawmakers following the
death of Taipei County Councilor Wu Shan-chiu of the opposition People First
Party, who was shot several times by a lone gunman at close range at his office
in suburban Taipei May 23. He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Before the gangland execution-style killing, Wu had also received a threatening

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's legislature has passed an amendment  to the Money Laundering  Control
Act,  introducing anti-terrorism regulations and lowering the threshold for
offenses to be considered serious crimes.</P>
      <P>The amendment stipulates that those who provide financial aid to terrorist
organizations, or support terrorist activities, may be sentenced to a maximum of
seven years or fined a maximum of NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>The amendment also states that cases in which the value of funds laundered
exceeds NT$5 million will be considered serious economic crimes, and
perpetrators will face stricter punishment. The financial threshold was lowered
from NT$20 million in order to better clamp down money-laundering crimes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined the Egmont Group -- an international anti-money laundering
organization  --  under the name "Money Laundering Prevention Center (MLPC)." In
May the group contacted its 20 members, including Taiwan, urging them to enact
legal sanctions in cases involving financial aid to terrorists.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan thus drafted the amendment based on an analysis of the Asia-
Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), and 49 proposals from the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF).</P>
      <P>The amendment  stipulates  that both outbound  and inbound travelers must
declare their holdings in foreign currencies or bonds over a certain amount set
by the government</P>
      <P>Fraud and illegal, high-interest loans regulated under the criminal code are
regarded as serious crimes under the money laundering amendment.</P>
      <P>In addition, national agricultural banks and trust enterprises have been added
to the list of designated financial institutions which must report suspected
money laundering activities. Jewelry shops and other institutions likely to be
caught up in such crimes are also included in the reporting system.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou
said Friday that he was satisfied with his four-day visit to India and
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former KMT chairman and two-term mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006, said
prior to his departure for home from Singapore that he had clearly conveyed his
policy initiatives on relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to
the governments of both India and Singapore, and that he had gained India's
promise to strengthen scientific and economic cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his two-day stay in India, Ma met several Indian ministers and
heavyweights of its ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>While there, Ma, for the first time, put forward the idea of "mutual non-denial"
between Taiwan and China which, considering that mutual recognition seems
impossible, he hopes will be conducive to future cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>During his brief stay in Singapore, Ma visited several important political
figures in the city state, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister
Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</P>
      <P>Ma told Singaporean politicians that his cross-strait policy is to maintain the
Republic of China's status quo without seeking Taiwan's independence or the
unification with China.</P>
      <P>If the KMT regains the power, it will ensure the dignity of Taiwan and the
interests of its people while working to improve relations with China, Ma
stressed.</P>
      <P>Ma told reporters accompanying him during his trip that the rise of the BRIC
countries -- Brasil, Russia, India and China -- and the planned free trade area
between ASEAN countries, China, Japan and South Korea, speaks to Taiwan's need
to adjust its economic, trade, and foreign policies.</P>
      <P>He said his Asian trip was designed to expand Taiwan's economic and trade
development space.</P>
      <P>Noting that India, which has overlooked Taiwan in the past, took the initiative
in inviting him to visit, Ma said this may also indicate India's intention to
adjust its trade policy.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed his hope that the trip might inaugurate a new way of thinking about
Taiwan's foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Asked about his "mutual  non-denial"  idea of cross-strait relations, Ma said
that although he believes that China will not accept it completely, the concept
at least provides a first step on the road to improving bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Beijing has seldom mentioned its "one country, two systems"
formula in recent years, and has instead advocated the peaceful development of
cross-strait ties, which Ma described as a change in China's policy.</P>
      <P>Given such a change, Ma said his "mutual non-denial" overture, which aims at
improving cross-strait relations, may present further opportunities.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to return to Taiwan at 7:30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Council of Grand Justices confirmed Friday the president's Constitutional
right to decide what is a state secret and his right to refuse to disclose it.</P>
      <P>In an interpretation of the Constitution, the council said the president, within
the authority conferred by the Constitution and the additional articles of the
Constitution, has the privilege to keep secret classified information concerning
national security, national defense and diplomacy if he determines that their
disclosure would compromise national security and interests.</P>
      <P>This privilege includes the right to refuse to give testimony and to produce
evidence for that purpose in court.</P>
      <P>Noting that this privilege should be governed by legislation which does not
actually exist, the council said the president may claim it even before the
legislation is in place by proclaiming that national security would be
jeopardize if he were to be questioned, make a statement or produce evidence.</P>
      <P>In the absence of law governing this privilege, the judiciary and prosecution
should deal with the president's proclamation according to the Code of Criminal
Procedure, and the president may challenge or appeal their decisions or rulings
following the same code, said the council.</P>
      <P>As to information already produced by the president to the court, the president
may still declare it to be classified information according to the law and the
court should follow the law related to classified information while using it
during a trial.</P>
      <P>The council also said the president's constitutional immunity to criminal trial
for any crime other than offenses against the internal and external security of
the state is designed for the presidency and cannot be forsaken by any
individual serving as the president.</P>
      <P>This immunity will shield the president from being investigated, prosecuted or
tried on criminal charges other than offenses against state's internal and
external security while he is in office. It does not means the president is
inculpable, and he can be sued for offenses committed in office after he steps
down, the council said.</P>
      <P>Also, the council said, this privilege will not exempt the president from the
obligation to serve as witness in the criminal trials of others, although he can
be questioned only at places of his choosing.</P>
      <P>The council's decision, agreed upon unanimously by 13 grand justices, was made
at the request of President Chen Shui-bian, who refused to produce documents in
the trial of his wife for alleged corruption at the Taipei District Court,
claiming that doing so would undermine national security.</P>
      <P>Chen welcomed the council's decision in a statement issued through his office
Friday, and he urged the court to follow the ruling while trying his wife.</P>

with Nicaragua are stable.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks after presiding over a swearing-in ceremony at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of new officials and representatives of overseas
offices.</P>
      <P>Commenting on media reports that relations between Taiwan and Nicaragua could be
on the rocks, Huang said that under the current difficult circumstances, he
could not guarantee that relations with every ally will be problem free.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has limited resources and cannot compete with China's checkbook
diplomacy," he said.</P>
      <P>"What we can do is to be on guard and do everything possible to cement ties with
our allies, " he said, adding that "Taiwan's relations with Nicaragua are solid
at present."</P>
      <P>The Associated Press recently reported that Nicaraguan Vice President Jaime
Morales Carazo said that "we as a sovereign country choose who our friends are,
" remarks seeming to indicate that Nicaragua is not ruling out possible
diplomatic relations with China.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he was present when Morales made the statement, adding that it
was a "misunderstanding" and that Morales has always been supportive of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On reports that Nicaraguan officials have traveled to Beijing to discuss the
establishment of diplomatic relations,  Huang said Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega was visiting Africa, its foreign minister was at home and that there were
no high-ranking officials in Beijing.</P>
      <P>He noted that Nicaragua's new president and ruling party have been in the
opposition for a long time and that their urgent task is to develop the economy
and reduce poverty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, as the biggest investor in Nicaragua, has created 25,000 jobs there,
which is a factor contributing to stable Taiwan-Nicaragua relations, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang's remarks came against the background of Taiwan's severing of relations
with Costa Rica earlier this month afer the Central American country switched
its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, ending a 63-year diplomatic
relationship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION KAOHSIUNG MAYORAL CANDIDATE ELATED AFTER COURT RULING</HEADLINE>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) Kaohsiung mayoral candidate Huang Chun-ying
said Friday that it is justice overdue after a court ruled to annul the election
of Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks afer the Kaohsiung District Court handed down the ruling
Friday to annul Chen's election on the grounds that she used election gambits
that could have swayed the outcome of the election prior to the Dec. 9 mayoral
election. However, the court rejected another suit against the election itself.</P>
      <P>Huang, who lost to Chen of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party by a slim
margin of 1,114 votes, filed lawsuits to challenge the outcome and the election
itself with the Kaohsiung District Court Dec. 28 and asked that all ballots from
839 polling stations be impounded for a recount.</P>
      <P>Huang said the significance of his victory is that it "indicates that democratic
elections cannot go against justice."</P>
      <P>He lauded the ruling as a "new milestone in Taiwan's democratic development, "
adding that he hopes "future elections will take a lesson from this and that
election gambits will not continue to hurt Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chuang Chi-wan urged Chen to resign immediately
to pave the way for by-election so that Huang can take over as mayor, but Chen's
camp has said it will appeal the ruling.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR TO APPEAL AGAINST DISTRICT COURT RULING: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu will appeal a District Court ruling that nullifies last
December's mayoral election result, a city government spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Yu-cheng, director of the Kaohsiung city government's Department of
Information, made the remarks after the Kaohsiung District Court annulled the
election result earlier in the day on the grounds that the victor's camp
unfairly accused her rival of vote-buying as an election gambit.</P>
      <P>In the Dec. 9, 2006 election, Chen Chu of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) squeaked past Huang Chun-ying of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) by a slim margin of 0.14 percent, or 1,114 votes out of some 770,000 cast.</P>
      <P>Huang filed a lawsuit late last December claiming that he lost the vote because
Chen's camp smeared him by presented a video on the eve of the poll allegedly
showing vote-buying on a bus returning from one of his campaign rallies.</P>
      <P>The video was repeatedly aired by television stations on election day.</P>
      <P>"The tactic... was enough to influence the election result, " the District Court
ruled in its verdict.</P>
      <P>But the court overruled another lawsuit by Huang aimed at annulling the election
itself due to suspected vote rigging.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the ruling, Hsiao said the judgment is absurd. "This is the
darkest moment in Taiwan's judicial history, given that the candidate who bribed
the voters with cash won the election lawsuit," he lamented.</P>
      <P>As the city government has not yet received the court verdict, Hsiao said he
cannot respond in detail. " At the moment, I can just say that the verdict
violates  Taiwan's  basic values and is unacceptable," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, the court ruling will not in any way affect Chen's exercise
of her mayoral power and performance of her official duties.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Hsiao said, the number of Chen's votes increased by 57
after several months of court scrutiny of the ballots.</P>
      <P>He claimed that a court ruling giving a vote-buying suspect a lawsuit victory is
unfair.</P>
      <P>According to the law, an election lawsuit can only be closed by a high court
ruling. If the High Court upholds the District Court ruling, a by-election will
be held to choose a new mayor.</P>

The Palestinian territories seemed headed Thursday to a turbulent political
divide. Masked Hamas gunmen took control of the Gaza Strip and the Fatah
president dissolved the 3-month-old unity government, declaring a state of
emergency and plans for elections.

An aide to President Mahmoud Abbas announced the decrees, including the firing

Hamas militias overran Fatah strongholds in Gaza, dragging men into the street
and shooting them.

Wall Street Journal:As Boomers Retire, Insurers Aim to Cash In

When baby boomers were in midcareer and eager to build nest eggs, the mutual-
fund, banking and brokerage industries swooped in and took advantage. Now the
insurance industry is eyeing that huge pile of money, hoping to build a global
business soothing anxiety over whether those nest eggs will last as boomers
retire and live long.

The result is a world-wide race to sell variable annuities, a product with risks
for insurers and a checkered past for U.S. consumers, thanks to unscrupulous
sales practices by some brokers and third-party agents. They typically offer
regular payments for life -- no matter how long a customer lives.</TEXT>

      <P>It is important for Taiwan's leader and presidential candidates to be careful
what they say and do in the 11 months leading up to the 2008 presidential
inauguration, American Institute in Taipei (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The next president will have an opportunity to make progress in cross-Taiwan

which he is scheduled to meet presidential candidates Frank Hsieh of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and Ma Ying-jeou of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>"The inauguration of the new president in Taiwan in May 2008 will obviously be
an important event. And regardless of who wins, it will present an opportunity
for some improvement in cross-strait relations and hopefully for progress on
some practical matters to the people of Taiwan, " he said in a roundtable

      <P>As Taiwan's media is notorious for its groundless speculation, the former AIT

      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers urged Ma Ying-
jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Friday to
ask KMT lawmakers to allow the passage of more budget bills that will help boost
economic growth.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers issued the call in a Legislative Yuan news conference  after the
2007 central government budget bill was eventually included for screening
earlier that day, the last day of the Legislative Yuan's current session.</P>
      <P>The KMT agreed to scrutinize the bill after Ma expressed willingness to
compromise after his party had blocked it for over six months in the opposition
"pan-blue alliance"-dominated legislature.</P>
      <P>According to DPP lawmakers, the KMT should also approve several other budget
bills that are needed to help boost Taiwan's economic expansion, such as a
budget bill that would grant NT$77.3 billion for a new 10 major development

some NT$80.7 billion for state-run enterprises and special funds to pay for 62
other projects.</P>

      <P>As Kinmen is seeking to transform itself from a military bastion into a prime
tourist destination, allowing Taiwan tourists to use the "mini three links" to
travel to China will greatly help the island achieve its aim, Kinmen Magistrate
Lee Chu-feng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a meeting with a group of 42 Kinmen migrants
residing in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Kinmen County is eager to pursue economic progress after the
number of military troops stationed there has declined due to a central
government policy change, Lee urged the central government to include tourists
from Taiwan proper into its scope of the "mini links" to help Kinmen better
develop its economy.</P>
      <P>"Such an opening will definitely help Kinmen boost its economic development, "
Lee said, adding that he will continue reiterating the appeal to Taipei and
calling for its quick approval.</P>
      <P>By the end of this year, only around 2,000 troops will be left on Kinmen, and
this is expected to further adversely impact Kinmen's dwindling economy, he
said.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refer to direct shipping and trade services maintained
between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and China's Fujian Province ports of
Xiamen and Mawei -- initiated in January  2001 by Taiwan  to help offset  the
lack of direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait and bolster
economic growth for the two outlying islands. Quanzhou in Fujian was also added

consistent in 1979, 1982 and now, " he stressed.</P>

participation in organizations that do not require such status, he said, adding
that "there are ways in which Taiwan can participate, in even the U.N.
organization, in terms of expert participation and observership."</P>

      <P>Four out of a group of five people who traveled to Vietnam early this month to

      <P>Health officials later found that a young man and his mother, both of whom are
friends of the 50-year-old, and a Taiwanese man and his Vietnamese wife who was
trying to introduce a Vietnamese woman to the young man, recently developed the
symptoms of fever, aching bones and headaches that accompany dengue fever.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors demanded Friday the detention of Eastern Multimedia Group Chairman
Gary Wang, a son of the fugitive Rebar Asia-Pacific Group founder Wang You-
theng, after questioning him.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors made the request one day after they led nearly 200 investigators
and policemen on a raid of 29 offices of the subsidiaries of the Eastern
Multimedia Group and Wang's residence.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors said Wang is involved in several major cases involving the
securities transaction law, the banking law, breach of trust, conversion of
property and the government purchase law. As he has the possibility of colluding
with other accomplices, they asked the Taipei District Court to detain him.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-tsun, deputy chief prosecutor of the Taipei Prosecutors Office, noted
that cases under investigation include Wang's group winning a project to operate
the giant sports dome, the sale of land at the Nankang Software Park to an
affiliated enterprise, diversion of funds from Asia Pacific Broadband and
illicit loans from the Chinese Bank, an affiliate of Rebar Group.</P>
      <P>Wang, who once served as a lawmaker and chairman of the ROC General Chamber of
Commerce thanks to the political and financial clout of his father's powerful
Rebar group, has until now avoided being caught since a major scandal triggered
by his father earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Rebar's financial woes came to light after two of its member companies -- China
Rebar Co. and Chia Hsin Food and Synthetic Fiber Co. -- applied for bankruptcy
protection Dec. 29. Their insolvency reorganization announcement prompted a run
on the Chinese Bank, another Rebar subsidiary. The bank has since been taken
over by the state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.</P>
      <P>Judicial probes into the group's suspected financial crimes followed.
Investigators have launched many rounds of large-scale searches at Rebar
headquarters and the offices of several of its 120-odd member companies, as well
as the homes of the Wang family and corporate executives.</P>
      <P>Wang's brothers and more than 100 other family members and corporate executives
were indicted in March on various charges.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng and his wife, Wang Chin Shi-ying fled to the United States in
January. Wang has since been detained at an immigrant detention center in Los
Angeles, although his wife is free because she is an American citizen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE FINALLY PASSES 2007 BUDGET BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
06/15/07  23:44:48
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan finally passed the central
government's 2007 budget bill Friday, which includes funds for certain arms
procurement projects.</P>
      <P>According to the newly passed bill, the government's annual revenues are
projected at more than NT$1.48 trillion, while the expenditures are set at
NT$1.63 trillion.</P>
      <P>On the confidential  budget section,  opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-
fang said an outlay of NT$200 million was approved to finance a feasibility
study on Taiwan's efforts to purchase diesel-electric submarines from the United
States while the remaining NT$4.3 billion for the submarine deal was deleted.</P>
      <P>The funding for a submarine-hunting P3-C aircraft procurement plan, totaling
more than NT$6.l billion, was approved, but an outlay of NT$11.3 billion for
procuring Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries was killed, Lin said, adding that
a NT$3.5 billion fund for upgrading the performance of Patriot PAC-2 anti-
missile batteries was passed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislature froze one-third of the NT$16 billion outlay for an
F-16 C/D jet fighter purchase plan, Lin said, adding that the freeze will be
lifted if the Ministry of National Defense manages to obtain U.S. consent to the
deal by the end of October.</P>
      <P>At the opposition camp's insistence, President Chen Shui-bian's discretionary
"special affairs funds" was cut from NT$50 million to NT$30 million, with the
added proviso that the funds must all be reimbursed with receipts or sales
invoices. In the past, only 50 percent of the fund needed proof of spending to
be reimbursed.</P>
      <P>The budget bill was stalled for more than six months because the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party, which controls a slim
majority in the legislature, held the bill hostage to a bill to amend the
Central Election Commission (CEC) Organic Law.</P>
      <P>With more people getting angry with the opposition's boycott of the government
budget bill, the KMT finally changed its mind and agreed to let go of the budget
bill.</P>
      <P>To vent its anger at the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's stonewalling of
the CEC Organic Law amendment bill, the "pan-blue alliance" maneuvered to freeze
a quarter of the CEC's 2007 budget and demand that the fronze fund cannot be
used until after the CEC amendment bill is passed and a new commission is formed
in terms of new rules.</P>
      <P>According to a government estimate, the country's economic growth rate will will
drop 0.25 percent to 0.3 percent if the budget bill fails to clear the
legislature by the end of June.</P>
      <P>The legislature will go into summer recess after the closure of Friday's
session. Both ruling and opposition camps have unveiled plans to push for the
holding an extra session in July or august to pass several other bills they
respectively favored.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday he
fully supports Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's decision to appeal against a Kaohsiung
District Court ruling that annuls her mayoral election victory.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks upon his return from an 11-day visit to the United States
that took him to several major U.S. cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles
and New York.</P>
      <P>As the district court in the southern port city just handed down its election
lawsuit ruling a day earlier, Yu was asked about his view on the issue right
after his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main
gateway.</P>
      <P>Yu said he needs to get more information before making a detailed comment. But
anyway, he added, the DPP and he himself will throw full support behind Chen in
her quest for justice through due process of law.</P>
      <P>During his just-concluded trip, Yu said he met with many DPP members, faithful
supporters and Taiwanese expatriates in the United States to listen to their
views on major Taiwan-related topics. Yu said he also took the opportunity to
urge them to return to vote for DPP candidates in the next legislative and
presidential elections to be held early next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISTRICT COURT GRANTS NT$100 MILLION BAIL TO EMG CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
06/16/07  13:25:04
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eastern Multimedia Group (EMG) Chairman Gary Wang was granted NT$100 million
(US$3.03 million) bail Saturday after being questioned about his alleged role in
a spate of suspected bribery and other financial crimes.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors asked for Wang's detention after summoning him and several
other EMG executives for questioning, but the Taipei District Court granted him
bail.</P>
      <P>As NT$100 million is a large sum, an EMG spokesman said, the company needs time
to collect the money for Wang's release.</P>
      <P>The bail amount is the second highest in Taiwan's judicial history. On Aug. 29,
2005, a Taipei district court judge granted NT$150 million bail to Hu Hung-jeou,
a former finance chief of Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co. in a corporate
fund embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors began questioning Wang and other company officials Thursday  after a
series of raids on EMG offices and Wang's properties.</P>
      <P>Wang and his associates are being questioned about their roles in four suspected
cases, including selling the group's stocks at an unreasonably low price;
embezzling funds from Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co., an EMG-affiliated
fixed-line operator; selling an EMG property to Union Insurance Co. and
subsequently renting out the property in order to avoid paying taxes; and
bribing Taipei City government officials to win a nine-year contract to operate
the Taipei Arena,  a multifunctional stadium in a bustling Taipei commercial
district.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, 17 senior executives of EMG and its affiliate companies as well
as two Taipei city government officials have been listed as crime suspects.</P>
      <P>Gary Wang is a son of Wang You-theng, the fugitive Rebar Asia Pacific Group
founder who has been indicted together with 106 others for their alleged
involvement in one of the country's largest financial scandals.</P>
      <P>Gary Wang has repeatedly denied allegations that he embezzled money from Rebar
group and then shifted the funds to Eastern Multimedia Group, which he founded.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have sought a 30-year prison term for the 82-year-old Wang You-
theng, who has been detained in Los Angeles after his passport was revoked by
Taiwan for allegedly violating securities, accounting and other financial laws.</P>
      <P>The Rebar group founder also faces a fine of NT$1.7 billion dollars for
masterminding a scandal in which he had allegedly siphoned off a record NT$73
billion in corporate funds into his personal or family accounts, according to
the indictment.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are also seeking a 28-year jail term and a NT$700 million fine for
Wang You-theng's wife, Chin Shih-ying, a U.S. citizen now living in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Among others charged were at least 10 members of Wang You-theng's family,
including his sons and daughters who had served as heads of different units in
Rebar, one of the largest conglomerates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The couple fled to China and later to the United States in December last year
shortly before the group's financial troubles came to light.</P>
      <P>The Rebar crisis became public in early January when two of its member companies
filed for bankruptcy restructuring with the Taipei District Court. The move
sparked a run on Chinese Bank, another Rebar subsidiary which has since been
taken over by the state-run Central Deposit Insurance Corp.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of the U.S. House of Representatives put forth Friday a piece of
legislation urging the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow Taiwan to
use its national name, flag and anthem in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) , a lead sponsor of the legislation, said it is
discriminatory and therefore against the Olympic Charter for the IOC to require
that Taiwan use the name "Chinese Taipei, " instead of its official title
"Republic of China, " to take part in Olympic games and for it to forbid the
country from playing its national anthem and displaying its national flag.</P>
      <P>According to the Olympic Charter, any form of discrimination with regard to a
country or a person on the grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or
otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Charter also directs the IOC to "oppose any political or commercial
abuse of sport and athletes," Tancredo noted.</P>
      <P>"It's disappointing that the IOC seems to be more interested in acting as a
foreign policy handmaiden for Beijing than it does in promoting sportsmanship
and fair play," he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of Puerto Rico, Tancredo noted that despite the
territory's status as a U.S. commonwealth, it is not required to use the name
"American San Juan" to compete in Olympic games.</P>
      <P>Co-sponsors of the legislation include Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), Dan Burton
(R-Ind.) and Thaddeus McCotter (R-Mich.).</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is scheduled to call on Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu Sunday
to show his support for the mayor's decision to appeal a court ruling that
annuls her election victory, Presidential Office sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The president is supportive of Chen Chu's decision to appeal and has full
confidence that the ruling will be overturned by a higher court, the sources
said, adding that the president will also make a major statement during his
Sunday meeting with Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>The president will be accompanied by Chen Chi-mai, deputy secretary-general of
the Presidential Office, and Lee Nan-Yang, director of the Department of Public
Affairs, when he calls on Chen Chu at her mayoral residence, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The mayor was released from hospital earlier this week after suffering a minor
stroke April 26.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court handed down the ruling on Friday, annulling Chen's
election victory on the grounds that she used election gambits, referring her
spreading words of "bribery" by the camp of Huang Chun-ying, the main opposition
Kuomintang's candidate, after the campaign activities had officially ended on
the eve of the Dec. 9 mayoral election, that the court claimed could have swayed
the outcome of the election.</P>
      <P>Huang filed lawsuits to challenge the outcome of the election and the election
itself after losing by a razor-thin margin of 1,140 votes to Chen Chu. The court
rejected the second suit against the election itself Friday.</P>

NT$2,000-NT$10,000 for each absence.</P>
      <P>The amendment also doubles the tobacco tax, with the tax on cigarettes rising
NT$500 per 1,000 cigarettes, that on cigars increasing NT$500 per kilogram and
that on shredded tobacco rising NT$500 per kilogram.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the manufacturing of candy, desserts, toys or any other objects in

      <P>Taiwan has donated 5,000 metric tons of rice to Kenya, in collaboration with the
international charity organization Feed the Children (FTC), as relief for the
East African country which has been struck by famine caused by drought, Taiwan's
representative to the United States, Joseph Wu said Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the donated rice has been shipped to Kenya and that it will be
delivered to Kenyan children by the FTC through local social welfare
organizations, such as orphanages and hospitals in Kenya's capital Nairobi.</P>
      <P>The donation is part of Taiwan's participation in the FTC's program to feed
millions of children suffering in areas struck by famine, Wu said, adding that
another 5,000 metric tons of rice donated by Taiwan has been delivered to its
diplomatic ally Malawi in southeastern Africa through the FTC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan worked with the FTC in 2005 to deliver a donation of 10,000 metric tons
of rice to Indonesian victims of the tsunami disaster of December 2004, and it
also donated 52 containers of new clothing worth a total of US$17.6 million to
over 160,000 children in need of clothes in 11 countries last year.</P>
      <P>The FTC and its long-term partner, the United States' National Basketball

      <P>A Central Election Commission (CEC) official said Saturday that the CEC will
operate with its current regulations as an amendment bill to the CEC Organic Law
failed to be passed in the Legislative Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>CEC Spokesman Teng Tien-yiou noted that the tenure of the 19 members of the CEC
was set to expire Saturday, and the premier will ask the president to designate
new CEC members in accordance with the current law.</P>
      <P>According to the current CEC regulations, the CEC will have 11 to 19 members
with a tenure of three years.</P>
      <P>The  CEC  amendment  bill  failed  to  be passed  in the just-concluded session
due to major differences between ruling and opposition parties over the
composition of the CEC, with the opposition parties demanding that members be
chosen in proportion to the number of seats each party maintains in the
legislature, and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insisting that
the current system be used.</P>
      <P>Unhappy with the CEC amendment bill's failure in the legislature, the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" maneuvered to freeze a quarter of the CEC's budget for 2007,
saying that the frozen funds will only be allowed to be used after the CEC
amendment bill is passed and a new commission is formed.</P>
      <P>Teng noted that it is the Legislative Yuan's right under the Constitution to
freeze the CEC's budget, adding that he had no further comment on the matter.</P>

      <P>Responding to the president's proposal, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary-
General Wu Den-yih said that whether the opposition will agree to include the
budget bills on the agenda of the special session will depend on whether the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is ready to compromise on a bill to
amend the Central Election Commission (CEC) organic law.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party as well as
the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union are promoting a motion to hold a special
legislative  session to review the KMT-initiated CEC bill concerning the
formation of the 17-member CEC.</P>
      <P>Owing to strong opposition from the DPP, the "pan-blue alliance" -- which holds
a slim majority in the legislature -- failed in its bid to steamroll the CEC
bill through the legislature, despite its attempt to hold the CEC bill hostage
with the 2007 budget bill during the last legislative session ended Friday and
the previous session ended in January.</P>
      <P>The 2007 budget bill only passed the legislature on the final day of the last
session after the "pan-blue alliance" finally agreed to let go of it in view of
growing public displeasure with their move.</P>
      <P>The KMT has insisted that the 17 members of the CEC be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of seats they each hold in the legislature,
with no single party allowed to control more than two-fifths of the total seats.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP opposes any party-based proportional principle for the CEC's
formation on the ground that such a practice violates the "division of power"
provision set forth in the Constitution.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday
that he explained the party's cross-strait policy during a meeting with Raymond
Burghardt, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), earlier the same
day.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks when he attended a Hami melon festival in Yilan,
northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he spoke about the KMT's present situation, Taiwan-U.S. relations
and future cross-strait policy during the meeting with Burghardt, stressing that
if he is elected, he will bring peace to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The KMT does not want volatile cross-strait relations, although it will insist
on its stance and will never capitulate to China, he said.</P>
      <P>He also told Burghardt that "Beijing must first remove its missiles targeting
Taiwan before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can engage in peace
negotiations."</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who arrived Wednesday for his second visit to Taiwan following his
appointment as AIT chairman in February 2006, has said that he wants to meet the
2008 presidential candidates of the two major parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The AIT is authorized by the United States to handle exchanges with Taiwan in
the absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma said a court ruling Friday to annul Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu's
election victory shows that "one should adopt legitimate methods to win an
election."</P>
      <P>"The practice of candidates making unsubstantiated accusations on the day of the
election should be checked, otherwise, it will be difficult to ensure fair
elections in the future," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that if the court did not hand down the ruling on annulling the
election, then there would probably be other election "gambits" by candidates on
election day in the future, which he said would be "detrimental to the
development of Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the bribery allegations by Chen Chu's camp, including
President Chen Shui-bian himself, against Huang Chun-ying, the KMT's Kaohsiung
mayoral candidate, on the day of the Dec. 9 mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court handed down the ruling on the grounds that Chen Chu
used election gambits that could have swayed the outcome of the election. Huang
filed lawsuits to challenge the outcome of the election and the election itself
after losing by a razor-thin margin of 1,140 votes to Chen Chu. The court
rejected the second suit challenging the election itself Friday.</P>

      <P>Friday's railway accident leading to five deaths at the Tail Railway Station in
Yilan, northeastern Taiwan was caused by human error, a high-ranking Taiwan
Railway Administration (TRA) official cited a preliminary investigation report
as saying Saturday.</P>
      <P>TRA Secretary-General Chang Ying-huei said that the driver of the train,
identified  as Lin Chung-liang,  failed to follow the pre-warning signals until
it was too late to stop the locomotive ahead of the last red signal light that
indicated the approach of a passenger train.</P>
      <P>Lin was driving a locomotive joined with another locomotive on a test run when
the accident occurred. Chang pointed out that Lin turned off the Automatic Train
Protection (ATP) system after its malfunction. However, he added, Lin failed to
stay alert after switching off the system installed in the train to help prevent
collisions through a driver's failure to observe a signal or speed restriction.</P>
      <P>A preliminary probe showed that the locomotives ran into the side of the
commuter train at a speed of 49 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Lin was severely disciplined and was transferred to a different job within the
TRA, while his supervisors were also disciplined, Chang announced.</P>
      <P>As for TRA Director General Chen Feng-nan's resignation after the largest
railway tragedy in Taiwan in 15 years, Vice Minister of Transportation  and
Communications Ho Nuan-hsuan said that the ministry will deal with the matter
after the probe into the accident is completed.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 15, 1991, two trains collided with each other on the Chaochiao section
of the West Rail Line in the northern county of Miaoli. Thirty people died and
more than 100 others were injured in the accident which was later determined to
have been caused by human error.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive  Party (DPP)  Legislator Wang Hsien-nan, who

06/16/07  20:46:22
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legitimacy of the Kaohsiung District Court ruling that annuls the result of
last December's Kaohsiung mayoral election is questionable and unjustifiable,
according to a judge handling the case.</P>
      <P>Ku Chen-hui, a member of the three-person panel of judges handling the election
lawsuit filed by main opposition Kuomintang candidate Huang Chun-ying after he
narrowly lost to Chen Chu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
the Dec. 9, 2006 election, has expressed his doubts about the ruling's legality
in a six-page footnote.</P>
      <P>Led by presiding judge Huang Hung-chin, the panel ruled in favor of Huang who
accused Chen of violating campaign regulations by presenting a video on the eve
of the poll allegedly showing vote-buying by Huang on a tour bus returning from
one of his campaign rallies.</P>
      <P>The video was repeatedly aired by television stations on election day. "The
tactic...was enough to influence the election result, " the district court ruled
in its verdict. Based on this point, the court invalidated Chen's election
victory and demanded that a new election be held to select a new mayor.</P>
      <P>However, Ku, who as the reporting judge on the panel was actually in charge of
most of the investigative work, didn't see eye-to-eye with his colleagues on the
judgment.</P>
      <P>Ku outlined three questions to challenge the ruling. First of all, Ku said if
Huang could not prove that Chen's claim of discovering "Huang paying 'walking
fees' to those who attended his campaign rally as shown in the video" was ill-
motivated, the court should not have judged it as a slanderous move or illegal
campaign gambit.</P>
      <P>Second, Ku said that since the Chen camp's negative campaign tactic at most
violated the regulations related to the period for campaigning, voters' voting
rights were by no means affected by such an infraction. Consequently, he said,
Chen had not broken any election-related fundamental principles to justify the
"annulment" ruling.</P>
      <P>Third, Ku said that in the conducting of election campaigns, exposing political
rivals supposedly illegal campaign gambits, such as vote-buying on a tour bus,
is part of freedom of speech which is protected by the Constitution. A complete
ban on such moves could infringe upon personal freedom of speech, he added.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ku said, the court's hyperboling a candidate's negative campaigning
gambit as a criminal act and employing it as a reason to invalidate the
candidate's election vitory would hobble protection of the candidate's freedom
of speech and ordinary voters' exercise of their voting rights.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ku said that in this case, there has not been sufficient evidence to
prove that Chen herself was involved in the conduct of the "walking fee"
campaign gambit. Therefore, he said it's inappropriate to hold Chen herself
equally responsible for violations of the Election and Recall Law by her
campaign aides who unveiled the controversial video at an election eve news
conference after the legal campaign period had expired.</P>
      <P>Chen announced at a Friday night press conference that she will appeal the case
because "the ruling was unreasonable."</P>
      <P>"I want to let everyone know that I am the legal mayor and that I will strive
for justice," she added.</P>

A year after President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced a

nuclear program, according to senior administration officials.

The debate has pitted Ms. Rice and her deputies, who appear to be winning so
far, against the few remaining hawks inside the administration, especially those
in Vice President Dick Cheneys office who, according to some people familiar

      <P>All African countries are welcome to attend a Taiwan-Africa summit meeting
scheduled to be held in Taipei in September,  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the summit meeting will focus on Taiwan's five diplomatic allies
on the continent -- namely Burkina Faso, Malawi, Swaziland, The Gambia, and Sao
Tome and Principe -- but that other countries are welcome to join the meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid reports that President Chen Shui-bian has asked that
this year's summit be of the same scale as that of a forum on China-Africa
Cooperation held late last year in Beijing by inviting as many African countries
as possible to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>In addition to inviting the leaders of Taiwan's five allies in Africa, at least
one representative from each of the 53 countries on the continent will be
invited to the meeting, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office officials declined to comment on the reports.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang is scheduled to visit the five African
allies next month to deliver the invitations on behalf of President Chen.</P>
      <P>Huang said in late April that the theme of the summit meeting will be how Taiwan
can assist its African allies to cope with the challenges of globalization.
Issues to be discussed at the summit meeting will include environmental
protection, biotourism, solar energy, medical care and public health, and
agriculture.</P>

      <P>Forty-four Taiwanese female lawmakers have signed a petition urging Myanmar's
junta head to immediately and unconditionally free the country's pro-democracy
leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has been under house arrest for most of the past 17
years, legislative sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Shu-ying of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party took the
initiative to launch a signature drive earlier this week to enlist female
lawmakers' support for a global campaign for Aung San Suu Kyi's early release,
the sources said.</P>
      <P>Huang managed to collect signatures from 44 female lawmakers of different
political stripes in a very short period of time, the sources said, adding that
nine female councilors from various cities and counties as well as Yunlin County
Magistrate Su Chih-fen and Taichung Mayor Jason Hu and his wife Shaw Hsiao-ling
have also signed their names in support of the drive. Aung San Suu Kyi was Hu's
classmate at Oxford University.</P>
      <P>Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has promoted non-violent
campaign for democratic reform in her homeland since her return to Myanmar in
1988. Her campaign is widely seen symbolizing the struggle of Myanmar people to
be free.</P>
      <P>Over the past 17 years, she has been under house arrest for most of the time.
The latest round of her house arrest began in May 2003 and should have expired
in May this year. But the Myanmar military government recently announced that
her imprisonment will be extended for another one year.</P>
      <P>Major world organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, the
ASEAN, the Amnesty International and human rights groups around the world have
appealed for her immediate  and unconditional release. Many Nobel Peace Prize
winners and parliaments in many countries have issued statements condemning the
Myanmar junta leaders' suppression of their country's pro-democracy Nobel
laureate.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has no intention of rivaling China in holding gala meetings to woo
African countries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Wang Chien-yeh
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang was responding to a United Evening News report that President  Chen Shui-
bian  has asked the MOFA to organize  a Taiwan-African  summit  that  measures
up to the China-Africa Cooperation Forum held in Beijing late last year.</P>
      <P>Besides inviting heads of state of the country's five African allies, the report
claimed that Chen has directed the MOFA to see to it that all of the continent's
53 countries be represented in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang said the report deviates from truth, stressing that Taiwan's engagements
with African countries focus on assisting them in national development through
official or non-governmental channels, not in the least for China's sake.</P>
      <P>Rebutting the newspaper report, the MOFA further issued a press statement late
Saturday saying that the Taiwan-African Allies Summit to be held in Taipei in
September will bring together the top leaders of Taiwan's five African allies to
meet with President Chen on charting sustainable development strategies and
coping with the challenges of globalization.</P>
      <P>Following on the heels of the Taiwan-African Allies Summit, the statement said a
Taiwan-African partnership forum will be held with the participation of
representatives from all African countries regardless of whether their countries
maintain or do not maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The partnership forum will discuss conclusions reached at the Taiwan-African
Allies Summit as well as feasible measures to narrow the digital divide, promote
public health and protect natural environment, the statement added.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA sources, Foreign Affairs Minister James Huang is scheduled to
visit the country's five African allies -- Burkina Faso, The Gambia, Malawi, Sao
Tome and Principe, and Swaziland -- next month to deliver the invitations to the
summit on behalf of President Chen.</P>

      <P>Visiting American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt met with
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)  presidential  candidate  Frank Hsieh
Saturday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, a Hsieh campaign strategist, said Burghardt, who as the AIT chief
is the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties,
was accompanied by Stephen Young, head of the AIT Taipei Office, during his one-
hour meeting with Hsieh at the latter's campaign office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the meeting proceeded in a cordial atmosphere, with topics
focusing on major international issues, relations across the Taiwan Strait as
well as Taiwan-U.S. ties and Taiwan's general political and economic
development.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for Burghardt, Lee said he could not reveal the content of the
talks in detail.</P>
      <P>Lee said Burghardt and Hsieh are old friends. Their first encounter took place
15 years ago when they attended an international forum at the City University of
New York. At the time, Lee said, Hsieh delivered a speech advocating  Taiwan
applying for U.N. membership in the name of "Taiwan" rather than its official
title of "Republic of China."</P>
      <P>During Saturday's meeting, Lee said Burghardt and Hsieh also talked about their
love for baseball. When seeing a big-size picture featuring Hsieh shaking hands
with Taiwan-born New York Yankees on a wall of Hsieh's campaign office,
Burghardt said that like Hsieh, he himself is a Yankees fan. But Young said he
likes Boston Red Sox more than any other Major League baseball team.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Burghardt also met with main opposition Kuomintang presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou. During their meeting, Ma was quoted as having elaborated
on his campaign platform, particularly his visions on cross-strait relations and
Taiwan-U.S. ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO REVIEW REQUEST FOR 'RICE BOMBER'S' SPECIAL PARDON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
06/17/07  10:29:06

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will consider the Legislative Yuan's suggestion for him
to grant a special pardon to an imprisoned "rice bomber" in a reasonable, fair-
minded way,  a Presidential Office spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks after the legislature unanimously passed a non-
binding resolution Friday requesting a presidential amnesty for Yang Ju-men,
better known locally as "rice bomber" as he sprinkled with small amounts of rice
in his homemade explosives for a bombing campaign during a one-year period
starting November 2003.</P>
      <P>Yang is serving a five-and-a-half-year prison term for planting at least 17
explosive devices around Taipei until he turned himself in to police in the
company of his brother in November 2004. Nobody was injured in Yang's bombing
campaign.</P>
      <P>Yang said during his trial that he had resorted to the bombing campaign to
attract the government's attention to the plight of local farmers after the
country's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002.</P>
      <P>The legislature's non-binding request for a special pardon to Yang was passed
along with a commutation statute granting amnesty to prison inmates serving
sentences of 18 months or less.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office spokesman said President Chen will make a thorough
review of Yang's case in terms of expert views collected in his extensive
consultations  with specialists  as well as the principles and spirit of the
newly passed commutation statute.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the president believes that those who offend the law
unwittingly or occasionally should not be denied an opportunity to correct their
own errors or deficiencies and get a fresh start in their career life.</P>
      <P>On April 24,  President Chen proposed an amnesty plan in commemoration of the
60th anniversary of the 228 Incident of 1947 and the 20th anniversary of the
lifting of 38 years of martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>Acting on Chen's directive, the Cabinet drafted a commutation bill and referred
it to the legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party supported the Cabinet-drafted
bill, the version proposed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) was passed by the legislature after a cross-
party consensus was reached.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-drafted version would grant commutation to only those who  receive
one-year  sentences  or less,  compared  to the opposition-proposed one-and-a
-half-year sentences or less.</P>
      <P>Some DPP lawmakers accused the "pan-blue alliance" of tailoring the statute to
benefit KMT Legislator Chiu Yi.</P>
      <P>Chiu was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his violent conduct during a
protest at the Kaohsiung District Court following the 2004 presidential
election. Chiu began serving time behind bar in April.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Justice estimate, 14,795 inmates can be released
immediately now that the KMT-proposed version has been passed, while another
10,140 will have their sentences cut by half.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Labor Front (TLF) , a private affiliation, urged Myanmar's military-
run government junta Sunday to free Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and
other freedom fighters who have been incarcerated or oppressed in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>TLF members said that in defiance  to pressure  from the international
community, the Myanmar junta extended recently Aung San Suu Kyi's house arrest
for another year, triggering condemnation from United Nations' Secretary General
Ban Ki-Moon and human rights groups around the world.</P>
      <P>The TLF said that they have worked with other Taiwan NGO groups since June 19,
2005 -- Suu Kyi's 60th birthday -- to collect signatures in support of "Free
Aung San Suu Kyi" campaigns launched by many NGO groups abroad.</P>
      <P>TLF is also collaborating with other Taiwanese NGOs in sponsoring a "Free Aung
San Suu Kyi" concert in Taipei Sunday evening, hoping that more people in Taiwan
will become aware of the lack of democracy in the Indochinese country, Myanmar,
and extend their support to Suu Kyi, who has spent most of the last 17 years
under house arrest, TLF members said.</P>
      <P>Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962.</P>
      <P>Suu Kyi led the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party to a
landslide victory at the polls in 1990, but her party was never allowed to take
power.</P>
      <P>The NLD has decided to boycott again the closed-door National Convention being
sponsored by the military junta for charter talks, saying that unless the
authorities free her, it will not alter its stance on a political boycott.</P>
      <P>The National Convention is the first of seven steps that the junta claims will
lead the isolated and impoverished Southeast Asian nation back to democracy
after 45 years of military rule.</P>
      <P>The NLD walked out on talks in 1995, after which discussions were suspended for
nearly 10 years.</P>

      <P>The presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Sunday
that he hopes the Taiwan High Court will uphold the ruling issued June 15 by the
Kaohsiung District Court annulling the Dec. 9 election victory of the incumbent
Mayor Chen Chun of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, formerly a KMT chairman who stepped down from the post in mid-
February, made the comments while answering questions from reporters on the
issue, which has stirred up debate following the district court's verdict last
Friday.</P>
      <P>Although the court's rule provoked mixed responses, Ma said, he believes that
the verdict will be helpful in wiping out "dirty tricks" in future elections.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung District Court judges annulled Chen's victory in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung
mayoral election on the grounds that the airing of a videotape by Chen's camp
late on the eve of the election -- when all campaigning activities are supposed
to stop -- accusing Huang Chun-ying, Chen's KMT rival, of vote-buying, violated
election laws and cost Huang the race.</P>
      <P>Huang filed two suits against Chen's camp after losing the election by 1,114
votes, asking that the court annul Chen's victory and invalidate the election.</P>
      <P>Chen was extremely dissatisfied with the ruling and vowed to appeal the case.
According to the Central Election Commission, Chen may remain in the mayor's
office until the outcome of the second trial.</P>

      <P>Eastern Multimedia Group (EMG) Chairman Gary Wang is likely to be detained once
again as Taipei prosecutors succeeded Sunday in annulling a Taipei District
Court ruling which freed Wang the day before on NT$100 million (US$3.03 million)
bail.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors lodged an appeal Sunday with the Taiwan High Court, asking
that it to throw away the bail decision.</P>
      <P>The high court accepted the appeal and ordered the Taipei District Court to
rehear the case.</P>
      <P>As a result, Wang, who has been questioned by prosecutors over his involvement
in at least four fraud and embezzlement cases connected with the Rebar Asia
Pacific Group, was ordered to return to the court for a new hearing Sunday
afternoon -- one day after he was freed on near-record bail of NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>Taipei prosecutors appealed to the Taipei District Court to detain Wang on
Friday night, but after a hearing, the court decided that it was unnecessary and
released him Saturday on NT$100 million bail, the second-highest bail set in
Taiwan's judicial history.</P>
      <P>Wang left the court Saturday afternoon after his company spent nine hours
collecting the bail money. He was prohibited from leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Wang may be detained or face record-high bail for his release.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors began questioning Wang and Tung Chia-ching, an EMG vice president in
charge of finance, Thursday after a series of raids on EMG offices and
properties belong to Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang and his close associates were questioned over allegations that Wang might
have won the contract to operate the Taipei Arena for nine years by bid-rigging,
that Wang illegally sold the group's stocks at an abnormally low price, that he
stole NT$27.2 billion from Asia Pacific Broadband Telecom Co., a local fixed-
line operator and a subsidiary of EMG, and that he tried to avoid paying taxes
by selling one of the group's properties to Union Insurance Co. and subsequently
renting out the property.</P>
      <P>Wang is the son of Wang You-theng, the fugitive Rebar founder who has been
indicted together with 106 others for their alleged involvement in one of the
country's biggest financial scandals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS RECOMMEND LOW CARBON ECONOMY TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE</HEADLINE>

(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local and foreign academics suggested at a seminar Sunday that the government
consider building a low carbon economy to help mitigate global climate change
due to global warming.</P>
      <P>Lin Tzu-lun, a professor at Shih Hsin University, issued the call at the forum,
which was also attended by officials from the Cabinet-level Environmental
Protection Administration and experts from Japan.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that the government come up with bolder measures and a clear-cut
policy in response to global warming, Lin opined that the government should
follow in the footsteps of British authorities in proclaiming to shift to a low
carbon economy instead of just focusing on how, when or how much to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.</P>
      <P>Moving  to a low carbon  economy  not only addresses  an environmental
imperative, it make business sense, some British experts were quoted as saying
and adding that the transition to a low carbon economy will have a negligible
impact on long term GDP growth and will present tremendous opportunities for
those who develop and deliver low carbon products and services.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the British government published its first white paper on
energy policy  calling  for a low carbon and cost-effective economy in 2003,
thereby encouraging the European Union, Canada and New Zealand to follow suit.</P>
      <P>In addition to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide by 60 percent by 2050 using
a mixture of energy efficiency, Lin said, the British white paper also announced
the government's goal of fully engaging in the development of renewable and
environmentally-friendly sources of electricity, replacing coal and oil with
lower carbon fuels.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to resist efforts to misrepresent or otherwise
underestimate the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and warned that the failure
to tackle the fundamentals of climate change will carry serious economic and
social costs.</P>
      <P>A Japanese expert attending the forum stressed that civil society groups are
responsible for raising public awareness that "using nuclear power is not
helpful in reducing global warming.</P>
      <P>According to the Japanese specialist, although nuclear power plants do not emit
greenhouse gases, other carbon-emitting power plants must be maintained as they
remain indispensable in case nuclear plants are rendered inoperative during an
emergency.</P>
      <P>Additionally, the Japanese expert warned of the risks posed by nuke waste and
the major incidents that might arise at nuclear power plants, and encouraged
local private groups to do their best to clearly relay that message to the
general public.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou promised Sunday to give all
people in Taiwan access to mainland China via Kinmen and Matsu, if he is elected
president next year.</P>
      <P>During a whirlwind visit to Kinmen, Ma pledged to announce this measures the day
when he is inaugurated as president.</P>
      <P>Noting that direct air and shipping links across the strait may not be launched
overnight given the complicated political and security issues involved, Ma said
to give all Taiwan people the access to mainland via Kinmen and Matsu, the two
Taiwan-controlled islands which link the mainland by ferry service, is something
Taiwan could do by itself.</P>
      <P>As the ferry service linking the two islands with southern Chinese ports of
Xiamen and Mawei have proved very successfully since it was opened in 2001,
Taiwan could make good use of it before the direct transportation links with
China is in place, Ma said.</P>
      <P>This access is only available to residents on the two islands and Taiwan
businessmen working on the mainland thus far.</P>
      <P>The KMT former chairman also promised to allow Kinmen's schools to accept
students from China in hopes it will help boost the island's economy.</P>
      <P>Ma was accompanied by KMT Vice Chairman Chan Chun-poh on the trip during which
he visited county officials and met with local people to exchange views with
them on local development.</P>

      <P>Wang is being investigated over allegations that he won the contract to operate
the Taipei Arena for nine years by bid-rigging, and also allegations of
embezzlement from his business group.</P>
      <P>Wang is the son of Wang You-theng, the fugitive Rebar founder who has been

      <P>A business group from Erdenet, Mongolia's largest industrial city, which is
preparing to transform itself into a "silicon valley," is expected to visit
Taiwan later this month on a shopping spree to purchase manufacturing machinery,
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (Taitra) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Erdenet, located about 300 kilometers northwest of the Mongolian capital of Ulan
Bator, is the site of Asia's largest, and the world's 10th largest
copper/molybdenum mine.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that the copper/molybdenum reserves in the Erdenet area are
extensive enough to support extraction for only about 20 years more, the
Mongolian government has decided to develop Erdenet into a science-based
industrial park housing machinery manufacturing,  wood  and  building-materials
processing,  food processing and leather garment processing zones, Taitra
officials said.</P>
      <P>The Mongolian government has allotted US$15 million this year to develop

Taitra officials said.</P>
      <P>Owners and operators of 16 companies to be housed in the Erdenet industrial park
are expected to be in Taiwan June 20-26, mainly for talks with Taiwanese
machinery suppliers.</P>
      <P>The Mongolian businessmen are interested in machines to process jewelry, stone,
ceramic tile, leather shoes, and wood, as well as commercial washing machines

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Monday called for a referendum to be held on the
country's bid to join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan" alongside the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen issued the call during a meeting with Heritage Foundation President Edwin
J. Feulner Jr. at the Presidential Office. It was the first time that Chen has
made a clear statement concerning the country's aspiration to seek a seat in the
U.N.</P>
      <P>Stating that holding a referendum will make the world aware of the Taiwanese
people's desire to enter the United Nation, Chen said that "Taiwan" is the most
"appropriate, " "powerful, " and "familiar" designation for the country to take
part in international activities.</P>
      <P>Chen argued that pushing the country to join world bodies under the name of
"Taiwan" has nothing to do with a change in its national title, neither will it
go against his previous "four noes" pledge, because  the country  has long
participated  in international organizations using different designations.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, he assured visiting American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt, during a recent meeting in Taipei, that he will never deviate
from his "four noes" pledge, made to President George W. Bush and the rest of
the world.</P>
      <P>But Chen said he also told Burghardt that during his last year in office he will
not cease building the Taiwan-centric notion of national character among the
people of Taiwan and cementing the country's democratization.</P>
      <P>Although the country failed in its bid last month to join the World Health
Organization as a full member under the name "Taiwan, " Chen expressed to
Feulner his appreciation of American support for Taiwan's  efforts to become an
WHO observer  and meaningfully participate in its activities.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked Feulner for his foundation's long-term and firm support of
Taiwan's democracy.</P>

      <P>Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has announced two new products
using nano technologies and is willing to transfer them to the private sector,
sources at the Hsinchu-based institute said Monday.</P>
      <P>The products -- a "nano plastic soap" and "nano anti-moisture agent" -- were
presented at "Taiwan Nano 2007", held June 14-16 at National Taiwan University
in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The nano plastic soap is made of nano-scale particles that minimize attrition
during cleaning or polishing process, said ITRI Researcher Wei Yu-kun. This
means that product can be used both in daily life cleaning, and also in high-
tech production processes, such as silicon wafer polishing or grinding.</P>
      <P>Additionally, Wei continued, the nano anti-condensation agent offers a better
water-proof effect, which lasts up to seven days: all the user has to do is add
the agent to water, dip a napkin into the water,  and polish  the items with the
napkin to create  an anti-condensation layer on the surface, Wei added.</P>

Assembly to voice Taiwan's longstanding wish to join the United Nations, said
the DPP deputy chief executive officer of policy affairs Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-chan made the announcement  after President  Chen Shui-bien expressed
his hope that a referendum would be held together with the 2008 presidential
election, asking voters whether or not they to support the idea of bidding to
join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan".</P>
      <P>Chang said the DPP will do its utmost to collect enough endorsements for the
proposed referendum to be carried out.</P>
      <P>The Referendum Supervisory Committee is scheduled to review the proposal June
29. Since most members of the committee are members of the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party, Chang said the DPP has
prepared a backup plan to launch an endorsement campaign to gather support
should the committee reject the referendum proposal.</P>
      <P>The DPP will campaign for the cause during the parade in early September in a
drive to seek a consensus among Taiwan's 23 million people over the referendum
issue, which aims to declare the country's strong desire to join the United
Nations under the name "Taiwan".</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) is backing a proposal by President
Chen Shui-bian that calls for a referendum on Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations to be held along with the 2008 presidential poll, TSU lawmakers and
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chih-chia, who concurrently serves as the TSU's legislative
caucus office director, made the comments while answering questions from
reporters on Chen's call.</P>
      <P>As the TSU has always supported pursuing a U.N. seat for the country under the
name of Taiwan, the party will definitely back Chen's call to have the U.N. bid
referendum held at the same time as the next presidential election, Lin said,
adding that all TSU lawmakers have taken part in an endorsement drive initiated
by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to meet the legal threshold to
put the issue to a referendum.</P>
      <P>However, Lin went on, the TSU objects to holding the presidential and
legislative elections at the same time. Both putting off the legislative
election  from January  to March or holding  the presidential  poll  in  January
instead  of March  would  be unconstitutional, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chou Mei-li, executive director of the TSU's public relations department, said
that her party supports Chen's idea of holding a U.N. referendum simultaneously
with the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>The DPP is slated to organize a mass march in early September to demonstrate the
eagerness of the Taiwanese people to enter the U.N., and according to Chou, TSU
lawmakers will also add their names to endorse that campaign.</P>
      <P>Chen told visiting Heritage Foundation President Edwin J. Feulner Jr. earlier
the same day during a meeting at the Presidential Office that he believes a
referendum on the country's U.N. bid under the name of "Taiwan" could be held
simultaneously  with the 2008 presidential poll.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Chen has spoken out clearly on the DPP

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will step up efforts to organize a
referendum on the country's bid to join the United Nations under the name
"Taiwan" alongside the next presidential election, a DPP legislative caucus whip
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian called for the
referendum to tell the world the people of Taiwan want to join the United
Nations during a meeting with Heritage Foundation President Edwin J. Feulner,
Jr. at the Presidential Office earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Ker said the first stage of a signature collection for a referendum on the
proposal has been completed and the party will soon begin the second stage of
collecting more signatures for the proposal to be put to a national referendum
alongside the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The time for collecting more signatures in the second stage will be limited,
and the party will have to step up its efforts," he said.</P>
      <P>Ker said he did not know whether the legislative elections will be held in
tandem with the presidential election. The Central Election Commission has set
Jan. 12 for the legislative elections, while the presidential election will be
held in March according to past practice.</P>
      <P>If the two elections are combined, the referendum on joining the United Nations
under the name of "Taiwan, " as well as another referendum on a proposal to ask
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to return its ill-gotten assets, can be
held simultaneously, Ker said.</P>
      <P>If the two elections are held separately, whether to put the referendum on one
proposal in each election or have two proposals in one election will have to be
discussed further, he continued.</P>
      <P>He said the party has yet to decide on whether the legislative and presidential
elections should be combined and that the party will hear the views of the DPP
caucus as well as take into consideration of DPP presidential candidate Frank
Hsieh's views.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and People First Party
(PFP) called for the DPP to "consider international reality" in proposing such a
referendum.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yi said the KMT is taking a pragmatic and flexible
approach. Whether it is "the Republic of China, " or "Taiwan, " or another name
that takes into consideration Taiwan's dignity will be acceptable, although the
premise will be international recognition.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Chen not take a rigid stance on the matter.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said there is a high level of consensus among the
Taiwan people on joining the United Nations and that there is no need for a
referendum.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the DPP will not attempt to make an "election gambit" out
of the issue by using the diplomatic setback to galvanize the public into
throwing its support behind the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Daniel Huang, executive director of the PFP's Policy Committee, echoed Su's
words.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that joining the United Nations as "Taiwan" will be "next to
impossible, " noting that the United States will not support such a proposal and
claiming that the president's suggestion is "only for the sake of election
maneuvering."</P>

followed.</P>
      <P>Describing Teng as a "national treasure, " Lee said his life and work "best

    <HEADLINE>KMT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO RELEASE CAMPAIGN WHITE PAPERS FROM JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou is expected to
release campaign white papers from July to keep the country abreast of his ideas
on running the nation if elected, his campaign aides said Monday.</P>
      <P>The aides said Ma, who has served as Taipei mayor and KMT chairman, has
exchanged ideas intensively with members of a KMT think tank over the
compilation of the campaign white papers and that he favors "short and concise"
white papers to "long and traditional" ones so that voters can be allowed to
grasp his ideas clearly and snappily.</P>
      <P>The KMT think tank researchers have suggested that Ma avert ethnic rows and
ideological issues, which they claimed the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
is "good at manipulating, " and instead focus on real policies concerning the
people's interests and welfare.</P>
      <P>According to the aides, Ma's campaign white papers -- on differing major issues
-- will mainly reflect "dignity" and "opening" as his main governance concepts.</P>
      <P>His white paper on cross-Taiwan Strait relations and diplomatic policy will
advocate that Taiwan seeks a "mutual non-denial" approach with China based on
the principle that both sides interpret the "one China" policy separately.</P>
      <P>It states that based on the premise  of maintaining  the cross-strait status
quo, Taiwan will promote economic and trade exchanges with China and the rest of
the Asia-Pacific region, or improving  cross-strait  relations  while expanding
substantive diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>His white paper on industrial development will suggest that while developing
Taiwan into a regional business and industrial operational center, the Ma
administration will seek to open Taiwan to Chinese tourists and develop tourism-
related businesses so as to spur development in various industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>On internal affairs, Ma will propose a "co-exist and prosper" idea, with
streamlining social order being one of the top options, according to the aides.</P>
      <P>On defense, he will propose "reasonable weapon purchases" and "appropriate
military build-up" to allow Taiwan to maintain its defensive capability while
refraining from entering an arms race with China. His white paper on defense
will also oppose Taiwan's pursuit of the development of assault weapon systems,
including nuclear weapons, the aides said.</P>

      <P>The Australian government has agreed to import mangoes from Taiwan, a major
breakthrough in bilateral trade relations, officials of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Australia announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The breakthrough is the result of a three-year effort to persuade the Australian
government to import the Taiwanese fruit, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Australian quarantine officials came to Taiwan to
inspect mango farms and other related facilities at the end of May, according to
the officials.</P>
      <P>Mango is a tropical fruit in season during the summer. Therefore, when
Australia's mangoes are out of season in its southern hemisphere winter,
Australian consumers can enjoy imported northern hemisphere Taiwanese mangoes,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>The office will continue to push for the export of other Taiwanese fruit to
Australia, the officials added.</P>

      <P>There has been an increasing trend of seeking professional certificates over the
past two years, according to data compiled  by the School of Continuing
Education  of Taipei-based Chinese Culture University (SCECCU) , which shows
that members of the public want to spend more money on private courses in

      <P>The SCECCU unveiled the data Monday of revenues generated from professional
certification classes held 2000-2006. The data shows that the average cost of
getting a professional certificate, such as state-level technician certification
in the field of interior decoration, was NT$11,203 (US$337) in 2004.</P>
      <P>In 2005 and 2006, the cost rose to NT$15,000-NT$16,000, according to the data.
SCECCU executives concluded that people are willing to spend more money to
obtain proof of their proficiency.</P>
      <P>Notably, the data also shows that yoga instructor certification is the most-

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's values must not be compromised even if direct transport, trade and
postal services are opened with China, Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said Monday on the offshore
county of Penghu.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, who was in Penghu for a two-day tour, the establishment of
the so-called "three direct links" between Taiwan and China must be based on the
values that Taiwan has long pursued, although such opening would be mutually
beneficial.</P>
      <P>Stating that Taiwan has to insist on its own principles and must not give its
way to China's conditions when it comes to the issue of building direct cross-
strait links, Hsieh said that "happiness and the future are in our hands" and
that "Taiwan must lead the way in bilateral talks."</P>
      <P>In response to talks made a day earlier on the island of Kinmen by Ma Ying-jeou
-- the main opposition Kuomintang's candidate in the 2008 presidential election
-- that he will allow all Taiwanese people to use the "mini three links" if he
is elected president, Hsieh claimed that such rhetoric would impair two-way
talks concerning the opening of direct transport links between Taiwan proper and
China.</P>
      <P>"It is very inappropriate for Ma to come up with this card for the time being
and it shows that he lacks experience, " according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The "mini links" refer to direct shipping services maintained between Taiwan-
held Kinmen and Matsu islands with three ports in China's Fujian Province --
Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzgou.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ma said that same day while giving a speech at National Chung
Hsing University  in Taichung City that direct Taiwan-China transport links
should be designated as cross-strait routes.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China represents both threats and opportunities for Taiwan, Ma
said he will ask Beijing to pull back its missiles pointing at Taiwan before
holding bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>If he is elected head of state and conducts negotiations with China, Ma
reiterated, he will be resolved to mitigating China's threats by seeking to
brandish the opportunities China could bring to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also rebutted President Chen Shui-bian's criticism that he was too naive when
broaching the idea of "mutual non denial" between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, it would be more "practical" and "flexible" if both could shift
from the current state of "mutual non recognition" to "mutual non denial" so as
to allow for the creation of space for the two sides to engage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Monday reports that President Chen
Shui-bian's revelation of secret information resulted in the arrest of Taiwan
businessmen in China are "not true."</P>
      <P>Officials of the MND's Bureau of Military Intelligence made the statement in a
press release in response to reports by the China Times, a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>The reports accused Chen, in a bid to promote a national referendum on the
purchase of missiles alongside the 2004 presidential election, of revealing Nov.
30, 2003 the locations and number of 496 missiles deployed along the
southeastern coast of China.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the president described the information as having come
from intelligence sources. China then arrested more than 30 Taiwan spies between
mid-December 2003 and January 2004 in revenge, the reports said, adding that
most of the spies are businessmen who have become scapegoats in the cross-Taiwan
Strait intelligence war.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it is well known that China has deployed a large number of
missiles along its southeastern coast and pointed out that satellite photos are
all that are required to substantiate the existence of the missiles.</P>
      <P>The reports that Chen, in a bid to seek re-election, noted the deployment of the
Chinese missiles, which led to the arrest of the Taiwan businessmen "do not
conform to the truth, " according to the press release.</P>
      <P>It described the reports as "digging out an old case that the bureau had handled
properly."</P>
      <P>On personnel who had access to China's secret information against Taiwan but had
dedicated themselves to safeguarding peace in the Taiwan Strait, the public
should "be positive of them," the press release said.</P>
      <P>The bureau has done its best to take care of the family members of arrested
intelligence personnel serving time in Chinese prisons, it added.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu said Monday that President Chen Shui-bian is "incapable
of intimidating justice," noting that this is no longer an authoritarian era.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu was responding to misgivings that the president is trying to intimidate
judges one day after he lashed out at a ruling of the Kaohsiung District Court
that annulled Chen Chu's election victory in the Dec. 9 Kaohsiung mayoral
election on the grounds that her camp spread "unsubstantiated" accusations of
her rival's vote buying that could have swayed the outcome of the election.</P>
      <P>Huang Chun-ying of the main opposition Kuomintang's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate
filed lawsuits challenging the outcome of the election and the election itself
after losing to Chen Chu by a slim-margin of 1,114 votes. The court rejected his
lawsuit against the election itself.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chu, "the ruling is difficult for the public or legal sector
to accept" and that she would appeal the case.</P>
      <P>Huang for his part said that as a national leader,  the president's  stern
criticism  of  the  judicial  ruling  was "inappropriate, " "incredible" and a
"negative model of democratic education."</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen Chu's camp had spread unsubstantiated words of "vote-buying"
after the official campaign activities ended, prompting the court to hand out
the annulment rule.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators from seven DPP-held
cities and counties will travel to Kaohsiung Thursday to lend support to Chen
Chu, according to a DPP legislative caucus whip.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming said the court ruling shows that "there will be no more peace
after every election, " pointing out that Chen Chu had caught her rival vote-
buying but ended up being annulled of her election victory.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, a KMT legislative caucus whip, said that the KMT will convene a
meeting Wednesday to decide how to lend support to Huang.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator  Lo Shih-hsiung  said that five legislative candidates nominated
by the KMT Kaohsiung city chapter and KMT caucus member of Kaohsiung City
Council will accompany Huang to another news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They will announce that KMT city councilors will use a boycott or another
"rational" way to show that Chen Chu's clinging onto her post has "no
legitimacy."</P>
      <P>Because Chen Chu's election victory has been annulled, her administrative team
will only be a caretaker one and should not make any major policy decisions,
according to Lo.</P>
      <P>The councilors will boycott plans and budgets for the lantern festival next year
until the court hands out a second trial ruling, although they will not obstruct
the follow-up funds for construction projects for the 2009 World Games and the
repair work for a cave-in on the mass rapid transit system construction, Lo
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`DISSENTING OPINION' DISCLOSURE DECIDED BY PANEL OF JUDGES: COURT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 18 (CNA)
06/18/07  23:31:35
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-person panel of judges charged with trying the Kaohsiung mayoral
election lawsuit chose to reveal a dissenting opinion expressed by one of its
members by attaching it to the court verdict, a Kaohsiung District Court
administrator said Monday.</P>
      <P>The court official made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Kuo Su-chung,  who is also a KMT legislative caucus whip, said the
disclosure of the panel's reporting judge's dissenting opinion before the final
ruling is handed down is illegal.</P>
      <P>Quoting Article 103 of the Court Organic Law, which was revised last December,
Kuo said judges' comments should not be made public until all court proceedings
are finalized.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, an election lawsuit cannot be closed until after the
second instance is finalized.</P>
      <P>The KMT's candidate in last December's  Kaohsiung  mayoral election, Huang Chun-
ying, filed a lawsuit demanding that the result of the election be annulled
after he narrowly lost to Chen Chu, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
candidate.</P>
      <P>Led by presiding judge Huang hung-chin, the panel ruled last Friday in favor of
Huang, who accused Chen of violating campaign regulations by presenting a video
on the eve of polling day allegedly showing vote-buying by him on a tour bus
returning from one of his campaign rallies.</P>
      <P>The video was repeatedly aired by television stations on election day.</P>
      <P>"The tactic... was enough to influence the election result, " the District Court
ruled in its verdict. Based on this point, the court invalidated Chen's election
victory and demanded that a new election be held to select a new mayor.</P>
      <P>However, Ku Chen-hui, who as the reporting judge on the panel was actually in
charge of most of the investigative work, did not see eye-to-eye with his
colleagues on the judgment.</P>
      <P>Ku outlined three questions to challenge the ruling. First, Ku said, if Huang
cannot prove that Chen's claim of discovering "Huang paying `walking fees' to
those who attended his campaign rally as shown in the video" was ill-motivated,
the court should not have judged it as a slanderous move or illegal campaign
gambit.</P>
      <P>Second, Ku said, since the Chen camp's negative campaign tactic at most violated
the regulations  related to the period for campaigning, voters' rights "were not
affected" by the infraction. Consequently, he went on, Chen did not break any
election-related "fundamental principles" to justify the annulment.</P>
      <P>Third, Ku said, in the conducting of election campaigns, exposing political
rival's supposedly illegal campaign gambits, such as vote-buying, is part of
freedom of speech and therefore protected by the Constitution. A complete ban on
such moves could infringe upon personal freedom of speech, he added.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ku said, the court's description of a candidate's negative
campaigning gambit as a criminal act and employing it as a reason to invalidate
the candidate's election victory would hobble protection of the candidate's
freedom of speech and ordinary voters' exercise of their voting rights.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ku said that in this case, there has not been sufficient evidence to
prove that Chen herself was involved in the conduct of the "walking fee"
campaign gambit. Therefore, he said it is inappropriate to hold Chen responsible
for violations of the Election and Recall Law by her campaign aides, who
unveiled the controversial video at an election-eve news conference after the
legal campaign period had expired.</P>

      <P>Ma Yin-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
reiterated Tuesday his promise on the offshore county of Penghu to open direct
cross-Taiwan Strait links if elected president.</P>
      <P>Ma flew into the Penghu Islands earlier the same day -- during the annual Dragon
Boat Festival -- to drum up public support for his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>Echoing remarks he made Sunday on the outlying Kinmen Island, Ma asserted that
he will hold cross-strait talks on opening direct transport, trade and postal
services between Taiwan proper and China -- the so-called "three links, " allow
all Taiwan people to use the "mini links" to travel to China and implement
direct cross- strait charter flight service on weekends and holidays as soon as
he is elected president.</P>
      <P>Ma pledged to wrap up bilateral talks on the "three links" within one year
following his election while working to make the "mini links" -- direct shipping
services between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu islands and Fujian ports of Xiamen,
Mawei and Quanzhou in China -- as well as direct cross-strait holiday and
weekend charter flights, available to all Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Although Penghu residents have been permitted to travel to China via Kinmen and
Matsu on the "mini links" routes since April this year, Ma said that such a
detour does not much benefit Penghu.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the possibility that the opening of the "three links" could have a
great impact on Penghu, the outlying island should consider transforming itself
into a prime tourist destination, Ma opined, suggesting that its Makung Airport
would perfectly serve international flights should some of its shortcomings be
overcome.</P>
      <P>Turning to a policy under consideration that would allow the establishment of
gambling casinos on Penghu, Ma said that he and the KMT's legislative caucus
members all are supportive of the idea and expressed his belief that it will
materialize when conditions are ripe.</P>
      <P>Ma also refuted criticism against him made a day earlier by Frank Hsieh, his
rival from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the 2008
presidential poll, by challenging Hsieh to come up with a clear and concrete
China policy.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Ma has demonstrated a lack of experience in cross-strait
affairs on the grounds the he has revealed his "three links" policy too soon,
which Hsieh said will simply invite China to frustrate the policy.</P>

      <P>Twelve tribesmen of Tao aborigines on Lanyu, also known as Orchid Island, off
the coast of eastern Taiwan, began a journey early Tuesday to Taiwan on a
traditional Tao wooden boat.</P>
      <P>Lin Chien-heng, an organizer of the project said in Taipei Tuesday that the
boat, christened Ipanga Na 1001, left Langdao on Lanyu at 4:30 a.m. braving a
downpour and thunderstorm.</P>
      <P>The first leg of their journey will take them to Taitung, which is 49 nautical
miles away as the crow flies although the rowing route would be much longer as
the boat has to cross the Kuroshio current flowing northward off the coast of
eastern Taiwan at a pace of four to five nautical miles per hour.</P>
      <P>Lin said the boat, made of 60 planks of wood and measuring 10 meters in length,
1.7 meters in width, 2.7 meters in height, is the biggest traditional Tao boat
to be made in living memory.</P>
      <P>Construction of the boat by five Tao fishing clans began last November and
finished in May, said Lin who came up with the project to prove that it was
possible for the Tao's ancestors to journey from island to island throughout the
south Pacific in their small boats.</P>
      <P>Capable of carrying 12 to 14 rowers, the boat set out at a speed of nine to 12
kilometers per hour and entered into the Kuroshio current at 9 a.m. Tuesday, Lin
said, predicting that it will arrive off of Taitung's beach at 9 p.m.</P>
      <P>After that, Lin said, four teams of Tao crew members will take turns rowing the
boat along the coastline of Taiwan to Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Tao, numbering about 4,000 throughout the country, lived on Lanyu and no
other place. Their ancestors are believed to have immigrated to that island from
Batan, the Philippines.</P>

      <P>An official of the U.S. Department of State urged Taiwan's President Chen Shui-
bian Monday to drop the proposal to hold a referendum on joining the United
Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The official with the department's Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs,
speaking on the condition of anonymity, made the call while responding to
Chinese-language media requests for comment on an earlier announcement by Chen
that he will push for a referendum on whether to apply for the U.N. membership
under the name of Taiwan, to be held alongside the next presidential election in
2008.</P>
      <P>The official first reiterated that the United States supports "Taiwan's
inclusion in appropriate international organizations that do not require
statehood for membership, " adding that such practice is consistent with his
country's "One China" policy.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, that policy does not include supporting Taiwan's quest to
gain membership in international organizations that require statehood, including
the United Nations. Moreover, the official said the United States opposes any
initiatives that appear to be designed to change unilaterally Taiwan's status,
including a referendum on "Whether apply to the U.N. under the name of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"While such a referendum will have no practical impact on U.S.-Taiwan status, it
would increase tensions in the Taiwan Strait," he explained, urging President
Chen to exercise leadership by rejecting the proposed referendum.</P>
      <P>The official further said that maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait is vital to the interests of the people of Taiwan, and serves U.S.
security and interest as well.</P>
      <P>President  Chen formally expressed his wish for holding a referendum on Taiwan's
drive to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan alongside the next
presidential election for the first time during his meeting with Heritage
Foundation President Edwin J. Feulner, Jr. in Taipei Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO GRANT SPECIAL PARDON TO 'RICE BOMBER'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
06/19/07  17:22:42

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced Tuesday his decision to grant a special
pardon to imprisoned "rice bomber" Yang Ju-men.</P>
      <P>Making the announcement during an inspection of a naval fleet in the northern
port of Keelung, Chen said he had consulted with Vice President Annette Lu and
relevant authorities concerning Yang's case and determined that special
commiseration is appropriate given the situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yang has performed well in prison and should be in no danger of re-
offending, Chen said, adding that he has ordered authorities  concerned to
process the special pardon for Yang according to the relevant laws.</P>
      <P>The move was made in response to a non-binding resolution adopted by the
Legislative Yuan last Friday in which the president was asked to pardon Yang.
The resolution was adopted along with the passage of a commutation statute that
grants amnesty to prison inmates serving sentences of no more than 18 months.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is serving a five-and-a-half-year prison term for planting at least 17
explosive devices around Taipei over a one-year period until he turned himself
in November 2004, is not eligible for commutation under the statute.</P>
      <P>Identifying himself as an opponent of the government's rice import policy, Yang
always included small amounts of rice in his homemade,  non-lethal explosives,
and claimed his actions were intended to call the government's attention to the
plight of local farmers.</P>
      <P>Also during Tuesday's  inspection  tour,  Chen again urged legislators to hold a
special session to review a list of important budget bills, including one
dealing with state-owned enterprises and another one addressing a series of
major development projects, in which the government is expected to invest NT$500
billion over a five-year period.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his gratitude to legislators for approving part of the budget for
an arms procurement package from the United States on the final day of the
legislative session last Friday, after the procurement had been stalled for
three years.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been more than six years since the package was approved
by U.S. President George W. Bush in 2001, Chen said debates over the arms
procurement over these past years have helped people in this country realize
that strong defense capabilities are their only protection in the realm of
national security, and that peace is not to be had for nothing, or at a
discount.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has no intention of engaging in an arms race with China, but only if we
are ready for combat and are capable of combating can we stop and prevent a war
to ensure true, long-lasting peace, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said politicians across party lines in Taiwan agree that the country urgently
needs to modernize its military forces, a situation which he said demonstrates
the will of Taiwan's 23 million people to safeguard the country's security and
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Included in the government's 2007 budget, which cleared the legislature last
Friday, were NT$200 million to finance a feasibility study on the purchase of
diesel-electric submarines from the United States, NT$6.1 billion to procure
submarine-hunting P3-C aircraft, and NT$3.5 billion to upgrade the performance
of Patriot PAC-2 anti-missile batteries.</P>

      <P>The machinery sector is expected to become the third manufacturing industry in
Taiwan to generate an annual production value of at least NT$1 trillion
(US$30.09 billion) , following the semiconductor  and flat-screen monitor
production sectors, Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA plans to assist 10 local enterprises in the sector in efforts to
develop them into flagship enterprises whose turnover reaches NT$10 billion or
more per year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, the machinery sector generated output valued at
NT$800 billion in 2006, representing an increase of 10.8 percent over the
previous year. The output accounted for 6.5 percent of the accumulated
production value of all the domestic manufacturing sectors in 2006, but the
carbon dioxide emission amount accounted only for 0.7 percent of the total.</P>

      <P>A 50-minute experimental film that will premiere at the Taipei Film Festival
will try to create "poetry in motion, " the film's producer said Tuesday at a
test screening.</P>
      <P>The film, produced by the Public Television Service (PTS), is a collaboration of
five established Taiwanese directors each of whom presents a 10-minute film
inspired by famous poems and poets, said Sylvia Feng, producer of the PTS
program Viewpoint and chief coordinator of the project.</P>
      <P>The short films, directed by Tseng Wen-chen, Wu Mi-sen, Hou Chi-jan, Chu Hsien-
jer and Mickey Chen will premiere June 24 at the annual Taipei Film Festival and
will be played on Viewpoint June 29.</P>
      <P>"You can find a lot of similarities  between  poetry and documentaries. However,
it is extremely difficult to transform words into images, " according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Other than Wu's, whose idea for his short animated film titled "Yearning" came
from an assignment he gave his students years ago, all the films have been
inspired by works of well-known Taiwanese poets, including Hsia Yu, Ling Yu and
Sun Tse-ping.</P>
      <P>The films include Tseng's "Keep Dancing, " Chu's "Genesis, Rehearsal, " Hou's
"Shopping Cart Boy " and Chen's "Seeking Friends Along the Coast."</P>
      <P>This is the second time PTS has produced experimental "poetry in motion"
filmmaking, following huge success in 2003, Feng said, adding that the
production of documentary films has seen a cross-over trend in recent years that
combines the elements of animation, musical and image effects.</P>

      <P>Veteran singer Yu Tien, whose daughter recently came third in a major mahjong
competition in Macau, said Tuesday that he is proud of her, but added jokingly
that he is also concerned he might have difficulty inviting friends to play the
traditional Chinese game at home.</P>
      <P>"With a gambling diva at home, most of my friends will be scared away," Yu
quipped.</P>
      <P>Yu, who admits to being a mahjong enthusiast himself, said his daughter Yu
Hsiao-ping learned the game as a baby when her grandma would hold her with one
hand while playing with the other.</P>
      <P>"It is not an exaggeration to say that she mastered her mahjong skill before she
learned to speak and walk," Yu said.</P>
      <P>As a girl growing up, Yu said she often briefly substituted for her father when
he would play mahjong with friends at home and would have to leave the table to
attend to other business.</P>
      <P>The proud father said his daughter usually ended up winning while playing on his
behalf and that he often lost what his daughter had won after taking over the
game again.</P>
      <P>Although mahjong is frowned on by some Chinese as a form of gambling and its
playing was forbidden in public places in Taiwan for a long time, Yu spoke out
for it, claiming that the game improves harmony at home when played among family
members and that it is a better form of entertainment than wining and dining.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Yu claimed that by having children play the game at home prevents
them from roaming about outside, which could lead to trouble.</P>
      <P>Yu said both he and his singer wife Lee Ya-ping like playing mahjong and own
more than 30 sets of high quality mahjong tiles.</P>
      <P>Yu Hsiao-ping, who ended up in third place in the 2007 World Series of Mahjong
in Macau last Sunday, won US$50,000.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) is collecting public opinion on a draft
curriculum outline that proposes including relationship courses in the senior
high school program, an education official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-lung, deputy director-general of the MOE's Department of Secondary
Education, said the ministry has organized a series of public hearings in which
experts and academics have been invited to contribute their views on the
proposed outline, which is intended for implementation in the 2009-2010 academic
year.</P>
      <P>The relationship courses have been included in the draft as part of civic and
social education, which, according to the draft, is aimed at "nurturing care and
virtue" in the country's citizens and will cover a wide range of issues such as
life education, gender equality, the environment and cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>To facilitate teenagers' healthy transition to adulthood, the courses will help
teenagers understand the meaning of love and how to handle breakups with their
lovers, according to the draft.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the draft Tuesday, some opposition lawmakers said the relationship
courses should be optional, not compulsory, because senior  high school students
might differ in terms of their relationship maturity.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Shu-chun of the Kuomintang said the availability of qualified
teachers is another aspect that should be taken into consideration if the MOE is
to include the courses in the senior high school curriculum, pointing out that
"students nowadays are probably more experienced than their teachers" in dealing
with relationships.</P>
      <P>Lu Shiow-yen, another KMT legislator, said the MOE should not further increase
students' workloads when the load is already very heavy.</P>
      <P>Lu suggested that knowledge about relationships be included in the existing life

      <P>China should adopt a positive mindset based on the best interests of the people
when dealing with the issue of cross-Taiwan Strait tourism, Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that technical problems concerning the government's plan to open
Taiwan to Chinese tourists are almost solved through several rounds of talks
with the Beijing authorities and that the main bottleneck of the plan lies in
political issues.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Beijing authorities will consider the matter from a positive point
of view. Hasn't Chinese President Hu Jintao said that `anything in the people's
interests should be done'? This is a matter in the people's interests that
Beijing should deal with from the perspective of the people's interests, " Chen
told CNA.</P>
      <P>Chen blamed China for impeding progress of the cross-strait talks on the tourism
issue by imposing political rhetoric in the talks.</P>
      <P>For example, China has referred to Taiwan as "Taiwan, China" and insisted  that
cross-strait  visits are not ones "between two countries," according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to attend a seminar with a group of China-based Taiwanese
businessmen organized by the Straits Exchange Foundation June 20-22 in Hualien,
during which he will brief the participants on the progress of talks on cross-
strait tourism and cross-strait charter cargo and passenger flights.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progress Party (DPP) "should be able" to relieve U.S.
misgivings about its plan to hold a referendum on Taiwan's bid for U.N.
membership in the name of "Taiwan, " an opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Mei-li, chief executive of the TSU's information department, made the
remarks after an unidentified U.S. State Department Official reiterated that the
United States opposes any initiatives that appear to be designed to unilaterally
change Taiwan's status, which includes a referendum on whether to apply for U.N.
membership as "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"While such a referendum would have no practical impact on U.S.-Taiwan status,
it would increase tension in the Taiwan Strait," the American official
explained, urging Chen to exercise leadership and reject the proposed
referendum.</P>
      <P>Responding to the remarks, Chou said Taiwan is an independent country that is
entitled to decide its own future or destiny. The international community should
not "misunderstand" the purpose of its push for a referendum on its U.N.
membership bid, she added.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the DPP administration should be capable of quenching U.S.
misgivings about our country's U.N. membership bid, " Chou said.</P>
      <P>The TSU, which controls 12 seats in the legislature, supports simultaneous
holding of a referendum on the country's U.N. membership application under the
name of Taiwan along with the 2008 presidential election, Chou said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she added, the party opposes the "two-in-one" merger of the next
presidential and legislative elections or the "three-in-one" merger of the next
presidential and legislative elections and the U.N. bid referendum.</P>
      <P>The TSU and the DPP are "pan-green" camp partners who share similar pro-
independence convictions but are otherwise divided on a variety of policy

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
vowed Tuesday to push for an extra legislative session and demand that a bill on
a monthly stipend for farmers, along with other key bills, be dealt with in the
session.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming's remarks echoed a call made earlier in the day by President Chen
Shui-bian, who asked the Legislative Yuan to hold an extra session to deal with
several important bills still being blocked after the latest session adjourned
last Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Ker, the DPP will definitely ask the legislature to hold an extra
session "out of concern over the people's livelihoods."</P>
      <P>Apart from the 2007 central government budget bill that was approved last week,
Ker said the DPP will also demand a bill regarding a five-year NT$500 billion
expansion program of public construction projects, as well as a bill aimed at
granting a monthly stipend of NT$6,000 for elderly farmers and an annual budget
bill for state-run companies, be addressed in the proposed extra session.</P>
      <P>Ker predicted that the farmers' monthly stipend bill will quickly be approved
during the extra session, on the grounds that both the ruling and opposition
parties have reached initial agreement on it.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, a legislative caucus whip of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
, said she agreed that an extra session should be called to deal with the key
bills, but questioned why the DPP excluded a draft law regarding the formation
of the Central Election Commission (CEC) from the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>As far as the KMT is concerned, the party hopes to approve all major bills in
the proposed extra session, including the draft CEC Organic Law, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, a lawmaker and director of the KMT's Policy Coordination
Commission, accused the DPP of double-dealing with the farmers' stipend bill.</P>
      <P>The KMT was willing to allow the bill to clear the Legislative Yuan last Friday
-- the last day of the session, but it was the DPP that came up with a motion
asking to put off a final approval for the bill in order to further discuss the
issue with the opposition.</P>
      <P>"This two-faced tactic was deliberately designed by the DPP to deceive elderly
farmers," he claimed.</P>
      <P>The several annual budget bills and the draft CEC Organic Law have been
stonewalled in the legislature over the past few months due to the divergent
positions of the "pan-green camp" led by the DPP and the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The "pan-blues" had insisted on passing their version of the CEC draft law in
exchange for the passage of the 2007 central government budget bill. But "pan-
blue" lawmakers agreed to approve it late last week after Ma Ying-jeou, the
KMT's presidential candidate, asked for the approval of the 2007 central
government budget bill amid public outrage over the KMT's antics.</P>

      <P>A former senior adviser to the president, Wu Li-pei, said Tuesday that he is
planning to make a public call in the United States for U.S. recognition of
Taiwan and establishing diplomatic relations with the country.</P>
      <P>Wu, who is the founder of the U.S.-based Formosa Foundation and a steadfast pro-
Taiwan independence advocate, made the statement prior to his departure slated
for Wednesday for the U.S. along with Peng Ming-min, also a prominent pro-
independence activist and a former senior presidential advisor.</P>
      <P>Wu said he and Peng are scheduled to hold a press conference in Los Angeles
Thursday to promote the call. They will then kick off efforts to make Taiwan's
independence an issue for policy debate between the Republicans and the
Democrats amid the approach of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections
in 2008.</P>
      <P>Wu said they hope to expand the issue into a "grassroots movement" in the United
States by launching a lobbying campaign there in hope of winning support from
the U.S. people. He stressed that that their gambit has nothing to do with the
Taiwan government and that they will be acting in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>He said surveys show that more than half of the American people are unaware that
their country maintains no diplomatic ties with Taiwan and claimed that now is
the best time to lobby U.S. grassroots voters for their support, as the U.S. is
entering a major election year. He did not elaborate further.</P>
      <P>Wu suggested that Taiwan first seek support from workers' unions, Christian
organizations, Republican conservatives, "free" Democrats, human rights groups
and environmental protection associations. Taiwan should also organize "Taiwan's
Friends" associations in every U.S. state and try to make the "Taiwan issue" a
big issue for American voters during election campaigns and major debates, he
added.</P>
      <P>Admitting that seeking U.S. diplomatic recognition will be difficult to complete
"soon, " Wu said, however, that their movement is expected to raise U.S.
people's attention toward the Taiwan issue. He also said it might even force the
U.S. government to review its "one China" policy.</P>

The American military began a major attack against Sunni insurgent positions
here in the capital of Diyala Province overnight, part of a larger operation
aimed at blunting the persistent car and suicide bombings that have terrorized
Iraqis and thwarted political reconciliation.

The assault by more than 2,000 American troops is unusual in its scope and
ambition, representing a more aggressive strategy of attacking several insurgent
strongholds simultaneously to tamp down violence throughout the country.

Wall Street Journal:For UAW Chief, a Bid To Forestall 'Waterloo'

As Detroit's struggling auto giants enter an epic battle with their unionized
workers to reduce costs, they contend they either must win a profound
restructuring or face catastrophe. Ron Gettelfinger's plan is to allow neither.

The head of the United Auto Workers union is trying to avoid becoming the union
leader who ends seven decades of nearly unbroken advances in workers' wages and
benefits. He is under unprecedented pressure to give back as much as $10 billion
a year to help U.S. car companies stop losing to their lower-cost Asian
counterparts -- or see the U.S. companies build more and more of their cars
overseas. Former UAW president Doug Fraser calls this "the most difficult time
in the history of our union. Period."</TEXT>

      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support the government's plan to apply for U.N.
membership in the name of Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman
Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang said, the government's push for a national referendum on the U.N.
membership bid does not break President Chen Shui-bian's now-famous "four noes"
pledge nor has it anything to do with changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>Chen's four noes pledge, made in his 2000 inaugural speech, refers to his
promise that so long as China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he
will not declare independence, will not change the national title or flag, will
not enshrine a "two states theory" in the Constitution to define cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and will not hold an "independence versus unification"
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a democratic country,  Wang went on, the government must respect
the grassroots call for joining the U.N. in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after an unidentified U.S. State Department Official
reiterated Monday that the United States opposes any initiatives that appear to
be designed to unilaterally change the Taiwan Strait status quo, which the U.S.
believes includes a referendum on whether to apply for U.N. membership as

of "rice bomber" Yang Ju-men, Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks came after President Chen shui-bian announced Tuesday that he will
grant a special pardon to Yang who is serving time at an open prison in Hualien
county in eastern Taiwan for offending the Firearms Control Act.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ministry has received the president's instruction to prepare for
Yang's release, Lee said the ministry will soon send a proposal of that effect
to Chen for formal approval in the coming days.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Lee said Yang can be released by the end of this week. "Yang
can leave prison within 24 hours after Chen formally signs the proposal," he
added.</P>
      <P>Yang was sentenced in 2005 to seven-and-a-half years in prison plus a fine of
NT$100,000 (US$3,030.3) for planting 17 explosive devices in public places
around Taipei over a one-year period until he turned himself in November 2004.</P>
      <P>Identifying himself as an opponent of the government's rice import policy, Yang
always sprinkled small amounts of rice in his homemade explosives, which is
where Yang's nickname came from. Nobody was injured in his year-long bombing
campaign.</P>
      <P>During his trial, Yang said he had mounted the bombing campaign to attract the
government's attention to the plight of local farmers after the country's
accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002.</P>
      <P>In January 2006, the Taiwan High Court reduced Yang's sentence to five years and
10 months, saying his motive was not malicious.</P>
      <P>While announcing his decision to grant a special pardon to Yang in his speech
delivered at a luncheon with members of the Navy's 131 Fleet in Keelung Tuesday
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, Chen said Yang deserves compassion and is
not expected to break the law again as he has behaved well during his time
behind bar.</P>
      <P>Yang's pardon marks the second presidential pardon since Chen assumed office in
May 2000. He first granted special pardon to 21 special prison inmates in 2000.</P>
      <P>Yang first served at a prison in Taipei and was transferred to an open prison in
Hualien early this year because of his good behavior. He works on a farm in the
Hualien open prison.</P>
      <P>According to Hualien prison sources, Yang remained calm after learning of
President Chen's decision to grant him special pardon.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for a pro-Yang advocacy group said the special pardon is "belated
justice."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA ISSUES 4-POINT RESPONSE TO U.S. OPPOSITION TO U.N. REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>

      <P>The majority of Taiwan people support the government's plan to apply for U.N.
membership in the name of Taiwan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman
Wang Chien-yeh said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang said, the government's push for a national referendum on the U.N.
membership bid does not break President Chen Shui-bian's now-famous "four noes"
pledge nor has it anything to do with changing the status quo.</P>
      <P>Chen's four noes pledge, made in his 2000 inaugural speech, refers to his
promise that so long as China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he
will not declare independence, will not change the national title or flag, will
not enshrine a "two states theory" in the Constitution to define cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and will not hold an "independence versus unification"
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is a democratic country,  Wang went on, the government must respect
the grassroots call for joining the U.N. in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after an unidentified U.S. State Department Official
reiterated Monday that the United States opposes any initiatives that appear to
be designed to unilaterally change the Taiwan Strait status quo, which the U.S.
believes includes a referendum on whether to apply for U.N. membership as
"Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Noting that the quest for U.N. representation under the name of Taiwan is backed
by the majority, Wang said the government's plan to hold a national referendum
on the issue is a response to public expectations.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government attaches great importance to relations with the
United States, Wang said MOFA will continue to communicate with the U.S. on the
issue.</P>
      <P>President Chen formally expressed for the first time during his meeting with
Heritage Foundation President Edwin J. Feulner, Jr. in Taipei Monday his wish
for holding a referendum on Taiwan's drive to join the United Nations under the
name of Taiwan alongside the 2008 presidential election.</P>

      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng arrived in Washington, D.C. Monday to exchange
views with members of the North America Taiwanese Professors' Association on how
to build Taiwan's identity through education.</P>
      <P>The participating professors urged the Ministry of Education to strengthen
cultivation of Taiwanese consciousness among young students and gave many
suggestions on how this might be achieved.</P>
      <P>Tu pointed out that the preservation and education of mother tongues is a very
important link to enhancing identity education, because learning mother tongues
will contribute to understanding different cultures. Tu also said the government
is working on making language laws that "gives every language equal status."</P>
      <P>Hakka and aboriginal languages already have formal learning and preservation
measures, Tu said, adding that Taiwanese has not had a preservation mechanism
and that more efforts need to be made to protect this language.</P>
      <P>Tu also mentioned that identity education has to shed light on the cultivation
of an international perspective so that people can acquire  a better
understanding  of Taiwan's  status  in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Tu also attended an international conference in Vancouver June 13, where he met
with education officials from British Columbia to discuss cooperation on
language teaching. He also went to Chicago June 15 to discuss cooperation
projects such as the training of Chinese teachers and establishing Taiwanese
studies seminars at local colleges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. State Department official reiterated Tuesday Washington's opposition to
Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations, warning that such a move would intensify tensions across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"The United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.  This would include a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name of 'Taiwan, '" said State Department
Spokesman Sean McCormack when asked to comment on the issue during a daily press
briefing. He was repeating a similar statement released by the department a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>"While such a referendum would have no practical impact on Taiwan's U.N. status,
it would increase tensions in the Taiwan Strait," McCormack added.</P>
      <P>McCormack stressed in line with its "one China" policy, the United States does
not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require
statehood, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He urged President Chen Shui-bian to exercise leadership by scrapping the
planned referendum, saying the plan would appear to run counter to Chen's
repeated commitments to U.S. President George W. Bush and the international
community.</P>
      <P>"Maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is of vital
interest to the people of Taiwan, and serves U.S. security interests as well,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which failed in its first attempt to gain membership to the World Health
Organization under the name of "Taiwan" in May, is planning to use a similar
model to apply for U.N. membership in September despite the prospect of failure.</P>
      <P>On Monday, President Chen unveiled his plan to push for a referendum on the U.N.
bid alongside the 2008 presidential election to "make the world aware of
Taiwan's 23 million people's desire to join the United Nations."</P>
      <P>Calling "Taiwan" the most "appropriate, " "powerful, " and "familiar" name for
the country to take part in international organizations, Chen said applying to
enter the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" will not mean any changes of
its national title, the Republic of China, or violate its "four noes"
commitments to the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged during his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses that if China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, not change the official name of the country, not include the
"state-to-state" concept on cross-strait relations in the Constitution, and not
promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status quo.</P>

      <P>Works to export mangoes produced in the southern county of Tainan have been
activated recently since Japan, a major Taiwanese mango importer, gradually
removed import restrictions on Taiwan's Irwin mangoes in recent months.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government expected an increase in Irwin mango exports to
Japan this year, with the price to move up, too, Wu Wei-ta,  chief of the
marketing  for the county's  Bureau of Agriculture, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Japan gave an order in 2006 to detain Taiwan mango exports at customs for
inspection after pesticide residue was found on the fresh fruit. Following that,
the numbers of shipments fell significantly.</P>
      <P>Since then, the county government has built a tracking system for local mango
production  and has tightened quality control and certification operations in
hopes of ensuring the quality and safety of the county's mango products, Wu
said. In doing so, local farmers and traders have won back Japan's trust in
buying Tainan County mangoes, Wu said.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the county may be allowed to export around 1,500 tons of
mangoes to Japan this year, with a price better than the NT$70 (US$2) per
kilogram posted last year, Wu noted.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday
criticized the United States for being "overbearing" in its opposition to
Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United

      <P>They made the remarks one day after a U.S. State Department official said that
"the United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally. This would include a referendum on whether to

      <P>Wang Tuoh, a major DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said that Taiwan has

their views.</P>
      <P>"The United States has no reason to object to it," Wang said, criticizing the
United States for being "overbearing.'</P>
      <P>Noting that U.S. spokesman Sean McCormack said that such a referendum "would

      <P>"China has deployed around one thousand missiles against Taiwan," Wang said,
asking if this is not creating cross-strait tensions. "The United States is
silent on the deployment, but is stern toward Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>Taipei city government's top publicity official, Yang Hsiao-tung, left for
Beijing Wednesday mainly to promote Taiwan tourism at the 2007 Beijing
International Tourism Expo slated for June 21-23.</P>
      <P>Yang is expected to officiate at the opening of the Taiwan Pavilion at the expo,
which will be showcasing tourism attractions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang is the first Taipei city official to visit Beijing since Taipei Mayor Hau
Lung-bin assumed office early this year.</P>
      <P>In a brief interview with CNA at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport before his
departure, Yang said he will join other private operators to promote Taiwan's
tourism attractions, including travel to hotspring resorts, at the expo and will
promote "city exchanges" between Taipei and Beijing, and other Chinese cities
and countries from around the world.</P>
      <P>Yang, who also serves as a spokesman for Taipei City Hall, said the Taiwan
Pavilion will be positioned independently at the expo -- not in the domestic
area nor in the international area -- to avoid Taiwan from being "dwarfed."</P>
      <P>The 2007 Beijing International Tourism Expo is expected to attract exhibitors
from over 80 countries and areas around the world to show off their tourism
specialties.</P>
      <P>At the Taiwan Pavilion, according to Yang, Taiwan's signature sweet -- tapioca
or "pearl tea" -- will be offered free of charge during the three-day run, as
well as instant "fun photo" stickers.</P>
      <P>Yang, meanwhile, declined to confirm speculation that he will meet officials
from Beijing's National Tourism Administration for talks on a wide range of
topics, including Taipei's continuing efforts to have the 2008 Olympic torch
come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council have said recently
that Taiwan is willing to re-negotiate the torch relay route with China so long
as Taiwan's national status is not downgraded.</P>
      <P>According to China's plan when it announced the torch relay route April 26, the
Olympic torch would travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Taipei and then
continue on to Hong Kong, Macau and several other Chinese cities before arriving
in the host city, Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rejected the route planning at that time, saying it deliberately
downgrades Taiwan's sovereign status. Taiwan wants the torch to come to Taipei
via a third country and travel on to another country before arriving in China.</P>
      <P>Yang is also scheduled to travel to Shanghai after the Beijing tourism expo to
meet officials and leaders from the private sector there for talks on city and
cultural exchanges between Taipei and Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT PROPOSES HOLDING EXTRA LEGISLATIVE SESSION JULY 9</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) proposed Wednesday that a special legislative
session be held July 9 to review a controversial bill concerning the
organization of the Central Election Commission (CEC).</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, the KMT's legislative caucus whip, insisted that the Legislative
Yuan must deal with the CEC bill "now that the central government's 2007 budget
bill has been passed."</P>
      <P>Hsu said the KMT will leave the door open for negotiations with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on the bill before its passage.</P>
      <P>Responding to the proposal, DPP legislative caucus convener Ker Chien-ming said
the date of the special session will be decided upon through inter-party
consultations.</P>
      <P>As to the agenda of the extra session, Ker said the DPP will not accept any
bills that violate the Constitution or any conditions attached to the passage of
the government's budget bills.</P>
      <P>Both the DPP and KMT favor holding an extra session, but differ on its agenda.</P>
      <P>Unlike the KMT, which aims to pass the CEC bill, the DPP expects the legislature
to pass a list of budget bills, including one concerning the operations of
state-owned enterprises and another one addressing a series of major development
projects.</P>
      <P>Owing to strong opposition from the DPP, the KMT-led "pan-blue alliance" --
which controls a slim majority in the legislature -- failed in its bid to
steamroll the CEC bill through the legislature during the legislative session
that ended last week and the previous session ended in January, despite the
alliance's strategy of holding the CEC bill hostage along with the 2007 budget
bill.</P>
      <P>The 2007 budget bill only passed the legislature on the final day of the last
session after the "pan-blue alliance" finally agreed to pass it in view of
growing public displeasure with their legislative tactics.</P>
      <P>The KMT has insisted that the 17 members of the CEC be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of seats they each hold in the legislature,
with no single party allowed to control more than two-fifths of the total seats.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP opposes any party-based proportional principle for the CEC's
formation on the ground that such a practice violates the "division of power"
provision set forth in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
, Wednesday gave his backing to the government's efforts to join world bodies,
but called on the government to employ feasible means to achieve that aim.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments while answering questions from reporters on the issue after
President Chen Shui-bian Monday proposed holding a referendum on the country's
bid to enter the United Nations as "Taiwan" along with the 2008 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the KMT supports all possible means that the government  might
pursue to help the country play a role in international organizations, including
the United Nations, Ma said that it is critical to apply the most feasible and
least risky means based on the "Taiwan-centric" notion so as to safeguard the
nation's dignity.</P>
      <P>Ma argued that "any precipitous moves will damage Taiwan" and "the government
must never use public referendums as a tool to score political points."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the question of which designation the country should adopt to
enter world bodies or take part in international activities, Ma urged the
government to be flexible in this regard to help create greater room for it to
play a role on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Chen's referendum plan has met with objections from the United States, which
called on Chen to show leadership by dropping the idea so as not to fuel cross-
Taiwan Strait tensions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A yearly vaccination may decrease the risk to cattle of contracting bovine
ephemeral fever (BEF), a viral cattle disease characterized by a short-term,
acute fever, which leads to its being named the "three day sickness, " according
to researchers of Tainan-based National Cheng Kung University (NCKU).</P>
      <P>NCKU President Lai Ming-chao, National Science Council Vice Chairman Tai Chien,
and Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih jointly hosted a press conference
Wednesday to announce the release of a new vaccine against mutant BEF virus,
developed by NCKU with the Tainan county government cooperation.</P>
      <P>BEF was first reported in South Africa in 1906. Taiwan was unaffected by
outbreaks of the acute fever in cattle until 1967. However, since then there
have been five major outbreaks, in 1967, 1983-1984, 1989-1990, 1996, and 1999,
with an average mortality rate of 5 percent.</P>
      <P>This viral disease usually spreads in summer and early autumn, with young cows
aged between six months and 2 years old most easily affected.  Flying  insect
vectors,  including  mosquitoes,  are responsible for the BEF transmission.</P>
      <P>Infected cattle develop symptoms including fever and dyspnea, while dairy cows
suffer a drop in production of approximately 50 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began performing BEF vaccination in 1985, with each animal being given
two or three doses of vaccine each year. However, given viral mutations the
traditional vaccine is no longer effective in guarding against outbreaks, NCKU
researchers said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the new vaccine was developed to protect against the mutant BEF
virus in Taiwan, Tai revealed that if a similar virus was to appear in China,
Taiwan would be delighted to assist the relevant Chinese authorities in
combating an outbreak.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would like to import crude oil from Russia to help diversify the
country's sources of oil imports, a visiting Taiwan economist said in Moscow
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, chairman of the Taiwan Futures Exchange and head of the private
Taiwan-Russia Association, said in an interview with a Moscow media outlet that
99.8 percent of the crude oil consumed in Taiwan is imported, thus securing
stable oil supplies is a top concern of the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes that it can import crude oil from Russia so as to lower reliance on
imports from the Middle East, an area rife with social instability and military
disturbances, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Importing crude oil from Russia, however, is not an easy task for Taiwan, Wu
said, adding that in the past, some importers have faced variable  quality in
the shipments,  and recently  experienced complications in securing supplies,
including difficulties involving transporting crude oil from the Ural Mountains
area and Russian Far East.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the Russian government to seriously consider cooperating with Taiwan
over these issues to benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu, a former vice premier of Taiwan, said that Taiwan sits in a
strategically important location in terms of regional security and crude oil
imports, pointing out that all oil tankers transporting imported crude oil for
Japan and South Korea pass through the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he said, Beijing's constant threats to use force against
Taiwan to solve cross-strait differences could also be threats to security and
stability of other countries in East Asia and the Asia-Pacific area as well.</P>
      <P>Wu continued that since Russia has maintained close connections with China,
Moscow could play an important role in influencing the development of cross-
Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wu and a Taiwanese delegation arrived in Moscow last week on a business trip.
Over the past several days, they have participated in a Taiwan-Russia
cooperation forum and have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) and an
agreement with public and private Russian organizations to bolster bilateral
exchanges between the two countries.</P>

      <P>A unit under the Hsinchu-based Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)
has developed a new "3D mouse" for computer games, with the aim of increasing
the entertainment value of games by offering omni-directional, full-movement
control over virtual characters, ITRI researchers reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>ITRI's Microsystems Technology Center (MTC) -- located outside the institute's
main base in Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan County -- has been pursuing
research and development of the mouse for about one year, and recently achieved
satisfactory results, they said, adding that the institute is now working on
transferring the related technologies to a local computer accessory
manufacturer.</P>
      <P>The 3D mouse has been developed based on micro-inertial sensing technology,
human movement calculation and simulation mechanisms to bring three-dimensional
sensing capabilities to the conventional mouse, MTC Associate Research Fellow Lu
Ying-ke explained.</P>
      <P>The mouse, Lu said, can detect user's body movements and transmit the signals
back to the computer via wireless communications to command the virtual
character to act according to user movements.</P>
      <P>The video game console-like mouse can then be used as a bat in baseball games, a
racket in tennis or badminton games, or even a handgun in shooting games to
create a "more-than-real" gaming experience, said Lu.</P>

      <P>Noting that 80 percent of the people in Taiwan support the country's plan to

      <P>Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations under the name of Taiwan will be the last means to safeguard its
democracy and human rights, Executive Yuan spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan people will not give it up, nor will they allow President Chen Shui-bian
to give it up," Shieh said, referring to the president's announcement Monday
that he hopes to hold such a referendum alongside the presidential election next
year.</P>
      <P>"Chen is not an authoritarian president, and he can't give up when another
country asks Taiwan to do things that run counter to democracy and human
rights," he added.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks one day after a U.S. State Department official said that
"the United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally. This would include a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name of 'Taiwan.'"</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has wanted to join the United Nations and the World Health
Organization in the name of Taiwan based on the idea that Taiwan has lifted its
martial rule for 20 years and that the people will play a decisive role in
determining its status and future.</P>
      <P>He noted that the desire of Taiwan people to join the international community
accords with human rights and democratic principles, and that no country that
champions human rights or democracy "should say no to Taiwan, or intimidate
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As the president represents the people, and a referendum will highlight
democracy and human rights, the president cannot but hold such a referendum to
solicit the maneuvering space for the nation, he said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's stance is legitimate in every way," he added.</P>
      <P>He noted that since Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in 1971, its
diplomatic allies have been repeatedly lured away by China, and its bid to join
international organizations has suffered repeated setback due to China's
obstruction.</P>
      <P>"That there have been changes in the status quo is no mistake, and one must see
what is being changed," he noted, saying that Taiwan has changed to safeguard
democracy and human rights, while China moves to mount an ever greater military
threat focused on Taiwan.</P>

robots competed as team against teams from China and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Wung Ching-chang,  chairman of TKU's Electoral  Engineering Department, said the
victory was the result of teamwork among 17 students participating in the Robo
Games in San Francisco and another 17 who remained in Taiwan to provide
technical aid. Wung added that "robotic designs emerged from collective
creativity and technological integration."</P>
      <P>In addition to NKU's awards, Chang Gung University won a silver medal in the
basketball competition, while National Cheng Kung University took bronze in the
penalty kick.</P>
      <P>TKU's robotic design team began participating in international robot
competitions in 2003. This year's team leader Yang Yu-ting, a graduate student
and the only woman on the team, said designing robots fills her with a sense of
fulfillment. Yang added that exchanges with other teams that join such
competitions is precious.</P>
      <P>David Calkins, the president of the Robotics Society of America and lecturer in
robotics and computer engineering at San Francisco State University,  said
international  robotic  games encourage scientific education and allows
participants to share their passion and knowledge with others.</P>
      <P>This year's Robo Games was the largest open game in the event's history, with

      <P>A biennial international children's television and film festival that will be

      <P>So far, Hu said, there have been submissions from Taiwan, India, Sweden,
Germany, France, the U.S. and the Philippines vying for six awards -- best
dramatic feature, best animation, best documentary, best TV program, Taiwan
award and special jury prize.</P>
      <P>This event has been trying to find a balance between "adults' perspective and
children's height, " said Wang Gun-yu, curator of the festival.</P>
      <P>The festival was previously held in 2004 and 2006 and received more than 230

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has designated July 15 as the day to mark the lifting of
martial law in Taiwan, Cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh said this year marks the 20th anniversary of the ending of martial law and
that the government has planned a series of activities, including concerts of
songs that were forbidden during the martial law era, exhibitions and the
issuance of memorial postage stamps.</P>
      <P>"Designating July 15 as a memorial day and the 60th anniversary activities of
the 228 Incident are an integral part of memorial activities in the hope of
understanding Taiwan's historic truth, " he said.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a Feb. 28, 1947 uprising against the corrupt
Kuomintang (KMT) government of the time. Rooted in this incident, the ensuing
"White Terror" period describes the brutal suppression of political dissents and
public discussion of the incident under martial law that lasted from May 19,
1949 to July 15, 1987.</P>
      <P>"Almost every family in Taiwan was directly or indirectly affected by martial
law," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>But 20 years after martial law, Taiwan now enjoys a democratic system and human
rights values that it can be proud of, he continued.</P>
      <P>Asked if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had the coming elections
in mind when it designated a day to mark the end of martial law seven years into
its rule, Shieh claimed that "the two things are irrelevant."</P>
      <P>"The government is worried that history will be left behind, truth will be
forgotten and reconciliation will be hard to achieve," Shieh said.</P>
      <P>He questioned why the KMT did not stage any memorial activities during the 13
years between 1987 and 2000 when it was swept from power by the DPP. To this
day, the KMT is still trying to evade its responsibility for the harm and
suffering it brought to the people of Taiwan during the 38 years of martial law,
he added.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:Truck Bomb Hits Baghdad Mosque, and 61 Are Killed

A suicide bomber barreled a truck filled with cooking gas and explosives into a
square bordered by a large Shiite mosque in the heart of Baghdad on Tuesday,
just as worshipers were finishing midday prayers. The Interior Ministry said at
least 61 people were killed and 130 wounded.

The attack took place as American forces continued a large-scale assault on
strongholds of Al Qaeda outside the capital where, they say, many of the vehicle
bombs are manufactured. The timing seemed intended to demonstrate that the
insurgents could still strike with near impunity, blindsiding the American
security crackdown in Baghdad.

Wall Street Journal:Toyota's New U.S. Plan: Stop Building Factories

Five years ago, Toyota Motor Corp. launched a factory-building blitz in the U.S.
that helped make it the world's largest auto maker. Now the architect of that
push and a senior member of the company's founding family are both urging a new
strategy for the U.S. -- hit the brakes.

Top Toyota executives are concerned that the car maker may have built too many
U.S. factories, in part to build political support by providing new jobs in lots

      <P>Taiwan should try to set priorities in efforts to seek Taiwan's return to the
United Nations after the United States expressed opposition to President Chen
Shui-bian's intention to push for a referendum on its U.N. bid under the name of
Taiwan, the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate suggested
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries, Ma Ying-jeou, a former KMT chairman, said he
believes the reason Washington opposed Taiwan's referendum plan is that it
understands the plan being formed to be not purely for the goal of returning to
the U.N. but for a "certain political purpose."</P>
      <P>The KMT raised the bid for resumption of Taiwan's membership in the U.N. every
year when it ran the country until 2000. In those days, the U.S. government
never voiced opinions against the bid, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was a founding member of the U.N. before it walked out of
the organization in 1971 after its rival, the People's Republic of China,
succeed in gaining admission to the U.N.</P>
      <P>Ma said it will be difficult to get Taiwan back into the United Nations and
pointed out that the task involves not just the matter of Taiwan's designation.
Taiwan needs to figure out why it can join the World Trade Organization but not
the U.N., and why it can attend the Olympic Games but is not allowed to enter
some other international organizations such as the WHO, he said, suggesting that
Taiwan learn from its setbacks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan needs to work out practical and possible strategies in bids for its space
in the international community, Ma added, citing the recent setback in seeking
the WHO membership</P>
      <P>Member states of the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making
arm -- rejected a proposal on Taiwan's membership application by a vote of
148-17 in mid-May. It was the first time Taiwan had sought full WHO membership,
instead of WHA observer status, in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Ma claimed, many influential WHA member states like Japan, the
U.S. and some European countries appeared to prefer Taiwan to seek observer
status in the WHA before seeking full membership. These countries all opposed
Taiwan's membership bid this year, he said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday the birth of the first Formosan
sambar deer developed from a frozen embryo will help boost local deer farmers
and increase the production of fresh deer antler velvet, an important ingredient
in some Chinese medicines.</P>
      <P>The COA reported that the deer was born April 16 and has grown to a weight of 10
kg.</P>
      <P>Kang Hsien-jen, an assistant researcher at the COA's Kaohsiung Animal
Propagation Station of the Livestock Research Institute, noted that researchers
collected the embryo Nov. 24, 2005, seven days after it was inseminated, froze
it and later implanted it into the uterus of a surrogate mother Aug. 9, 2006.
The calf was born 257 days later.</P>
      <P>Kang said the station staff were elated, believing it to be another breakthrough
in their breeding technology after their first deer born through artificial
insemination July 28, 2005.</P>
      <P>He noted that the frozen embryo technology will help improve the quality of the
species and that the breeding technology will also help favor deer that can
yield higher quantities of antler velvet.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that Taiwan has around 21,000 deer, with the Formosan sambar
deer accounting for around 85 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Noting that deer antler velvet can fetch good prices in Taiwan, at between
NT$1,000-NT$1,200 (US$30.3-US$36.36) per tael (around 38 g), he said the
development of the breeding technology will be profitable.</P>
      <P>Kang said the deer antler velvet each male deer can produce varies dramatically
from between 20 taels and 326 taels per year.</P>
      <P>"The number of male deer that have high velvet yields is small, " Kang said,
adding that a good stud deer can sell for between NT$100,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Kang added that Taiwan needs around 80 tons of deer antler velvet a year,
although it can only produce between 20 tons and 25 tons. Taiwan imports around
five tons from New Zealand and relies on "parallel imports" for its remaining
needs.</P>

      <P>Berger made his first trip to Taiwan in 1998. At that time, he was mayor of
Guatemala City, Guatemala's capital, and he visited Chen, who was mayor of
Taipei at the time.</P>
      <P>Berger recalled that he received a letter from Chen after he lost his first
presidential bid in 1999. In that letter, Berger said, Chen gave him enormous
encouragement while showing no trace of despair over his own loss in his Taipei
mayoral re-election bid.</P>
      <P>"That letter has profound meaning for me and my family. It gave me strength at a
low point in my career and has become one of my most treasured collector's
items, " Berger was quoted as having told Chen during their Wednesday meeting.</P>
      <P>Berger further said he looks forward to seeing the cordial Taiwan-Guatemala
relations become a model for mutual interaction among countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Berger will sign three agreements with Chen to boost bilateral
cooperation in various fields. Since Guatemala and Taiwan signed a free trade
agreement, Berger said, bilateral trade and commercial cooperation have further
expanded and Guatemala's exports registered a whopping 125 percent year-on-year
growth in 2006.</P>
      <P>Berger said he hopes more Taiwan companies will invest in Guatemala to further
enhance bilateral economic cooperation.</P>

      <P>Visiting Guatemalan President Oscar Rafael Berger Perdomo said Wednesday that
maintaining friendly diplomatic relations with Taiwan is not just his personal
decision but also "the common will of all Guatemalan people."</P>
      <P>Berger, who arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a five-day visit, made the remarks

    <HEADLINE>COA TO BOOST ANTLER VELVET YIELDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20 (CNA)
06/21/07  11:20:59
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday the birth of the first Formosan
sambar deer developed from a frozen embryo will help boost local deer farmers
and increase the production of fresh deer antler velvet, an important ingredient
in some Chinese medicines.</P>
      <P>The COA reported that the deer was born April 16 and has grown to a weight of 10
kg.</P>
      <P>Kang Hsien-jen, an assistant researcher at the COA's Kaohsiung Animal
Propagation Station of the Livestock Research Institute, noted that researchers
collected the embryo Nov. 24, 2005, seven days after it was inseminated, froze
it and later implanted it into the uterus of a surrogate mother Aug. 9, 2006.
The calf was born 257 days later.</P>
      <P>Kang said the station staff were elated, believing it to be another breakthrough
in their breeding technology after their first deer born through artificial
insemination July 28, 2005.</P>
      <P>He noted that the frozen embryo technology will help improve the quality of the
species and that the breeding technology will also help favor deer that can
yield higher quantities of antler velvet.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that Taiwan has around 21,000 deer, with the Formosan sambar
deer accounting for around 85 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Noting that deer antler velvet can fetch good prices in Taiwan, at between
NT$1,000-NT$1,200 (US$30.3-US$36.36) per tael (around 38 g), he said the
development of the breeding technology will be profitable.</P>
      <P>Kang said the deer antler velvet each male deer can produce varies dramatically
from between 20 taels and 326 taels per year.</P>
      <P>"The number of male deer that have high velvet yields is small, " Kang said,
adding that a good stud deer can sell for between NT$100,000 and NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>Kang added that Taiwan needs around 80 tons of deer antler velvet a year,
although it can only produce between 20 tons and 25 tons. Taiwan imports around
five tons from New Zealand and relies on "parallel imports" for its remaining
needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EAST ASIA FORUM BRINGS TOGETHER NGO EXECUTIVES TO DISCUSS AID WORK</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An international forum sponsored by Taiwan Overseas Aid (TOAID) opened in Taipei
Thursday for non-government organizations (NGOs) executives to exchange
expertise and experiences in post-disaster relief and long-term humanitarian aid
work.</P>
      <P>"The fourth  East Asia Forum brings  together  about  120 international aid
project managers from more than 10 countries to discuss aid operation strategies
and methods with an aim to upgrade international aid service quality," said a
TOAID spokesman.</P>
      <P>Keynote speakers at the two-day forum will include French and Japanese emergency
relief and long-term aid experts as well as executives of the five TOAID member
organizations, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The five NGOs that form TOAID are Compassion International Taiwan, the Eden
Social Welfare Foundation, the Field Relief Agency of Taiwan, the Noordhoff
Craniofacial Foundation and the Taiwan Root Medical Peace Corps.</P>
      <P>Topics listed on the agenda include emergency  relief and long-term aid for
landmine victims, key policy formulation for emergency medical aid, interaction
between NGOs and government organizations (GOs) , review of major aid projects
as well as philanthropy,  ethics and obstacles to international aid,  the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwanese NGOs have become increasingly active in international
disaster relief operations in recent years,  the spokesman said that many local
NGOs organized volunteer teams to take part in aid work in the wake of a tsunami
disaster in South Asia in 2004, a devastating earthquake in Pakistan in 2005 and
a similar deadly temblor in Indonesia in May 2006.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese NGOs are developing rapidly and have contributed much to
international humanitarian relief campaigns, the spokesman said Taiwan has yet
to mature in international aid work. It is hoped that the ongoing seminar will
help enhance public awareness of international aid work and assist local NGOs in
upgrading their relief expertise and techniques, the spokesman added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-tong urged China Thursday to speed
up negotiations with Taiwan on issues concerning visits to Taiwan by Chinese
tourists and the operations of cross-Taiwan  Strait charter passenger and cargo
flights.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks  during a seminar with a group of China-based Taiwanese
business people held in eastern Hualien County, in response to a recent proposal
by Beijing authorities that cross-strait weekend charter flights be launched at
the same time as the opening of visits by Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Beijing authorities need to accelerate the progress of talks on these
issues and resolve the remaining problems involved before both sides can decide
on the date for the launch of these two programs.</P>
      <P>While the technical problems regarding  the operations  of cross-strait
passenger charter flights have been settled, political problems are what both
sides need to overcome now, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In what has been considered by the MAC as the main obstacles impeding the
progress of cross-strait talks, China has referred to Taiwan as a tourist
destination within China, and insisted that cross-strait visits are not ones
"between two countries."</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's plan to stop over in the United States on the way to
her scheduled visit to Latin America is expected to be finalized next week,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Wang Chien-yeh, Lu will visit Paraguay in early July
to take part in activities marking the 50th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Paraguay, and is also planning to visit
two other Central American countries with diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ministry is targeting the Dominican Republic and Panama as the possible
destinations, but details of Lu's itinerary have yet to be finalized, MOFA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Hsueh  Mei-yu,  deputy  director-general  of the ministry's Department  of North
American  Affairs,  said Taiwan filed an application with Washington two weeks
ago for Lu's plan to make transit stops in the United States for the Latin
American trip.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government is expected to reply to the application within next week,
Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>Asked if Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum on the country's bid for U.N.
membership despite U.S. opposition will affect Lu's transit plan, Hsueh said she
cannot speculate how the United States is going to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is an established procedure for the arrangement of U.S.
transit plans for Taiwan leaders, Hsueh said she believes the U.S. government
will process Taiwan's application based on the principles of comfort,
convenience, security and dignity for the traveler.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has unveiled a plan to push for a referendum alongside
the 2008 presidential election on Taiwan's effort to apply to join the United
Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Although the U.S. government has expressed its opposition to the plan and warned

      <P>Visiting Guatemalan President Oscar Berger reaffirmed Thursday his country's
friendship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Berger said that diplomatic relations between Guatemala and Taiwan are stable
and stressed that he has a deep affection for Taiwan, which he called a very
wonderful country.</P>
      <P>Berger made the remarks in response to questions from reporters during a visit
to a naphtha cracking plant operated by the Formosa Plastic Corp. in Mailiao,
Yunlin County. Berger was accompanied by President Chen Shui-bian during the
visit.</P>
      <P>This is Berger's third visit to Taiwan. Nevertheless, the visit has drawn
widespread attention in Taiwan given the fact that Berger has come in the wake
of the severance of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and another Central American
country, Costa Rica.</P>
      <P>Chen said Wednesday that Berger's visit demonstrates his firm and genuine
friendship toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Wang Chien-yeh said Thursday
that Taiwan-Guatemala relations remain strong and that leaders of the two
countries are maintaining close interaction.</P>
      <P>On a local media report suggesting  it is "unusual" that Guatemalan Minister of
Foreign Affairs Gert Rosenthal has not come with Berger, Wang said the media
should not speculate unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, Rosenthal is not visiting Taiwan this time because he needs
to stay in Guatemala to receive several visiting foreign ministers from European
and South American countries.</P>
      <P>After maintaining formal ties with Taiwan for decades, Costa Rica secretly
established diplomatic relations with China early this month and cut off ties
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The development sparked concerns in Taipei about a possible domino effect
impacting Taiwan's diplomatic relations with other Central American nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has 24 diplomatic allies around the world, 12 of which are in Latin
America and the Caribbean region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON 'GREATER NUMBER OF TYPHOONS' THIS YEAR: CWB</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Central Weather Bureau (CWB) meteorologists disagreed  Thursday with speculation
that Taiwan is bound to experience a greater than usual number of typhoons this
year under the influence of La Nina, saying that it is still too early to tell.</P>
      <P>CWB forecasters said they do not agree with the speculations of the academic in
question based on an analysis conducted by the Japan Meteorological Agency that
the number of typhoons likely to directly hit Taiwan this year would be greater
than the usual three or four due to the influence of La Nina.</P>
      <P>According to CWB tallies, an average of 27 typhoons occurred in the western
Pacific and South China Sea areas each year over the past several decades, and
of the total, three or four directly affected Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said that La Nina is characterized by unusually cold ocean
temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific, compared to El Nino, which is
characterized by unusually warm ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific.</P>
      <P>They said currently, ocean temperatures in the Equatorial Pacific are at normal
levels, although these temperatures could turn colder than usual in months to
come.</P>
      <P>Arguing that it is still uncertain whether there will be a La Nina this year,
and that even if there is a La Nina, it would take months to tell, by which time
typhoon season would be over in the Taiwan area, the forecasters said it is
still too early to speculate that Taiwan should expect unusually greater number
of typhoons this year due to La Nina.</P>
      <P>Noting that July and August are usually the high season for typhoons in the
Taiwan area, the CWB forecasters said they will publicize their typhoon
forecasts for 2007 at the end of June.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Patients in Taiwan may have to wait for up to 33 years before a kidney is
available for transplant, a surgical doctor at the National Cheng Kung
University Hospital in Tainan, southern Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Po-chang, director of the hospital's Department of Surgery, said he has
based his estimate on the fact that there are around 6,000 patients in Taiwan
awaiting kidney transplants, but only 180 patients who actually receive the
transplant surgery each year.</P>
      <P>He said the concept of organ donation is popular in foreign countries, so
foreign patients may only have to wait for three or five years for transplants.
In Taiwan, the waiting period may be 10 times longer.</P>
      <P>Lee cited his hospital as an example, saying that around 700 patients in the
hospital are awaiting kidney transplants, but only around 30 kidney transplant
surgeries are conducted every year. This means that those who are waiting for an
available kidney must wait at least 23 years, he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the unpopularity of the idea of organ donation in Taiwan, there
are other problems, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that a kidney transplant surgery can only receive a reimbursement of
NT$19,800 (US$600) from the National Health Insurance program, which he
described as a meager amount compared to the large sum of time and money the
hospital must spend on training the surgical team.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwanese transplant medicine needs to undergo reform in
several aspects.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian granted a special pardon to imprisoned "rice bomber"
Yang Ju-men Thursday in accordance with the Constitution and an amnesty law, a
Presidential Office spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chen signed the special pardon Thursday in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
where he played host to a state banquet in honor of visiting Guatemalan
President Oscar Berger Perdomo and his entourage, according to Lee Nan-yang,
director-general of the Department of Public Affairs under the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Yang, who is serving time at an open prison in Hualien County in eastern Taiwan
for offending the Firearms Control Act, is expected to be freed by nightfall
after the pardon order signed by the president reaches the Ministry of Justice
in Taipei, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Chen announced Tuesday his decision to grant a special pardon to Yang on the
grounds that he had behaved well in prison over the past three years and should
be in no danger of re-offending. Chen said he had consulted with Vice President
Annette Lu and relevant authorities concerning Yang's case and determined that
the terrorist should be given special consideration given the situation.</P>
      <P>Chen's special pardon announcement was made in response to a non-binding
resolution adopted by the legislature June 15 in which the president was asked
to pardon Yang.</P>
      <P>Yang was sentenced in 2005 to seven-and-a-half years in prison plus a fine of
NT$100,000 (US$3,030.3) for planting 17 explosive devices in public places
around Taipei over a one-year period until he surrendered in November 2004.</P>
      <P>Claiming to be an opponent of the government's rice import policy, Yang always
included small amounts of rice in his homemade, "non-lethal" explosives, which
is where Yang's nickname came from. Nobody was injured in his year-long bombing
campaign.</P>
      <P>During his trial, Yang said he had mounted the bombing campaign to attract the
government's attention to the plight of local farmers after the country's
accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002.</P>
      <P>In January 2006, the Taiwan High Court reduced Yang's sentence to five years and
10 months, describing his motive as "not malicious."</P>

      <P>Taiwan will continue to communicate with the United States on its plan to hold a
referendum on the country's bid to join the United Nations, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Mei-yu, deputy director of the ministry's Department of North American
Affairs,  made the remarks after a U.S. State Department  official reiterated
Washington's  opposition to the proposal.</P>
      <P>"The United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.  This would include a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name of 'Taiwan, '" State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack said.</P>
      <P>McCormack stressed that in line with its "one China" policy, the United States
does not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require
statehood, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that Taiwan and the United States have communicated on the issue for
more than one year, and that they know each other's stance through various
channels.</P>
      <P>She noted that President Chen Shui-bian declared several months ago that he
would promote the bid to join the United Nations in the name of Taiwan, and that
he conveyed this to several U.S. delegations during visits they made to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has continued to communicate with the United States on the issue, and
both sides are aware of the respective policies and stances," she added.</P>
      <P>However,  she also claimed that the U.S. State Department official's remarks
"may only be reiterating its firm stance," and she further claimed that the U.S.
official use of the word "oppose" "might only be a tone to stress its firm
stance."</P>
      <P>She said Taiwan and the United States are well aware that they have different
viewpoints and predicted that "heated discussion will not affect the overall
relations between the two sides."</P>
      <P>She also said Chen's plan to hold a referendum on the nation's U.N. bid is not
an attempt to change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, and does not run
counter to his "four noes" pledge made in his 2000, and again in 2004 inaugural

under the name "Chinese Taipei, " Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chen Ming-

      <P>Speaking during an informal gathering with the media in Hualien County, Chen
said the IOC has decided that the agreement should apply to the 2008 Olympic
Games in Beijing and has written Taiwan about its decision.</P>
      <P>In what Taiwan considered intentional moves to downgrade the country's status,
China offered to include Taiwan as the first stop of a "domestic" torch-relay
route for the 2008 Olympic Games and referred to Taiwan as "Taipei, China",
implying that Taiwan is part of China. That offer was rejected by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Owing to Beijing's opposition, Taiwan has been barred from most international
activities, and where Taiwan is allowed to participate, it is forbidden from
using its official name -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, several pro-Taiwan members of the U.S. Congress put forth
legislation urging the IOC to allow Taiwan to compete in the 2008 Olympic Games
using the national name, flag and anthem of choice.</P>
      <P>Congressional members said it is discriminatory, and therefore against the

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday that feels heartache over the
Legislative Yuan's freezing of a large chunk of the government's 2007 budget and
hopes a special legislative session can be held to pass certain urgent budget
bills.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said he was grateful for the
legislature's approval of the government's annual budget plan last Friday before
going into summer recess.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the 197-day delay in the budget bill's passage has
adversely impacted the economy, particularly hindering the launch of NT$70.6
billion-worth of new public investment or infrastructure construction projects.
The delay could result in a slowdown of the country's economic growth by an
estimated 0.25 to 0.3 percentage points, he lamented.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chang said, as much as NT$62 billion of the government's 2007

The frozen amount cannot be used pending further review by the legislature on a
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Budget Act doesn't offer any basis to justify the so-called
"partial budget freeze, " Chang, who was a seven-term legislator before assuming
the premiership, said the legislature only cut off the administration's budget
proposals or passed them before the "rotation of the political party in power"
or the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) grip of power.</P>
      <P>Describing the legislative-engineered  "budget freeze" as a by-product of
partisan strife, Chang said the move has threatened the well-being of the
public.</P>
      <P>Chang called for the holding of an extra legislative session as soon as possible
to lift the "budget freeze" and screen a number of other critical budget bills,
including one concerning the expansion of public infrastructure construction
projects worth NT$77.4 billion, which form part of an ambitious five-year NT$500
billion development plan.</P>
      <P>Another budget bill that needs to be addressed urgently concerns the operations
of state-owned enterprises and several government-run development funds totaling
NT$4.2 trillion, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the accumulated amount of these long-stalled budget bills far
exceeds the government's 2007 budget, Chang said their early passage is critical
to the country's overall development.</P>
      <P>During the Cabinet meeting, Chang directed Vice Premier Chiou I-jen to form a
supraministerial task force to deal with issues related to the NT$62 billion in
frozen budget so as to ensure smooth government operations and realize a 4.6
percent economic growth target.</P>
      <P>According to the Legislative Yuan-approved budget bill, the government's
revenues for 2007 are set at NT$1.48 trillion, while the expenditure is
projected at NT$1.62 trillion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming said the party caucus will
come up with a motion urging the legislature to open a special legislative
session July 1.</P>
      <P>"We hope the special legislative session can start July 1 and last for 10 to 14
days to address a large number of critical bills, " Ker said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the budget bills mentioned by Chang, Ker said the DPP caucus also
expects the special session to deliberate certain other long-shelved key bills,
including amendments to the Income Tax Law aimed at canceling decades-old income
tax exemption privileges for military personnel and elementary  and junior high
school teachers, as well as amendments to the farmers stipend statute to raise
the monthly allowances for elderly farmers to NT$6,000 from the current
NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>As the main opposition Kuomintang already proposed that the legislature hold a
special session July 9 to address an amendment package  to the Central Election
Commission  organic statute, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng is expected
to call a cross-party consultative meeting to hammer out the timing and the
agenda for the proposed special session, analysts said.</P>

      <P>Chthonic -- a Taiwanese black metal band -- will voice support for Taiwan's full
participation in the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" during a concert
tour of America and Canada in July and September, bandleader Freddy Lin said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chthonic will perform in the 2007 Ozzfest tour, which is an annual tour of the
United States featuring heavy metal, hard rock and black metal groups, in more
than 30 American cities.</P>
      <P>The government asked Chthonic to voice support for Taiwan's U.N. bid during the
tour, in association with a series of activities to be held to promote Taiwan's
full participation in the U.N. in New York in September.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwanese entertainers  avoid political questions  and occasions to prevent
their Chinese market being compromised, Lin said, adding that Chthonic is
willing to cooperate with the government's promotion and feels obliged to
contribute to Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Lin said the band has named its concert "UNlimited Taiwan," which signifies the
unlimited potential of Taiwan and also shows how the U.N. has limited Taiwan's
full participation as a sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hopes the band's endeavors and musical power in the concerts will
help arouse international  awareness of Taiwan's difficulties in joining
international organizations, and will prompt more friends to support Taiwan's

      <P>A group of lawmakers from the ruling and opposition camps urged the government
Thursday to impose strict controls on the erection of WiMAX base stations, which
they said pose a great risk to the health of those living nearby.</P>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Wang Yu-ting and her ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) counterpart Tien Chiu-chin issued the call at a news
conference after government authorities recently revealed a plan to allow for
the establishment of WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access)
base stations.</P>
      <P>Wang and Tien asked the National Communications Commission (NCC) to review its
planned opening of WiMAX base stations and demanded that it not issue licenses
for base stations before WiMAX safety has been fully assured.</P>
      <P>According to the two legislators, WiMAX base stations will be more  powerful
than cell phone  base stations  in transmitting electromagnetic radiation,
posing an even greater health threat.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  representatives  from  the Taiwan  Environmental Protection Union
also suspect that some 20 residents in Tainan City diagnosed with cancer are
victims of electromagnetic radiation released by cell phone base stations.</P>
      <P>However,  officials  from  the  Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA)
and the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs were reserved about their concerns over the negative health effects of
WiMAX.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-chi, an IDB section chief, said that it is "too early" to talk about the
dangers of WiMAX, as no WiMAX base stations, whose power transmission efficiency
and electromagnetic radiation is lower, have been erected in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to an EPA official, the government will adjust its regulations on the
establishment of WiMAX base stations in compliance with the rules of the World
Health Organization, which is expected to release a new report on
electromagnetic radiation next year.</P>

      <P>The free trade agreements (FTAs) Taiwan has signed with Central American
countries will help boost trade between Taiwan and those nations, Central
American exhibitors said Thursday in an international food show.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-El Salvador-Honduras FTA was signed May 7 and became the third FTA
established between Central American nations and Taiwan, which has inked
separate FTAs with Panama, Guatemala and Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>With more products  from both sides  enjoying  tariff-free incentives, El
Salvador is looking to export more sugar, coffee and seafood to Taiwan, said
Mauricio Chavarria, Marketing Manager of EXPORTA -- a Salvadoran government
agency in charge of export promotion, which is the equivalent of the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>El Salvador  was among several nations,  including  Panama, Guatemala, Nicaragua
and Honduras, that jointly set up an FTA Nations Hall at the 2007 Taipei
International Food Show, which is being held from June 21-24. The Latin American
nations are showcasing products such as coffee, seafood, sauces, juices and
meat.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan manufactures high-quality machinery, which is what El Salvador needs.
Once the FTA kicks in, Salvadoran industries will benefit from the lower prices
of Taiwanese products, " Chavarria said.</P>
      <P>"Without the FTA, you would not see many products displayed here, " said Rodrigo
Coba, general manager of a Panamanian company that sells products made from the
noni fruit. Coba's company has secured its first distributor in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Panama became the first Central American country to sign an FTA with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"El Salvador intends to keep doing business with Taiwan, although we import a
lot of products from China, " Chavarria said, adding that El Salvador's limited
manufacturing capability is not capable of handling a large market like China
yet.</P>
      <P>"And we would like to trade with Taiwan because of your democracy and your
assistance in fishery, agriculture and infrastructure in El Salvador. I do not
see China buying a large amount of products from El Salvador at the moment, " he
said.</P>
      <P>After the FTA goes into effect, he said, El Salvador can trade coffee with
Taiwan directly instead of through Japan, so that consumers in Taiwan will get
Salvadoran coffee at a cheaper price.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), bilateral trade between Taiwan
and El Salvador was valued at US$80.48 million for 2006, with Taiwan enjoying a
trade surplus of US$62.5 million.</P>
      <P>Central American countries can be Taiwan's gateway to the North American market,
as Taiwanese manufacturers can also take advantage of the Central America-
Dominican Republic-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR).</P>

      <P>Maintaining the status quo of the Republic of China is the position of the

China.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's position is that we should maintain the status quo of the ROC," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after Mao Kao-wen, chairman of the presidium of the KMT
Central Advisory Committee, told a meeting of the presidium that he will propose
to Ma that the current relationship across the Taiwan Strait is one between "two
Chinas," with the ROC based in Taiwan and the People's Republic of China based
in China.</P>
      <P>The two sides should move toward "one China" in the future, Mao said, adding

      <P>The Bush Administration is now more concerned about the stance of Frank Hsieh,
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate, toward
President Chen Shui-bian's plan to hold a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid, a
political observer in Washington said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With less than one year left of Chen's tenure, the U.S. government is now
showing more interest in Hsieh's attitude toward the issue, as Ma Ying-jeou, the
opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) presidential candidate for 2008 election, has
made known his stance in this regard recently, added the observer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>Chen unveiled Monday his plan to promote a referendum on Taiwan's bid to enter
the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" to be held alongside the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen's plan immediately encountered strong opposition from the U.S. government,
which declared that it opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.</P>
      <P>A U.S. State Department official pointed out that such a referendum will have no
practical impact on Taiwan's U.N. status but will increase tension in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the source, some people believe that the harsh attitude from the
U.S. government is due largely to the fact that the United States is conducting
high-level talks with China and that the State Department's disapproving  words
were spoken to mitigate pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The observer noted that the Bush Administration was obliged to expressed its
stance strongly and openly after failing to convince Chen through private
channels not to make the move.</P>
      <P>The Bush Administration now is hopeful that Hsieh's attitude will differ from
Chen's, the observer said, adding that Chen is seen as pandering to local voters
at the expense of Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>

      <P>There are at least 3,000 infants and children in Taiwan who are victims of drug
or alcohol abuse and are facing survival crises, the Child Welfare League
Foundation reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Most of these children who are exposed to drugs or alcohol are facing crisis of
survival, crisis of delayed development and crisis of suicidal tendency as a
result of long-term mental and psychological trauma, foundation experts said.</P>
      <P>The experts said 239 children from cases that the foundation has helped or
intervened in are victims of drug or alcohol exposure.</P>
      <P>Of them, 48.6 percent have alcoholic or drug abusing adults who are their only
caregivers.</P>
      <P>Of these adults, 79.1 percent are also jobless, 56 percent are debt-ridden, 36.8
percent are mentally challenged and 39.7 percent are child-abusers who sometimes
even feed drugs and booze to their children to calm them down, foundation
experts said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min, executive director of the foundation, said that islandwide, a total
of 1,212 infants and children were found to be victims of drug or alcohol
exposure in 2006.</P>
      <P>Wang quoted statistics compiled by the Children's Bureau under the Ministry of
the Interior as indicating that the number of children  from  high-risk
families  who have received  expert intervention had surpassed 15,000 as of
early this year.</P>
      <P>Of these 15,000 children, about 10 percent were victims of drug or alcohol
exposure, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang quoted a U.S. study as reporting that children who are victims of drug or
alcohol abuse are three times more likely to be physically  abused  than their
counterparts  from non-drug  or non-alcoholic families.</P>
      <P>These children are also four times more likely to suffer neglect, Wang added.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chung-hsiung said Thursday that the public should refrain from
responding in an "intuitive and political" way to the re-appointment of all 16
Central Election Commission (CEC) commissioners.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks one day after he submitted the list of the original 16
commissioners to President Chen Shui-bian for approval. All of them were re-
appointed and former Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung also continued to head the
commission.</P>
      <P>"In view of the sensitivity of the opposition camp on the matter, as well as
taking into consideration the national interests and the practical needs of the
law, " Chang said, he submitted the old list after the tenure of the previous
CEC commissioners expired June 16.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the operations of the CEC cannot be disrupted, noting that the
previous CEC set Jan. 12 for the next legislative elections, which will adopt
the new "single-member constituency, two vote" electoral system. The new
legislature will also see its seats cut by half to 113 from the current 225.</P>
      <P>"Whether at the central or local levels, there are many new measures awaiting
decisions from the CEC," he said.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations,  the CEC should install  11 to 19 commissioners for a
three-year tenure. Apart from the CEC chairman, none of the commissioners are
paid.</P>
      <P>The regulations state that commissioners should include those with no party
affiliation and that commissioners of a single party should not exceed two-
fifths of the total seats.</P>
      <P>The KMT has wanted the formation of the CEC to be recommended by political
parties in proportion to the number of seats they each hold in the legislature,
with no single party allowed to control more than two-fifths of the total seats.</P>
      <P>The version of a KMT bill regarding the CEC formation failed to pass the last
opposition-controlled legislative session due to serious clashes between the

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
supports a plan to hold a referendum on the country's bid to join the United
Nations under the name of "Taiwan, " a spokesman for Hsieh's campaign office
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chao Tien-lin said Hsieh promoted a bid to join the United Nations in the name
of "Taiwan" 16 years ago and added that Hsieh debated the issue at the time with
John Chiang, then-minister of foreign affairs and now a legislator of the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The plan is not only being advocated by President Chen Shui-bian, who expressed
the wish to hold such a referendum earlier this week, according to Chao.</P>
      <P>Noting that a U.S. State Department official has reiterated Washington's
opposition to the referendum proposal, Hsieh said that it is only natural that
the two countries "have different stances."</P>
      <P>"The United States opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.  This would include a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name of 'Taiwan, '" State Department
spokesman Sean McCormack said.</P>
      <P>McCormack stressed that in line with its "one China" policy, the United States
does not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require
statehood, including the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Despite the U.S. opposition, "Taiwan can still create a win-win situation after
a full and comprehensive communication with the United States," Chao quoted
Hsieh as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG MAYOR UPSET WITH CUTTING OF EDUCATION SUBSIDIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  June 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu expressed strong dissatisfaction Thursday over a
Ministry of Education (MOE) decision to cut this year's subsidies for the city's
two English learning programs for adult residents and parents with their
children.</P>
      <P>Hu vowed that he will appeal the ministry's decision to the Cabinet and failing
that, will pursue the case through administrative litigation.</P>
      <P>The two English language programs cost NT$2.74 million per year, but the
Taichung city government has been informed that because it "failed to cooperate
with a major ministry policy" on screening and identifying talented students
last year, the subsidies will no longer be forthcoming this year.</P>
      <P>Hu pointed out that Taichung's performance in carrying out the two language
programs ranked fourth nationwide last year and said the MOE should not have cut
its subsidies for the city using a "totally irrelevant reason."</P>
      <P>"The city of Taichung submits NT$300 billion (US$9.08 billion) in tax revenues a
year to the national coffers. How could the central government withhold the
subsidies from us in this way?" he asked, adding that "the subsidies come from
the tax money paid by us."</P>
      <P>Hu said that although he can easily find NT$2.74 million to meet the shortfall
from elsewhere, he cannot comply with the "ill will" of the central government
but will seek redress for the unfair treatment of Taichung's citizens.</P>

hands to ask their residents to switch off and unplug all electrical appliances
for 10 minutes on Friday.</P>
      <P>The campaign, titled "Let the Earth Cool Off a Little: Unplug Your Appliances to

    <HEADLINE>COED MURDERESS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE UNTIL SEPTEMBER: MOJ</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A woman convicted of murdering her classmate at National Tsinghua University
more than nine years ago will be eligible for parole this September, a Ministry
of Justice (MOJ) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a United Daily News report that the Kaohsiung
Women's Prison in the southern port city of Kaohsiung had applied for parole for
Hung Hsiao-huei, who is serving an 18-year prison term for murdering her
classmate Hsu Chia-chen and mutilating her corpse in March 1998 in an auditorium
of the prestigious university in Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The newspaper report is false, " the MOJ official said, adding that the
Kaohsiung prison authorities have not filed a parole application for Hung
because she will not be eligible for parole until this fall.</P>
      <P>Hung was sentenced to 15 years in prison for killing Hsu and three-and-a-half-
years for mutilating the body. Her murder sentence is not eligible for
commutation under an amnesty statute passed by the legislature earlier this
month, but she is qualified to have her mutilation sentence halved.</P>
      <P>Following the commutation, the MOJ official said, Hung's prison term will end
April 2, 2014.</P>
      <P>According to the official, Hung served her time behind bars at Taipei Prison and
Taoyuan Prison from January 1999 through March 2001. She was transferred to
Kaohsiung Women's Prison March 21, 2001 and has been there since.</P>
      <P>The official said Hung has behaved well since her incarceration and has
converted to Christianity.</P>
      <P>As the best educated inmate at the Kaohsiung Women's Prison, Hung teaches other
inmates English and other subjects, prison sources said, adding that she has
received citations for quitting smoking and writing Bible and other religious
scriptures, as well as winning championships in calligraphy and essay writing.</P>
      <P>Prison sources said Hung is unwilling  to give any media interviews and looks
forward to continuing her graduate studies after regaining her freedom.</P>
      <P>In addition to serving a long prison term, Hung has to compensate Hsu's parents
with NT$24.17 million. Prison sources said Hung hopes society can forgive her,
allowing her to stand on her own feet and save money to repay Hsu's parents.</P>
      <P>Hung and Hsu were rivals in a love triangle, but the Taiwan High Court verdict
ruled that it was Hung's unauthorized use of Hsu's credit card that led to the
murder.</P>
      <P>Regarding Hung's intent to murder, the verdict said it was based on the fact
that the victim was brutally beaten before Hung poured a powerful corrosive
chemical on her that disfigured her body and led to her death. Hung later
dragged Hsu's body to the rear of the auditorium to keep it from being found.</P>
      <P>The cold-blooded campus murder shocked society at the time. Both Hung and Hsu
were second-year graduate students at Tsinghua University's radiobiology
institute at the time of the murder.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREED `RICE BOMBER' CALLS FOR MORE CONCERN FOR CHILDREN, FARMERS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly released "rice bomber" Yang Ju-men shunned the media limelight Thursday
but called for more public concern for the well-being of the country's children
and farmers.</P>
      <P>Yang arrived in Taipei late that day from an open prison in Hualien County in
eastern Taiwan after President Chen Shui-bian formally granted him a special
pardon earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Responding to press inquiries about his feelings after regaining freedom, Yang,
who planted bombs around Taipei City as a way to air his grievances, claimed
that he is "only an ordinary person" unworthy of media attention. He said he
hopes to see the media and the public turn their attention to welfare services
for children and farmers.</P>
      <P>Yang then traveled back to his old home in Changhua in central Taiwan in the
company of his brother.</P>
      <P>Yang's father who is residing in the northern port city of Keelung expressed his
gratitude for President Chen's granting of a special pardon to his son. "I hope
Ju-men can find a job in Changhua and will never offend law in the rest of his
life," his father said.</P>
      <P>Wu Yin-ning, a Changhua-based freelancer who has maintained regular
correspondence with Yang during Yang's incarceration, said she plans to publish
a book in July on the "rice bomber" incident and the plight of local farmers
based on Yang's more than 100 letters to her over the past few years. The
proceeds from book sales will be donated for school lunch for children from
impoverished families, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Yang was sentenced in 2005 to seven-and-a-half years in prison plus a fine of
NT$100,000 (US$3,030.3) for planting 17 explosive devices in public places
around Taipei over a one-year period until he turned himself in November 2004.</P>
      <P>Identifying himself as an opponent of the government's rice import policy, Yang
always sprinkled small amounts of rice in his homemade explosives, which is
where Yang's nickname came from. Nobody was injured in his year-long bombing
campaign.</P>
      <P>During his trial, Yang said he had mounted the bombing campaign to attract the
government's attention to the plight of local farmers after the country's
accession to the World Trade Organization in 2002.</P>
      <P>In January 2006, the Taiwan High Court reduced Yang's sentence to five years and
10 months, saying his motive was not malicious.</P>
      <P>While announcing his decision to grant a special pardon to Yang in his speech
delivered at a luncheon with members of the Navy's 131 Fleet in Keelung Tuesday
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, Chen said Yang deserves compassion and is
not expected to break the law again as he has behaved well during his time
behind bar.</P>
      <P>Yang's pardon marks the second presidential pardon since Chen assumed office in
May 2000. He first granted special pardon to 21 special prison inmates in 2000.</P>
      <P>Yang first served at a prison in Taipei and was transferred to an open prison in
Hualien early this year because of his good behavior. He works on a farm in the
Hualien open prison.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for a pro-Yang advocacy group said the special pardon is "belated
justice."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bank raised key interest rates Friday by 0.25 basis points,
marking the 12th hike since October 2004.</P>
      <P>Following the hike, the discount rate stands at 3.12 percent, the rate on
accommodations with collateral at 3.5 percent, and the rate on accommodations
without collateral at 5.375 percent, all hitting the highest levels since
September 2001.</P>
      <P>Also raised Friday is the required reserve ratio on foreign currency deposits,
which is up significantly from 0.125 percent to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Central bank officials said the adjustment is aimed at narrowing the wide gap
existing between the required reserve ratio on foreign currency deposits and
that for Taiwan dollar deposits, which averages 5.3 percent at present.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to prompt banks to cut interest rates for foreign  currency
deposits,  slowing down capital outflow and stimulating an appreciation of the
Taiwan dollar, market analysts said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, central bank officials said the hike of key interest rates is
warranted give the rise in market rates and the projected increase in
inflationary pressure and economic growth in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Citing forecasts by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, the officials said the country's inflation rate is likely to
increase from 0.99 percent in the first half of this year to 1.93 percent in the
second half, as the rise in wholesale prices gradually feed into consumer prices
and unit labor costs return to positive growth.</P>
      <P>In addition, with the steady economic expansion in Asia and Europe expected to
boost Taiwan's exports, Taiwan's economic growth is projected to rise from 4.27
percent in the first half of this year to 4.48 percent in the second half, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Members of the financial sector predicted that the central bank will further
adjust the key interest rates upward in September.</P>

presidential election on Taiwan's U.N. bid, which prompted opposition from the
United States.</P>

as soon as possible."</P>

      <P>Two former advisers to Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian urged the United States
to recognize Taiwan as a sovereign country and establish diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-min and Wu Li-pei, who is also founder of the Formosa Foundation, made
the appeal at a press conference held in Los Angeles.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the main goal of the establishment of the Formosa Foundation five
years ago was to challenge the "one China" policy of the United States, and that
now the appeal is still more imperative.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States should recognize both China and Taiwan, Wu said it
is necessary to tell the American public about the unfair treatment the
Taiwanese people is enduring.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, more than half of Americans do not even know that there are no
diplomatic relations between the United States and Taiwan. Wu noted that it's
important to make the American people understand that the establishment of
U.S.-Taiwan official ties are crucial to the economic, political and military
futures of both countries.</P>
      <P>Wu added that 29 Taiwanese young people participating in a series of training
courses organized by his foundation will begin visiting U.S. congressmen next
week in a bid to lobby for "recognizing and establishing diplomatic ties with
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Peng, who teaches some of the training courses, noted that the policy of the
United States toward Taiwan is contradictory in that it hails Taiwan's democracy
and freedom while refusing to recognize Taiwan diplomatically.</P>
      <P>Being that the major U.S. presidential hopefuls are now bringing forward their
campaign policies, Peng said it's the proper time for Taiwan to present an
appeal to the American people in a bid to change the "one China" policy of the
U.S. government.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's electronics industry is facing fierce competition from South Korea,
while the local financial services industry is less competitive than that in
Hong Kong and Singapore, the head of a private think tank said Friday,
suggesting that Taiwan might rank last among the four Asian Dragons.</P>
      <P>The four Asian Dragons refer to South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the Polaris Research Institute, made the remarks
while offering the institute's forecast on Taiwan's economic prospects this year
at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Liang predicted that Taiwan's economic growth is likely to reach 4.31 percent
this year, adding that the manufacturing industry is expected to grow further to
4.82 percent.</P>
      <P>However, amidst slowed growth in the construction industry and other industries,
the industrial production growth rate will drop to 4.37 percent, while the
service industry is expected to register a 4.36 percent rise this year, Liang
went on.</P>
      <P>Liang noted that the total output of Taiwan's service industry, which accounts
for about 72 percent of the total GDP, has not grown as fast as expected in
recent years. Moreover, Liang said that Taiwan's economy relies too heavily on
the electronics industry, which is encountering strong competition from South
Korea,</P>
      <P>In addition, the Korean won has been appreciating against the New Taiwan dollar
over the years, but Taiwan's export performance is not as good as South Korea's,
Liang noted.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan cannot compete with South Korea when it has an advantage in price,
what should Taiwan do when it does not have a price advantage?"Liang said.</P>
      <P>Giving the institute's forecast on the price of goods, Liang said that the
increased price of imported goods has resulted in an increase in the Wholesale
Price Index (WPI) and exported goods prices, but not in the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) and the core CPI.</P>
      <P>This year's CPI growth rate is predicted to grow by 1.5 percent, and the

    <HEADLINE>HOSPITAL SUCCEEDS IN TREATING ALLERGIC DISEASES WITH HERBAL PATCHES</HEADLINE>

      <P>A traditional Chinese medicine hospital in southern Taiwan claimed Friday that
it has achieved good results in treating more than 500 asthma and allergic
rhinitis patients with herbal patches.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Municipal Chinese Medicine Hospital began to treat patients with
bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis last summer by sticking patches with
specially prepared herbal blends to selected acupuncture points on the back on
the three hottest days of the year.</P>
      <P>The treatment program was launched based on Chinese medicine literature that
using this method to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis for three consecutive
years can achieve an over 80 percent success rate.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Chien-chih, a doctor in charge of the treatment program, the
three hottest days of a year come after the summer solstice.</P>
      <P>He added that according to the Chinese calendar, the three hottest days of 2007
will fall on July 16, July 25 and Aug. 14, and that these days are believed to
be the best opportunities to boost the patients' "yang" energy and strengthen
their immune systems.</P>
      <P>Chen said the method involves the use of a herbal paste made from a variety of
herbs that can help strengthen vital "yang" energy and eliminate pathogens when
applied to relevant acupoints, and that a gravely ill patient may receive three
extra treatments in addition to the treatments on the three supposedly hottest
days.</P>
      <P>He said the hospital will continue to use the therapy on patients with asthma
and allergic rhinitis this summer, and that interested patients can make
reservations for treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAOKONG CABLE CAR TO BE INAUGURATED JULY 4: TAIPEI MAYOR</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The long-expected Maokong cable car system is scheduled to be inaugurated for
commercial operations July 4, if the system passes a battery of tests and
checks, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the announcement at a meeting of the city's Bureau of Transportation,
held to review the progress of the cable car project.</P>
      <P>According to the operator, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC), the cable car
will run from 9:00 a.m. to 22: 00 p.m. on weekdays, and will begin operations a
half hour earlier on weekend and holidays, in accordance with the opening hours
of the Taipei Zoo, one of the cable car terminals.</P>
      <P>In a report on operational drills of the cable car system, which runs from the
popular Taipei Zoo to Muzha's Maokong tea-production area, TRTC officials said
at the meeting that thunder storms in Muzha were the greatest challenge facing
the new transportation system.</P>
      <P>When thunder strikes, all 144 cabins of the cable car system must stop running
and all passengers be evacuated as soon as possible. This is particularly
troublesome as it is difficult to accurately predict thunder storms, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>To address this problem, the TRTC has consulted with the Taiwan Power Company on
how to detect the occurrence of lightning strikes and how long thunder storms,
while planning to purchase a lightning detection system, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to assuage public concerns over the cable car safety, Yang Hsi-an,
deputy secretary-general of the city government, said passengers in the cabin
will not be affected by thunder storms because the cable care system is equipped
with lightning conductors.</P>
      <P>According to the city officials, ticket prices for the Maokong cable car line,
which will have four stations, have been set at NT$30, NT$40 and NT$50. There is
also a "One-Day" ticket available for NT$250 which may be used multiple times in
a 24 hour period.</P>
      <P>Ticket prices will be reviewed and adjusted 18 months after the cable car
system's inauguration, officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S U.N. BID AIMED AT PROTECTING STATUS QUO: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 22 (CNA)
06/22/07  18:44:00
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Friday the country's plans to apply for U.N.
membership under the name of "Taiwan" and to push for a referendum on the bid,
in spite of opposition by the United States.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue during an informal gathering with the media at Yilan
County's Fushan Research Station under the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute,
Chen claimed that the U.N. bid does not violate his commitment to the United
States but is aimed at protecting the status quo of Taiwan and the basic human
rights of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Taiwan has been barred from the World Health Organization
(WHO) mainly because it is not a member of the United Nations, and the situation
is becoming "increasingly unfavorable to Taiwan" in light of China's on-going
attempts to downgrade Taiwan's status internationally.</P>
      <P>As a sovereign  state,  Taiwan is entitled to appropriate representation in the
United Nations, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"We must let the whole world hear the desire and determination of the country's
people to safeguard Taiwan's status as a sovereign state," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"We must use the name of `Taiwan' to apply to enter the United Nations to
protect the status quo from being changed or damaged, " he added.</P>
      <P>The fact that opposition Kuomintang presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou has
expressed his support for Taiwan's inclusion in the world body indicates that
there is a national and cross-partisan consensus on the issue, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"As to the areas where consensus is lacking, such as under what name the country
should apply to the United Nations, they should be put to a public referendum to
allow for the establishment of a common ground acceptable to the majority of
people through debate and discussion," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Calling the introduction of a referendum system in Taiwan an important step to
consolidate and deepen the country's democratic development, Chen said democracy
should not only provide people with franchise but also with the right to decide
on major public issues.</P>
      <P>He said the proposal to hold a referendum on whether the country should apply to
the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan" was initiated directly by the
people, and that as president, he has an obligation to comply.</P>
      <P>Chen said he respects the different opinions that the United States have
expressed over Taiwan's U.N. bid and referendum plan, adding that his
administration will continue to communicate with Washington to try to sort out
the differences.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the first referendum that was held alongside the 2004
presidential election against China's missile threat against Taiwan had likewise
sparked great concern in the United States and that he nevertheless resisted the
U.S.  pressure to make the referendum possible.</P>
      <P>Insisting that the government should "walk the right path and do the right
thing" despite international pressure, Chen said he will use the final year of
his presidential term to blaze a viable trail for the future president so that
the new government "will not be afraid of China or the United States."</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which failed in its first attempt to gain membership in the WHO under
the name of "Taiwan" in May, is planning to use a similar model to apply for
U.N. membership in September despite the almost certain prospect of failure.</P>
      <P>In response to the move, officials at the U.S. State Department have reiterated
that the United States does not support Taiwan's membership in international
organizations that require statehood and that Washington "opposes any initiative
that appears designed to change Taiwan's status unilaterally, " including a
referendum on whether to apply to the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The officials urged Chen to "exercise leadership" by scrapping the planned
referendum, which they said would appear to run counter to Chen's repeated
commitments to U.S. President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>They were referring to pledges that Chen made during his 2000 and 2004 inaugural
addresses that if China has no intention of using force against Taiwan, he will
not declare Taiwan independence, will not change the official name of the
country, will not include the "state-to-state" concept on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations in the Constitution and will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-strait status quo.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) Friday urged patients infected with multiple
drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) to seek treatment immediately.</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-yang, section chief of the DOH Center for Disease Control (CDC), made
the appeal as he reported on an HIV-positive man who has been infected with
multiple drug-resistant TB, the first such case since the center launched a
medical care network for multiple drug-resistant TB patients May 1.</P>
      <P>Yang noted that the man is registered with the health authorities as HIV-
positive and that he usually resides in central Taiwan. He has never been
infected with TB before.</P>
      <P>Yang said HIV-positive patients are at high risk of tuberculosis, adding that
their risk of being infected with TB is 10 times greater than non-HIV people.</P>
      <P>The CD4 T-cells per cubic millimeter of the blood sample of the man was lower
than 50, although patients receiving drug cocktail treatment for AIDS usually
have cell counts of over 200, Yang said.</P>
      <P>CD4 T-cells are a type of lymphocyte that co-ordinate the immune system's
response to certain micro-organisms such as viruses. HIV can infect and kill CD4
T-cells, as well as some other types of cell.</P>
      <P>Yang said the low CD4 T-cells show that the man's immune system is diminished.</P>
      <P>The CDC has quarantined the man and is keeping tabs on those with whom he has
had contact, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The number of HIV-positive patients had reached 13,742 as of the end of April,
according to CDC statistics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has an additional 15,000 TB patients every year, with a mortality rate of
about 10 percent. There are currently between 600 and 800 of them who are
multiple drug-resistant.</P>

      <P>Police detained 12 migrant workers from Indonesia Thursday who illegally ran
away from their work and hid out in an apartment in Tucheng City, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the police authorities, the 12 laborers -- 11 men
and one woman -- were caught together in a small apartment in an industrial
park.</P>
      <P>An initial investigation showed that all 11 men are fishermen who worked for
fishing boats registered in Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan
before running away to the north. The eldest of them is 37 years old, while the
youngest is 25.</P>
      <P>The sole 28-year-old female told police in fluent Chinese that she decided to
abscond due to the poor salary she was paid. Working as a domestic maid, she
said she got only NT$4,000 per month, far lower than the legal minimum of
NT$15,000 (US$455).</P>
      <P>The woman said that she and her husband, who entered Taiwan a few months later
than she did, went into hiding in the Tucheng apartment. The other Indonesian
workers who lived with them are friends of the husband who had also absconded
due to the poor treatment they received, she added.</P>
      <P>Police claimed that someone might be acting behind the scenes, inducing them to
run away and helping them hide out in Tucheng.</P>
      <P>Policemen from Juifang township in Taipei County raided the Tucheng apartment
late Thursday, acting on a tipoff that unknown foreign workers frequented the
place.</P>
      <P>Police sent 11 of them to a detention center operated by the Immigration Agency
in Taipei County, while the remaining one will face the same fate after his

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that granting special pardon to the "rice
bomber" Yang Ju-men is what he has been wanting to do for the last few years and
that he needs no applause from others while doing the "right thing."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a meeting with journalists in Yilan County,
northeastern Taiwan, one day after he granted Yang a special pardon after he
served less than three years in prison for planting 17 home-made explosive
devices around Taipei City during 2003-2004, striking terror into the hearts of
city residents.</P>
      <P>Yang was dubbed the "rice bomber" as he put a note on each of his bombs
expressing his opposition to the government's rice import policy and urging the
government to take good care of farmers. Yang said his movement was to arouse
the government's awareness of farmers' plight.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although Yang's terrorist acts were to be "blamed," his motives
were "worthy of sympathy."</P>
      <P>Thanking Yang for continuing to remind the government to pay attention to the
problems of farmers, Chen said his administration has been doing so, although he
admitted that the results "may not be satisfactory to all."</P>
      <P>In response  to the reports  saying that Yang seemed not appreciative of Chen's
pardon, as he was expected to be released on parole in October due to good
behavior in any case, Chen said he just did what he should do in releasing the
bomber.</P>

      <P>The Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced Friday the third imported case of
measles this year.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said the patient is a 25-year-old man living in southern Taiwan
who has been inoculated with the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine twice.</P>
      <P>The man has shown no classical symptoms of the measles, which is why his case
was only confirmed after two blood tests.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting said the man and his girlfriend visited Japan May
19-25. He developed high fever June 4 and a rash on his face June 5. He was
discharged from hospital June 11 after treatment.</P>
      <P>Lin said that after two MMR shots, the protection effect is about 95 percent,
although some people still get measles with milder symptoms.</P>
      <P>Lin said that more than 40 family members and friends with whom the man has had
contact have not shown symptoms of measles and the CDC estimates that there is
no reason to suspect a measles outbreak.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan has a high ratio of measles vaccination and that the public have
nothing to worry out.</P>

      <P>A cross-border human trafficking ring specializing in smuggling Vietnamese and
Chinese citizens into Taiwan for labor exploitation has been smashed through
joint operations of police and coast guard personnel, police sources said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Officers from the Taichung Harbor Police Bureau in central Taiwan, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) and Coast Guard Administration's (CGA's) third and
eighth patrol fleets stationed in offshore Penghu County busted the criminals
earlier this week after more than two months of intensive probes, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Nine ring members and 16 Vietnamese illegal immigrants were rounded up in a
series of raids in Taipei County's Chungho City, Taipei City's Songshan District
and Penghu County's Hsiyu islet and Chibei waters that began Wednesday, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Taichung Harbor police discovered a group of
Vietnamese illegals trying to destroy a wooden boat in waters off the Formosa
Plastics Group's petrochemical complex in Mailiao, Yunlin County in April.</P>
      <P>Their unusual action prompted police into believing that their arrival in the
region could not be accidental and could just be the tip of the iceberg of a
well-organized criminal operation, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Criminal investigation and coastal guard authorities then formed a joint task
force to investigate suspected human trafficking operations under the leadership
of the Yunlin Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>After extensive probes, the task force discovered that underworld figures in
Vietnam, China and Taiwan had colluded in smuggling Vietnamese people to Taiwan
for labor exploitation via Shantou, Guangdong Province in southern China, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Chinese snakeheads tended to purchase wooden boats to transport their Vietnamese
clients to Taiwan, making the ships mingle with Chinese fishing boats to avoid
detection. Once the ships arrived in Taiwan waters, their Taiwanese accomplices
would transship the illegals to Taiwan and send them to strictly guarded
hideouts.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese ring members would then produce bogus identities or marriage
certificates for the illegal Vietnamese immigrants and arrange laboring jobs for
them. Ring members in Vietnam, China and Taiwan would draw lucrative commissions
from brokering the smuggled immigrants into jobs, the sources said.</P>
      <P>The ring also smuggled Chinese immigrants to Taiwan through similar routes, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Among the apprehended ring members were a Taipei-based Vietnamese nicknamed
A-chuan who was responsible for contact with snakeheads in Vietnam and arranging
work for the illegals.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwanese ring members, nicknamed A-Cheng and A-mei, were accused of
specializing in document forgery so that the illegals could find jobs or
partners in marriages of convenience.</P>
      <P>In Wednesday's raid, coast guard officers stationed in Penghu first spotted four
Vietnamese illegals -- two men and two women -- on a road in Hsiyu -- a small
islet of the Penghu island group, the sources said, adding that 12 others -- two
women and 10 men -- were intercepted Thursday aboard an unnamed Chinese fishing
boat off Mutouyu, another Penghu islet.</P>
      <P>The discovery led to subsequent raids on the ring's hideouts and the arrest of
the key figures, the sources said, adding that no other illegals smuggled in the
latest operation remained at large.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TRADE, ECONOMIC EXCHANGES COME TO BOTTLENECK: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and economic exchanges between Taiwan and China have come to a political
bottleneck that is hindering further progress of exchanges,  Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairman Chen Ming-tung said Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Chen said that when Taiwan attempts to open its
doors to Chinese tourists, establish direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights, or
establish a mutual currency settlement mechanism, it gets trapped in a
"political framework" every time it is about to sign an agreement with the
relevant Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>He said he expects that Beijing will bring up the question of how to define the
nature of planned direct cross-strait flight routes when the two sides begin
talks on the issue. "That is a political framework, " Chen noted, referring to
China's insistence upon its claim that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>The same challenge also hits talks on the establishment of a currency settlement
mechanism, Chen went on, pointing out that since the issue involves the exercise
of sovereignty, there is no way for Taiwan and China to reach agreement on the
issue unless they resolve their political disputes.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the existing restrictions on local investment in China can be
relaxed, Chen replied that there has to be a balance between domestic investment
and investment in China. Under the current regulations, a local enterprise is
only allowed to invest a maximum of 40 percent of the company's total capital in
China.</P>
      <P>If the situation in which Taiwanese capital flows to China but is not remitted
back to Taiwan changes, so that profits made in China are brought back to
Taiwan, there will be possibility for the government to consider raising the
investment ceiling, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that the promise Beijing made in 1997 to
Hong Kong that it could maintain its lifestyle for 50 years under the "one
country, two systems" unification scheme was "a sheer lie."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the Fushan Research Station, a botanic research
facility in Yilan County, during a meeting with reporters.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, time proves that the promise Beijing made to Hong Kong upon
its reversion to Chinese rule 10 years ago was a lie.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong people have long been keen to enjoy democracy and direct popular
elections,  and this is exactly the major key difference between Taiwan and the
former British colony, according to Chen. He also blamed Ma Ying-jeou,
presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , for harboring
unrealistic illusions of China.</P>
      <P>Accusing Ma of being totally wrong to insist on promoting Taiwan's dealings with
China based on the so-called "1992 consensus," Chen quoted C.F. Koo, ex-Chairman
of the Straits Exchange Foundation, as admitting that it was a term created by
former Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Su Chi in April 2000.</P>
      <P>No high ranking Beijing officials, including former President Jiang Zemin and
incumbent President Hu Jintao, or official Chinese documents have acknowledged
that the "1992 consensus" refers to "one China,  respective interpretations" --
something Ma appears to believe, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Accepting the "1992 consensus" means that Taiwan has to yield to Beijing's "one
China" principle that would downgrade the country to a province or region of the
People's Republic of China, he said.</P>
      <P>The president urged Ma and his party to "get to the bottom" of the "1992
consensus" and warned him not try to sell his rhetoric to Taiwan's people in his
efforts to push Taiwan to forswear its national sovereignty.</P>

      <P>Australia will offer Taiwanese tourists free Electronic Travel Authority (ETA)
services from July 1, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office (ACIO)
announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese tourists who apply for ETAs -- the equivalent of visas -- will no
longer be charged the NT$1,000 application fee, ACIO Visa Services Director
Catherine Genn said.</P>
      <P>An ETA is issued electronically by a computer system and there is no stamp or
label in the passport. Applications for ETAs can be submitted through travel
agencies or airlines.</P>
      <P>"This is good news following Australia's approval of the import of Taiwanese
mangoes last week. And the timing of the announcement is wonderful because of
the summer vacation, " said Yu Teh-sheng, deputy director of the Department of
East Asia and Pacific Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to an ACIO tally, Genn said, 77,000 of the 80,000 visas the office
authorized to Taiwanese tourists in 2006 were ETAs. The free ETA service is
expected to boost tourist numbers.</P>
      <P>However, tourists who apply for ETAs online instead of through ACIO's visa
service will still be charged the transaction fee of A$20, she noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is among a limited number of countries in the Asia Pacific region, which
include Japan, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia, that are eligible for ETA services
as "low-risk countries" as defined by the Australian government, Genn said.</P>

      <P>Male freshmen account for the majority of traffic deaths among college students,
according to the results of a survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by National Chiao Tung University Professor Wu Tsung-
hsiu at the commission of the Ministry of Education (MOE) . The ministry is
concerned that accidents have been the major cause of death among college
students in recent years, and that traffic accidents accounted for around 60
percent of the deaths.</P>
      <P>Wu said random checks on college students who died in traffic accidents show
that out of 108 cases, 90 were men and 18 were women.</P>
      <P>Forty-one were freshmen, followed by 29 sophomores, 15 juniors and 17 seniors
and six post-graduates.</P>
      <P>Wu said the higher number of deaths among male freshmen is because freshmen are
usually just 18, have just started driving and tend to go out joyriding.</P>

      <P>Barry Marshall, Australia's most recent Nobel Prize for Medicine winner, will
visit Taiwan and seek to inspire Taiwanese students' engagement in science,
organizers said Friday in a press conference.</P>
      <P>Marshall, 56, and his longtime collaborator Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel
Prize in Medicine in 2005 for their discovery of the helicobacter pyroli
bacterium and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease. He is scheduled to
visit Taiwan June 26-29 and deliver speeches to medical school students and high
school students, National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and Australian
Education Center (AEC) announced.</P>
      <P>The discovery identified the great majority of gastritis and peptic ulcer cases,
which were previously thought to be chronic infections caused by stress and
dietary factors, as being caused by the helicobacter pyroli and found that they
were curable with just a short regimen of antibiotics.</P>
      <P>"The real story about Marshall's visit is about the type of person he is, " said
Dean Woodgate, Director of the AEC's education, science and training section.</P>
      <P>Marshall was dismissed as "a crazy guy saying crazy things" about his hypothesis
at first. To prove his theory, he experimented on himself, ingesting a turbid,
foul-tasting solution of helicobacter pyroli.</P>
      <P>The story of Marshall is one of a scientist who will do anything to prove his
point, said NTUH physician and professor Lin Jaw-town.</P>
      <P>"The achievement and story of Marshall represent two distinct characteristics of
Australians: we like to give things a go and encourage friendship, " Woodgate

      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) is to launch a package tour to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan
as part of the government's efforts to promote local tourism and boost "creative
life industries," a bureau spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The bureau has chosen 11 tourist attractions to feature on the tour said Chang
Chin-chung, an official of the bureau's Knowledge Service Division, who added
that the bureau hopes to use the tour to introduce Taiwanese culture and nature
to Japanese visitors.</P>
      <P>The tour is also expected to increase the business turnover of local "creative
industries" by 4 percent and to attract investment of NT$25 million (US$756,887)
in these industries, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has an abundance of natural resources due to its tropical and subtropical
climates, as well as cultural assets and traditional arts, Chang said, adding
that all of these are of great interest to older Japanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Tourism Bureau, Chang said Japan was the
largest source of visitors to Taiwan in 2005 with 1,163,835 visitors, which
accounted for 33.07 percent of the total number of foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Among these Japanese visitors, 70.53 percent named food as Taiwan's leading
attration, comparing to 37.94 percent naming the scenery and 30.53 percent
naming the historical relics, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>However, Chang citred a Japanese survey as pointing out that 83.7 percent of the
senior wealthy Japanese tourists liked the natural scenery, followed by 74.4
percent who preferred historical sites and 60.5 percent who wanted to see
natural ecosystems or environmental protection-related tours.</P>
      <P>Japanese tourists spend an average of US$270 each day in Taiwan, which is much
higher than the US$180 spent daily by Hong Kong and Macao visitors, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Middle-aged and senior Japanese visitors are generally rich, have leisure time
and are more willing to understand Taiwan's culture, Chang said, adding that the

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu inspected the outlying island of Kinmen Friday, where
she warned of the military threat from China.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call during a seminar with local residents and businessmen using
direct ferry services from Kinmen to several ports in China's Fujian Province --
part of the popularly known "mini links" that also exist between Taiwan's Matsu
island and the Fujian port of Mawei.</P>
      <P>In response to Kinmen residents' call for a full opening of the mini links to
all Taiwan people rather than just Kinmen residents and select others, Lu urged
local people not to ignore the possibility of attacks from China, on the grounds
that Beijing has never slowed its military buildup aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, only Kinmen and Matsu residents, as well retired veterans and Chinese
spouses of Taiwan citizens, are allowed to travel to China via the "mini links."</P>
      <P>Beijing had 50 missiles pointing at Taiwan in 1996 and the number has increased
to more than 1,000 at present, Lu said, adding that Taiwan and Kinmen are on the
same boat and will share the same fate should China invade.</P>
      <P>She urged the Kinmen people to "face up to this reality" and join the central
government efforts in creating a "mutually beneficial situation" for Kinmen,
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>However, Lu also promised to relay Kinmen residents' opinions to President Chen
Shui-bian, as this was the major purpose of her inspection trip to the island.</P>
      <P>Kinmen's hope of transforming into a modern hub in the Taiwan Strait, if
successful, will not only help the island catch up with new trends but will also
help China dilute its hostility toward Taiwan, paving the way for the three
sides to explore new horizons, she said.</P>

Macedonian pro-Beijing forces gained the upper hand in the nation's coalition
government and transferred diplomatic recognition to Beijing.

2001: The Navy General Headquarters says that it has commissioned

Confucius' lesson of the day: "A man who withdraws himself from the world for no
other reason than to show his personal purity of motive is one who breaks up one
of the greatest ties in the foundation of society. A good and wise man, on the
other hand, who enters the public service, tries to carry out what he thinks to
be right. As to the failure of right principles to make progress, he is well
aware of that."</TEXT>

California regulators moved Thursdaay to revoke the license of Martin Luther

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC EXPERTISE OF KMT VP CANDIDATE WINS CROSS-PARTISAN RECOGNITION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vincent Siew, who has been named by opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential
candidate Ma Ying-jeou as his running mate, is among a small minority of
politicians who has won recognition from across Taiwan's political spectrum
because of his strong economic background.</P>
      <P>An expert in economic and cross-Taiwan Strait affairs, the 68-year-old Siew
served as premier under the former KMT government for three years until the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>In 2002, he was appointed by the DPP government as chairman of the state-funded
Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, a position he still holds.</P>
      <P>In recent years, Siew has been promoting the establishment of a cross-strait
common market to take advantage of the rise of China as an economic giant.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, the formation of a cross-strait common market will facilitate
Taiwan's entry to the greater China market, which will benefit both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew proposes that Taiwan and China normalize their economic and trade relations
to pave the way for the removal of unnecessary trade barriers, the provision of
preferential treatment for each other and the eventual establishment of a
customs union.</P>
      <P>To cope with the possible marginalization of Taiwan in the wake of the economic
integration of East Asia, Siew advocates developing Taiwan into the world's
largest free trade region.</P>
      <P>He believes that foreign trade is the lifeline of Taiwan's economy and that only
if Taiwan opens itself to the world will it be able to sustain its economic
momentum.</P>
      <P>Siew suggests that Taiwan should set a good example in the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum by opening its market to other APEC members and
welcoming them to invest, manufacture and set up research and development
centers in Taiwan, which he believes will help lessen the sensitivity of cross-
strait economic and trade activities.</P>
      <P>Starting his civil service career as a diplomat in the 1960s, Siew later took up
important  economic positions  in the KMT government, including minister of
economic affairs from 1990 to 1993 and chairman of the Council of Economic
Planning and Development from 1993 to 1994.</P>
      <P>Siew was chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council from 1994 to 1995 and in 1996
he was elected a legislator representing his birthplace, Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>During  the  National  Development  Conference  hosted  by then-President Lee
Teng-hui at the end of 1996, Siew was the then-ruling KMT's main negotiator with
the then-opposition DPP.</P>
      <P>He was appointed premier by Lee in 1997 and in 1999, he was named by Lien Chan,
then-vice president and the KMT's candidate for the 2000 presidential election,
as his running mate.</P>
      <P>After the KMT's defeat in that election, Siew was appointed a vice chairman of
the party, a position he held until 2005.</P>
      <P>Siew's economic expertise has also won the recognition of President Chen Shui-
bian, who named Siew as a vice chairman of the Economic Development Advisory
Council in 2001.</P>
      <P>Chen planned to designate Siew as his special envoy to the informal APEC
leadership summit in 2000 but was forced to drop the plan following the DPP
government's decision to scrap the fourth nuclear power plant project that year,
a move that enraged the KMT.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) is to launch a package tour to attract more Japanese tourists to Taiwan
as part of the government's efforts to promote local tourism and boost "creative
life industries," a bureau spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>The bureau has chosen 11 tourist attractions to feature on the tour said Chang
Chin-chung, an official of the bureau's Knowledge Service Division, who added
that the bureau hopes to use the tour to introduce Taiwanese culture and nature
to Japanese visitors.</P>
      <P>The tour is also expected to increase the business turnover of local "creative
industries" by 4 percent and to attract investment of NT$25 million (US$756,887)
in these industries, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has an abundance of natural resources due to its tropical and subtropical
climates, as well as cultural assets and traditional arts, Chang said, adding
that all of these are of great interest to older Japanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Tourism Bureau, Chang said Japan was the
largest source of visitors to Taiwan in 2005 with 1,163,835 visitors, which
accounted for 33.07 percent of the total number of foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Among these Japanese visitors, 70.53 percent named food as Taiwan's leading
attration, comparing to 37.94 percent naming the scenery and 30.53 percent
naming the historical relics, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>However, Chang citred a Japanese survey as pointing out that 83.7 percent of the
senior wealthy Japanese tourists liked the natural scenery, followed by 74.4
percent who preferred historical sites and 60.5 percent who wanted to see
natural ecosystems or environmental protection-related tours.</P>
      <P>Japanese tourists spend an average of US$270 each day in Taiwan, which is much
higher than the US$180 spent daily by Hong Kong and Macao visitors, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Middle-aged and senior Japanese visitors are generally rich, have leisure time
and are more willing to understand Taiwan's culture, Chang said, adding that the
bureau will also launch a package tour targeting young Japanese tourists.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu inspected the outlying island of Kinmen Friday, where
she warned of the military threat from China.</P>
      <P>Lu issued the call during a seminar with local residents and businessmen using
direct ferry services from Kinmen to several ports in China's Fujian Province --
part of the popularly known "mini links" that also exist between Taiwan's Matsu
island and the Fujian port of Mawei.</P>
      <P>In response to Kinmen residents' call for a full opening of the mini links to
all Taiwan people rather than just Kinmen residents and select others, Lu urged
local people not to ignore the possibility of attacks from China, on the grounds
that Beijing has never slowed its military buildup aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Currently, only Kinmen and Matsu residents, as well retired veterans and Chinese
spouses of Taiwan citizens, are allowed to travel to China via the "mini links."</P>
      <P>Beijing had 50 missiles pointing at Taiwan in 1996 and the number has increased
to more than 1,000 at present, Lu said, adding that Taiwan and Kinmen are on the
same boat and will share the same fate should China invade.</P>
      <P>She urged the Kinmen people to "face up to this reality" and join the central
government efforts in creating a "mutually beneficial situation" for Kinmen,
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>However, Lu also promised to relay Kinmen residents' opinions to President Chen
Shui-bian, as this was the major purpose of her inspection trip to the island.</P>
      <P>Kinmen's hope of transforming into a modern hub in the Taiwan Strait, if
successful, will not only help the island catch up with new trends but will also
help China dilute its hostility toward Taiwan, paving the way for the three
sides to explore new horizons, she said.</P>

      <P>Main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's
selection of former Premier Vincent Siew as his running mate could be the "best

mate, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was on an inspection tour of the outlying island of Kinmen, made the

2008 presidential election at a Taipei news conference earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>"Siew is one of my 'old colleagues' as we ran for the vice presidency
simultaneously in 2000. I congratulate him for his being chosen again to run for

best candidate for the post.</P>
      <P>As for  the ruling  Democratic  Progressive  Party's  vice presidential
candidate, Lu said she is not in a position to address the issue. "Our
presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, should have full freedom to pick his
running mate," she added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said she feels Hsieh could draw inspiration from Ma's selection
of Siew, an experienced economic policy architect, for his ruling expertise.</P>

said, adding that forming a ticket that lives up to social expectations could be
a test of Hsieh's political wisdom.</P>

      <P>Several opposition lawmakers requested Saturday a constitutional interpretation
of the re-naming of the nation's state-owned post company earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lee Fu-tien and Liu Wen-hsiung of the People First Party and Justin
Chou of the Kuomintang requested the Council of Grand Justices for the
interpretation.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the board of Chunghwa Post Co. approved a proposal to rename the
company Taiwan Post Co. and that President Chen Shui-bian and former Premier Su
Tseng-chang attended a new plaque unveiling ceremony Feb. 12.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Executive Yuan exercised an administrative order to change the name
of the post company, and then proposed a bill to ask the Legislative Yuan to
revise the law to accommodate the new name.</P>
      <P>"This is an infringement of the legislative authority and a clear violation of
the principles of division of power enshrined in the Constitution," according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee said the post company is a state-owned enterprise and the legislature has
the right to screen its budget. The Executive Yuan's instruction to change the
name will "lead to doubts" in the legislative Yuan's screening of its budget, he
said.</P>
      <P>The re-naming of the post company is part of the government's campaign to shed
the names of state-owned enterprises that contain references to China, in a bid
to underscore Taiwan's distinct national identity. "Chunghwa" means "Chinese" or
"China" in mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Two other state-owned enterprises have had similar name-changes. The China
Petroleum Corp. has been changed to "CPC., Taiwan, " while the China
Shipbuilding Corp. has been changed to "CSBC Corp., Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh's
choice of running mate is now generating intense speculation now that the ticket
of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the 2008 presidential election has
been set, DPP sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou announced earlier in the day that former
Premier Vincent Siew will be his running mate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's camp said he has no timetable for announcing his running mate, that he
is not in a hurry to settle the matter and that he will probably not announce
his choice before a party congress in August or September.</P>
      <P>"This also shows respect toward the potential running mate," they said.</P>
      <P>DPP sources said Hsieh's choice could be former Premier Su Tsang-chang or former
Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan.</P>
      <P>Although Hsieh is widely believed to be tilting toward Yeh, given that Yeh's
political career is closely intertwined with his own and that she is a woman and
a Hakka -- the second-largest ethnic group next to Hoklo in Taiwan -- the
party's calls for Hsieh to team up with Su have not subsided.</P>
      <P>Yeh served as vice premier (2004-2005) and as acting mayor of Kaohsiung
(2005-2006) , the post in which Hsieh served between 1998 and 2005. Hsieh later
served as premier 2005-2006.</P>
      <P>DPP sources claimed that only a Hsieh-Su ticket will help mend fences in the
wake of the rifts caused by the bitterly contested party presidential and
legislative primaries. Such a ticket would be also beneficial  to the upcoming
legislative  and presidential elections, they added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has expressed deep regret and
dissatisfaction Saturday over the Singapore government's opposition to President
Chen Shui-bian's proposal to seek a referendum on Taiwan's bid to enter the
United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement a day earlier that
Taiwan's proposal is "provocative and irresponsible" and pointed out that the
referendum will only give the people of Taiwan false hope, raise tension between
Taiwan and China and reduce Taiwan's international space.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman David Wang said Singapore's statement is utterly unacceptable,
because Taiwan is a sovereign democratic country, the right to referendum is a
basic right of the people and other countries have no right to intervene.</P>
      <P>In a press released Saturday, the MOFA said that Taiwan, as a sovereign state,
is qualified to apply for participation in the U.N. and that the international
community should support the country's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>According to the statement, Taiwan's admission into the U.N. under the name
"Taiwan" would not mean a change of the nation's official name, as Taiwan
participates in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum under the name
"Chinese Taipei" and is a member of the World Trade Organization under the name
"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," with no
official name-change.</P>
      <P>Wang said that China, instead of Taiwan, should be considered the biggest threat
to the status quo and regional peace because it deploys thousands of missiles
against Taiwan and its national defense budget continues to grow in double
digits.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou expressed the
expectation Saturday that his running mate, Vincent Siew, will play the role of
"chief engineer" of the country's economic revival if the ticket wins the 2008
election.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks while announcing the former premier as his running mate, Ma
said he is honored to be able to win Siew's consent to team up with him, in
light of Siew's extensive administrative experience  and remarkable
contributions  to Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes Siew will use his experience to seek a way out of Taiwan's
economic impasse rather than serving simply as a deputy with only limited formal
power.</P>
      <P>Siew, a technocrat who served as a diplomat for 10 years and an economic
official for 30 years, sailed the country through the Asian financial crisis
under his premiership in the late 1990s, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Other achievements that Siew attained during his premiership included applying
for Taiwan's entry to the World Trade Organization, building the country's fifth
naphtha cracking plant and kicking off the high-speed railway project.</P>
      <P>"After seven years under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , people are
starting to miss `smiling Siew' -- a composed helmsman who led Taiwan through a
crisis," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, owing to his concern for Taiwan's economy, Siew did not turn
down the DPP's offer for him to serve as an advisor to the national economic
development conference and as the country's representative at an informal
leadership summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>However, Ma blamed the DPP for not accepting the advice put forth by Siew, a
situation Ma said is responsible for the economic problems faced by the country
today.</P>
      <P>On criticism that the running mate choice lacks "novelty" -- given the fact that
Siew also served as the running mate of then-KMT presidential candidate Lien
Chan in 2000, Ma said he does not care whether his partner is a new face or an
old face because experience and talent are what he values.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew said Ma met with him several times over the past few weeks to
invite him to serve as running mate and that he was deeply moved by Ma's
sincerity.</P>
      <P>Siew said that although he has left the civil service, his concern for Taiwan's
economic development continues, adding that he shares Ma's ideas of giving
priority to economics and the people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Siew pledged he will work hard for a KMT victory in the 2008 presidential
election for the well-being of the people.</P>
      <P>According to Ma's close aides, Siew's economic background and his credentials as
a native Taiwanese from Chiayi complement Ma's image as a mainlander descendant
and can help expand Ma's support base in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Siew has put forth the idea of "Republic of China equals Taiwan, " upholds
the Taiwanese identity and has taken part in various international economic and
trade conferences as chairman of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, it will be more convincing to the voters if Siew promotes Ma's cross-
strait and economic policies, they said.</P>

      <P>Whoever wins the 2008 presidential election, the development of the economy
should be the theme of the next government, the chairman of the powerful Taiwan
Electrical and Electronics Manufacturers' Association said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Arthur Chiao made the remarks after main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou named former Premier Vincent Siew as his
running mate earlier that day, saying that he hopes to make use of Siew's
economic and financial expertise to revitalize the economy.</P>
      <P>Chiao expressed the hope that Siew will help upgrade Taiwan industry's
competitiveness amid ever-fiercer global competition.</P>
      <P>He noted that Siew was previously deeply involved in Taiwan's economic
development and said that although he has not been active in politics recently,
he is concerned about industrial development in Taiwan and has put emphasis on
an open economic environment.</P>
      <P>Chiao recalled some of the things Siew has done that impressed him most,
including the promotion of the build-operate-transfer model for the nation's
first high speed railway, which was officially launched this January.</P>
      <P>Siew also helped Taiwan emerge relatively unscathed from the Asian financial
crisis of the late 1990s, he said.</P>
      <P>Siew advocated the Asia-Pacific operations hub project and promoted  the  low
energy  consumption,  capital-intensive  and technology-intensive concepts that
are followed by many countries today, Chiao said.</P>
      <P>He also said relations with China are closely intertwined with Taiwan's economic
development and that the future leader of Taiwan must see to it that Taiwan's
economy is not subject to restrictions in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>"The government needs to work in tune with the changing times, "he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that a lot of policies might be correct at the time of their
formulation but need to be adjusted with time.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of a cap of 40 percent for local investment in China,
saying that the restriction might have been reasonable five years ago, but might
no longer be suitable for the present situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>71% POLL RESPONDENTS SUPPORT U.N. BID UNDER NAME OF `TAIWAN'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventy-one percent of the people who answered a recent survey said they support
a proposal to put forward a bid for Taiwan's membership in the United Nations
under the name of "Taiwan" in September when the U.N. General Assembly is held
in New York.</P>
      <P>The issue has triggered public concern over Taiwan's diplomatic situation since
the United States expressed its opposition Monday to President Chen Shui-bian's
resolve to push for a referendum on the U.N. bid under the "Taiwan" designation.</P>
      <P>The private Institute for National Policy Research (INPR) , a think tank,
conducted the poll on Taiwan's diplomatic prospects June 15-16 in which 1,070
effective questionnaires were collected, with a margin of error of three
percentage points.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 48 percent of the respondents said they agree
with the idea that China's diplomatic suppression of Taiwan will increase and
that the suppression will continue no matter which political party wins the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Sixty-eight percent of the respondents said they know Beijing spent NT$14
billion (US$427 million) to buy diplomatic recognition from Costa Rica,
attributing this to the severance of the 63-year-old diplomatic partnership
between Taiwan and the Central American country June 6.</P>
      <P>Seventy percent said China has never stopped trying to damage Taiwan's
friendships with foreign countries, lock Taiwan out of influential international
organizations, suppress Taiwan in every different field and hurt Taiwan people's
feelings.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 87 percent said Taiwan, as a sovereign country, does not need to seek
China's consent before seeking membership in major international organizations,
and 77 percent of the respondents expressed disagreement with the notion that
Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Asked what Taiwan should do to expand its diplomatic relations, 57 percent of
the respondents said it should boost civic exchanges with foreign countries and
international groups, 48 percent said it should join international
organizations, 43 percent said it should make efforts to maintain relations with
the United States, Japan and Europe, and 23 percent said it should try to get
more diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the poll results, Cheng Duan-yiao, director of National Chengchi
University's Institute of International Relations, said that the results show
not many people see "increasing diplomatic allies" as an important diplomatic
task.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, Cheng said many people now think that it is more
important for Taiwan to engage in pragmatic international exchanges than to seek
diplomatic allies, which suggests that people want the government to take
practical diplomatic approaches.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) said Saturday it has requested the
relevant authorities to test a popular chemical product called "crystal babies"
that is popular among local school children, in the wake of reports that the
product has caused allergic reactions in some children.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Ching-fang, a section chief at the commission, the results of
the tests are expected to be out within three days.</P>
      <P>If any harmful ingredients are discovered in the product, the CPC will order a
recall of the product and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will also
punish the manufacturers, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said the so-called "crystal babies" are a kind of acrylic polymer originally
designed to be used in aquariums as a soil substitute.</P>
      <P>However, owing to the strong absorbent properties of the product, the tiny,
colorful balls split after absorbing a certain amount of water. This phenomenon,
which to children apparently appears similar to reproduction, has made them
popular as "pets," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection does not
classify the product as a toy, Liu urged consumers not to let their children
play with it.</P>

      <P>Leafy vegetable crops have completely recovered in central and southern Taiwan
after vegetable fields there were inundated two weeks ago by flooding caused by
heavy rain, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The new crops are expected to reach market by the end of the month, the
officials said, noting that by then, the fluctuating vegetable prices will have
stabilized.</P>
      <P>In early June, Changhua and Yunlin counties, two of the country's major
vegetable production areas, sustained heavy losses of leafy vegetables due to
the flooding, resulting in a supply shortage.</P>
      <P>With assistance from the COA Agriculture and Food Agency, farmers in the flood-
affected areas began work to restore cultivation as soon as the water receded
and are expected to harvest by the end of June thanks to sunny weather over the
past few weeks, the COA officials said.</P>
      <P>To ensure non-stop vegetable supplies to the domestic market, the agency has
been assisting local vegetable farmers since 2005 in building protection

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Saturday his counterpart's choice of running mate "falls outside his
expectation."</P>
      <P>Hsieh was commenting in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, on opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's announcement of his running mate, former
Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that public opinion polls conducted by himself show that every one of
Ma's running mates mentioned previously, including Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, former Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen, former National Taiwan University
President Chen Wei-chao and Uni-President Enterprise CEO Lin Chang-sheng, would
be a big boost to Ma.</P>
      <P>"But Wang definitely comes out on top, although the KMT has turned him away,"
Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Siew, a Hoklo, will be a plus for Ma, who was born in Hong Kong, in
terms of winning ballots from the Hoklo, the largest ethnic group in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also claimed that Siew contributed to Taiwan's economy during what he
described as the "early years, " when Taiwan played the role of the world's
factory and used fast-track development to stimulate rapid economic growth.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan "has long passed that period. At the present stage, political
stability, social justice, clean environment and the upgrading of mutual trust
between people are equally important, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The emphasis now should be on a high-quality nation and an economy that will
make people happy," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Ma has touted Siew's advocacy of the formation of a cross-strait
common market to facilitate Taiwan's entry into the greater China market, Hsieh
claimed that this means the introduction of laborers from China, to which he is
opposed.</P>
      <P>"What Taiwan needs to introduce is capital and more investment so that the value
of the laborers will be upgraded," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will announce his running mate any time soon, he said that
after seeing Siew's name, "we are not in a hurry."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a major caucus whip of the DPP in the legislature claimed that the
"Ma-Siew" ticket is a game of the "high-class society, " which he described as
deviating from the "mainstream views of society."</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming said he was surprised to see that the KMT is suffering "a dearth
of talent" and is "putting old wine in new bottles."</P>
      <P>Ker noted that Siew served as the running mate of former Vice President Lien
Chan in the 2000 presidential election and finished a distant third that time,
and said Ma is now trying to "copy the defeat experience."</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, manager of Hsieh's campaign office, also lashed out at Ma for
trying to use "smiles to cover up his own corruption, " referring to the
nickname of his partner -- " Smiling Siew."</P>
      <P>Lee said that Ma, after playing up the issue of his running mate for months,
hastily announced his partner on the eve of a party congress, which is set to
approve a revised party charter tailored to allow Ma to continue running for
president even if he is convicted of corruption.</P>
      <P>Ma, who served as Taipei mayor for two terms between 1998 and 2006, was indicted
earlier this year for alleged misuse of the mayoral "special allowance fund" for
his discretionary use. The KMT is revising the party charter, which bars KMT
members found guilty in the first trial from representing the party in
elections.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) will begin issuing electronic alien
resident certificates (ARCs) embedded with advanced anti-forgery microchips to
replace the existing paper cards from July 1, an immigration official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the move is congruent with general world trends, the official said
it will not only bring new convenience to foreigners but will also contribute to
the government's anti-forgery and anti-terrorism drives.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage from July 1 through Dec. 31, the official said, the NIA
will only issue new ARCs with integrated circuit (IC) chips to new applicants
and those who apply to replace older or lost ARCs.</P>
      <P>The fees for the new ARCs will remain unchanged at NT$1,000 (US$30.30) per year.</P>
      <P>Responding to calls by foreign expatriates for lower prices for ARCs, the
official said the fees are reasonable and much cheaper than those exacted in
many other countries, including the United States, Canada, New Zealand,
Australia and Japan.</P>
      <P>In the second phase from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2008, the official went on, all
existing ARC holders will be required to exchange their old paper cards for the
electronic ones.</P>
      <P>The official said the new ARC measures will also apply to the more than 330,000
foreign  blue-collar  workers  employed  by manufacturing and construction
companies as well as caregivers hired by families with patients in need of long-
term care.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the new IC ARCs are designed in line with the
electronic international ID cards (eID cards) adopted in advanced countries to
help speed up customs clearance and prevent forgery as well as help stave off
possible terrorist activities.</P>
      <P>NIA data shows that Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Finland, Estonia, Hong Kong, Mexico,
Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have issued eID cards while the United
States, Germany, Norway and Denmark have issued e-passports to prevent forgery
and fight terrorism, the official added.</P>

      <P>A Philippine Cultural Festival that includes a parade, song and dance
performances and a Miss Talent contest will be held in downtown  Taipei Sunday
to celebrate Philippine culture, the Taipei city government's Department of
Labor announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>The celebration, which is a part of the 2007 Southeast Asian Cultural Activities
series organized by the Migrant Workers' Cultural Center (MWCC) , is held to
ease the homesickness of the more-than 8,000 Filipino workers in Taipei City and
to foster bilateral understanding between Taiwanese and Filipinos, said
Department of Labor Commissioner Su Yin-kuei.</P>
      <P>The first event will be a cultural parade that starts from St. Christopher's
Church going to the Taipei Art Park, where the remaining activities will take
place. To highlight the diversity of Philippine culture, there will be song and
dance performances by various indigenous tribes, as well as a choir from St.
Christopher's Church and foreign groups.</P>
      <P>A Miss Talent contest will also take place, with the final winner getting a
Taipei-Manila round-trip ticket and cash.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has been very supportive of foreign workers, according to
Reynaldo Gopez, labor representative of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office

      <P>Father Romeo Velos from St. Christopher's Church, where thousands of Filipino
Catholics gather every Sunday for Mass, said the international community is no
loner homogeneous and that foreign workers are not only laborers and strangers.</P>
      <P>"They are, at the same time, residents and our brothers and sisters, " Velos

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will continue to attempt to persuade the
United States to understand the need for President Chen Shui-bian to seek a
referendum on Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations under the name of
"Taiwan, "a MOFA official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Deputy Representative to the United States Huang Wei-feng made the
remarks to reporters after attending a seminar at George Washington University,
in response to the U.S. State Department's opposition to Chen's referendum
proposal.</P>
      <P>U.S. State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack said Tuesday that such a
referendum would raise tension between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Huang explained at the seminar that Taiwan government decided to strive for
entry to the U.N. and the World Health Organization under the name of "Taiwan"
this year after having sufferd many setbacks in its bids to join various world
bodies in the past decade.</P>
      <P>Responding  to questions about the necessity of holding a referendum -- since
poll results already show public support for Taiwan's U.N. bid -- Huang said
that a referendum can "truly show the people's will" because it is active
involvement compared with passively answering poll questions via telephone.</P>
      <P>Huang said it is understandable that the U.S. does not agree to Taiwan's
referendum proposal but said the MOFA will keep communicating with the U.S. to
let it know the referendum proposal is "the will of the people of Taiwan" and
that the government has to "respect the people's decision."</P>

      <P>Main opposition  Kuomintang  (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou's choice
of former Premier Vincent Siew as his running mate has drawn mixed reactions
from within the party but has won support from its ally, the People First Party
(PFP), and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU).</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng were
optimistic about the Ma-Siew ticket, saying that Siew's financial and economic
expertise, as well as his ability in handling crises will boost the party's
chance in winning the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a caucus whip of the PFP, said the ticket represents the
combination of integrity and financial expertise, which he described as "worthy
of expectations."</P>
      <P>NPSU Chairman Lin Ping-kun noted that Siew comes from an impoverished family in
Chiayi, giving him a background close to the grassroots, and said that even if
it is not a plus, it is at least not a minus.</P>
      <P>But some KMT members expressed worry, saying that while Siew definitely will
complement Ma in terms of his financial expertise and his being a Hoklo -- the
largest ethnic group in Taiwan -- "the biggest problem of this ticket is that it
is not fresh enough, given the current volatile Taiwan society and the
preferences of the electorate."</P>
      <P>Some even said that "they are bracing for a drop in approval ratings for the KMT
ticket in the next couple of days."</P>
      <P>KMT legislators Su Chi and Lin Yu-fang were positive about the team's strength,
saying that it will be a boost to the party and Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Su said that a "new" running mate is not necessarily the best choice, while Lin
said that Siew's solid economic and political background and his coming from
Chiayi,  as well as his less distinctive political and party stripes, make him a
suitable choice.</P>

      <P>Taiwan reopened its doors to Canadian boneless beef from cattle under 30 months
of age Saturday, ending a three-and-a-half-year import ban on Canadian beef out
of concern over mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ting-hung, deputy director of the Bureau of Food Safety under the
Department of Health (DOH) , said Canadian beef entering Taiwan must bear health
and hygiene certification issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CIFA)
and must be handled and packed by DOH-approved slaughterhouses and packaging
facilities in Canada.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsieh said, the beef should be free of all bone and other animal parts
regarded as high-risk in terms of the deadly disease. These parts include
principally brains and spinal cords.</P>
      <P>Taiwan issued an import ban on beef from Canada, the United States, Japan,
Britain and several other European Union countries Dec. 31, 2003 amid fears over
the threat of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government applied to the DOH in March 2004 for lifting the import
ban, Hsieh said, adding that the DOH agreed to reopen the doors to Canadian beef
with stringent restrictions only after holding 11 rounds of consultative
meetings with health experts in terms of BSE prevention measures unveiled by the
World Health Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsieh said, the DOH had sent personnel to Canada for field study and
comprehensive assessment before deciding to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>Besides demanding the Canadian government produce regular reports on its
enforcement of BSE prevention and control measures, Hsieh said the DOH has also
asked relevant government agencies, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
to step up beef safety inspection and crack down on smuggling.</P>
      <P>City and county health bureaus have also been ordered to intensify inspection of
supermarket chains and hypermarts to check whether Canadian beef imports meet
relevant DOH regulations or requirements.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, Hsieh added that only beef from the United States, New Zealand,
Australia and Canada is allowed to enter Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "green energy" industry's annual output value is expected to reach
NT$152.4 billion (US$4.65 billion) by 2009 as Taiwanese enterprises have been
continuing to expand their investments in the sector with the government's
encouragement, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) officials
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Environmental protection has become an important issue worldwide after signs
that the global warming is worsening as the greenhouse effect expands. Out of
environmental protection concerns, more and more people around the world are
turning to non-polluting, recycled green products, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The green-purchasing trend has changed enterprises' passive attitude toward
environmental protection to an active and aggressive attitude and they have
begun injecting money into research and production of so-called green products
such as renewable energy and technology to cut down carbon dioxide emissions,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>In the green trend over the past few years, the world's investment in the green
energy industry has risen from the level of US$28 billion in 2004 to US$71
billion in 2006, representing a 1.5-fold increase, the CEPD said, touting the
sector as a rising star in global investment.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the annual production value of the green energy sector amounted to
NT$92.96 billion in 2006, posting a growth of 40 percent over the previous year,
while that of the environmental protection services sector grew from NT$39.63
billion in 2004 to NT$57.39 billion in 2005, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In the government's planned efforts to push for the emerging industries'
development, the green output is expected to increase to NT$152.4 billion in
green energy production and NT$70.9 billion in environmental protection services
by 2009, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Militants Said to Flee Before U.S. Offensive

The operational commander of troops battling to drive fighters with Al Qaeda
from Baquba said Friday that 80 percent of the top Qaeda leaders in the city
fled before the American-led offensive began earlier this week. He compared
their flight with the escape of Qaeda leaders from Falluja ahead of an American
offensive that recaptured that city in 2004.

In an otherwise upbeat assessment, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the second-
ranking American commander in Iraq, told reporters that leaders of Al Qaeda in
Mesopotamia had been alerted to the Baquba offensive by widespread public
discussion of the American plan to clear the city before the attack began.

Wall Street Journal:Bear Stearns Bails Out Fund With Big Loan

Bear Stearns Cos.'s dramatic decision to lend as much as $3.2 billion to one of
its two troubled hedge funds staves off the risk of a fund collapse that could
have damaged its position as a major Wall Street bond player -- and had the
potential to ripple through a jittery subprime-mortgage market.

The loan on Friday came only after days of high -stakes brinksmanship with some
of Wall Street's biggest players. All wanted to protect their stakes in the
hedge funds, but they worried as well that a liquidation of the funds -- which
invested heavily in subprime-mortgage assets -- risked igniting a broader panic
in the mortgage- bond market.</TEXT>

      <P>Hong Kong's "democracy and press freedom" have been continuously regressing
since its return to China and there is no sign of possible improvement at this
moment, scholars and journalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan said Saturday in
asymposium.</P>
      <P>As Hong Kong was the model city in Asia for its cultural diversity and economic
development in the 1980s and 1990s, now it looks like Taiwan in the 1950s and
1960s, political wise, said Tung Li-wen, a professor and the vice president of
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy, in a syposium one week before the 10th
anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to China on June 30, 1997,
signifying the end of British ruling for over 100 years.</P>
      <P>July 1, 2003, when half a million Hong Kong residents marched on streets to
protest against the Basic Law that had stripped away the basic civilian freedom,
was an important date in Hong Kong history, Tung said.</P>
      <P>"Before that day, Chinese government didn't think the governence of Hong Kong is
a big problem. After that, it knew Hong Kong would be abig problem, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The past 10 years of Hong Kong can be summed up with three characteristics:
inconsistent economy,  regressed democracy, and diverted media, " said Paul Lin,
a political commentator who fled from China to Hong Kong and now lives in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China's failed experience in Hong Kong was the main reason why it had never
mentioned that Hong Kong's "One country, two systems" framework would serve as a
good example for Taiwan after 2003, Tung noted.</P>
      <P>"It is also interesting that 'chief executive' has become a term of insult and
"SAR" (special administrative region) basically means puppet regime in Taiwan, "
he added.</P>
      <P>Donald  Tsang,  chief executive  of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region,
is smart to direct people's attention to economy instead of politics, Lin said.
However, Hong Kong's economy was not as optimistic as it seemed since it had
relied heavily on China since 1997, he stressed.</P>
      <P>A number  of  Hong  Kong  press  members  lamented  about self-censorship and
self-restraint of Hong Kong media. Because of China's tighter control and
interference, Hong Kong's press freedom has dropped to 66th in the world in 2006
in the independent Freedom House survey, said Woo Lai Wan, chairperson of Hong
Kong Journalists Association.</P>
      <P>Woo called for a "never retreat" mentality against the oppression from China for
Hong Kong and Taiwan media alike.</P>

      <P>The amendment,  introduced by Republican Representative Tom Tancredo, demands

restricted official contacts with Taiwan since the United States switched
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.</P>
      <P>The guidelines bar the top Taiwan leader from visiting the United States (only
transit stops are permissible) , prohibit Taiwan's foreign minister from

aimed at promoting exports of the southern Taiwan county's farm produce, mangoes
in particular, local officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>It will be the fourth consecutive year that Su has visited Japan to boost sales

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei has collaborated  with
National Geographic  in producing a documentary on its vast trove of art
treasures to be introduced to international audience, museum curators said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>It marks the first time that the museum-- home to the best of the 1,000-year-old
art collection of China's emperors -- has cooperated with an international media
outlet to film its magnificent holdings for presentation to TV audience around
the world, NPM Director Lin Mun-lee said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NPM houses the world's most famous collection of Chinese art,
Lin said the hour-long documentary will provide a fascinating glimpse into the
finest of Chinese cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>The film features three spheres of focus -- the history of the museum's huge and
versatile art collection, the epic-like story of the museum's emigration from
China to Taiwan and how the museum has harnessed modern technology to display
its invaluable art objects in fresh, dynamic ways to the public, Lin said.</P>
      <P>National Geographic has sent a seasoned crew to produce the film, including Mike
Barrett, writer and producer of the project; Jamie Hamill, director of
photography; Christopher Slaughter, managing director; and Jonathan Schutz,
director.</P>
      <P>According to NPM curators, the National Geographic feature has not only
catalogued the museum's priceless art treasures but also spun out their subtext,
including maintenance, security and delicate logistics such as temperature and
humidity. The filming started June 14 and wrapped up Saturday.</P>
      <P>The museum houses several items that are the pride of their collection and
famous worldwide, including the "Jade Cabbage", a piece of jade carved into the
shape of a head of cabbage, with an insect attached; the "meat-shaped stone", a
piece of agate, the strata of which are cleverly used to create a likeness of a
piece of pork cooked in soy sauce; a boat carved from an olive pit; and the
"Painting of One Hundred Horses"; as well as four paintings from the Northern
and Southern Song Dynasties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou promised the
country Sunday that if elected in the 2008 race, and if the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) -led "pan-green" lawmakers outnumber KMT-led "pan-blue"
legislators at that time, he will allow the DPP to organize the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Making the vow at a KMT congress, Ma, who named former premier Vincent Siew his
running mate the day before, said that if elected, he will put forth an
appropriate plan for political reforms but will not seek to change or rewrite
the nation's constitution arbitrarily.</P>
      <P>Ma said if elected, he will push for judicial reforms and will remain
stringently neutral and let Cabinet operate independently.</P>
      <P>The former Taipei city mayor and KMT chairman spelled out four major goals that
he vowed to achieve if elected president of the Republic of China in 2008. Those
goals are: Revive Taiwan's core values, rev up Taiwan's economy, secure Taiwan's
dignity, and create a promising future for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the economic fronts, Ma said Siew, his running mate, will play the role of
"chief engineer" of the country's economic revival if the ticket wins the 2008
election, adding that he will see to it that all of Taiwan becomes a free trade
zone, which will win back funds and shipments  to Taiwan from around  the world,
help lower the unemployment rate to below 3 percent and allow Taiwan's per
capita income to top US$20,000 by 2011.</P>
      <P>Ma said if elected, he will return long-lost "dignity" to the people of Taiwan
and make sure that the ruling KMT discard unhealthy unification/independence
issues and instead shift to issues that are directly related to the people's
welfare and interest.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's international status, Ma said if elected, he will seek to allow
Taiwan to take part in global activities more often while  securing  Taiwan's
sovereignty  and  avoiding  hostile confrontations with China. He urged the
people of Taiwan not to look on Taiwan's status and situation in the world as
hopeless just because unfair treatment that the island has encountered.</P>
      <P>On the educational front, Ma said if elected, he will seek to develop Taiwan
into the world's Mandarin-learning hub and raise Taiwan's profile via cultural
means.</P>

      <P>A Kinmen detachment of the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) referred a Chinese
mainland national to the Kinmen Public Prosecutors' Office Sunday after he swam
from a beach in Xiamen, Fujian province, to Dadan Islet a day earlier, where he

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, former chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
party's presidential candidate, vowed to go all out Sunday for the party's
victory in the coming legislative and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the call while leaving the KMT's 17th national congress, during which
party delegates gave their approval to the presidential ticket of Ma and former
Premier Vincent Siew. Ma announced that he had selected Siew as his running mate
a day earlier.</P>
      <P>While pledging his resolve to win back power in 2008, Ma also encouraged the
KMT's legislative candidates to do their best to win more than half of the seats

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,  a KMT heavyweight previously favored to
serve as Ma's running mate, said that he is more than confident that the Ma-Siew
ticket will win the next presidential poll.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions on whether or not he has been invited to
serve as the Ma-Siew camp's election campaign manager, Wang replied that he has
not been contacted by anyone regarding this issue and argued that it is "too

      <P>Representatives of nearly 30 social activists groups said Sunday that they have
not ruled out the possibility of fielding their own candidates in the next
legislative election to fight for greater rights for the people.</P>
      <P>Twenty-eight social groups, which represent over 700 sub-groups islandwide,
formed a single confederation Sunday to better present the views of popular
groups, particularly disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>Bai Hsiu-hsiung, formerly a deputy Taipei mayor, said during a ceremony marking
the establishment of the Taiwan Social Welfare Confederation that the
confederation has not excluded the possibility of seeking group members to run
for legislative seats so that the voices of private social groups would no
longer fall on the deaf ears of the major ruling and opposition political
parties. Bai spoke in his capacity as chairman of a preparatory  committee  of
the confederation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Ming-li, chief secretary of the preparatory committee, said his
confederation firmly opposes the practice of Democratic Progressive Party and
Kuomintang candidates bidding for the votes of farmers, fishermen, and senior
citizens by promising ever greater subsidies or annuities.</P>
      <P>This kind of contest is nothing more than political ploy to win votes in general
elections, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen noted, however, that it is still too early to tell whether the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alishan forest railway was disrupted Sunday when a landslide caused by heavy
rains damaged a section of the line near the end of a tunnel.</P>
      <P>According to the Chiayi office of the Council of Agriculture's Forestry Bureau,
which manages the rail line, it will take at least 50 days to repair the damaged
section of the railway.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the office pointed out that successive afternoon thunderstorms
during the past few days caused a landslide near No. 42 Tunnel, located 59
kilometers from Chiayi Station, and damaged the railway.</P>
      <P>The Alishan railway is said to be one of the world's three remaining alpine
railways. The other two are located in northern India, connecting Himalayan
mountains, and in the Andean mountain range of South America.</P>
      <P>Opened in 1912 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the narrow-gauge railway
was designed to haul timber down the mountain, but is now mainly used to
transport the more than 200,000 tourists who annually visit Alishan to see the
area's beauty at an altitude of more than 2,200 meters in Taiwan's Central
Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>The scenic rail line winds its way up from the subtropical plains to mountainous
pine forests in just 72 kilometers, crossing more than 80 bridges and passing
through about 50 tunnels. Its route includes a series of dangerous switchbacks.</P>
      <P>Although the government has been operating the train at an annual loss of about
NT$110 million (US$3.35 million) , it has decided to preserve the line not only
for its historic value but as a means to boost local tourism.</P>

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) approved Sunday a revision to the party
charter during its 17th national congress, clearing the way for its presidential
candidate to run in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 party delegates endorsed the revision, giving it their
unanimously approval during the meeting chaired by KMT Vice Chairman P. K.
Chiang at the stadium in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The party charter amendment, which allows party members standing trials to run
for public offices on party tickets before they are "convicted" in the third
trial, will replace a regulation that prohibited those convicted in the first
trial from vying for the party's nomination in elections.</P>
      <P>The change will permit Ma Ying-jeou, who had been indicted on embezzlement
charges  before  being named as KMT presidential candidate, to run in the coming
presidential election until he is convicted in the third trial.</P>
      <P>KMT delegates  also enthusiastically  approved  the party's presidential ticket
of Ma and former Premier Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>In addition, KMT delegates added a clause underscoring the party's "Taiwan-
centric" beliefs in its charter,  promising to prioritize to bring benefits to
Taiwan's people, while replacing the word "unification" with "peaceful
development" in another clause to underscore its stand concerning Taiwan's
relations with China.</P>
      <P>Ma was indicted by Taipei prosecutors in mid-February for allegedly misusing
funds from a special monthly municipal allowance designated for his
discretionary use when he served as mayor of Taipei from 1998-2006. He stepped
down from the party's top post shortly after the indictment.</P>
      <P>Despite the corruption charges, the KMT nonetheless nominated Ma in May as its
presidential candidate, stirring up strong social criticism.</P>

      <P>A total of 271 second-generation, overseas Taiwanese from 23 countries around
the world will start eight-week internships at some 50 institutes and companies
in southern Taiwan Monday to enable them to gain a deeper understanding and
greater recognition of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>NSC officials said that the Taiwan Teck Trek internship program has expanded
since its inception in 2005, from 183 participants to this year's 271
participants, and from six-week internships to this year's eight-week
internships.</P>
      <P>They said the Taiwan Tech Trek -- held for the first time in 2005 -- is designed
to offer internships to young overseas Taiwanese students in the hope that their
visits to Taiwan will provide incentives for them to work in Taiwan after
graduation.</P>
      <P>More than 800 young Taiwanese descendants have applied for 271 internship
openings this year, the official said, adding that 24 of the 271 selected had
taken part in the 2005 or 2006 programs.</P>
      <P>The NSC will finance each "trekkie" with NT$50,000 (US$1,515) for the internship
courses, although they will have to pay for their airline tickets, room and
board, and insurance, NSC officials said.</P>
      <P>Before starting their internships at various institutes and companies July 1,
the "trekkies" will travel in a group to Tainan City to visit historic sites,
explore their cultural legacy, view the famous local yacht industry, salt-
processing industry, and a biotech industrial park in Tainan County, between

      <P>In an effort to prevent illegal waste dumping, the Taipei City government has
decided to grant cash rewards to citizens who provide information leading to the
arrest of offenders, with the rewards of up to 30 percent of fines collected by
the agency, a city official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has stepped up its crack
down on wanton waste dumping and littering since June 2000 when it implemented
the "fee per bag" measure, which required residents to purchase specially
designated trash bags for the disposal of garbage, and a "No Drop" policy which
prohibited leaving garbage on the streets.</P>
      <P>The DEP, based on information supplied by local residents, has uncovered a total
of 8,000 cases of illegal waste dumping over the past five months, and
investigated 14,243 cases altogether during the last year, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>Under the Waste Disposal Act, those convicted of illegally dumping waste face
fines ranging from NT1,200 (US$36.36) to NT$6,000, the official said.</P>
      <P>The DEP is now poised to adopt measures to further crack down on improper
dumping and encourage the public to provide information on offenders, the
spokesman noted, stating that beginning July 1, violators will be subject to
heavy fines if they commit offenses more than twice within a year.</P>

      <P>Students from an elementary school in Taiwan's southernmost county, Pingtung,
are collecting used cooking oil at the school and having it turned into
biodiesel fuel, which has thus far powered a teacher's car for over 30,000
kilometers.</P>
      <P>Tung An Elementary School in Pingtung County's Nanchou Rural Township began to
process used household cooking oil into biodiesel fuel three years ago to help
keep the environment clean and to improve environmental  efficiency in the
county,  which is an agricultural area with many orchards,  Tung An Principal
Tsai Ching-wen said.</P>
      <P>"We experienced a bumpy start during which there was little action, but then
more and more students started to bring in waste oil after repeated public
campaigns," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Cheng-wen, the teacher responsible for instructing students how to process
used household cooking oil into biodiesel, contributed his own diesel engine van
to serve as a "lab mouse" and use biodiesel fuel processed in a makeshift
factory at the school.</P>

      <P>A student's grandmother has been one of the most steadfast supporters, not only
contributing used cooking oil, but also expired, clean cooking oil.</P>
      <P>Biodiesel  is simple to use,  biodegradable,  nontoxic and essentially free of
sulfur and aromatics. Most importantly, biodiesel provides a way for the
county's households and eateries to dispose of their used cooking oil in an
environmentally friendly manner, Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>The spokesman added that the office will now pursue the piracy cases as they
would have affected the rights of lawful businesses in Taiwan selling the
Nintendo video games.</P>
      <P>He said the pirated Wii discs, worth about NT$600,000, would have seriously
disrupt the market prices of the games.</P>
      <P>The latest Nintendo game console is becoming increasingly popular in Taiwan,
with the number of owners estimated at more than 20,000, although the product is
yet to be formally marketed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the National Communications Commission, Taiwan's highest media
regulator, Nintendo has obtained certification in Taiwan for the Wii. Passengers
entering Taiwan are allowed to import two Wii's duty-free if they are certified
to be genuine Nintendo products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CANDIDATE CRITICIZES KMT CHARTER CHANGE, IGNORES POLL RESULTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
06/24/07  20:42:42
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank Hsieh, the presidential candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), Sunday dismissed poll results showing the opposition ticket in the
lead, saying that he cares more about doing the right thing and does not mind
temporary changes in opinion poll results.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in Pingtung County while answering reporters' questions
after local newspapers reported that public approval  ratings for the main
opposition  Kuomintang's  (KMT) presidential ticket, formed by former chairman
Ma Ying-jeou and former premier Vincent Siew, are higher than those of the DPP,
regardless of whether former Premier Su Tseng-chang or former Vice Premier Yeh
Chu-lan is chosen to complete the ticket.</P>
      <P>Ma announced that Siew would be his running mate a day earlier and KMT delegates
gave the pairing their stamp of approval during Sunday's 17th national congress
after agreeing to amend a clause of the party's charter that would have barred
Ma, who has been indicted on embezzlement charges, from taking part in the
presidential election if he is found quilty in the first trial.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the poll results showing that he is trailing the opposition, Hsieh
said that he will not be mindful of temporary ups- and -down in public approval
ratings, but rather focus on doing the right thing.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the KMT's charter revision, aimed at allowing Ma to run in
the coming presidential election, was improper, and the higher approval rating
Ma currently enjoys is meaningless. Hsieh went on to warn Ma that he might be
cast aside by voters upset with the KMT's wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, executive director of Hsieh's election campaign office, told a
news conference later the same day that the KMT's decision to revise its charter
to smooth the way for Ma was solely motivated by partisan gain and will
seriously hobble the development of party politics in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, DPP lawmaker Hsu Kuo-yung accused the KMT of
"back pedaling" on Taiwan's political development with the charter amendment. He
blamed the KMT for a lack of self-reflection and asked Ma to come up with a
clear explanation regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's pledge that if elected president, he would allow the DPP to
form a Cabinet should that party gain a majority of seats in the Legislative
Yuan, DPP legislative caucus whip Ker Chien-ming called Ma's promise an
"electoral gambit" to deceive voters, and a political maneuver by the KMT to
gloss over his corruption charges.</P>
      <P>"Ma's pledge is merely 'empty talk' because he knows very well that the DPP can
hardly win more than half of the seats in the legislature," Ker claimed.</P>
      <P>"If Ma is sincere in his vow that he will do his best to improve Taiwan's
economy," Ker asked, "why do 'pan-blue' lawmakers of the KMT and the People
First Party still refuse to approve some key bills devoted to the country's
economic development, such as the annual budget bills for state-run enterprises
and several special funds?"</P>
      <P>Regarding a United Daily newspaper report that the Ma-Siew ticket will lure
votes from supporters of the "pan-green" camp and median voters, DPP lawmaker
Wang Shu-hui called it a KMT trick, saying that the KMT was blowing its own
trumpet.</P>
      <P>According to the report, some 51 percent of the respondents to its survey favor
the Ma-Siew ticket and opined that Ma's pairing up with Siew will help lure an
additional 4 percent in support from "pan-green" and moderate voters.</P>

      <P>Taipei City Zoo filed an administrative suit against the Council of Agriculture
(COA) after repeated COA rejections of the zoo's applications to import pandas
from China, a spokesman for the zoo said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Rebutting the council's arguments that the zoo lacks well-trained personnel and
adequate facilities to house pandas, Spokesman Chiao Ming-chie said that the zoo
had sent staff to many countries to learn about the care of pandas.</P>
      <P>The zoo also sent a veterinarian and two staff members to China last month to
receive training, Chiao said, stressing that zoos in many countries send staff
overseas to undergo training one to three months before importing animals.</P>
      <P>Noting that the zoo has the expertise, facilities, and capability to care for
pandas, Chiao pointed out that the key problem lies in how to overcome the
limits that the Washington Accord imposes on the import and export of endangered
animals.</P>
      <P>To solve that problem, governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait need to
show sincerity and jointly work towards a solution, Chiao said, asserting that
now is the time for a breakthrough in the exchange of wild animals between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chiao also said that the zoo is dealing with the issue from a professional
viewpoint, adding that the zoo has consulted experts and public for opinions on
the issue in three meetings and one public hearing.</P>
      <P>The COA has consistently denied the zoo's applications reasoning that the
international  conservation  community favors in situ conservation over ex situ
conservation. However, according to Chiao, both approaches are equally
important.</P>
      <P>"You cannot just promote in situ conservation and totally reject ex situ
conservation," he went on.</P>
      <P>At present, the zoo has received total donations of NT$250 million (US$7.6
million) from local enterprises to sponsor the construction of an exhibition
hall for pandas, Chiao said, while admitting that progress is behind the
schedule, and stressing that construction will be completed by the end of this
year.</P>

Virtually every aspect of global migration can be seen in this tiny West African
nation, where the number of people who have left approaches the number who
remain and almost everyone has a close relative in Europe or America.

Migrant money buoys the economy. Migrant votes sway politics. Migrant departures
split parents from children, and the most famous song by the most famous Cape
Verdean venerates the national emotion, "Sodade," or longing. Lofty talk of
opportunity abroad mixes at cafe tables here with accounts of false documents

      <P>A man suspected by police in the shooting death of a Taipei County councilor
killed himself after engaging in a gun battle with police in Taipei late Sunday.</P>
      <P>The man, who was cornered by police at a private parking lot, fired at least
three or four shots at police before turning the gun to his own head.</P>
      <P>Police identified the man through a driver's license found on his body as Lan
Chia-wei, with Lan's identity later verified through fingerprinting. Lan had
been wanted by police in connection with the killing of Wu Shan-jeou, a Taipei
County councilor from Hsintien City , who was shot four times by a gunman in his
office on May 23, and died on spot.</P>
      <P>Lan was stopped by police at a roadblock in downtown Taipei Sunday night for a
routine check, but he suddenly dropped a bag he was carrying and tried to flee
the scene.</P>
      <P>Police officers gave chase on foot and called for reinforcements via radio. The
man drew a gun and shot at police officers, but he was finally cornered by
police at a private parking lot and continued the gun battle in an attempt to
escape.</P>
      <P>During the shoot-out, police fired some 20 shots before the man committed
suicide by turning the gun to his temple and pulling the trigger.</P>
      <P>He was sent to Mackay Memorial Hospital, but was declared dead on arrival
according to police.</P>
      <P>Lan's picture was published by police on June 18 as the main suspect in the
assassination of councilor Wu, as his image was caught on a surveillance camera
outside Wu's office minutes before the murder even though the suspect's face was
partially covered with sunglasses and a helmet.</P>
      <P>The police believe Lan was hired to kill Wu and they are working to track down
the masterminds behind the death, whom they believed have fled to mainland
China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said Monday that he will make "economy" the main theme of his election campaign.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting with KMT representatives from overseas at
the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>Asked why he picked former Premier Vincent Siew as his running mate, Ma pointed
out that what Taiwan most needs now is a good economy.</P>
      <P>"Don't talk to me about the independence versus unification issue now, because
it is a false issue unrelated to Taiwan's economic development, " he said,
adding, "It is a must to have another transfer  of power in 2008,  to reverse
Taiwan's  languishing performance over the past seven years."</P>
      <P>Siew, a veteran technocrat who served as premier from 1997-2000 and as economic
affairs minister 1990-1993, is popular for his familiarity with economic
affairs.</P>
      <P>According to several public opinion surveys carried out by local media outlets,
the Ma-Siew ticket is backed by some 50 percent of the public, well ahead of a
20 percent public approval rating enjoyed by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party ticket, regardless of whom joins its presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh,
on the ballot.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who served as premier from 2005-2006, has yet to announce his running
mate. Su Tseng-chang,  Hsieh's predecessor in the premiership from 2006-2007,
and Yeh Chu-lan, vice premier during the 2004-2005 period, are widely favored.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese human rights lawyer was turned away from Hong Kong airport Monday
after arriving from Taiwan the previous night.</P>
      <P>Chu Wan-chi told CNA that she arrived from Taiwan Sunday night but was refused
entry at the airport after immigration officials found that she had been
blacklisted by Hong Kong authorities for bringing a suit in 2003 against Hong
Kong authorities over their refusal of entry to a group of Taiwanese Falung Gong
practitioners.</P>
      <P>In that case, which is still pending in a local court, Chu has been acting on
behalf of three Taiwanese Falung Gong practitioners suing the Hong Kong
authorities for refusing 80-odd Taiwan Falung Gong practitioners entry to attend
an international gathering of Falung Gong followers in February, 2003.</P>
      <P>Chu, who entered Hong Kong June 19 and left June 20, told CNA that an
immigration  official took her to a room Sunday for questioning over the purpose
of her visit to Hong Kong, and whom she is intended to meet during her stay.</P>
      <P>Chu said she replied that she had come to witness the July 1 celebrations of
10th anniversary of Hong Kong's hand over to China.</P>
      <P>However, Chu said that immigration official would not let her enter despite the
willingness of local Falung Gong practitioners to vouch for her good behavior
during her stay, claiming that her stay would not serve the public interest.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the official took away her travel documents and ordered officers
with the riot squad to remove her shoes in preparation to forcefully carry her
onboard a Taiwan-bound Dragonair flight Sunday night.</P>
      <P>Asking that she be treated with due respect, Chu promised to board by herself,
but the plane took off before she arrived at the boarding gate, Chu said.</P>
      <P>She was therefore kept in an office waiting expulsion on the next flight.</P>
      <P>Condemning the Hong Kong government's illegal treatment of Taiwanese Falung Gong
practitioners, Chu said about 100 Taiwanese Falung Gong practitioners are trying
to travel to Hong Kong to take part in a march on July 1 to protest the crack
down by Chinese authorities, but none of their visa requests were granted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin Monday decreed that all passenger buses operating in
the city immediately undergo a thorough safety check following Sunday's
accident, in which a coach plunged into a ravine on scenic Yangmingshan in
surburban Taipei, killing eight people and injuring 25 others.</P>
      <P>According to statistics of the city Bureau of Transportation, there are
currently 265 passenger bus operators in Taipei, with more than 3,000 buses on
the road. Bureau Director Luo Hsiao-hsien said the bus companies that have been
recently ticketed for traffic violations will be the first subjected to safety
checks.</P>
      <P>Police will also crack down on violators of traffic regulations on Yangde
Boulevard,  the main road running through  National Yangmingshan Park, which is
a popular tourist attraction in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The Sunday accident, which occurred on Yangde Boulevard, saw the tour bus,
carrying a driver and 29 passengers, collide with the car in front of it before
going off road and into the ravine. According to the driver, who was injured in
the accident, faulty brakes were at fault.</P>
      <P>Hau said that a probe into the accident is still ongoing, and it is too soon to
determine what caused the tragedy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Luo said the bureau has found that the driver of the ill-fated
vehicle is well qualified to drive the large double-decker touring bus as he
holds the highest-degree license for driving trailer trucks. Additionally, the
bus, which was built in 2001, passed its regular check Jan. 20, and had been
scheduled to undergo another regular maintenance check on July 20.</P>
      <P>Asked why such a "good vehicle" sustained a brake failure, Luo speculated that
it might have resulted from an "improper" driving habit -- remaining in top gear
on a downhill road. In such a situation the driver must constantly apply the
vehicle's brakes to control its speed. As a result, the brakes are more likely
to overheat and break down, Luo said.</P>
      <P>Stressing these possible causes were wholly speculative, Luo noted that relevant
authorities are investigating whether the Sunday accident was caused by
mechanical failure or human error.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh Jung-lin, a prosecutor of the Shilin District Prosecutors
Office, indicated after his examination of the debris of the bus lying in the
ravine that the ill-fated vehicle had not only been remodeled, but was running
with retread tires,</P>
      <P>After being remodeled, the bus could no longer provide sufficient protection to
its passengers, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The bus owner, the Taipei-based Taiwan Tour Bus Company, has denied the
accusations.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that preparations for the
Double Ten National Day celebrations are following procedure.</P>
      <P>Wang, who concurrently serves as the chairman of the Oct. 10 National Day
Organizing Committee, made the remarks after listening to reports by Vice
Interior Minister Lin Chung-sheng on the preparations.</P>
      <P>Noting that President Chen Shui-bian suggested during a National Day rally last
year that the rally be scrapped in 2007, given that the public views on holding
the rally were so divergent and that some were reluctant to take part, Wang said
"all preparations are following set procedures."</P>
      <P>He said the committee has tentatively decided that the National Day celebration
party be held at Zuoying, Kaohsiung, while a National Day fireworks display will
be held at Pingtung in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since there will be National Day celebration party and fireworks, the National
Day rally in the daytime "should also be held, although its scale can be left
open for discussion."</P>
      <P>"The committee will also respect President Chen's decision on whether he wishes
to attend the rally, " he said, but added that the committee will have the final
say on whether to hold National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>When the National Day rally was held last year, it was at the height of a
"depose President Chen" campaign launched by a former chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over a series of alleged corruption scandals
surrounding his family members and close aides.</P>
      <P>During the National Day rally, red-clad opposition legislators were sitting on
both sides of the grandstand, separated completely by a white curtain from the
main section where the president, Vice President Annette Lu, and the heads of
the executive, legislative, judicial and examination yuans, as well as foreign
dignitaries, were seated.</P>
      <P>The curtain was set up by the National Day Organizing Committee in the hope of
avoiding embarrassment for the president during the event.</P>
      <P>However, brief scuffles broke out nevertheless. During Chen's address,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) legislators continued
to chant "step down" slogans, unfurled "depose Chen" banners, and flashed the
"thumbs down" sign for several minutes to lend support to the anti-Chen
protesters.</P>
      <P>The actions triggered angry responses from DPP legislators sitting next to them.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong led party legislators in an abrupt walkout from the
grandstand during Chen's address, which caused nervousness among security
personnel.</P>

      <P>The suspected gunman in the May 23 assassination of Taipei County Councilor Wu
Shan-chiu shot himself shortly before midnight Sunday in a parking lot in Taipei
after engaging in a shootout with police, a police spokesman announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-kang, spokesman for the police task force investigating the
assassination case, said Lan Chia-wei, 35, shot himself in the head after he was
encircled by a special police unit, and that he was pronounced dead on arrival
at a hospital.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Lan's mother had confirmed her son's identity.</P>
      <P>Lan was believed to be the killer who went into Wu's service office in suburban
Taipei May 23 and pumped five bullets into him at close range, killing him
instantly.</P>
      <P>Police acting on information from CCTV footage traced Lan through two thieves
who provided him with a stolen motorcycle to carry out the murder.</P>
      <P>The police task force is still trying to track down the suspected mastermind
identified by the surname Wu, who police said has fled to China, and another
chief suspect, Wang Yao-kai, who, according to the two motorcycle thieves,
abetted them in stealing the motorcycle at an agreed price.</P>
      <P>Police  have indicated  that they are working  through  a cross-Taiwan Strait
anti-crime mechanism to ask police in China to catch the mastermind and
repatriate him to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The motivation for the murder is unclear, but the task force spokesman said
police believe the criminals wanted to get rid of the opposition People First
Party councilor because he had spoken out against vested interest groups in the

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) is considering the
introduction of mandatory seat belts for passengers in coaches that are used on
mountain roads, the director of the MOTC department of railways and highways
revealed Monday.</P>
      <P>Yin Cheng-peng explained that the proposal was brought up to decrease the number
of people killed or injured in traffic accidents after a tour bus ran off the
road and crashed into a ravine on Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei City Sunday,
causing eight deaths and 25 injuries.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations governing road traffic safety, all seats on coaches have
had to be equipped with seat belts since Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>However, Yin said, the law only demands for the installation of seat belts, but
does not stipulate that passengers must use them.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to a statement from the Shaklee (Asia) Inc., the American-
owned direct sales company that lost eight employees in Sunday's accident, the
family of each of the dead is entitled to insurance compensation of at least
NT$4 million.</P>
      <P>The tour bus, carrying 29 passengers, was rented by the company's Taiwan branch
to take its sales people from around the island to a meeting in the scenic
Yangmingshan National Park.</P>

      <P>Taiwan received export orders totaling US$27.53 billion in May, representing a
year-on-year growth of 11.92 percent, according to statistics released Monday by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that Taiwan received export orders totaling US$130.87
billion in the first five months of this year, up 12.25 percent from the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>In terms of export items, information and telecommunications products made the
biggest contribution,  increasing by US$1.23 billion, or up 27.62 percent from
the same month of last year, mainly because demand for notebook computers was
strong and international companies continued to subcontract orders to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In May, Taiwan received orders from Hong Kong and China totaling US$7.45 billion
in May, ahead of those valued at US$6.8 billion from the United States.</P>
      <P>Among the companies  surveyed by the MOEA,  22.67 percent anticipated that their
orders will increase in June, while 24.77 percent expected dropping contract
numbers and 52.56 percent expected the value of their foreign orders in June
will be at the same level as for May.</P>
      <P>MOEA Director-General of Statistics Huang Chi-shi estimated that foreign orders
will continue to increase thanks to steady growth of global trading and the
strong demand from emerging economies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Seven workers were injured Monday when a Taoyuan County factory producing high-
purity chemicals for electronics manufacturing was destroyed by fire.</P>
      <P>The injured workers were hospitalized with burns and respiratory problems caused
by inhaling toxic fumes.</P>
      <P>The fire occurred during a chemical dispensing process and spread to a storage
tank at the Luchu township-based factory owned by E Kay Technology Co.</P>
      <P>The fierce blaze soared as high as a 20-story building and produced a huge black
pall of smoke that could be seen from five kilometers away.</P>
      <P>Fire departments in the area dispatched 27 fire trucks to the fire scene and it
took nearly six hours for firemen to bring the conflagration under control.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Council of Labor Affairs said they will go back to the fire
scene with fire experts to establish the cause of the fire.</P>
      <P>E Kay Technology Coa. is a subsidiary of Yee Fong Chemical and Industrial Co. It
was established in August 2000 to produce propylene oxide-based glycol ethers
(POGEs) , which are in increasing demand because their high purity and low metal
content make the materials ideal for the manufacturing of sensitive electronics
components.</P>
      <P>POGEs are used for the etching or depositing of conductive lines, as well as the
removal of contaminant deposits and final cleaning of components. High purity of
the materials is required because the slightest impurity could cause a short
circuit on these highly sophisticated components.</P>
      <P>E Kay Technology supplies around 100,000 tons per year of specialist chemicals
to the Taiwanese electronics industry.</P>

      <P>The DOH has sent extra personnel to carry out disinfection spraying around the
man's house in the hope of eliminating the breeding sites of the mosquitoes that
carry the disease. However, the mosquito density in the area was still high,

who have yet to be detected.</P>
      <P>The health officials will conduct a more thorough examination of the area.</P>

approved former China Steel Corp. Chairman Lin Wen-yuan to return to his old

      <P>Lin has served as chairman of the Taiwan Cogeneration Corp. since leaving China
Steel in October 2005.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Shih Yen-hsiang said the ministry has notified China
Steel of the Cabinet's decision. China Steel is set to convene a board meeting

      <P>A new post for current China Steel Chairman Chiang Yao-tsung has yet to be

President Chen Shui-bian and said to be an able hand in soliciting campaign

    <HEADLINE>CDC TRACKING PATIENTS WITH SUPER-DRUG-RESISTANT FORM OF TB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
06/25/07  21:07:58
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan might have 17 patients with super drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis
(TB) remaining unaccounted for, an official with the Center for Disease Control
(CDC) under the Department of Health said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-yang, a CDC division chief, made the remarks after U.S. health
officials quarantined a man in late May over concern that he might have exposed
passengers on two trans-Atlantic flights to a dangerous form of TB that the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified as "extensively drug-
resistant TB."</P>
      <P>Quoting CDC tallies, Yang said an average of 15,000 new TB cases are reported in
Taiwan annually, about 6,000 of which are contagious.</P>
      <P>Among local TB patients, Yang went on, an estimated 300 to 400 have multiple
drug-resistant forms of TB. "And a further assessment shows that about 20 have
even more dangerous super drug-resistant forms of TB," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the CDC has so far only tracked down three patients with super drug-
resistant forms of TB, Yang said 17 others suspected to have similar illness
remain unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>"We are worried that they might expose other people to the disease, " Yang said,
adding that those with super drug-resistant forms of TB should immediately come
forward to receive special treatment.</P>
      <P>Those with contagious or dangerous forms of TB should also refrain from taking
long-distance flights to prevent spread of the disease, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Tuberculosis is a major communicable disease that the government has spent much
money and energy fighting. Although the mortality rate has dropped by nearly 20
percent since the government launched a new treatment project, Yang said, TB
remained the 13th highest cause of death in Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yang added, the number of TB deaths outnumbered that of all other
communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that usually attacks the lungs. It is
spread through the air and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing
up blood. There were an estimated 1.6 million deaths from TB in 2005, according
to the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>In late May, the U.S. government quarantined a patient with a super drug-
resistant form of TB after he violated rules on taking long-distance flights. It
marked the first U.S. federal quarantine order in 44 years.</P>
      <P>To ensure public health and hygiene and protect  airborne passengers from being
infected with TB, Yang said the DOH has decided to forbid those with multi-drug-
resistant forms of TB from taking any flights from July 1 and those with
contagious TB from taking international flights that last eight hours or longer.
Violators will be slapped with fines ranging between NT$10,000 (about US$303)
and NT$150,000.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Hussein Cousin Sentenced to Die for Kurd Attacks

As the judge pronounced five death sentences on the man Iraqis know as Chemical
Ali, the defendant seemed on Sunday to be a shadow of the merciless enforcer who
oversaw poison gas attacks that killed thousands of Kurdish villagers in Iraqs
northern uplands nearly 20 years ago.

At the age of 61, severely weakened by diabetes, the defendant, Ali Hassan al-
Majid, leaned heavily on a walking stick for the 18 minutes it took the judge to
read guilty verdicts on counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity. Unlike his cousin Saddam Hussein, whose shouted defiance nearly
drowned out the judge who sent him to the gallows last year, Mr. Majid offered
no protest until the judge ordered bailiffs to lead him from the iron-ribbed
cage that serves as a dock.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) vowed Monday to push through a draft
organic law concerning the formation of the Central Election Commission (CEC) in
a proposed legislative extra session.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shao-ping, the KMT's legislative caucus whip, told reporters that the party
is poised to have the draft CEC organic law approved during the planned extra
session now that the KMT has allowed the passage of the 2007 central government
budget bill June 15 -- the last day of the previous session.</P>
      <P>Hsu's remarks came after Ker Chien-ming, the legislative caucus whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), called earlier that same day for an
extra legislative session to be held as soon as possible to handle 13 bills that
it submitted, and urged the KMT not to continue insisting on first screening the
draft CEC organic law as a way to block other bills.</P>
      <P>Since the annual budget bill has cleared the Legislative Yuan, Hsu argued that
the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) should in
turn permit the draft CEC organic law crafted by the "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT and the People First Party (PFP) to pass.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the 13 bills that the DPP hopes to deal with in the extra session,
Hsu said the KMT will support the passage of those pertaining to Taiwan's
economic development but will not back bill that aims to get back for the
national coffers the KMT's ill-gotten assets.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the KMT will come up with a decision next week on when to hold
the legislative session, with the date tentatively set for July 9.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a Legislative Yuan news conference earlier in the day, Ker said the
DPP legislative caucus has gained sufficient endorsements from lawmakers to call
an extra session to address the 13 important bills -- including sunshine bills
on political donations and the KMT's ill-gotten assets, a five-year NT$500
billion public work expansion bill and a budget bill for state-run companies, as
well as bills aimed at the underprivileged and a tax reform bill.</P>
      <P>Now that Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT's presidential candidate, has vowed to devote his
energy to helping reinvigorate what he has called Taiwan's dwindling economy,
Ker said, Ma should ask the KMT lawmakers not to block the sunshine and economic
stimulus bills.</P>

      <P>From July 1, those who are infected with infectious tuberculosis (TB) will be
barred from taking long-haul international flights of over eight hours, the
Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yang Shih-yang, a section chief of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said that
those infected with infectious TB should wait for tests to show negative after
taking medicine for two weeks before boarding a long-haul flight.</P>
      <P>Those infected with multiple drug-resistant TB will not be allowed to fly at all
until they are fully recovered, with violators facing fines of between NT$10,000
and NT$150,000 (US$303-US$4,545) , he said.</P>
      <P>As domestic flights are all less than an hour in duration, the DOH has yet to
set restrictions on these flights for TB patients, Yang said.</P>
      <P>But he said infectious TB patients should wear a surgical mask throughout the
flight, while multiple drug-resistant TB patients should refrain from taking
domestic flights.</P>

patients to immigration authorities in September.</P>

      <P>According to Li, Hsu claimed he was not aware there was a rhino horn in the golf

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang,
pledged Monday to make Taiwan a "free trade zone" so as to more competitively
open the country to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Ma made the pledge while giving a keynote speech in Taipei titled: "Taiwan's
Turn" in English during a forum sponsored by UBS AG, Taipei Branch.</P>
      <P>Stressing his determination  to promote trade and economic policies based on
"Taiwan-centric" beliefs to benefit Taiwan's people if he wins the 2008
presidential poll, Ma promised that he will do his best to build Taiwan into a
"free trade zone" that would allow the country to further reach out.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's refusal to set up direct
transport links with China and its restrictions on China-bound investment by
local companies have negatively impacted Taiwan's economy, Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>The KMT candidate said he is confident that Taiwan's economy will be given a
boost if he is elected president, adding that his pairing up with Vincent Siew
-- a veteran economic technocrat who served as premier from 1997-2000 -- has
also helped ease concern in the business community.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, foreign investors and companies believe that the election of
the KMT ticket will help revive Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>The main theme of his election campaign will be the economy, he said, adding
that the DPP government has had five premiers serving six terms of premiership
over the past seven years.</P>
      <P>With such frequent changes of premier, the government has been unable to hammer
out comprehensive policies to fit Taiwan's economic needs, according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Recounting recent trip he made to Singapore and India, Ma said Taiwan's economic
development and its relations with China are the two issues about which most
"foreign friends" are concerned with regard to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also touted the importance of a "non mutual denial" concept broached by
himself to promote peace and development in cross-Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Like most of Taiwan's people who favor maintaining the status quo across the
strait,  Ma said,  he will make it clear to the international community upon his
election that the Republic of China does not intend to alter the current cross-
strait situation.</P>
      <P>Ma also expressed his belief that a new TV ad showing him striding ahead against
a blank background will help relay his message to the public that Taiwan needs

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will hold a roundtable Tuesday to discuss
major labor policy concerns, including the much-anticipated overhaul of foreign
labor policy, government sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The roundtable will bring together representatives of labor unions  and employer
associations  as well as labor  affairs administrators and academics to exchange
views on major labor policy concerns, the sources said.</P>
      <P>It meeting will be the first of its kind since the minimum wage was hiked and
new CLA Chairman Lu Tine-lin assumed office. The last roundtable took place in
April, with basic wage adjustment as main theme.</P>
      <P>Officials from the CLA and the Ministry of Economic Affairs as well as senior
executives of six leading industry and commerce associations and the national
federation of labor unions are expected to take part in Tuesday's roundtable
discussion which is likely to focus on foreign labor policy issues.</P>
      <P>According to CLA officials, foreign labor policy may be adjusted in terms of
domestic labor market situation, economic development, public sentiments and
management responses.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairman Lu Tien-lin said earlier this month that a dynamic management
mechanism will replace the current quota system with regard to labor import
policy. Under the new system, Lu said local enterprises will be allowed to
import more migrant workers if the domestic unemployment rate drops to a certain
level and local people's job opportunities will not be affected and vice versa.</P>

      <P>Applications submitted by four Taiwanese technology firms seeking to invest in
low-end semiconductor packaging and testing factories in China have passed
"strategic screening" by a supraministerial task force, a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang identified the four companies
as the Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Walton Advanced Engineering Inc.,
Greatek Electronics and Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Group.</P>
      <P>The government announced the lifting of a ban on Taiwanese firms investing in
packaging and testing factories in China in April last year. Many Taiwanese
companies submitted applications, but only four passed the first phase of
screening, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The  supraministerial  task  force  started  examining  the applications in
early June and decided that these four companies' applications  fitted in with
the government's  regulations  on cross-strait division of labor and investment.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Investment Commission has begun the second stage of acreening or
substantial screening, Shih said, adding that the commission will finalize its
examination and deliberation as soon as possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPECTED 'INTERLOCUTOR' IN COUNCILOR ASSASSINATION NABBED</HEADLINE>

      <P>A man suspected of playing an intermediary role in the murder of a Taipei County
councilor last month was nabbed Tuesday, just a day after the alleged killer in
the case committed suicide following a gun battle with police.</P>
      <P>Wang Yueh-kai, 24, was staying with six other men and a woman in an apartment on
Changshun Street in Taipei's Wanhua district close by a police station and a
police dormitory when he was arrested by detectives in the early hours of
Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>According to the police investigation team, Wang served as a liaison in the
assassination of Councilor Wu Shan-jeou in May. He was believed to have abetted
Wu Chu-hsien and Hu Ting-yueh in stealing two motorcycles, which were later
modified into one vehicle for the use of the alleged gunman, Lan Chia-wei, in
the Mafia-style killing of the outspoken councilor.</P>
      <P>Wu Chu-hsien and Hu Ting-yueh are already in police custody after they were
apprehended in a raid earlier this month, but the suspected mastermind of the
cold-blooded murder, identified as Wu Hsin-chung, fled to China a couple of days
after the assassination.</P>
      <P>Police said Wang's arrest is expected  to help verify Wu Hsin-chung's role in
the premeditated killing, particularly his motives, and determine whether there
are other suspects remaining at large.</P>
      <P>Councilor Wu Shan-jeou, an opposition People First Party member and councilor
from Taipei County's Hsintien City, was gunned down in his office May 23 and
died on the spot after being shot four times.</P>
      <P>After a month of intensive investigations, police said they believed that both
suspects Lan and Wang had not yet received any money from the suspected
mastermind after the councilor's murder, and that the fugitives had joined
together to avoid capture.</P>
      <P>The investigative team had mounted more than 10 raids in Panchiao, Taipei City,
Yilan, Chiayi, Changhua and Taichung in attempts to nab the two, but all those
operations failed.</P>
      <P>Late on Sunday night, Lan, 36, who had arrived by bus from Chiayi City in
southern Taiwan stumbled onto a police roadblock while walking near the
intersection of Civic Boulevard and Chengde Road.</P>
      <P>When he was stopped by police officers for a routine check, he dropped the bag
he was carrying and fled. The officers gave chase and called for reinforcements.</P>
      <P>Hemmed in by police, Lan exchanged gunfire with police officers in a parking lot
for more than 20 minutes, before turning the gun on himself. He was declared
dead on arrival after being rushed to nearby Mackay Memorial Hospital.</P>
      <P>Following Lan's death, police stepped up efforts to track down the alleged
intermediary, Wang, by closely monitoring the behavior of his family members as
well as analyzing Lan's cellphone records. Police finally traced Wang to the
apartment in Wanhua, which is adjacent to a police dormitory and a riot police
station.</P>
      <P>Now that the key contact or "middleman" in the murder has been rounded up,
police said they will use cross-Taiwan Strait communication channels to request
that their Chinese counterparts speed up efforts to track down the suspected
mastermind Wu Hsin-chung.</P>
      <P>According to police, Wu Hsin-chung and some friends were involved in
environmental cleanup businesses and the murder is possibly connected to those
deals. Councilor Wu Shan-jeou often raised environmental issues at Taipei County
Council sessions before his death.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that the ministry will study
the request of its Central America ally Nicaragua to write off its debts.</P>
      <P>Simon Ko, director of MOFA's Department of Central and Southern American
Affairs, made the remarks in the wake of media reports that Nicaragua Foreign
Minister Samuel Santos has requested that Taiwan write off the debts as a
precondition for maintaining diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ko said that Nicaragua, an impoverished country with a high level of debt, may
have asked its other creditor countries to write off the debts.</P>
      <P>He said that debt elimination is probably a world trend, but since Taiwan is not
a member of "The Paris Club, " and has no similar debt relief mechanism, it will
have to take stock of the experience of the club.</P>
      <P>The Paris Club is an informal group of financial officials from 19 of the
world's richest countries, which provides financial services,  including debt
restructuring, debt relief, and debt cancellation to indebted countries and
their creditors. Debtor countries which have failed to reach agreement with
credit countries on rescheduling their debts are often recommended to the Paris
Club for assistance by the International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will have to gauge it's own financial capacity and discuss the matter
before conducting an assessment and making a decision," Ko said.</P>
      <P>The ministry is currently collecting relevant information for related government
agencies to study, he added.</P>
      <P>The Nicaraguan request comes against the background of Taiwan's severing of
relations with Costa Rica earlier this month afer the Central American country
switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, ending a 63-year

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL HOTLINE FOR TEENAGE PREGNANCY COUNSELING LAUNCHED</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced Tuesday the launch of the national
toll-free 0800-257085 hotline providing teenage pregnancy counseling.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang noted that the ministry has since 2004 subsidized
the operation of various teenage pregnancy counseling hotlines in 15 counties
and cities.</P>
      <P>In an effort to expand those services to the entire country, the ministry
integrated the hotlines under a single number and set up the www.257085.org.tw
Web site to provide one-stop service to pregnant teenagers who need help, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Chi Hui-jung, CEO of the non-profit Garden of Hope Foundation that is in charge
of operating the hotline, estimated that the number of underage abortions in
Taiwan number approximately 24,300 cases per year, based on National Youth
Commission tallies which show there were 12,300 surgical abortions, and 12,000
non-surgical abortions involving girls under 20 years of age in 2002.</P>
      <P>With MOI tallies indicating that 5,000 babies were born to teenage mothers in
2006, the number of teenage pregnancies likely totals at least 30,000 per year,
Chi said.</P>
      <P>According to Chi,  many pregnant teenagers find themselves helpless to deal with
pregnancy, which involves common problems such as whether to tell their parents,
how to tell their parents, whether to have an abortion or give birth to the
baby, whether to get married, and whether to give up their babies for adoption
by others.</P>
      <P>In addition to counseling  pregnant teenagers  in need of assistance, hotline
workers can also help transfer their cases to social workers for medical, legal,
financial and adoption services and help negotiate with their families, Chi
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the teenage pregnancy Web site provides various information on
pregnancy, parenting, medical care, schooling and employment, along with an
online counseling mailbox, Chi said.</P>

to human health, most people choose, if possible, to remain at a distance from
cell phone base stations and other types of transmission stations.</P>
      <P>As there are increasing protests among local people against the erection of
wireless network base stations in their neighborhoods, some entrepreneurs are
disguising their base stations, causing greater panic among citizens concerned
about their health.</P>
      <P>In view of recent strong protest among villagers against a cell phone base
station in Tainan City, and a wireless networking system to be set up in the
city that has been a cause of great concern among environmentalists,  Hsu

      <P>A new laboratory to study animals after they undergo  gene transfer  and cloning
operations  has been established by the staff of the Livestock Research
Institute (LRI) under the cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, government
sources announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The new lab in the southern county of Tainan -- officially named the "Molecular
Research Ranch for Gene-modified Animals" -- serves as an "intensive care unit"
for livestock or poultry that has been genetically modified in other labs, LRI
researchers explained.</P>
      <P>Animals undergoing genetic modification require intensive care to preserve the
intended genetic expressions, as well as to protect them from disease, mutation,
or contamination, they noted, adding that most livestock research labs in Taiwan
lack such facilities, meaning that an ICU-type lab has been urgently needed for
a long time.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the "ranch" is currently equipped with animal surgeries,
an assisted reproductive technology center, a genetic engineering lab, and a
farm for gene-modified animals. LRI will continue expanding the lab's equipment
and refining its standard operating procedures to earn accreditation from the
International Organization for Standardization.</P>

      <P>National Sun Yat-sen University in the southern port city of Kaohsiung has
discovered 10 new species of sea slug, drawing international attention to its
remarkable research results, an university spokesman announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came at a press conference that the university held to unveil
the results of its recent research on sea slugs in waters off Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sun Yat-sen University was one of the few local universities granted subsidies
from the Ministry of Education in 2005 as part of the ministry's five-year
subsidy plan of NT$50 billion (US$1.5 billion) aimed at enhancing the quality of
academic research.</P>
      <P>The university's research team has identified 150 species of the marine
creatures in waters off Taiwan, as well as the outlying islets of Penghu,
Hsiaoliuchiu, Green Island, and Orchid Island, Michael Hin-Kiu Mok, a professor
at the university's Institute of Marine Biology, said.</P>
      <P>Nearly 120 of the sea slugs are newly collected in Taiwan, and 10 of may have
been discovered for the first time, Mok pointed out, adding that few of the
animals found were previously recorded in Taiwan's scientific literature.</P>
      <P>At present, 2,700-3,000 species of sea slug have been identified around the
world, according to Mok.</P>
      <P>Compared with only four or five species of such animals found off the coast of
Australia, Taiwan's discovery of 150 species in its waters has received a
significant amount of attention from the international community, Mok said,
adding that 61 of these species are found in the Wai-an sea area off of Penghu

      <P>Sales of whale sharks, the largest living fish species, fillets of the same will
be banned in Taiwan starting Wednesday, an executive of the fishermen's
association of Suao township in Yilan county, northeastern Taiwan, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) , the highest fishery authority of the country,
stipulated a catch quota of 30 whale sharks for this year. When that quota was
reached in March, the COA declared March 27 that no further fishing would be
allowed to target the giant fish -- locally called "Tofu shark" for its tender
and white meat. The COA also demanded that the catches be sold out within three
months.</P>
      <P>The sale deadline is due on June 27, Lin Yueh-ying said.</P>
      <P>Whale shark is not listed as an endangered species in Taiwan, but is listed in
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora (CITES) signed in 1973 in Washington to slowdown species extinction.</P>
      <P>Out of respect for the international convention, Taiwan has set catch quotas to
control the take of whale sharks. In 2006, the quota was set at 60, and that was
cut into half this year, Lin said, noting a full ban on targeting the filter
feeding shark will be imposed for next year.</P>
      <P>Under the ban, fishermen are obliged to return whale shark bi-catch to the
ocean, whether it is dead or alive. Violators face up to a maximum three years'
imprisonment or fine of up to NT$150,000 (US$4,575), according to the COA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the military Tuesday to sever ties with the "old
era" and shed what he called is its "old mindset" and step up democratic
education in the military.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while presiding over a commissioning ceremony for
senior military officers at the Ministry of National Defense. A total of 45
military personnel were promoted to the ranks of major general or lieutenant
general.</P>
      <P>The president noted that from July 1, the "five tenets" of the nation's armed
forces that have been observed for decades will be shortened to "three tenets."</P>
      <P>He was referring to the deletion of "doctrine" and "leader" and the keeping of
"nation, responsibility and honor."</P>
      <P>He said that in the past, the line between the then-ruling Kuomintang and the
nation was thin so that the military put "doctrine and leader" ahead of "nation"
to facilitate the championing of a specific ideology and the promotion of the
personality cult of the late President Chiang Kai-shek and later his son, the
late President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>"In this way, the armed forces served a specific party and individuals, " Chen
said, which he said posed the greatest hindrance and damage to Taiwan's pursuit
of democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>He noted that since he first assumed the presidency in 2000, he immediately
embarked on the task of promoting the neutrality of the armed forces and
readjusting the function of the political warfare system from a tool serving a
specific party to spy on the armed forces to one that really cares about the
welfare of military personnel.</P>
      <P>He also ordered the removal of all statues of Chiang Kai-shek from military
barracks.</P>
      <P>These, coupled with the shortening of the tenets for the armed forces, have
paved the way for the military to "sever ties with the old era and shed its old
mindset thoroughly," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that "political turbulence will not affect the right
tenets and management of the military."</P>
      <P>He noted that there will be two national elections in the coming months -- the
legislative and the presidential elections, during which several proposals might
be put to national referendum -- which he said will be a major litmus test of
Taiwan's deepening of democracy.</P>
      <P>He urged the armed forces to "step up the education of democracy and rule of law
so that the armed forces will not be disrupted by the election activities."</P>

      <P>The Chinese Childrenhome and Shelter Association started a fund-raising campaign
Tuesday aimed at helping former orphanage residents live independently.</P>
      <P>The campaign is being held through Sept. 24 in cooperation with the convenience
store chain FamilyMart, with the goal of raising NT$1.5 million to help at least
1,800 former orphanage residents.</P>
      <P>During the period, the public are welcome to donate cash using donation boxes
available in FamilyMart stores nationwide, make donations  online  through  the
association's  Web  site  at www.childrenhome.org.tw,  or  remit  their
donations  to  the association's  postal account,  according  to the
association's secretary-general, Hung Chin-fang.</P>
      <P>The funds will be used to finance various programs preparing orphans for
independent living after leaving orphanages, including psychological counseling
and guidance, vocational training, subsidies for senior high school, college and
university tuition fees, as well as allowances for housing rental, National
Health Insurance premiums and living costs, Hung said.</P>
      <P>She noted that most orphanage residents have to face the pressure of schooling
and employment immediately after leaving orphanages and that only a small number
of them are able to live in their relatives' homes.</P>
      <P>Because of their limited educational backgrounds and financial difficulties,
most former orphanage residents are unable to further their studies and thus
have problems finding stable employment, she said.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the association in February on
42 orphanages around the country, 60 percent of the respondents said financial
assistance is what orphanage residents need the most after leaving orphanages,
while 56 percent mentioned assistance in schooling and employment.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 69 percent of orphanage residents leave the institutions
before the age of 15, with only 48 percent continuing schooling after that.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former residents at 44 percent of the surveyed orphanages have full-
time jobs and stable work, while those from 32 percent of the orphanages have
only part-time jobs and 50 percent have unstable employment.</P>

      <P>Lin said it was still not certain if the boy's mother has also been infected.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that chikungunya fever is an infectious disease often seen in
Southeast Asia, South Africa and South America. The symptoms are similar to
dengue fever, although the incubation period is shorter and the symptoms are
more obvious.</P>
      <P>The disease is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain, as
well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless widespread
occurrence of the disease causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.</P>
      <P>Lin said the first imported chikungunya fever case occurred seven months ago.
The patient was a student studying in Singapore, which, together with Japan,
later detected imported cases, although both countries had had no such cases
before.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that to prevent the disease from making inroads into Taiwan, the
priority will be to stop it from entering Taiwan. On this point, the fever
monitoring stations set up at the nation's airports have worked to good result.</P>
      <P>The other important task will be to remove standing water in the environment to
prevent the mosquitoes from breeding.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ORDER GIVEN TO ELIMINATE BROWN ANOLES IN CHIAYI COUNTY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Agriculture authorities in Chiayi County issued an order Tuesday to eliminate
all brown anoles -- a lizard species native to Cuba and the Bahamas -- because
they have been propagating so rapidly that they now pose a threat to indigenous
lizard species.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-hua, head of the Agriculture Bureau under the Chiayi county
government, urged residents to report sightings of the lizards to the
authorities so that action can be taken to catch them.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the results of an initial study show that the brown anole probably
carries parasites and that their presence could impact the local ecology,
environment and the "quality of life of people in the county."</P>
      <P>The brown anole, or anolis sagrei, was first discovered in Chiayi County seven
years ago. But recently, large numbers of the lizards have been sighted in
orchards, betel palm plantations and rural neighborhoods in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>An estimate by agriculture experts puts the number of brown anoles in Chiayi
County at more than 10,000. It is not known how the foreign lizard got into
Taiwan, but the experts believe they were brought in from the United States.</P>
      <P>Agriculture officials said that if their propagation is not stemmed in time,
they could spread rapidly to other areas of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In July last year, a resident of Hualien City spotted four brown anoles in his
backyard and took photos of them.</P>
      <P>The brown anole originates from Cuba and the Bahamas and spread to Florida,
Louisiana, Georgia, Texas and Mexico.</P>
      <P>A major characteristic of these lizards is that they extend an orange dewlap --
a fold of loose skin hanging from the neck -- when they feel threatened. The
lizards feed on ants, spiders, grasshoppers and many other insects and defend
their territory very fiercely.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) urged the public Tuesday not to seek
employment with unknown companies or individuals seeking frontmen for unlawful
activities in South Korea.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, since September 2006 more than 100 people from
Taiwan have been arrested by South Korean police for allegedly opening dummy
bank accounts, receiving suspicious funds from banks, or using fake credit cards
for purchases made in that country.</P>
      <P>Some of the Taiwanese arrested have been given prison terms ranging from one to
three years by South Korean judges, while others remain in custody at detention
centers awaiting trial or appealing their cases, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has issued several press releases since the beginning of the year
urging the public to remain alert and guard against the possibility of being

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is planning a "long stay" program for its
presidential candidate, Ma Ying-jeou, in central Taiwan, in a bid to establish
closer links with local people, KMT lawmaker Lu Shiow-yen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a Legislative Yuan news conference, Lu said that the party central
is in charge of the program, which aims to help Ma, former KMT chairman,
understand in depth local grassroots' needs and development.</P>
      <P>As the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration has overlooked
development in cities and counties in central Taiwan, Ma's "long stay" to start
with the region will be helpful in boosting mutual communications  and
understanding  between Ma and local residents prior to the 2008 presidential
election, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The two-week project, the first of the KMT's "long stay" program, is expected to
kick off within two weeks at the earliest, with Ma staying in each city and
county for three to five days, Lu said, adding that a meeting will be held in
the Taichung area Wednesday to discuss the project's relevant details.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the kinds of places that might accommodate Ma, Lu said,  temples,
private  houses  and budget hotels are under consideration by the KMT as Ma
himself is a simple person.</P>
      <P>Ma released his first TV advertisement Monday and announced former Premier
Vincent Siew as his running mate Saturday. The Ma-Siew ticket currently enjoys a
public approval rating of some 50 percent, according to surveys conducted by
local media outlets.</P>
      <P>Siew was born in Chiayi County, southern Taiwan and his pairing with Ma has been
viewed by some political observers as giving a boost to Ma's chances in the
coming presidential poll.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) has approved a Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) proposal to build offshore wind power plants, a CEPD
spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan theoretically has about 9 million kilowatts of potential wind power in
costal areas, but only 1.2 million kilowatts of offshore wind power are
exploitable after various restrictions are excluded, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman explained that the restrictions include national defense areas,
transportation routes, approved exploitable areas, ecological and coastal
preservation areas, coastal protection zones, potential geological hazards,
undersea cable routes, fault lines, and possible areas for shallow earthquakes
greater than a magnitude of three on the Richter scale.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Taiwan has no practical experience in building
offshore wind power plants and is still in the beginning stages of manufacturing
key wind turbine parts. In order to ensure steady development, the government
decided to implement the project in several phases, with the maximum wind power
projected for the first phase set at 300,000 kilowatts.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also asked the MOEA to help domestic wind turbine parts manufacturers
improve production ability, the spokesman said.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has decided to extend for another
year the current measures aimed at assisting domestic flight service operators
in overcoming the impact of high-speed railway competition, CAA officials said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CCA has found that since the Taiwan High-Speed Rail system began operations
Jan. 5, passenger loads on flights between Taipei in northern Taiwan and
Kaohsiung in the south have been dropping significantly.</P>
      <P>According to CCA statistics, the operational volume on west coast flight routes
fell 50 percent in May compared with the same month of the previous year, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>There are currently 31 single-trip high-speed rail trains per day, with the
number set to be increased to 61 by September. The CAA predicts that passenger
flights in western Taiwan will be even harder-hit by then.</P>
      <P>The CAA began to implement the aid measures July 1, which include suspending
landing fees at the Pingtung and Hengchun aviation terminals, cutting landing
fees by 50 percent at other domestic aviation terminals, reducing land and real
estate leasing fees for the Pingtung and Hengchun terminals by 30 percent, and
reducing the leasing fees of this kind for other terminals by 10 percent.</P>

elementary school in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It's amazing, I don't believe I shook hands with him" said a student at
National Taitung University Laboratory Elementary School when he met Dennis, as
his devotion to Taitung has been documented in a Taiwanese elementary school

students, telling them stories and sharing his wisdom with them.</P>

communication, as there are a wide variety of languages and dialects used in

      <P>Chao Chien-ming, president Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, was given a seven-year
sentence Tuesday following his appeal to the Taiwan High Court, for his role in
insider trading in stock of the Taiwan Development Corporation (TDC).</P>
      <P>He had been sentenced to six years in jail in the original trial heard in the
Taipei District Court Dec. 27 last year.</P>
      <P>His father, Chao Yu-chu, was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail in the
same case Tuesday, compared to a sentence of eight years and four months handed
down in the first trial.</P>
      <P>A fine of NT$30 million (US$915,383) in addition to the jail terms, which was
imposed in the original trial on both Chao Chien-ming and Chao Yu-chu, remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Two other defendants in the case, Yu Shi-yi and former TDC Chairman Su Teh-
chien, were also handed fines and heavier prison terms.</P>
      <P>Yu received a sentence of seven years and two months in prison in addition to a
fine of NT$60 million (US$1.83 million) , while Su was given seven years and six
months and a fine of NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>Both Yu and Su were handed terms of four years and three months in the previous
trial.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Taiwan High Court said the court meted out heavier jail
terms to the four defendants because their combined profits from their offenses
were over NT$100 million -- which made them subject to jail terms of seven years
or above rather than terms of between three years and 10 years as prescribed by
law for ordinary insider trading offenses.</P>
      <P>The court determined in its judgment that the four defendants had raked in
NT$100.83 million (US$3.07 million) in illegal profits, while the Taipei
District Court said in the case's first trial that their illegal gains were just
NT$4.27 million.</P>
      <P>The difference lies in the two court's different methods of calculating the
defendants' illegal gains from their offenses, although both courts believed
there is no question of the defendants' involvement in insider trading.</P>
      <P>The high court worked out their combined  illegal profits according to the stock
prices at which they bought and the prices at which each defendant sold their
stocks.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court said the Chaos was awarded the minimum jail term
stipulated in law for the crime of insider trading, while the senior Chao was
also guilty of embezzling NT$4.5 million, for which he was given a sentence of
three years and six months.</P>
      <P>The senior Chao's two separate sentences was incorporated into a term of eight
years and four months by the Taiwan High Court.</P>
      <P>The case stemmed from a dinner party between the younger Chao and then-TDC
Chairman Su Teh-chien July 14, 2005, during which Chao learned that the loss-
making TDC was to be bailed out by a syndicated loan from several banks.</P>
      <P>He relayed the information to his father, who bid for 5,000,000 shares on July
25, 2005 and sold them after banks approved the loan to TDC.</P>
      <P>Su did not engage in insider trading but was found guilty of tipping off the
Chaos.</P>
      <P>The fourth defendant, Yu Shi-yi, is a friend of the Chaos who was present at the
dinner party and bought TDC stocks along with them.</P>
      <P>The two other people involved in the case -- Chen Chin-jao and Hung Min-sen --
were given a suspended sentence of one year and ten months and one year and four
months, respectively in a separate trial by the Taipei High Court on April 24.</P>

Agriculture (COA) Tuesday to ban circus shows set to take place in a
recreational park in Taichung this summer, based on an amended law that forbids
the import and export of wild animal for circus performances.</P>
      <P>According to Tien Chiu-chin and Wang Tu-fa, although the Encore Garden had
obtained a permit for the shows before the Wildlife Conservation Act was
amended, the COA should order the planned shows to be scrapped now that the law
has been changed.</P>
      <P>Echoing the call of the legislators, animal conservationists from the  Taiwan
Environmental  Protection  Union  and  the  Life Conservationist Association
called on the public to boycott the shows.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee Tao-sheng, deputy chief of the COA's Forestry Bureau, said the
shows, to be performed by a Vietnamese circus, are being organized by a local
entertainment company.</P>
      <P>While the company has so far only obtained the Taichung city government's permit
for the circus to perform at the Encore Garden, the bureau is still processing
the company's application to import seven rhesus monkeys for the shows, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>On the company's plan to import three Asiatic black bears, the company has not
obtained the Vietnam government's export permit and therefore has not applied
with the bureau to for the animals' import into the country, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said the bureau is handling the case according to the old law, noting that
although the amendment to the Wildlife Conservation Act was passed by the
legislature June 14,  it is still pending promulgation by President Chen Shui-
bian before it becomes effective.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Justices Loosen Ad Restrictions in Campaign Law

The Supreme Court on Monday took a sharp turn away from campaign finance
regulation, opening a wide exception to the advertising restrictions that it
upheld when the McCain-Feingold law first came before it four years ago.

In a splintered 5-to-4 decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that as
interpreted broadly by federal regulators and the laws supporters, the
restrictions on television advertisements paid for from corporate or union
treasuries in the weeks before an election amounted to censorship of core

Wall Street Journal:Fleeing Chavez,Oil Workers Flock To Frigid Alberta

Before he left Venezuela in April for this petroleum outpost in northern
Alberta, Freddy Mendez heard tales about bone-chilling winter cold and lumbering
moose. Since he's come to town, he's seen two black bears in his neighborhood.
Still, the toughest adjustment is the late-night sun.

"You get a lot of work done when the sun doesn't set until 11," he says,
stifling a yawn. "But it's so hard getting the kids to bed." The 45-year-old
engineer is part of a swelling colony of Venezuelan expats who say they were
driven into exile by a hostile government.</TEXT>

      <P>Customs officials reminded local travelers Tuesday to be aware of new cash
declaration rules of European Union countries as the peak tourist season is
approaching.</P>
      <P>According to the new rules, people entering or leaving EU countries will have to
declare cash totaling 10,000 euros or more from June 15. EU customs officers
will be authorized to check travelers' luggage and seize cash exceeding 10,000
euros unless a valid reason is given by the travelers for having the cash.</P>
      <P>EU customs  officers  were quoted as saying that the new regulations are aimed
at cracking down on money laundering,</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, which adopted the same rules as other EU countries,
travelers failing to declare cash in excess of 10,000 euros or who have false
declarations of cash will face fines of up to 5,000 pounds.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei customs officers also reminded local travelers that people
entering or leaving Saudi Arabia are required to declare cash or precious metals
worth 60,000 riyals (US$16,000) or more, a rule that went into effect June 2.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's cash declaration rules, the customs officers said travelers
leaving the country should declare local currency exceeding NT$60,000 (US$1,834)
and are required to declare foreign currency worth more than US$10,000 before
they leave, or risk have their cash confiscated, the officers added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAIN DRIVER GETS CITATION FOR SAVING PASSENGERS' LIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  June 26 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A train driver with the Alishan forest railway received  a citation  from the
government  Tuesday in recognition of his vigilance that saved more than 100
passengers from imminent disaster two days ago.</P>
      <P>With 27 years of experience operating the train, Lin Chi-cheng, 52, quickly
sensed something was wrong when the four-carriage train went into the No. 42
tunnel on the 72-km rail line.</P>
      <P>"The echo was extremely loud and there was no light at the end of the tunnel,"
Lin recalled, adding that he immediately activated the brakes.</P>
      <P>Some of the passengers in the first carriage said that as the train ground to a
halt, they found that only a meter away, a huge pile of rocks from a landslide
had blocked the railway.</P>
      <P>Realizing that they had just cheated death, the passengers applauded and thanked
Lin for saving their lives. Maintaining his usual composure, Lin laid no claim
to the merit and pointed out that he was only doing his job.</P>
      <P>Su Chia-chuan, chief commissioner of the Council of Agriculture, presented the
citation to Lin at the Forestry Bureau's Chiayi Forest District Office. The
local office also presented Lin with a cash award.</P>
      <P>Three other staff members operating the train were also cited for helping avert
a major disaster.</P>
      <P>The Alishan forest railway was disrupted June 24 by a landslide caused by
successive thunderstorms. Hundreds of tons of rocks damaged part of No. 42
tunnel and a 100-meter section of the railway near the exit of the tunnel. The
tunnel is located 59 km from Chiayi Station.</P>
      <P>According to the Forestry Bureau, which manages the railway, it will take about
40 days to repair the damaged section of the railway and eight months to
reconstruct the tunnel.</P>
      <P>The Alishan railway is said to be one of the world's three remaining alpine
railways. The other two are located in the Himalaya in northern India and in the
Andes of South America.</P>
      <P>Opened in 1912 while Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the narrow-gauge railway
was designed to haul timber down the mountain, but is now mainly used to
transport the more than 200,000 tourists who visit Alishan each year to see the
area's beauty at an altitude of more than 2,200 meters in Taiwan's Central
Mountain Range.</P>
      <P>The scenic railway winds its way up from the subtropical plains to mountainous
pine forests in just 72 km, crossing more than 80 bridges and passing through
about 50 tunnels. Its route includes a series of dangerous switchbacks.</P>
      <P>Although the government has been operating the train at an annual loss of about
NT$110 million (US$3.35 million) , it has decided to preserve the line not only
for its historic value but as a means to boost local tourism.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung defended Tuesday a government  planned  exhibition  to
ask that the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) ill-gotten party assets be returned
to the national coffers and denied allegations that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is seeking only to serve its own interests.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks to reporters while answering questions on the issue
before he gave a speech at a meeting of the Taipei-based Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>Asked  whether  the  plan  by the Cabinet-level  Research, Development, and
Evaluation Commission to spend NT$9.5 million to sponsor the exhibition is aimed
at the KMT, Chang argued those who illegally posses national assets must return
them to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's party assets targeted by the DPP administration were ruled by the
courts as illegally seized and the government efforts to get them back is by no
means a way to serve its own interests with national resources, " he said.</P>
      <P>"If it were the DPP that had taken the assets in the first place, the government
authorities also would have to demand their return to the state," he pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Later,  in his speech,  Chang said the government  deeply appreciates the
contribution made by Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises to the
country's economic development.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, there are 1.23 million small companies in Taiwan,
accounting for 97.8 percent of the business community. They have created 7.6
million jobs and generate combined business revenue of NT$10 trillion per year,
he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration remains committed to its promise to take care of the
underprivileged and the small businesses, as well as boosting development in
central and southern regions, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) Tuesday urged Chao Chien-ming, President
Chen Shui-bian's son-in-law, not to appeal to the Supreme Court and to
immediately start serving his jail term after he was sentenced to seven years in
jail in a second trial earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker and one of the party's legislative caucus whips,
issued the call in a news conference, claiming that members of the first family
"have the responsibility" to set a good example for society" and should do their
best not to further waste national and judicial resources.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court handed down a prison term of seven years to Chao Chien-
ming, and one of nine years and six months to his father, Chao Yu-chu, for their
roles in insider trading of Taiwan Development Corp. shares. Each of them was
also fined NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>The Chaos and their conspirators were proved by the Taiwan High Court to have
illegally made more than NT$100 million (US$3 million) in the insider trading.</P>
      <P>The verdicts of the High Court were heavier than the punishment handed down in
the first trial by the District Court, which gave a six-year jail term to Chao
Chien-ming and eight years and four months for his father.</P>
      <P>Predicting that Chao Chien-ming may still face a severe penalty even if he
appeals his case to the supreme court, Liu said that first lady Wu Shu-jen and
first daughter Chen Hsing-yu should ask him to drop his appeal, acknowledge his
wrongdoing and begin serving the jail term as soon as possible "for the sake of
the national interest."</P>
      <P>"It will be extremely deplorable if polarized confrontation is sparked in
society as the legislative and presidential elections approach, " Liu said,
adding that "disputes arising from the case should be put to an end as quickly
as possible."</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) presidential candidate Frank Hsieh
said Tuesday that if elected in 2008, he will strive to develop a "well-being
economy" in which promoting a systematic upgrading of Taiwan's quality of life
and environment will be the main themes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a former premier, also criticized the economic agenda advocated by his
election rival -- the main opposition Kuomintang's standard bearer Ma Ying-jeou
-- as "wrong diagnosis and wrong prescriptions."</P>
      <P>Ma said recently that if he wins the 2008 presidency, he will boost Taiwan's per
capita gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of wealth, to US$20,000 in 2011
from the current level of about NT$16,000 and lift the stock index to over
10,000 points. Ma also mocked the DPP administration's inexperience in running
economic and financial affairs.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Ma has misread Taiwan's current situation, Hsieh said Taiwan's
predicament does not lie with its economic or GDP growth.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Taiwan's woes are primarily the result of protracted
political fighting in the legislature and the uneven distribution of wealth
spurred by the widening wealth gap.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Hsieh said, Taiwan's greatest need is not quantitative
growth but an all-inclusive upgrading of quality of life, which comprises social
justice, ethnic harmony, political stability, environmental protection and
sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>Dismissing Ma's economic platform as promoting a "commodity economy, " Hsieh
said what he wants to pursue is a "well-being economy" that aims to bring
economic well-being to all citizens.</P>
      <P>On Ma's overture of rediscovering Taiwan's core values, Hsieh asked what forms
Taiwan core values. "For me, democracy, happiness and dignity form our core
values, " Hsieh said, adding that Ma's advocacy of diligence and tenacity as
Taiwan's core values are irrelevant. "Diligence and perseverance have been
integral parts of our character that do not need advocated by a president," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was also critical of Ma's cross-Taiwan Strait policy overtures, claiming
that Ma's advocacy of forming a cross-strait common market and making entire
Taiwan a free trade area is risky as such a development could eventually make
Taiwan an "offshore island of China."</P>
      <P>Stressing that he backs opening to Chinese tourists and capital, Hsieh said he
is nevertheless reserved about Ma's advocacy of unlimited openness toward china
by making Taiwan a free trade zone and forming a common market with China.</P>
      <P>"We must always strike a balance in safeguarding our separate national identity

    <HEADLINE>BUSH ADMINISTRATION URGED TO OPEN U.S. VISITS BY TAIWAN OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 26 (CNA)
06/27/07  12:16:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. congressional committee adopted a non-binding resolution Tuesday urging
the administrative branch to lift restrictions on visits to the United States by
high-level elected and appointed officials of Taiwan, including the president.</P>
      <P>The resolution asked the administrative branch to abide by section 221 of the
Immigration and National Technical Corrections Act of 1994, which provides for
the president or other high-level officials of Taiwan to visit the United
States, including Washington, D.C., at any time to discuss a variety of
important issues.</P>
      <P>The  resolution,  passed  unanimously  by  the  House  of Representative's
Committee on Foreign Affairs, said the United States should allow direct high-
level exchanges at the Cabinet level with the government of Taiwan to strengthen
a policy dialogue with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It said it is in the interest of the United States to strengthen links between
the United States and the democratically-elected officials of Taiwan and
demonstrate stronger support for democracy in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"Since the Taiwan Strait is one of the flashpoints in the world, it is essential
that United States policymakers directly communicate with the leaders of
Taiwan," the resolution said.</P>
      <P>It said the U.S. policy that bars the president, vice president, premier,
foreign minister and defense minister of Taiwan from visiting Washington D.C.
deprives the U.S. president, Congress and the American public of the opportunity
to engage in a direct dialogue with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lifting these restrictions will help bring a U.S. friend and ally out of its
isolation, which will be beneficial to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific

      <P>The resolution was initiated by Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) , a co-chair of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus. It was co-sponsored by 33 other representatives
including Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Delighted at the passage of the resolution, Chabot said it is undesirable that
democratically-elected officials from Taiwan are not allowed to visit the U.S.
capital while leaders from communist China are received with state courtesies.</P>
      <P>Chabot said this policy is humiliating to Taiwan and sends the wrong signal to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will hold a consultant meeting every three
months with representatives of both management and workers, experts and
scholars, and officials of economic  affairs to discuss issues relating  to
foreign-labor policies, according to CLA officials.</P>
      <P>The initiative was formed at a round-table meeting for social dialogue hosted
Tuesday by Minister of Labor Affairs Lu Tien-lin, in which officials responsible
for economic planning and development, representatives of enterprise management
and workers, as well as scholars in relevant fields took part.</P>
      <P>The social dialogue meeting was initiated by former CLA chief Lee Ying-yuan to
serve as a platform for management-worker dialogue. The Tuesday event was the
first of its kind since Lu took office May 21.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the planned consultant meetings, Lu said that in the preliminary
formulation, the participants will comprise six representatives of management,
six representatives of workers, four officials from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, two CLA officials, as well as three experts and scholars from relevant
fields, with the CLA minister to serve as the meeting convener.</P>
      <P>Topics for discussions will include the total number of foreign laborers, and
restrictions on working permits for foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Basically, Lu stated his council will adopt a process of "dynamic management" on
foreign-labor policy, meaning enterprises will be allowed to import more foreign
workers once the unemployment rate falls below a certain figure, and the import
will not affect the employment of local workers. If unemployment is found to be
rising, the CLA will consider cutting the number of foreign workers allowed, he
added.</P>
      <P>On  Tuesday,  the  participants  also  agreed  that  the management-worker
dialogue process should be further expanded to cover issues concerning most
professional sectors in the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lu said the CLA plans to organize 20 separate meetings for dialogue
between the management and workers from 20 different professional sectors before
the end of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP 1,000 'TAISHANG' MAY OUTSHINE TAIWAN COUNTERPARTS SOON: CCIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
06/27/07  12:33:28
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The accumulated turnover of the top 1,000 Taiwan-funded companies in China,
commonly known as "Taishang, " could outpace that of the top 1,000 corporations
in Taiwan in five years, according to a newly released market research report.</P>
      <P>The report, prepared by the Taipei-based China Credit Information Service Ltd.
(CCIS), said the top 1,000 "Taishang" posted an average 45.88 percent year-on-
year growth in business turnover in 2006, far exceeding the average 16.03
percent increase registered by their Taiwan-based counterparts.</P>
      <P>If the trend continues, the report said, the top 1,000 "Taishang" will outshine
their Taiwan parents in terms of revenues by 2012.</P>
      <P>In its latest annual survey, the CCIS evaluated the growth potential of the top
1,000 "Taishang" and the top 1,000 Taiwan-based corporations in terms of their
growth rates of turnover, pre-tax profits, work force and net profits.</P>
      <P>The study showed that the top 1,000 "Taishang" outperformed their Taiwan
counterparts in terms of the first three indexes while only lagging behind in
their net profit ratio.</P>
      <P>According to the CCIS analysis, it's harder for "Taishang," most of which
operate labor-intensive lines of business, to make profits than their Taiwan-
based counterparts.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless,  the report said "Taishang" still enjoy many advantages from
China's vast market scale and fast economic growth rates. As a result, CCIS
researchers said large Taiwan enterprises must rely on investment in China to
sustain their growth.</P>
      <P>The CCIS survey also found that 70 percent of Taiwan's top 500 private
manufacturing companies have invested in China. Moreover, survey results showed
that each of them tends to have six or more offshoots in China.</P>
      <P>Another noteworthy finding was that large Taiwan companies are more fervent than
their smaller counterparts in launching investment projects in China. According
to the survey, only 40 percent of Taiwan's top 5,000 companies have invested in
China, but the ratio reached 52 percent among the top 1,000 conglomerates.</P>
      <P>The survey further found that not only many manufacturing corporations have set
up production facilities in China, nearly 36 percent of Taiwan's top 500 service
firms have also opened shop there to tap its immense domestic market.</P>
      <P>In the past three years, the report said, the business turnover of the top 1,000
"Taishang" posted 81 percent growth, compared to about a 24 percent increase
registered by their Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the pre-tax profits of Taiwan's top 1,000 companies dropped from 7.75
percent in 2004 to 6.13 percent in 2005 and rebounded to 6.43 percent in 2006.
In comparison, the pre-tax earnings of the top 1,000 "Taishang" surged to 4.53
percent in 2006 from a mere 3.3 percent in 2005.</P>
      <P>The CCIS report also urged the government to take precautions against a possible
"hollowing out" of Taiwan's manufacturing sector following an "exodus" of large
enterprises to China.</P>
      <P>Noting that China-based offshoots may cut ties with their Taiwan parents to
facilitate their listing on foreign stock exchanges, the report said more and
more "Taishang" are also forming new industry supply chains in China instead of
relying on their Taiwan parents in materials and parts procurement.</P>
      <P>The survey further  found that the top 300 foreign-funded companies in Taiwan
saw a slower pace in their turnover and pre-tax profits, and some of them even
registered negative growth on both fronts. About 14 percent of foreign-owned
companies said they treat Taiwan as a launch pad for their ventures into the
vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, securities companies were the most lucrative foreign
enterprises in Taiwan last year, with the pre-tax profit rate reaching an
average of 32.76 percent, far higher than semiconductor firms' average 7.79
percent earning rate.</P>

      <P>A young drug pusher, who was nabbed for possession of more than 360 grams of the
illicit drug Ketamine in January this year, was given a sentence of five years
and two months by Taipei judges Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to judges from the Taipei District Court,  Chen Liang-hsu, 20, was
nabbed by Coast Guard Administration (CGA) agents on Taipei's bustling Changchun
Road on the night of Jan. 18 and was found to have three small bags of Ketamine,
or 69.8 grams in total, on him, possibly ready to meet his customers there.</P>
      <P>With a warrant from the district court,  CGA agents then accompanied Chen to his
home in Sanchung City, where they found six more small bags of Ketamine,
weighing 297 grams in total, and a scale.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that he bought the Ketamine at a cost of NT$30,000 (US$915) per 50
grams from two drug "mules" known only as "A-Ru" and "Sis" in Taipei County in
August and September of last year.</P>
      <P>Chen then told the judges that he was suffering an unspecified mental-health
illness, and that police had tortured a confession from him.</P>
      <P>The judges checked with doctors from the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital where
Chen had been ordered to undergo psychological examination, only to be told that
Chen had fabricated the reports of mental-health illness.</P>
      <P>In addition, the judges said Chen seemed not to be remorseful and could not show
any evidence to prove that he was tortured by police, prompting them to hand
down a five-year, two-month sentence for violation of the statute on illicit
drug prevention.</P>
      <P>Ketamine -- a third-grade illicit drug -- is a white crystalline powder used as
a general anaesthetic mainly in veterinary medicine.</P>

      <P>The government is working on measures aimed at attracting foreign professionals
to work in Taiwan, and stay longer for their work, Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Those friendly measures include a proposal to exclude the expenses of traveling,
relocation, telephone fees and even house cleaning from the paychecks of foreign
professionals, meaning that these costs will be tax-free, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD-proposed measures were brought forward for discussions at the Executive
Yuan meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign professionals are defined as those who are invited to work in Taiwan
under Ministry of Economic Affairs-operated special programs for hiring overseas
talents in technology and science, and the high-tech talents employment policy
of the National Science Council, as well as those who are invited to assist in
the government's national economic development plans, according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>It's expected that the foreign professional friendly treatment plan will be
implemented as soon as it is approved by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The CEPD began to review existing regulations governing the employment of
foreign professionals after the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei expressed
in March that high taxation levels have affected the willingness of
professionals to live and work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan employs a progressive individual income tax rate of up to 40 percent.</P>

      <P>A student from the Czech Republic is helping to clean up Taiwan's environment by
picking up litter and inspiring his Taiwanese peers to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Twenty-two year old Daniel Hradsky, an exchange student studying Chinese at
Wenzao Ursuline College of Languages in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, rode a
motorcycle around the island soon after he arrived in Taiwan in February this
year, picking up garbage littering the beaches and valleys along the way.</P>
      <P>Daniel said he fell in love with the island's scenic areas soon after he first
set foot in Taiwan. He rode to beaches and mountains to enjoy the natural beauty
of Taiwan, which has been known to people in the West as "Isla Formosa" in
Portuguese meaning "the beautiful island.</P>
      <P>Many sites, however, are littered by tourists' drink bottles, cans, glass and
garbage, Daniel said, adding that sometimes the volume of trash was so great
that "it would take an army" to finish cleaning the litter up.</P>
      <P>Daniel recalled that his girlfriend back in the Czech Republic was a
conscientious "garbage collector" who would stoop to pick up litter on the
street whenever she saw it. At the time, he recalled, he considered her actions
"boring" and "meaningless."</P>
      <P>To his surprise, Daniel said, he started picking up litter on the streets, in
the mountains and on the beaches after he came to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past five months, Daniel has been to Taipei City in the north, Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Kenting in the south, as well as Taitung and Hualien in the east,
all the while picking up garbage as he went.</P>
      <P>According to Daniel's observation, the Taiwanese people are very kind and
friendly to foreigners, but they are "litter bugs" who are also heavily
dependent on cars, motorcycles and air conditioners -- all conveniences that are
implicated in environment hazards and climate change.</P>
      <P>Daniel's actions have inspired his Taiwanese classmates and friends, who have,
in turn, joined him in collecting garbage. Some of his classmates have even stop
using their air-conditioners.</P>

      <P>Three local research institutes have earned accreditation from the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) for their
laboratory animal management,  paving the way for international  cooperation  in
biomedical studies, academic sources reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The three institutes -- National Laboratory Animal Center (NLAC), National
Defense Medical Center (NDMC) , and BioLASCO Taiwan Co. -- passed AAALAC's
accreditation and assessment reviews in March, they said, adding that they were
informed of the final results only last week.</P>
      <P>AAALAC is a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment
of animals in scientific research. Currently, 730 companies, universities,
hospitals, government agencies and other research  institutions  in  30
countries  have  earned  AAALAC accreditation, demonstrating their commitment to
responsible animal care and use, according to the association's website.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Development Center for Biotechnology was accredited by AAALAC in 2000
-- the first to receive accreditation among all research institutes around the
island, they said, adding that they have since been joined by NLAC, NDMC, and
BioLASCO, bringing the number of accredited institutes in Taiwan to four, second
only to China's six and South Korea's five among Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Being recognized by the AAALAC means that both the lab animal management and
the research quality control in these institutes have achieved a higher
standard, " NLAC Researcher Chang Wei-cheng explained. "Taiwan's efforts in
biomedical research and development can thus be more easily accepted in other
countries, facilitating international collaboration and helping made-in-Taiwan
medicines gain wider market access."</P>
      <P>In the future, NLAC and BioLASCO will be able to provide lab animals in
compliance with international standards; meanwhile, NDMC will be in charge of
providing qualified facilities for animal experiments, according to the
institutes.</P>

      <P>Chen pointed out that boosted by the semiconductor and flat panel display

      <P>In addition, Chen continued, the financial reforms promoted by his

      <P>A government spokesman reviled Hong Kong authorities Wednesday for barring
Taiwanese Falun Gong followers from entering Hong Kong even though they held
valid travel documents.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Shieh Jhy-wey lambasted Hong Kong
immigration authorities as "absolutely wrong" for denying 12 Taiwanese Falun
Gong adherents entry Monday in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's
return to Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>The 12 Taiwanese citizens were repatriated after being denied entry to Hong Kong
because their visits were "not conducive to the public good."</P>
      <P>Shieh said Taiwan -- a democratic country whose people fully enjoy freedom of
religion and freedom of speech -- feels it is a pity that Hong Kong denied entry
to the 12 Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>He said the entry denial reflects the fact that Hong Kong's human rights and
democracy have regressed to a level much lower than that enjoyed by Hong Kongers
10 years before under British colonial rule.</P>
      <P>This latest incident should also remind the Taiwanese people that Beijing has
been manipulating democracy and human rights in Hong Kong under the guise of the
so-called "one country, two systems."</P>
      <P>China outlawed Falun Gong,  which combines meditation with Buddhist-inspired
teachings, as an "evil cult" in mid-1999 and practitioners have subsequently
faced often brutal repression.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN READY TO TALK WITH CHINA ON BANKING, FINANCIAL EXCHANGES: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) vice chairman said Wednesday that although
Taiwan has tried to liberalize banking and financial exchanges with China as
best it can, Beijing has been tremendously uncooperative.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan said during a cross-Taiwan Strait forum that
Taiwan is willing to open negotiations with China to help normalize economic and
trade relations across the strait so long as Beijing stops resisting.</P>
      <P>Tung said the administration allowed Taiwan's banking institutes to open liaison
offices in China in June 2001, followed by allowing Taiwan insurance operators
to establish subdivisions in China in August 2002, allowing insurance operators
to invest in their Chinese counterparts in April 2004 and allowing Taiwan stocks
and securities firms to establish branch offices in China in February 2005.</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's liberalization, the Chinese authorities have refused to talk
with the Taiwan authorities in this regard and have refused to allow Taiwan
stocks and securities firms to establish branch offices or subsidiaries in
China, letting them only set up representative offices, Tung added.</P>
      <P>In July 2004, Tung noted, the administration put forth 18 proposals to enhance
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges, including currency exchanges,
investment guarantees,  financial supervision, judicial reciprocity, commercial
arbitration, cargo and passenger charter flight services, allowing Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan and direct air and sea links, in the hope that the
Chinese authorities would at least meet Taiwanese officials for talks.</P>
      <P>However, Tung said, Beijing has set numerous "political barriers" to official
talks on those proposals.</P>
      <P>In June 2005, he added, the administration authorized the quasi-official Taiwan
External Trade Development Council to talk with its Chinese counterpart on
cross-strait trade relations. However, the Chinese authorities refuse to talk
with the officials, and only agreed to increase business and trade exchanges
with Taiwan via a mechanism arranged by Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Tung claimed that instead of helping, the mechanism created more problems in
terms of boosting cross-strait trade.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, in August 2005, China opened 15 categories of Taiwan
fruits to be exported to China, but the exports of Taiwan fruits to China
declined by 9 percent that year.</P>
      <P>Last December, he continued, China announced that it would import 2,000 tons of
bananas from Taiwan "in an effort to help Taiwan banana farmers digest stocks."
But in the end, China purchased only 118 tons -- less than 6 percent of the
promised volume.</P>

      <P>The recruitment will bring the total number of local governments' child-

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung instructed relevant authorities Wednesday to be
prepared for a massive release of prison inmates who are eligible for
commutation in an amnesty program, to reduce the possible social impact to the
lowest degree.</P>
      <P>In a Ministry of Justice (MOJ) report on measures to deal with the enforcement
of President Chen Shui-bian's commutation act, statistics show that 25,670
inmates will benefit from the amnesty, initiated as a way to commemorate the
60th anniversary of the 228 Incident of 1947 and the 20th anniversary of the
lifting of 38 years of martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>The act will be enacted July 16 and on that day, 10,523 inmates will be
released, while others will have their sentences halved, the report said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin released the report at a meeting at the
Executive Yuan, in which he cited MOJ statistics as saying that more than 31,000
prisoners were released in a 1988 amnesty and another 27,706 in 1991.</P>
      <P>The ratio of recidivism among pardoned prisoners within 10 years of their
release were 19.7 percent and 16.2 percent, respectively in those two amnesties,
both lagging far behind the recidivism rate of 46.9 percent among those released
after 1997.</P>
      <P>The figures prove that the 2007 amnesty program does not contradict the
government's determination to maintain social order and crack down on crime,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>After hearing the report, the premier said reinforced measures should be
implemented to monitor drug abusers and thieves, since the tallies show that
drug abusers comprised the largest portion of prisoners to be released July 16.</P>
      <P>Chang also instructed the Council of Labor Affairs to make efforts to assist the
released prisoners with vocational training and employment opportunities, while
requesting the Ministry of the Interior to help the socially disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Taiwan welcomes Beijing's move to address it with the official title that it
uses in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), Government Information Office
Minister Shieh Jhy-wey said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shieh made the remarks after China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi
referred to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei" while talking about the 2008 Beijing
Olympic torch relay issues at a routine news conference earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>It marked a major change in Beijing's references to Taiwan on Olympic affairs.
For years, Beijing has addressed Taiwan as "Taipei, China" instead of the IOC-
sanctioned designation "Chinese Taipei." Beijing has deliberately used its
moniker as a means of showing its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On April 26, Taiwan rejected a China-proposed torch relay route that would have
had the flame arriving in Taiwan from Vietnam April 30, 2008, and going on to
China-controlled Hong Kong and Macau. The moniker dispute was one of the reasons
cited by Taiwan for its snubbing of the Beijing-proposed route.</P>
      <P>"Given Taiwan's status as a formal IOC member, Beijing should at the very least
address us by our official title in the organization, " Shieh said, adding that
Beijing's change has vindicated some of the injustice Taiwan has endured over
the years.</P>
      <P>Shieh further said that so long as China refrains from efforts to "downgrade
Taiwan or localize Taiwan" and instead deals with Taiwan on an equal footing,
relations across the Taiwan Strait will definitely be on friendly terms and
could even be "as cordial as brotherhood."</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-hsiang, deputy minister of the Sports Affairs Council, echoed Shieh's
view, saying that Taiwan is satisfied with Beijing's change in its attitude
toward the name issue.</P>
      <P>As for the Olympic torch relay, Lee said Taiwan remains firm on its position
that the flame must enter and exit Taiwan via a third country.</P>
      <P>"We cannot afford to compromise on this fundamental stance, "Lee said, adding
that Taiwan cannot accept any arrangement of the relay route that would make
Taiwan appear as a stop on a Chinese domestic route.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan looks forward to a new round of cross-strait talks on
adjustments of the original Olympic torch relay route.</P>
      <P>While announcing the 137,000-km relay route in Beijing April 26, Chinese
officials claimed that Taiwan would be the starting point of China's domestic
relay route, prompting Taiwan to reject the offer.</P>
      <P>As with all Olympics, next year's relay will begin in Greece March 25. After
circling Greece, it will arrive in Beijing March 31. It will then wend its way
across Asia, Europe, the Americas, Africa and back to Asia and China before
being used to ignite the cauldron at the opening ceremony Aug. 8 in Beijing's
91,000-seat National Stadium.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:New Poll Finds That Young Americans Are Leaning Left

Young Americans are more likely than the general public to favor a government-
run universal health care insurance system, an open- door policy on immigration
and the legalization of gay marriage, according to a New York Times/CBS News/MTV
poll. The poll also found that they are more likely to say the war in Iraq is
heading to a successful conclusion.

The poll offers a snapshot of a group whose energy and idealism have always been
as alluring to politicians as its scattered focus and shifting interests have
been frustrating. It found that substantially more Americans ages 17 to 29 than
four years ago are paying attention to the presidential race. But they appeared
to be really familiar with only two of the candidates, Senators Barack Obama and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, both Democrats.

Wall Street Journal:How Wall Street Stoked The Mortgage Meltdown

Twelve years ago, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sent a vice president to
California to check out First Alliance Mortgage Co. Lehman was thinking about
tapping into First Alliance's lucrative business of making "subprime" home loans
to consumers with sketchy credit.

The vice president, Eric Hibbert, wrote a memo describing First Alliance as a
financial "sweat shop" specializing in "high pressure sales for people who are
in a weak state." At First Alliance, he said, employees leave their "ethics at
the door."</TEXT>

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said Wednesday that the domestic stock market would rebound to over 10,000
points if the KMT regains power in 2008.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering reporters' questions after having attended a
news conference called by human rights groups to lend support to three suspects
involved in a high-profile homicide case that occurred in 1991 in Hsichih,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>In response to criticisms made by Frank Hsieh, presidential candidate of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, Ma clarified that he has never called for
an opening to Chinese laborers or Chinese farm products. "Hsieh must not make
such false accusations against me," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the KMT backs a liberal economic policy that would allow Taiwan
to open to the whole world, including China, and Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Ma vowed to establish direct transport links between Taiwan and China, and spoke
of making Taiwan a free trade zone during a forum sponsored by UBS AG, Taipei

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars from Taiwan and China discussed a wide range of topics related to
political, social and economic development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait in
a seminar held Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Tung Chen-yuan briefed the
participants on the status of cross-strait exchanges and the Taiwan government's
policy regarding cross-strait exchanges in his opening remarks at the one-day
seminar, which took place at National Taiwan University (NTU).</P>
      <P>The government has been trying to protect national interests instead of blocking
cross-strait economic exchanges because the increasingly active cross-strait
economy is determined by a market mechanism that should not be obstructed by
government, Tung summed up.</P>
      <P>However,  Shen Jiuyuan,  secretary-general of Pudong Taiwan Economic Research
Center, and Liu Xiangping, a professor at Nanjing University,  said Taiwan
should be more open in its economic relationship with China to prevent itself
from being marginalized.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait political interaction of the last 20 years has not helped the
Taiwanese people to erase their fear and distrust of China, said Georg Gesk, an
assistant professor at Taiwan's Hsuan Chuang University. China's oppression of
Taiwan's diplomatic and international space and its deployment of close to 1,000
missiles pointing at Taiwan led to a collective feeling of China's "animosity
and unfriendliness," he added.</P>
      <P>Gesk said the governments of Taiwan and China should make efforts to eliminate
the animosity, citing the evolution of relations between France and Germany in
explaining how former enemies make peace with each other.</P>
      <P>A thesis by NTU professor Chou Chi-hsiang focused on the analysis of the second
phase of constitutional reform in Taiwan and claimed that President Chen Shui-
bian's road of constitutional reform has hit the wall and that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party will have to initiate negotiations with China to
build up a healthy environment for presidential candidate Frank Hsieh.</P>

      <P>A women's rights advocacy group protested in front of Japan's representative
office in Taiwan Wednesday on the</P>
      <P>heels of passage of a U.S. House committee resolution on the Japanese military's
wartime sexual enslavement of women in Asia, demanding a formal apology and
compensation from the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>"This can be seen as a huge victory in our 15-year effort to get compensation
for comfort women, " said Fran Gau, Executive Director of the Taipei Women's
Rescue Foundation (TWRF) , on the overwhelming 39-2 vote in the U.S. House of
Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee passed that day, which called on the
government of Japan to "formally  acknowledge,  apologize  and  accept
historical responsibility" for its coercion of young women into sexual slavery
during World War II.</P>
      <P>The foundation and two former comfort women, Cheng Chen-tao and Chen Yang,
staged a 30-minute protest in front of the Interchange Association, Japan's
official representative office in Taiwan, under the watchful eyes of dozens of
policemen. They were not received by Japanese officials.</P>
      <P>"At 86 years old, I can no longer work and make a living. For many years the
Japanese government has refused to recognize the existence  of comfort  women or
offer a formal  apology  and compensation. With the passage of the resolution, I
hope for Japan's apology and compensation, " said Cheng.</P>
      <P>Chen Yang also questioned  why the Taiwan government  and legislature failed to
initiate a practical solution in pressuring Japan now that the U.S. has shown
support for the compensation claim movement.</P>
      <P>"The governments of South Korea and China have been very active and supportive
of the compensation claim. The Taiwan government and legislature should step up
their efforts as well, as the resolution has now received support from Canada,
Australia, Germany, South Korea, China and the Philippines, " said Gau.</P>
      <P>"We are not requesting Japan's apology forever. We want the truth to be
recognized, " said Legislator Joanna Lei, who also attended the protest.</P>
      <P>"The government of Japan has never taken the responsibility it should have
taken. On the contrary, it has spent a lot of money lobbying in the U.S. for the
resolution not to pass, " Gau said, adding that the TWRF also condemned 44
Japanese lawmakers' denial of the existence comfort women in a full-page
advertisement in the Washington Post earlier this month.</P>
      <P>The non-binding  Resolution 121,  which was introduced  by Representative
Michael Honda last January, will now be voted on in a full House.</P>

      <P>An investigation into why both engines of a China Airlines plane on a May 19

      <P>The CAL aircraft -- an Airbus A330-300 -- was equipped with two CF6-80E1 type

      <P>The report said that although the plane was able to continue its flight and

      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official defended Wednesday the department's recent
decision to reopen Taiwan to imports of Canadian boneless beef from cattle under
30 months of age, saying that the move was decided upon only after prudent and
scientific evaluation.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Sanitation, made the remarks
after opposition People First Party Legislator Tsai Sheng-chia accused the
government of pandering to political pressure by allowing Canadian beef to enter
Taiwan again.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Canada remains a mad cow disease-affected area, Tsai said he is
afraid that reopening Taiwan to Canadian beef will expose local people to health
risks.</P>
      <P>In response, Cheng said the legislator's worries are unwarrented and
unnecessary, adding that the DOH dare not take any risk in exposing local people
to deadly diseases nor would it pander to political pressure at the expense of
local people's health.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the DOH has conducted a comprehensive review of official
documents furnished by Canadian authorities as well as done a scientific
analysis  based on the findings  of field inspections.</P>
      <P>"We have twice sent expert teams to Canada to inspect its cattle ranches,
slaughterhouses and other relevant facilities and then commissioned the National
Health Research Institute to conduct a professional assessment before coming to
a decision, " Cheng said, adding that the DOH has not faced any political
pressure in its decision-making process.</P>
      <P>Under DOH regulations, Canadian beef entering Taiwan must bear health and
hygiene certification issued by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CIFA) and
must be handled and packed by DOH-approved slaughterhouses and packaging
facilities in Canada.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the beef should be free of all bone and other animal parts regarded as
high-risk in terms of the deadly disease. These parts include principally
brains, spinal cords and cattle bone marrow.</P>
      <P>Taiwan issued an import ban on beef from Canada, the United States, Japan,
Britain and several other European Union countries Dec. 31, 2003 amid fears over
the threat of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government applied to the DOH in March 2004 for lifting the import
ban, and the DOH agreed to reopen Taiwan to Canadian beef imports with stringent
restrictions last Saturday after holding 11 rounds of consultative meetings with
health experts in terms of BSE prevention measures unveiled by the World Health
Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health.</P>
      <P>Besides demanding the Canadian government produce regular reports on its
enforcement of BSE prevention and control measures, the DOH has also asked
relevant government agencies, including the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to
step up beef safety inspection and crack down on smuggling.</P>
      <P>City and county health bureaus have also been ordered to intensify inspection of
supermarket chains and hypermarts to check whether Canadian beef imports meet
relevant DOH regulations or requirements.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows beef imports from the United States, New Zealand,
Australia and Canada.</P>

never regards anything as beneath his notice or as unworthy of serious and
careful attention -- that is what is meant by being dignified without being
supercilious."</TEXT>

      <P>The public should be on guard if they are stung by a stingray, as the spine
contains a potentially deadly venom, a doctor from a central Taiwan hospital
warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu Li-hua, director of the Emergency Department of Tung's Taichung Metro Harbor
Hospital, said the hospital recently handled three such cases including a 39
-year-old local and a 28-year-old foreign national, who were stung by the fish
as they were collecting fishing nets, and a 28-year-old chef, who was stung
while preparing a dish featuring the fish.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that clinical experience has shown that most patients were
inadvertently stung while fishing or preparing the fish for cooking.</P>
      <P>He said the classic symptoms after being stung are severe pain, chest pain or
chest tightness, palpitations, night sweats and dizziness, and in the most
serious cases, death.</P>
      <P>He said that after being stung, the patients should immerse the affected area in
hot water at a temperature of between 41 and 45 Celsius, and seek urgent medical
treatment. They should remain under observation in hospital for at least six
hours to be safe.</P>
      <P>The most famous stingray-related injury resulted in the death of Stephen Irwin,
nicknamed "the Crocodile Hunter."</P>
      <P>Irwin, an Australian wildlife expert and television personality, achieved world-
wide fame from the television program "The Crocodile Hunter, " which was an
internationally broadcast wildlife documentary series co-hosted with his wife
Terri Irwin.</P>
      <P>On September 4, 2006, Irwin was fatally stung in the chest by a stingray whilst
snorkeling at Batt Reef off the coast of Port Douglas, Queensland, on
Australia's Great Barrier Reef.</P>
      <P>Irwin was in the area filming a documentary entitled "Ocean's Deadliest."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ TO FLESH OUT DETAILS FOR RELEASE OF PARDONED PRISONERS</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will hold a meeting next Monday to flesh out
technical details for the smooth release of prison inmates eligible for pardon
under a sentence commutation statute that will take effect July 16, an official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ tallies, 25,670 prisoners will benefit from the statute passed
by the legislature June 15, with more than 10,000 eligible for release
immediately and the remaining having their sentences cut by half.</P>
      <P>As soon as the statute comes into force, 10,523 inmates, including 170 people
serving time in military prisons, will be eligible for release.</P>
      <P>To ensure the smooth operation of relevant formalities, the official  said,
staff  members  from the MOJ's prosecutorial, correction, and rehabilitation and
protection affairs departments as well as chief prosecutors and prison heads
from across the country will meet July 2 to hammer out technical details and
various corresponding measures.</P>
      <P>MOJ statistics show that more than 40 percent of prisoners to be released July
16 are offenders against the narcotics control act. To prevent recidivism among
newly released drug offenders, the official said, the MOJ will keep close tabs
on their behavior and offer them necessary assistance, including helping them
join treatment programs and find jobs.</P>
      <P>Among drug offenders to be released on the first day that the pardons take
effect, 635 are HIV-carriers, the official said, adding that the MOJ will take
special measures to prevent further spread of AIDS and assist the released  HIV-
carrier  drug offenders  in rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>On that day, the official said, the Taiwan Aftercare Association will send staff
to prisons around the country to present a package of pamphlets to each of the
freed HIV-carrier drug offenders, which will contain information about AIDS
prevention, drug rehabilitation and Methadone substitute programs.</P>
      <P>The second largest group of inmates to be released on the first day of the
pardons are offenders convicted of burglary and theft, while those convicted of
fraud will form the third largest group of pardoned prisoners, the official
said.</P>
      <P>By place, Taichung Prison in central Taiwan will have the greatest number of
inmates qualified for release on the first day of the new statute, with 1,145;
followed by Tainan Prison, with 615 and Changhua Prison, with 500.</P>
      <P>On April 24, President Chen Shui-bian proposed a sentence commutation plan in
commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the 228 Incident of 1947 and the 20th
anniversary of the lifting of 38 years of martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>Acting on Chen's directive, the Cabinet drafted a commutation bill and referred
it to the legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party supported the Cabinet-drafted
bill, the version proposed by the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) was passed by the legislature after a cross-
party consensus was reached.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-drafted version would grant commutation to only those who  receive
one-year  sentences  or less,  compared  to the opposition-proposed one-and-a
-half-year sentences or less.</P>
      <P>Some DPP lawmakers accused the "pan-blue alliance" of tailoring the statute to
benefit KMT Legislator Chiu Yi.</P>
      <P>Chiu was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his violent conduct during a
protest at the Kaohsiung District Court following the 2004 presidential
election. Chiu began serving time behind bar in April.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China is addressing Taiwan with the official title that it uses in the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) thanks to the influence of the
international community, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Y. L. Lin, director of MOFA's Department of International Organizations,
made the remarks a day after China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi
refereed to Taiwan as "Chinese Taipei" while talking about the 2008 Beijing
Olympic torch relay issues.</P>
      <P>That marks a major change in Beijing's references to Taiwan on Olympic affairs.
For years, Beijing has addressed Taiwan as "Taipei, China" instead of the IOC-
sanctioned designation "Chinese Taipei." Beijing has deliberately distorted the
name as a means of restating its claim to sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said that this shows that if the international community speaks out for
Taiwan, it will prod China to rethink its past practices and make changes.</P>
      <P>He also said that a recent move by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE) to downgrade Taiwan's membership to the level of a "non-sovereign regional
member" under pressure from China is indicative of China's relentless
obstruction of Taiwan's efforts to seek maneuvering space in the international
community.</P>
      <P>China would even force members of international organizations in which Taiwan is
already a member to accept its "one China principle," which Taiwan can never
accept, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the recent drive to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan"
is aimed at making the international community "recognize Taiwan's separate
identity and that the island is by no means a part of the People's Republic of
China."</P>
      <P>He said the drive is still ongoing, and priority must be given to soliciting
support from allies as well as communicating with other major countries.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ministry will send delegations to the European Union, Japan
and the United States to lobby for their support, Lin said Taiwan's overseas
embassies and representative offices are communicating with the officials of
their stationed countries.</P>
      <P>The ministry will not necessarily send delegations, but will ask experts and
scholars to visit major countries to explain the reasons why the nation wishes
to apply to join the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan," he added.</P>

      <P>Yulong Nissan Motor Co., a joint venture between Yulong Group of Taiwan and
Nissan Motor of Japan, has received the nation's first certificate from the
Ministry of the Interior on its newly developed vehicle anti-theft system called
"Anti Theft Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."</P>
      <P>Yulong Nissan General Manager Wu Hsin-fa and Interior Minister Lee Yi-Yang
announced the achievement at a news conference Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the system protects a vehicle by having vehicle identification
numbers tagged on important parts and components. These security lables are
invisible and very difficult to remove. Even if they are scratched off,
ultraviolet marks will be left on the vehicle for tracing, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Lee said vehicle anti-theft system will help reduce vehicle theft by increasing
risk of theft and raising difficulties for selling stolen cars and components.</P>
      <P>All of the cars produced by Nissan will be fitted with the system from July 1
and the company will absorb the added production cost until the end of October,
Wu said. It will also be available for sale for retro-fitting to older cars, he

      <P>Four Taiwanese high-technology companies have gotten the green light from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday to invest in low-end semiconductor
testing and packaging plants in China.</P>
      <P>Executives of the Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASE) Group, Siliconware
Precision Industries Co., Greatek Electronic and Walton Advanced Engineering
Inc. all welcomed the "final approval" granted by the MOEA's Investment
Commission.</P>
      <P>The four companies' China-bound investment plans involve ASE Group's joint
venture with Philips' NXP Semiconductor to establish a semiconductor testing and
packaging plant in Suzhou; Siliconware's investment of US$30 million in Suzhou;
Greatek's investment of US$30 million in a Chinese city yet to be decided; and
Walton's investment of US$18 million, also in Suzhou, according to Investment
Commission officials.</P>
      <P>The administration announced the lifting of a ban on Taiwanese firms investing
in semiconductor testing and packaging plants in China in April last year. Many
Taiwanese companies had submitted applications,  but only these four have passed
the Investment Commission's screening process as their applications fit with the
MOEA's regulations on cross-strait division of labor and investment, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>In order to accelerate the approval of their applications, these four companies
have also promised to first increase investments in Taiwan. Of them, Siliconware
plans to spend some NT$30 billion (US$915 million) to build a new semiconductor
testing and packaging plant, which is expected to create some 6,000 jobs, the
officials added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not rule out any possibilities in the development of the country's
relations with China, so long as they are approved by the people through a
democratic process, Taiwan's representative to the United States said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Making the remarks during a luncheon with members of major U.S. think tanks in
Washington D.C., Joseph Wu said Taiwan's cross-Taiwan Strait policy has remained
unchanged despite the suspension of the National Unification Guidelines last
year.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, President Chen Shui-bian will try to improve Taiwan's relations
with China during the remaining 11 months of his term by seeking a breakthrough
on cross-strait talks on issues concerning the operations of cross-strait
charter flights and visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said the government of Taiwan will never accept Beijing's "one
China" principle or the so-called "1992 consensus, " which Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang claims allows Taiwan and China to interpret the meaning of
"one China" separately.</P>
      <P>Pointing to results of opinion surveys, Wu said the majority of people in Taiwan
wish to maintain the status quo and are not ready to go for the option of
establishing a "Republic of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Wu said although it is unlikely that China will accept this option at present,
the minds of intellectuals in China are expected to become more open as China
becomes more prosperous.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's plan to push for a referendum on the country's bid to apply to the
United Nations under the name of "Taiwan, " Wu said Taiwan and the United States
should step up their communications to sort out their differences on the matter.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan understands that some moves it is planning to make are likely to
draw strong reaction from the other side of the Taiwan Strait. But if the United
States is to try to restrict Taiwan from doing things that are common in other
democratic countries, it will be hard to convince the people of Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the United States was supportive of referendums held by Eastern
European countries to withdraw from the former Soviet Union and that many other
countries are also holding referendums as part of the process to amend their
constitutions.</P>
      <P>However, the United States is always nervous whenever Taiwan is planning to push
for a referendum, especially on issues concerning Taiwan's participation in the
international community and other sovereignty-related issues, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has no intention of causing a cross-strait crisis and hopes the
United States will allow its key policy-makers to visit Taiwan  to conduct
direct communication  with their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>According  to Wu,  although Taiwan maintains no diplomatic relations with member
nations of the European Union, many of these countries have sent vice
ministerial-level officials and foreign affairs officials to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes there will be similar exchanges between Taipei and Washington, he
said.</P>
      <P>Expressing approval for a non-binding resolution adopted Tuesday by the U.S.
House of Representatives' Committee on Foreign Affairs urging the administrative
branch to lift restrictions on visits to the United States by high-level elected
and appointed officials of Taiwan,  Wu said the resolution reflected the U.S.
Congress' recognition of Taiwan's democratic development.</P>

      <P>More than 20 Falung Gong members from Taiwan remain in detention in Hong Kong
Thursday after staging a sit-in the previous night at the airport in protest
against having been denied entry.</P>
      <P>One of the Falung Gong members, surnamed Yang, spoke to the CNA by telephone
from detention in Hong Kong, saying that the group began their sit-in at the
airport after being barred from entering the former British colony upon arrival
at 7: 30 p.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The group of Taiwanese Falun Gong members were slated to take part in a
demonstration July 1 in Hong Kong to protest China's human rights abuses on the
occasion of the 10th anniversary of the special administrative region's return
to Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, they asked Hong Kong authorities to give an explanation as to
why they were denied entry and decided to stage the sit-in after getting no
response from Hong Kong officials.</P>
      <P>They continued the protest until 4 a.m., when Hong Kong policemen took them away
by force and placed them in the detention center. All of the demonstrators were
detained in isolation, she added.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong police were extremely unfriendly to them during the sit-in,
refusing to allow them to drink water, or go to the toilet with company, she
said, adding that those who went to the toilet alone were taken away one by one.</P>
      <P>Yang accused Hong Kong authorities of treating them in a brutal manner without
justifiable  reason and stated that they were determined to reveal the episode
to the whole world.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government spokesman declined to comment on the
incident on the grounds that it was an isolated case.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, the U. S. State Department also called on the Hong Kong
government to maintain a high level of personal and policial freedom, saying
that it had learned that at least one Falun Gong member from Taiwan had been
denied entry to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Theresa Chu, a human rights lawyer and Taiwanese Falun Gong practitioner, was
deported the day after arriving on the evening June 24 in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to a spokesman for the Falun Gong movement in Hong Kong, a further 100
Taiwanese Falun Gong members were also barred from entering the former British
colony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED NOT TO POLITICIZE TAIWAN'S REFERENDUM</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian blasted China's ceaseless  efforts to squeeze Taiwan
out of the international community Thursday, calling on Beijing not to
politicize his recent proposal to hold a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the opening ceremony of a training course on national
development and women leadership sponsored by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>In addition to hailing Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's leadership, Chen spent nearly
30 minutes talking about Beijing's malicious repression of Taiwan's efforts to
participate in international activities over the last seven years.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing deployed some 200 missiles targeting Taiwan in 2000 when he
assumed post as Taiwan's president, Chen said the number of the missiles
recently jumped to 988.</P>
      <P>In addition, China's military spending is growing by double digits every year,
with the U.S. government warning that Taiwan should stay alert as China's
military expansion has exceeded its defense needs.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China is oppressing Taiwan from top to bottom, regardless of
political affiliations, including both people and animals, and central and local
governments.</P>
      <P>For example, Chen added, recently Beijing lured away Taiwan's diplomatic ally --
Costa Rica -- as it did with Saudi Arabia, South Korea,  and South Africa during
the previous Kuomintang (KMT) government.</P>
      <P>Chen went on that Beijing's suppression of Taiwan will not loosen even if Taiwan
adopts policies advocating unification with China, citing the example of China's
blocking Taipei's participation in the World Capital Forum and the meeting of
the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC21) , when former opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou was mayor of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma, the KMT's presidential candidate for the 2008 election, is considered by
some as favoring unification with China.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  Chen said,  China told a visiting  Taiwanese delegation of
opposition leaders in 2005 that it would help Taiwan join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , however, Beijing later signed a secret memorandum of
understanding with the WHO secretariat, downgrading Taiwan's sovereignty and
requiring that the island's technical exchanges with the WHO be contingent on
China's approval.</P>
      <P>In regard to his recent plan to promote a referendum on Taiwan's bid to enter
the United Nations under the name of "Taiwan", to be held alongside the 2008
presidential election, Chen stressed that the proposal does not violate his
former commitment to U.S. government and has nothing to do with changing
Taiwan's official designation.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has failed in its U.N. bid for the last decade under the name of
Republic of China, Chen asked what other options the country has other than
pursuing membership under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen's plan immediately encountered strong opposition from the U.S. government,
which declared that it opposes any initiative that appears designed to change
Taiwan's status unilaterally.</P>
      <P>Concerning  opposition  from some people to his referendum proposal, Chen said
he did not quite understand whether these people are opposing the holding of a
referendum, the use of the name of "Taiwan", or Taiwan's entry into the United
Nations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that Hong Kong's regressive democratic
development over the past 10 years of Chinese rule, which strikes a sharp
contrast with Taiwan's improving democratization during the same period,  proves
that "without sovereignty, there is no democracy."</P>
      <P>Making the comment in the latest issue of his online newsletter ahead of the
10th anniversary of Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule, Chen likened Hong
Kong to a bird confined in "a cage that is becoming smaller and smaller."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Beijing's promise to grant a high-degree of autonomy to the
Hong Kong people under the "one country, two systems" formula is nothing but a
lie -- one which prompted 500,000 Hong Kong residents to take to the streets on
July 1, 2003.</P>
      <P>"Today's Hong Kong can only choose between staying in a bigger cage and a
smaller one, but is unable to change its fate in a bird cage or enjoy the right
to be its own master. Taiwan's 23 million people should count themselves lucky
about this," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the lifting of martial
law in Taiwan, Chen said Taiwan's history over the past five decades  testifies
that the wave of democracy  is irresistible and that the party-state system and
authoritarianism cannot last long.</P>
      <P>While democratization is the path that China is bound to take in the future, the
experiences of Taiwan and Hong Kong will be the best references for China in its
process to achieve freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, Chen
said, expressing the hope that democracy and freedom will become common in
China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and across all of the ethnic Chinese community.</P>

the International Trade Commission (ITC) of the Ministry of Economic Affairs

13 at the latest, economics officials said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance imposed a provisional anti-dumping tax of up to 43.46

      <P>Members of a private cross-Taiwan Strait relations group, accompanying some 60
Chinese spouses of Taiwan nationals, lodged a protest at the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) Thursday, opposing the administration's plans to further restrict
the number of Chinese spouses settling in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang Shu, secretary-general of the private Chunghua Cross-Strait Marriage
Consultation Association, said this was the second time since mid-June that the
association and the Chinese spouses have filed an appeal with the MOI to scrap
articles in a draft population policy white paper that would be tremendously
discriminatory to Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>The protesters  expressed opposition  to the parts of the population policy
white paper stipulating that the number of Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens
would be further restricted and that Chinese spouses and foreign spouses of
Taiwan citizens should produce a financial certificate effective for one year
before obtaining their Republic of China IDs. The financial certificate would
require the applicants to have at least NT$350,000 (US$10,671) of their own.</P>
      <P>The protesters also demanded that the government immediately amend articles 17
and 21 of the Statute Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area so that Chinese spouses can be treated equally as
foreign spouses to obtain ROC IDs after four years of continuous residence in
Taiwan, instead of eight years.</P>
      <P>Tang said his association and the protesting Chinese spouses hope that the
discriminatory lines in the white paper will be scrapped before it is submitted
to the Executive Yuan for approval in mid-July. If not, he said, association
members and the Chinese spouses will take their protest to the streets in
September.</P>
      <P>Zhou Yuhui, a woman from Hunan Province and the wife of Taichung resident Yang
Chiang-yao, who were among Thursday's protesters, said that according to the
draft population policy white paper, she would be unable to obtain her ROC ID

entry into Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Theresa Chu, who is also the Asian executive director of the United States-based
Human Rights Law Foundation, was barred from entering Hong Kong Wednesday,
making it her second denial of entry in three days.</P>
      <P>Chu said that prior to the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China
July 1, the Hong Kong authorities have been repatriating dozens of Taiwanese
Falun Gong practitioners to Taiwan recently in an effort to prevent them from
staging a protest in front of Chinese President Hu Jintao during his visit to

    <HEADLINE>HALF NATION'S COACH DRIVERS ARE OVERWORKED: CONSUMER'S FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An investigation by the Consumer's foundation has found that half of the long-
distance coach drivers plying Taiwan's highways are overworked in apparent
violation of the nation's Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Cheng Jen-hung told a press conference Thursday that the
foundation sampled six coach drivers working for the Kuo-Kuang Motor Transport
Co. and the Aloha Bus Co. and monitored their work patterns June 13-22, to find
that half of them worked more than 12 hours per day.</P>
      <P>Cheng pointed out that the current working conditions of coach drivers show no
improvement compared with four years ago when a report by the Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health said that coach drivers in Taiwan worked an
average 58.9 hours per week, or 11.8 hours per day in a five-day work week.</P>
      <P>According to the Labor Standards Law, the normal hours of work should not exceed
eight per day, but can be extended by four hours to 12. The Ministry of the
Interior has made it clear that for professional drivers, the time spent on
standby duty should be included as part of their working hours.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that although the two coach service companies allowed two to three
hours of rest periods during a work day, there are no comfortable environments
for them to rest properly.</P>
      <P>"During their rest times, a coach driver needs to eat, clean the interior of the
vehicle and have the fuel tank filled. Some drivers even have to wash their
vehicles," he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said fines of between NT$6,000 and NT$60,000 for breaching the Labor
Standards Law have failed to provide a deterrent to coach service operators who
demand that their drivers work more than 12 hours a day.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to examine the accident-causing practice of coach
companies paying low basic salaries to drivers but offering them handsome
bonuses for longer than normal working hours.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  has no strict  laws governing  the working  hours of long-distance
drivers.</P>
      <P>In Europe, coach drivers must take a 45 minute break after four-and-a-half hours
of continuous driving. That break can be split into two -- the first of 15
minutes and the second of 30 minutes. The maximum amount of driving per day is
nine hours but this can be extended to 10 hours twice a week. Total weekly
driving is limited to 56 hours per week or 90 hours per fortnight.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Yu Shyi-kun delivered to the
Central Election Commission (CEC) Thursday a petition signed by 1.4 million
people endorsing a referendum proposal initiated by the party and several civic
groups on forcing the opposition Kuomintang to return its ill-gotten assets to
the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Before delivering the petitions, Yu, who concurrently serves as the convener of
an alliance seeking the retrieval of the ill-gotten assets, DPP presidential
candidate Frank Hsieh, DPP Legislator Trong Chai and World United Formosans for
Independence Chairman Ng Chiau-tong attended a news conference during which they
predicted that they will succeed in retrieving the assets improperly or
illegally amassed by the KMT during its 55 years in power.</P>
      <P>Yu said that despite some having had misgivings about collecting enough
signatures to put the proposal to a national referendum, it has proved to be a
success.</P>
      <P>He claimed that this is the first referendum proposal launched by "the citizens,
" instead of a top-down one. The proposal "has demonstrated the Taiwan people's
resolve and will to retrieve the assets that belong to the nation," Yu added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that in the past, the line between the ruling party and the nation
was often blurred so that what should have been national assets actually lined
the pockets of the KMT.</P>
      <P>"Retrieving the KMT's ill-gotten assets is the wish of the Taiwan people and
their common language," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He also said that some opposition party members have suggested that the KMT
return all its party assets, but said the party cannot follow through on this.</P>
      <P>Yu, Hsieh and various supporters later chanted slogans and symbolically moved a
carton of signatures to a container truck that went to the Executive Yuan to
deliver them to the CEC.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-chan, deputy executive director of the DPP's Policy Committee,  said
that after the CEC receives the 1.4 million signatures, it will deliver them to
local election commissions for verification. As long as there are more than

      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has countered a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) referendum proposal to retrieve the KMT's ill-gotten
assets by proposing a referendum on corruption.</P>
      <P>Huang Chung-hsien,  director of the KMT's Organization and Operation Department,
said Thursday that the party has been promoting its anti-graft  referendum
since last year.  The second-stage name-collecting drive has obtained 1.1
million signatures so far, surpassing the threshold of 820,000 names for it to
be put to a national vote.</P>
      <P>Huang said the KMT will send the petition to the Central Election Commission for
screening next Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the Referendum Law, a valid referendum proposal must be put to a vote
within six months, and Huang estimated that the vote on the anti-graft proposal
can be held alongside the legislative elections slated for Jan. 12 next year.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung has said that faced with a series of corruption
scandals surrounding the DPP administration, the KMT will mobilize the party to
launch a referendum vote against corruption so as to retrieve the national
assets it claims have been embezzled by the DPP.</P>

      <P>Team leader Chang Tien-ming, 52, and Wu Chao-chang, 39, together with seven
other team mates, were seen off early Thursday from Huhsi township by Penghu

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday that without expert
evaluation and approval, Taiwan will not import beef with bones from any country
at present.</P>
      <P>Cheng Hui-wen, director of the DOH Bureau of Food Sanitation, said the
department decided recently to reopen Taiwan to imports of Canadian boneless
beef from cattle under 30 months of age after prudent and scientific evaluation,
but will not open Taiwan's doors to beef with bones from any country, including
Canada or the United States.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks in response to a United Daily News report earlier that
same day that the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) listed Taiwan May
28 as a country where the threat of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) , or
mad cow disease, is "under effective control" just like the U.S. and Canada.</P>
      <P>The report has caused officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) to worry
that the U.S. and Canada might request Taiwan to open its doors to U.S. or
Canadian beef with bones from cattle aged over 30 months on the grounds that
Taiwan is at the same status as the U.S. and Canada in terms of mad cow disease
control.</P>
      <P>COA officials are worried that imports of beef with bones from cattle aged over
30 months could pose a threat to Taiwan's quarantine defense.</P>
      <P>Cheng once again defended the DOH's decision to reopen Taiwan to imports of
Canadian boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age, saying that based on
the average amount of beef consumed by the average Taiwanese, it would take 500
years for a Taiwanese to contract mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The Canadian government applied to the DOH in March 2004 for lifting the import
ban and the DOH agreed to reopen Taiwan to Canadian beef imports with stringent
restrictions June 23 after holding 11 rounds of consultative meetings with
health experts in terms of BSE prevention measures unveiled by the World Health
Organization and the OIE.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows beef imports from the United States, New Zealand,
Australia and Canada.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA ASKS OIE TO REVIEW TAIWAN'S MAD COW DISEASE RISK CLASSIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 28 (CNA)
06/28/07  21:30:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has asked the World Organization for Animal
Health (OIE) to review its stringent categorization of Taiwan as a country with
"effective controlled risk" for mad cow disease, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has never had a case of mad cow disease, scientifically known as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , the official said the COA has asked the
OIE to review its criteria and consider altering Taiwan's ranking.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the OIE adopted a new classification system for BSE
last year, which gauges only countries that have furnished the Paris-based world
watchdog body for animal health with data and information on their domestic
animal health situation for scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Just  12 countries  around  the world  have  applied  for classification of
their BSE status, the official said, adding that five of them, including New
Zealand and Australia, are recognized as having "negligible" risk of mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and five other countries -- the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Chile
and Brazil -- are ranked as having "controlled" risk of BSE, the official said,
adding that the status of the 12th country is unclear.</P>
      <P>Some opposition politicians have taken task with the government over the OIE's
classifying Taiwan in the same category as the United States and Canada, where
cases of mad cow disease have been reported.</P>
      <P>They claimed that Taiwan's downgrading from BSE-free status to the same level as
the United States and Canada is mainly because the Department of Health (DOH)
has opened Taiwan to beef imports from the two countries under what they claimed
is "political pressure."</P>
      <P>Dismissing the opposition criticism as unwarranted, the official said the so-
called "downgrading" is a wrong perception, since the new OIE BSE classification
system has just been implemented for the first time.</P>
      <P>As for linking Taiwan's ranking with its beef imports from the United States and
Canada, the official claimed that such speculation is equally spurious and
implausible.</P>
      <P>Taiwan only allows imports of boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age
from the United States and Canada. According to the official, the OIE has
excluded "boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age" from any risk of
spreading BSE.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the OIE's classification of Taiwan as a "controlled
risk" zone for BSE is probably connected with Taiwan's previous imports of bone
powder from BSE-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Even if the OIE rejects the COA's request to change Taiwan's status this time
around, the official said, Taiwan will still apply for OIE classification next
year.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan's "controlled risk" status will prompt BSE-affected
countries to pressure Taiwan to import their boneless beef from cattle under 30
months of age, the official said that is a question for the Department of Health
(DOH) to consider. "I'm convinced that the DOH will never put local people's
health at risk," he added.</P>
      <P>BSE, which occurs in adult cattle, is one of a group of brain-wasting  diseases
(known  as  transmissible  spongiform encephalopathies or TSEs) . Britain
destroyed 3.7 million cattle in the 1980s and 1990s because of BSE, which has an
incubation period of 3 to 5 years in cattle.</P>

      <P>Academics from more than 10 countries are taking part in a two-day international
conference on culture diversity under international trade regimes that started
Thursday to discuss conflicts and difficulties  between preserving cultural
diversity and trade practices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is "rich in cultural diversity as it has been ruled by Spanish and Dutch"
and is currently facing the challenge  of globalization at a time when it is
working hard toward developing a cultural creative industry, said Minister of
Council of Cultural Affairs (CCA) Wong Chin-chu in her opening remarks.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 20, 2005, the UNESCO General Assembly adopted the Convention on the
Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression (CCD), which
became effective March 18 this year. Taiwan has been paying great attention to
the convention although it is not a U.N. member, Wong said.</P>
      <P>The  debate  between  preserving  cultural  diversity  and international trade
practices has been going on in Geneva, where the World Trade Organization (WTO)
headquarters are located, said Deng Chen-chung, chief negotiator of Taiwan's
Office of Trade Negotiations who was based in Geneva in his previous job.</P>
      <P>In most countries, trade and cultural officials do not talk to each other often,
Deng said, adding that even in Geneva, representatives from different countries
know very little about the UNESCO convention.</P>
      <P>"Currently, the WTO is not equipped to handle this issue, " he said, urging a
mechanism between the WTO and UNESCO and clearer rules of the convention to be
set up.</P>
      <P>A total of 16 theses will be presented at the conference, and new rules to
address cultural policy issues within the WTO framework in future trade
negotiations will be explored. The participants are from New Zealand, Canada,
India, Israel, Germany, South Korea, Hong Kong, France, the U.K., the U.S. and
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>In the face of an imminent hike in the minimum monthly salary from July 1, most
workers and employers, unsurprisingly, have opposite viewpoints of the change,
according to the results of a poll released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent of companies surveyed are opposed to the hike, in contrast to as
high as 68 percent of part-time workers who favor the increase, according to the
Internet poll conducted by the 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>After lengthy negotiations, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) came up with a
final decision last month to raise the hourly pay for part-timers from NT$66, in
place since 1997, to NT$95 -- marking a rise of nearly 44 percent. The change is
expected to benefit some 1.41 million workers, CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>The survey also discovered that 24 percent of the companies questioned agreed
with the government's minimum monthly salary adjustment. At the same time, 54
percent of part-timers responding to the poll voiced concern that they might
lose their jobs as a result of the increase.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the medicine, farming and husbandry sectors employ the
largest ratio of workers (66.7 percent of the total) who receive a basic monthly
salary, followed by the sector related  to daily consumption  (65.7 percent)
and traditional manufacturing (50.9 percent).</P>
      <P>Questioned about what would be impacted the most by the hike, 72.6 percent of
the businesses polled said they are most concerned about rising costs in health
insurance premiums and retirement pensions, ahead of 69.9 percent and 45.8
percent that cited growing costs in workers' wages and ensuing declines in
business earnings, respectively.</P>
      <P>Asked what would be the main effect on society, 69.9 percent of small
enterprises said the rise in the basic wage will increase operating difficulties
for them. Some 57.4 percent expressed worry that it will worsen the jobless
rate, while 51.8 percent said some companies might slash the number of their
part-time workers.</P>
      <P>The local job bank conducted the cyber survey June 14-27, collecting 432 valid

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) voiced Thursday its objections to the
government's plan to pursue U.N. membership for the country under the name of
"Taiwan, " describing the issue as nothing more than an election gambit
maneuvered by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, a PFP lawmaker and director of the PFP's Policy Research
Center, made the remarks in a news conference as an Executive Yuan panel is set
to screen the issue Friday and come out with a final decision on whether it
should be put to a referendum for the public to vote on alongside the 2008
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Describing the planned move as a DPP scheme aimed at "rigging" a national
election, Chang claimed that holding a referendum on Taiwan's U.N. cause at the
same time as the presidential election will violate the "four noes" pledge made
by President Chen Shui-bian in his 2000 and 2004 inauguration speeches.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan also oppose the DPP's referendum plan for the same
reason, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Apart from that,  such a referendum would be illegal and unconstitutional and
would greatly undermine national security and interests, he said, adding that
his party is firmly opposed to holding the referendum.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Lee Fu-dien suggested that the DPP administration first carry out
constitutional amendments to change the country's official designation to
"Taiwan" before it seeks to join the United Nations under that name.</P>
      <P>Hu Chu-ching, a PFP member and a member at the Executive Yuan's public
referendum screening panel, expressed concern over a possible negative response
from the DPP, saying that the DPP might file an administrative petition in an
attempt to overrule the panel's final decision if its vote outcome runs counter
to the ruling party's stance.</P>
      <P>Last year, the Appeals Review Committee under the Executive Yuan, without prior
approval from the screening panel, ruled on its own that a DPP proposal on
holding a public referendum to ask the Kuomintang (KMT) to return its ill-gotten
assets to the state is lawful, he pointed out.</P>

past year, to Coldplay. As any fan will know, Coldplays most celebrated release
was entitled ARush of Blood to the Head. As anyone who knows Mr Darling will
tell you, the last thing he is likely to experience is a rush of blood to the
head. As a lawyer, politician and long-serving minister, he has risen smoothly
to the top without putting a foot wrong.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>New York Times:White House Is Subpoenaed on Wiretapping

The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday issued subpoenas to the White House,
Vice President Dick Cheneys office and the Justice Department after what the
panels chairman called stonewalling of the worst kind of efforts to investigate
the National Security Agencys policy of wiretapping without warrants.

The move put Senate Democrats squarely on a course they had until now avoided,
setting the stage for a showdown with the Bush administration over one of the
most contentious issues arising from the White Houses campaign against
terrorism.

Wall Street Journal:More People Give This Game a Toss,Corny as It May Be

Heidi Hoffmann clutched a red cloth bag of dry corn in her right hand and stared
down her target, a 6-inch hole cut in a wooden platform at the other end of a
cavernous bar. If she could hurl this bag and one or two more into the hole, she
could clinch yet another victory for her team in the ChicagoCornhole league.

"This is unbelievable," complained opponent Andrew Rotolo, mystified by his
team's 17-1 deficit.

A bag-tossing game known as cornhole but also called Bags or Baggo, has become a
craze in recent years at bars, tailgate parties and church picnics in the
Midwest. The game is even drawing rival leagues, equipment vendors and big

      <P>The Taiwan High Court handed down death sentences Friday for the three convicts
in a brutal murder case in Hsichih, Taipei County in 1991 known locally as
"Hsichih Trio, " marking a dramatic about-face on the court's 2003 acquittal

      <P>The three defendants -- Su Chien-ho, Chuang Lin-hsun and Liu Ping-lang -- can
appeal against the latest ruling.</P>
      <P>Each of the "Hsichih Trio" was given two death sentences in a third and final
instance Feb. 9, 1995 after being convicted of robbery and brutal killing of Wu
Ming-han and his wife March 24, 1991.</P>
      <P>The country's then-top prosecutor repeatedly  filed special appeals with the
Supreme Court for retrial, but the appeals were all rejected. After many twists

the trio's lawyer for a rare retrial of the case.</P>
      <P>After more than two years of retrial, the high court acquitted the three men in
January 2003 on the grounds that there were not sufficient evidence to prove the
defendants' involvement in the brutal slaying of the couple.</P>
      <P>In March that year, the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office appealed against the
ruling and five months later, the Supreme Court revoked the "acquittal" ruling
and demanded that the high court retry the case. The debate session ended May
18, 2007 and the panel of judges dealing with the case gave their verdict

      <P>Three to four typhoons are likely to hit Taiwan this year, close to the average
number of 3.1, Central Weather Bureau (CWB) officials forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Teh-jung, director of the CWB's Weather Forecast Center, for
several consecutive years, the number of tropical cyclones forming in the
northwestern Pacific Ocean has been below average.</P>
      <P>With the trend expected to continue this year, the number of tropical cyclones
likely to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean is projected to range between
23 and 25, compared with the 50-year average of 26.7, Wu said.</P>
      <P>CWB tallies show that damage caused by typhoons and heavy rain amounts to more
than NT$17 billion per year on average, accounting for 85 percent of all damage
due to climatic disasters.</P>
      <P>CWB officials urged the public to take proper precautions ahead of the typhoon
season and pay attention to typhoon information released by the bureau.</P>
      <P>On this summer's weather, the officials predicted that it will be hotter than
average, as it has been over the past several years.</P>
      <P>Over the past 30 years, between July and September, an average of 18.3 days have
seen temperatures rise above 35 degrees Celsius, according to CWB tallies.</P>
      <P>However, between 1997 and 2006, there were many years in which the number of

    <HEADLINE>RETRIAL OF 'HSICHIH TRIO' TURNED AROUND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
06/29/07  16:58:36
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court (THC) handed down death sentences for the "Hsichih Trio, "
Friday, reversing a "not guilty" verdict announced in January 2003 due to a lack
of evidence.</P>
      <P>The High Court panel handed down death sentences for Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-lang
and Chuang Lin-hsun -- known locally as the "Hsichih Trio" -- on charges of
robbery and intentional murder.</P>
      <P>The trio, who were incarcerated for 16 years on death row before being released
in January 2003, are eligible to appeal the latest ruling.</P>
      <P>High Court spokesman Wen Yao-yuan said during a news conference Friday that the
judges decided to give death sentences to the trio based on the testimony of the
fourth man, Wang Wen-hsiao, who implicated  the  other  three  as  accomplices;
results  of cross-examination of the trio's confessions; and the results of
investigations by the Institute of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice of a
kitchen knife that the attackers used on the victims.</P>
      <P>Wen also said that the panel of judges discounted as "mere speculation" the
opinions given by U.S.-based forensic scientist Henry Lee, who said in early May
that based on photos of the crime scene he does not exclude the possibility that
a single attacker was responsible for the double murder and rape.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, given the different depths and angles of wounds on the two
victims, a single kitchen knife could have produced all of the cuts, stab wounds
and hacks.</P>
      <P>The case stems from the March 24, 1991 robbery and murder of Wu Ming-han and his
wife Yeh Ying-lan, who were found dead in their Hsichih, Taipei County,
apartment. They had been stabbed 79 times.</P>
      <P>Five months after the slayings, police arrested Wang Wen-hsiao, later known as
the fourth accomplice. Police believed that Wang and three other men gang-raped
Wu's wife before killing her with a kitchen knife taken from the kitchen.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was a soldier at the time, was executed in 1992 after being sentenced
to death by a military court. The other three, tried in civil court, were
convicted of robbery, murder and rape and also sentenced to death. By 1995 the
Hsichih Trio had exhausted all their legal appeals.</P>
      <P>However, then-State Public Prosecutor-General Chen Han, was unsure of their
guilt, and acting within his power as the state's chief prosecutor, made three
appeals to the Supreme Court to retry the case. The high court rejected each of
his motions, but in May 2000 the Taiwan High Court approved an application by
the trio's lawyer for a rare retrial of the case.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing retrial, the Taiwan High Court found that the defendants'
confessions contained differing accounts of the events, including the time,
motive, individual actions, and how the spoils from the robbery were to have
been split up.</P>
      <P>In January 2003, following two years and 31 hearings, the high court acquitted
the three men on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to prove the
defendants' involvement in the brutal slaying of the couple.</P>
      <P>In March of the same year, the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office appealed the High
Court's ruling, and in August the Supreme Court revoked the "acquittal" ruling,
saying that the Taiwan High Court judges had evaluated evidence in the case in
defiance of time-tested rules, defied logic, failed to observe legal guidelines
and had not done a thorough investigation into the case before rendering a
verdict. The Supreme Court then demanded that the high court retry the case.</P>
      <P>In the retrial in May this year, a prosecutor said the three defendants could
have given confessions differing in the details of their accounts due to the
prolonged delay between trials over the years, but claimed that truth and fact
should not be overturned simply because of "trivial differences" in the
defendants' verbal accounts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the trio's lawyer Su You-chen argued via a written statement in May
that it is unacceptable and unjustifiable that the police should find that the
trio were Wang's accomplices solely on the strength of the prosecutors' belief
that it was "impossible for a sole predator to stab two persons 79 times."</P>
      <P>The High Courts' latest hearings ended May 18, 2007. The panel of judges dealing
with the case handed down their verdict Friday.</P>
      <P>Upon hearing the latest ruling, a tearing Su Chien-ho, one of the trio, said he
will appeal until his name is cleared because he did not do it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD SEEK TO REJOIN U.N. IN MORE PRAGMATIC WAY: KMT HOPEFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing the Republic of China on Taiwan to re-enter the United Nations and
other world bodies is a goal that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)  has long
sought to achieve,  KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>That goal, however, should be pursued in a pragmatic manner with a flexible
strategy, Ma said, adding that using a particular name in the U.N. bid, without
giving thought to the possible consequences, may make people think there are
political motives at work.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to President Chen Shui-bian's announcement earlier this year
that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration will seek to have
Taiwan rejoin the U.N. and other world organizations under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the United States' opposition to the DPP's plans to use a
nationwide referendum to facilitate Taiwan's U.N. bid, Ma said he is not at all
surprised that Washington opposes the DPP plans because the U.S. government has
consistently been opposed to Taiwan's endeavors to join the U.N. under the name
"Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ma said no individual or country has been able to represent Taiwan since 1971
when the ROC was forced to drop out of the U.N. after the U.N. gave the China
seat to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>That was the reason why the KMT, Taiwan's ruling party until 2000, has
ceaselessly sought to enable the ROC to re-enter the U.N., Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that he does not oppose the DPP's pushing for a referendum on
seeking re-entry to U.N. and other world bodies, but believes firmly that the
approach should be pragmatic and flexible, adding that in the end, participation
is what really matters, not the name.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who was once a vice chairman
of the KMT, said he agrees that Taiwan should seek to re-enter the U.N.,  and
that there should be flexibility and negotiations on the name.</P>
      <P>Wang added that the KMT's pushing for a "U.N. referendum" to be held in tandem
with the 2008 presidential election will certainly be conducive to Ma's
election.</P>

      <P>The 22th Forum of Speakers of the Legislative Bodies of the Central American and

Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislative  speakers  from Taiwan's six diplomatic  allies Dominica, El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Panama, and Belize, as well as three vice
speakers, will travel to Taiwan to attend the forum, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The speaker and vice speaker of Costa Rica, which broke off relations with
Taiwan earlier this month,  will not join the conference, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became an observer at the biannual forum in 1999, and first hosted the
forum in Taipei in 2000, Wang noted, saying this is the second time that Taiwan
has organized the event.</P>
      <P>On July 2, Wang is slated to accompany the visiting speakers and vice speakers
to visit President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, followed by a
tour to the Hsinchu Science Park and a journey to Danshui in the northern county
of Taipei later in the evening.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the forum, to be held in Taipei, will help alleviate the mounting
concern that Costa Rica's departure might have a domino effect on Taiwan's
diplomatic allies in Central and Southern America, and that it will further
consolidate Taiwan's bonds of friendship with those countries.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet's referendum review committee turned down Friday the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) initiative to hold a referendum on the
country's bid to apply to the United Nations under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Committee chairman Kao Yung-kuang said the initiative was voted down 12-8
because the majority of committee members found that the initiative is invalid.</P>
      <P>In objecting to the plan, some committee members argued that such a referendum
is unnecessary as pushing for the country's inclusion in the United Nations is a
policy already adopted by the government, according to Kao.</P>
      <P>Other members  mentioned  that the United  Nations  is an organization where
statehood is required for membership and that the country will need to amend its
constitution to change its official name from "Republic of China" to "Republic
of Taiwan" before it can apply to the United Nations under the name "Taiwan, "
Kao said.</P>
      <P>The initiative, sponsored by approximately 90,000 people, was submitted May 21
to the Central Election Commission (CEC) , where it underwent a preliminary
screening.</P>
      <P>The case was then forwarded to the referendum review committee, which held a
hearing June 22, at which DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun was invited to brief the
committee on the initiative.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes to have a referendum on the bid held alongside the 2008
presidential election in order to "make the world aware of Taiwan's 23 million
people's desire to join the United Nations, " despite opposition from the United
States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which failed in its first attempt to gain membership in the WHO under
the name "Taiwan" in May, is planning to apply a similar approach to apply for
U.N. membership in September, despite the almost certain prospect of failure.</P>
      <P>Officials at the U.S. State Department have reiterated that the United States
does not support Taiwan's membership in international organizations that require
statehood and that Washington "opposes any initiative  that appears  designed
to change Taiwan's  status unilaterally, " including a referendum on whether to
apply to the United Nations under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Also, the officials said the planned referendum would appear to run counter to
President Chen Shui-bian's repeated commitments to the United States.</P>
      <P>However, President Chen Shui-bian claims the U.N. bid and referendum plan do not
violate his commitments but are aimed at maintaining the status quo and the
basic human rights of the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged during his 2000 and 2004 inaugural addresses that if China has no
intention of using force against Taiwan, he will not declare Taiwan
independence, will not change the official name of the country,  will  not
include  the "state-to-state"  concept  on cross-Taiwan Strait relations in the
Constitution and will not promote a referendum to change the cross-strait status
quo.</P>

      <P>The seven are: Chen Chi-mai, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential

      <P>The committee  rejected  the DPP-proposed  U.N.  referendum initiative  for  a

    <HEADLINE>`SPECIAL AFFAIRS' TRIAL PROCEEDS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: JUDGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
06/29/07  18:36:22
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The presiding judge handling trial of a case involving alleged misuse of
President Chen Shui-bian's "special affairs funds" ruled Friday that the trial
will proceed in private from now on.</P>
      <P>Tsai Shou-hsun, head of the panel of judges, announced the decision after
President Chen asked the Taipei District Court the day before to return
confidential documents and other records that prosecutors took from his office
to use as evidence in the "special affairs" embezzlement trial in which first
lady Wu Shu-jen is a defendant.</P>
      <P>Chen made the request in a letter addressed to the District Court and the
presiding judge in terms of a constitutional interpretation issued by the
Council of Grand Justices June 15, which confirmed the president's
constitutional right to decide what is a state secret and his right to refuse to
disclose it.</P>
      <P>According to a Presidential Office press statement issued late Thursday, the
documents Chen asked the court to return include invoices he used to justify
reimbursement of expenditure from his "special affairs fund" between January
2000 and June of last year.</P>
      <P>Chen also asked the court to return other documents and data, including
electromagnetic records related to the case, based on his concerns that the
nation's interests and safety could be affected by any leak of information
contained in the files.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors Eric Chen and Chou Shih-yu indicted Wu, along with three former and
incumbent presidential aides, last November on separate charges of embezzlement,
forgery and perjury.</P>
      <P>The indictment accuses Wu of submitting invoices or receipts obtained from other
people to claim reimbursement on a portion of the "special affairs funds" set
aside for the president's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Chen defended the action on the grounds that he had to use other people's
invoices to claim reimbursement from the "special affairs funds" because he used
the money for "secret diplomatic missions."</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office press statement also took issue with what it described
as the court's "failure to protect the confidentiality of the documents, "
saying that the judicial personnel in charge of the case failed to abide by
their promise to keep the evidence from being publicized.</P>
      <P>According to the constitutional interpretation delivered by 13 grand justices
unanimously June 15, the president has the privilege to keep classified
information concerning national security, national defense and diplomacy under
wraps if he determines that disclosure could compromise national interests and
security.</P>
      <P>The grand justices further said that the presidential immunity includes the
right to refuse to give testimony or produce evidence for that purpose in court.
As to information the president has already provided to the court, he can still
declare it to be classified information according to the law and the court
should follow the law regarding classified information when such information is
used in a trial.</P>
      <P>Since the testimony given by the president and the information collected by the
judiciary with regard to the "special affairs fund" case were related to his
exercise  of power granted  by the Constitution, the Presidential Office press
statement said the president is requesting the return of all those documents and
records.</P>
      <P>The district court continued court proceedings Friday, summoning defendants and
witnesses for questioning. As in the past, the wheelchair-bound first lady
applied for leave of absence, citing health reasons.</P>
      <P>A district court spokesman said the panel of judges will decide whether to
return the documents and records to the Presidential Office after listening to
opinions presented by prosecutors and defendants and their lawyers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, presidential candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
reiterated Friday that he has never called for opening Taiwanese jobs to Chinese
workers, and urged his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) rival to stop making
false accusations in this regard.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments during a 40-minute seminar with nearly 100 laborer
representatives to hear from the file and rank.</P>
      <P>In response to local workers' grave concern over whether Chinese workers would
be allowed to work in Taiwan, Ma said that he has never made such a proposal and
urged Frank Hsieh, DPP presidential candidate, not to continue leveling
incorrect charges against him.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the entry of foreign laborers, Ma opined that workers and the
business community should negotiate to find a solution acceptable to both sides.</P>
      <P>"But I have never called for an opening to Chinese workers, " he asserted, then
added, "However, I do agree that Taiwan should catch up with the trends and open
to Chinese tourists now that Taiwanese tourists make some 4 million visits to
China each year."</P>
      <P>"Attracting a large number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan will be one of my
priorities if elected president in the 2008 election, " he said.</P>
      <P>Regarding investment by Taiwanese companies in China, he said that he favors the
free movement of capital, but would impose controls on exports of advanced
technology.</P>
      <P>Ma also reiterated his promise to set up direct transport, trade and postal
links with China, saying that putting such services in place will effectively
help the many Taiwan businessmen traveling between the two sides better overcome
their family, economic and operational difficulties arising from the lack of
such direct links.</P>

      <P>The Paper Windmill Theatre, a local drama group, invited people to join a
performance of its art project called "Art Project for Kids in 319 Townships --
First Mile Kid's Smile" aimed at presenting performances to children in remote
areas financed with donations from the public, an executive of the troupe said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Paper Windmill Culture Foundation held a news conference Thursday to
introduce its recruitment program that invited people aged over 18 willing to
spend two days per month making changes for such children, to sign up for
auditions.</P>
      <P>Former  Premier  Tsai Ying-wen,  National  Youth Commission Chairwoman Cheng Li-
chun and Mandarin Daily News Chief Editor Feng Chi-mei attended the news
conference  to promote the program, initiated by the foundation's executive
director, Lee Yung-feng.</P>
      <P>According to Luo Pei-an, supervisor of the foundation, the troupe started the
project's first performance in Yilan County's Yuanshan township last December
and has staged 29 performances for nearly 56,00 children in just six months.</P>
      <P>The troupe performs when donations to the township for the performance reaches
NT$350,000 (US$10,692) . Children do not pay to see the show, Luo said.</P>
      <P>Without government subsidies, the project relies on donations from the public,
Luo said, adding that the project has already received  donations  of more than
NT$27  million  from  4,384 contributors.</P>
      <P>The troupe also initiated another activity in association with the art project
in which 30 percent of the funds raised at each performance of the troupe are
used to buy copies of the Mandarin Daily News for local schools, in order to
encourage students to read, Luo said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislator urged the government Friday to
closely supervise the operations of four local semiconductor  testing  and
packaging  plants whose investments in low-end products in China were just
approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Loh Chih-ming, together with former presidential adviser Huang Tien-lin and
Taiwan Association of University Professors Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Wen-fu,
made the appeal at a press conference held in Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Loh stressed that it is technically easy for the low-end semiconductor testing
and packaging factories to upgrade to high-end plants, and the government's
opening of low-end IC testing and packaging firms to break into China is giving
the industry a free hand to develop in China.</P>
      <P>Loh suggested that MOEA officials send professionals to attend the four
companies' board meetings in order to further monitor whether there are any
violations of their original investment applications.</P>
      <P>Fan Liang-tung, executive secretary of the MOEA's Investment Commission,  said
MOEA officials will continue supervising the seasonal reports of these firms and
will make investigative tours if necessary.</P>
      <P>The four semiconductor  testing  and packaging  plants  -- Siliconware Precision

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Friday to endorse a public referendum plan on Taiwan's bid to enter the
United Nations proposed by the main opposition party after a government
committee rejected a referendum proposal that the DPP submitted.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Wu Den-yih made the comments to reporters while answering
questions on the issue after a referendum review committee under the Executive
Yuan turned down earlier the same day a public referendum proposal initiated by
the DPP on pursuing U.N. membership for the country in the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP originally proposed to hold the referendum at the same time as the 2008
presidential poll.</P>
      <P>If the DPP identifies itself with the country's official title of Republic of
China, the KMT also welcomes its supporters to endorse the  KMT-proposed
referendum  proposal  calling  for  Taiwan's participation in world bodies and
other international organizations under the name of the ROC, Taiwan or other
feasible titles that ensure successful entry and national dignity, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As long as the Central Election Commission approves the KMT's proposed
referendum on Taiwan's U.N. bid by July 4, the party will proceed with its
referendum plan as scheduled, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition People First Party, an ally of the KMT in the "pan-
blue alliance, " called the committee's rejection of the DPP-driven referendum
proposal on Taiwan's U.N. cause "fair and reasonable, " on the grounds that it
is meaningless to call a referendum on an issue that has already gained a high
degree of national consensus.</P>
      <P>According to PFP spokesman Lee Hung-chun, his party supports the decision by the
Executive Yuan's referendum review committee to turn down the DPP's referendum
plan by a vote of 12-8.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's joining the United Nations is out of the question if cross-Taiwan
Strait relations remain gridlocked, Lee pointed out.</P>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP in the "pan-
green camp, " blasted the referendum committee for rejecting the DPP proposal
and expressed deep regret about the development.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a Legislative Yuan news conference, TSU legislative caucus whip
Tseng Tsahn-deng insinuated that the committee has become a mouthpiece of China,
as its decision conforms to Beijing's long-term objections to Taiwan's entry
into the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Although seven DPP-leaning referendum committee members resigned from  the
committee  after  the decision,  which  they called "unacceptable, " Tseng said
that the TSU will continue promoting a public referendum on Taiwan's pursuit of
U.N.  membership and questioned why its people cannot directly have a say on it,
given that 77 percent of them support the cause.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government's Maokung cable car service in Mucha is slated to be
inaugurated July 4 after evaluation of deficiency improvements, an official al

      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. will begin the service immediately after the
inauguration ceremony, the official said.</P>
      <P>The evaluation committee, comprised of experts and scholars invited by the city
government, examined the cable car system June 14 and listed 16 minor items
requiring improvement.</P>
      <P>The TRTC and the city government's Public Works Department completed the minor
improvements June 23, which were later confirmed by the committee, the official
said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the system is 4.03 km long and has four stations:
Taipei Zoo Station, Taipei Zoo South Station, Chihnan Temple Station, and
Maokung Station. The system will be able to carry 2,000 passengers per hour or
about 20,000 per day.</P>
      <P>Peak hours of the cable car service's upward line are expected to be from 1
p.m.-2 p.m., with peak downhill hours to be from 4 p.m.-5 p.m.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) pledged Friday to appeal against a
decision made earlier that day by the Cabinet's referendum review committee,
which rejected the party's initiative to hold a referendum on the country's bid
to apply to join the United Nations under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said the party will make the move next week in the hope
that the initiative can be approved soon.</P>
      <P>Noting that the initiative is sponsored by more than 90,000 people, Yu described
the referendum review committee's decision as "against democracy" and "against
public opinion."</P>
      <P>Yu claimed the committee turned down the initiative because it is controlled by
pro-Chinese unification members who "identify with China" and "deny Taiwan."</P>
      <P>On U.S. opposition to the referendum plan, Yu claimed that the country's bid to
use the name "Taiwan" to apply for U.N. membership does not involve changing the
country's official name -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Yu said some countries, such as Macedonia, have used names different from their
official titles to join the United Nations and claimed it is against the United
States' founding spirit for Washington to object to the plan.</P>
      <P>Once the appeal is filed, the case will be handled by an appeal review
commission under the Executive Yuan, which is almost certain to reverse the
decision of the referendum review committee, as the appeal review commission is
controlled by the DPP, while the referendum review committee is controlled by
the opposition.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou called Friday
for an objective revelation of historic events, saying that while writing a
history, mankind should refrain from "uglifying or beautifying" the truth.</P>
      <P>Ma, a former KMT chairman, made the remarks in an interview with the Taipei-
based Broadcasting Corporation of China.</P>
      <P>Introducing his new book, "the Spirit of Motherland, " published June 21, Ma
said the book comprises stories of model figures who once lived In Taiwan and
made contributions to the country, as well as significant historic events in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The reason he wrote the book is that he wants to give history its "true face, "
Ma claimed.</P>
      <P>The KMT has been faced with severe criticism over the years resulting from the
228 Incident of 1947 -- a notorious dark chapter in Taiwan's history perpetrated
by the KMT under the leadership of late President Chiang Kai-shek, in which a
popular uprising was brutally crushed by KMT troops.</P>
      <P>Ma said people should not just wipe off all the contributions made by the KMT to
the development of Taiwan because of one incident, or even because of the "white
terror" era following the 228 incident, when the KMT brutally suppressed any
form of political dissent.</P>
      <P>The KMT "made mistakes, " but it also made contributions to the country, Ma
said, adding that he is willing to offer an apology for the incident on the
behalf of the party.</P>
      <P>Citing similar examples in other countries such as Japan, Germany and China, Ma
said Germany has made a good example in atoning for its crimes in World War II,
while Japan has not attempted to do the same for its war crimes, while China has
never appeared even slightly willing to admit to its faults in the bloody
massacre it perpetrated in Tiananmen Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>Compared  with these  acknowledged  perpetrators  of human atrocities on a
massive scale, the KMT has "done something nicely by recognizing its mistakes,"
the former KMT chairman claimed.</P>
      <P>Describing Taiwan people as diligent, pragmatic and very tolerant to people from
overseas, Ma said the Taiwan people welcome everyone only if they come with
sincerity and goodwill.</P>

      <P>Imported Chinese products beat Taiwan's traditional industries with massive
quantities and much cheaper prices, representatives of Taiwan's traditional
industries said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chien Lung-fu, Chairman of the Jih Sheng International Furniture Co., said
Taiwan used to have 60 percent of the domestic market share in the industry, but
said the market share has decreased to 40 percent since Taiwan's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001. China-made furniture have taken over
Taiwan-made products with much cheaper prices due to its low production and
material  costs and the WTO's tariff-free  policy on imported furniture.</P>
      <P>Lee Wen-tzen,  director of Taipei City's bedlinen industry association, said
cotton quilts imported from China with poor quality priced at less than NT$1,000
per piece, has taken away Taiwanese producers' market.</P>
      <P>Yiou To-er, general secretary of the Taiwan Ceramic Industry Association,  said
Taiwan used to have more than 100 ceramic production lines but now has only
about 70 because Taiwan cannot compete with China's massive production of
ceramics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Hosiery Manufacturers' Association Director-General Wei Fang-ta said
nearly 80 percent of the domestic market share previously owned by Taiwanese
manufacturers has been taken over by Chinese products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imposition of provisional anti-dumping tax on imported China-made
towels last year has given Chien, Wei and Lee hopes of seeking help through
appeals for anti-dumping measures on Chinese products.</P>
      <P>However, they were also warned by Yunlin Towel Industrial Technology Development
Director-General Lai Yen-chou that measures taken too late -- such as the
imposition of anti-dumping tax on China-made products -- will still hurt
industries. Lai pointed out that the anti-dumping tax only revived five-eighths
of sales.</P>
      <P>Lee said the government is paying too much attention to big financial groups
instead of caring more about traditional industries. The government took NT$31
billion (US$947 million) of the country's deposit insurance fund to solve a
financial crisis of Taiwan's Chinese Bank at the beginning of this year, Lee
said, adding that the amount could have been used to save at least 80,000 small-
and medium-sized enterprises.</P>

      <P>The government should show more respect for the basic rights of hundreds of
thousands of migrant workers and immigrants in Taiwan, academic and social
groups said in a seminar Friday.</P>
      <P>The government of Taiwan "sees migrants as potential criminals and the cause of
problems, while Canada does not," said Hsia Hsiao-chuan, a professor at Shih-
shin University, at the seminar aimed at sharing Canada's experience in
migrants' rights and community integration.</P>
      <P>There have been a lot of social issues concerning the families of immigrants,
namely foreign spouses, and their second-generation members, and social groups
desperately need help from the government, said Chang Lai-hou, a representative
from the Eden Foundation social welfare group.</P>
      <P>Canada is a country of immigrants, which was why it has always paid great
attention to its immigration law since 1869, the year the law  came  into
effect,  and  to  maintaining  an open  and discrimination-free mentality toward
immigrants, said Ron MacIntosh, Executive Director of the Canadian Trade Office
in Taipei (CTOT). Both Canada and Taiwan look at immigrants as a way to sustain
the economy, but the situations of two countries are different as Canada is a
vast land with small population while Taiwan is a small and densely populated
country with limited resources, MacIntosh said.</P>
      <P>"Canada recognizes the economic contributions of migrant workers. That is its
fundamental difference from Taiwan, which sees migrants as potential criminals
and the cause of problems, " Hsia said, noting that Taiwan has different
treatment for residents and non-residents that is extremely discriminatory.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, migrant workers are excluded from most laws and regulations.  They
are not allowed to transfer employers. The government gives the right to
employers to mistreat migrant workers under the name of `management of migrant
workers', " she added.</P>
      <P>"It is difficult for immigrants to apply for residency. There are too many
barriers for them to acquire citizenship. And they are not allowed to vote and
work. Migrant workers don't have the rights to protest, either," she noted.</P>
      <P>Currently, Canada accepts approximately 200,000 immigrants from all over the
world annually. Half of those are temporary workers who mostly came from the
U.S., Mexico, the Philippines and the Caribbean countries,  said Patricia
Nicoll, Director of CTOT's Visa and Immigration.</P>
      <P>In terms of human trafficking victims, the Canadian government offers Temporary
Resident Permits (TRP) , longer term permits and permanent status options to
protect the victims' rights.</P>
      <P>"What our government needs to understand is that good governance means not only
effective border control but also the protection of basic human rights for non-
citizens, " Hsia said.</P>

      <P>Activities, including a betel nut salesgirl fashion show and an exhibition of

to sell the mildly narcotic and carcinogenic nut -- took place at the venue to
celebrate the opening.</P>
      <P>The six-day exposition, to run through July 4, was organized by the Kaohsiung

      <P>One cannot always be a winner, but sometimes one works harder when he or she
gets rejected by others, Australian 2005 Nobel Prize for medicine laureate Barry
Marshall told hundreds of Taiwanese high school students in a speech Friday.</P>
      <P>Marshall, who concluded a four-day visit to Taiwan Friday, was awarded the Nobel
Prize for medicine in 2005 along with his longtime collaborator Robin Warren for
their discovery of the helicobacter pyroli bacterium and its role in gastritis
and peptic ulcer disease.</P>
      <P>In the one-hour speech, titled "Journey of a Nobel Scientist" and sponsored by
the University of Western Australia, National Taiwan University and Australian
Education International (AEI) , Marshall told the audience how he was "always
interested in shortcuts" during the days when he developed his interest in
science and "not very humble in college" in pointing out professors' mistakes.</P>
      <P>Quoting historian Daniel Boorstin,  he said, "The greatest obstacle to knowledge
is not ignorance, it's the illusion of knowledge."</P>
      <P>Marshall's discovery identified the great majority of gastritis and peptic ulcer
cases, which were previously thought to be chronic infections caused by stress
and dietary factors, as being caused by helicobacter pyroli and curable with
antibiotics.</P>
      <P>His findings were dismissed at first and to prove his theory, he experimented on
himself, ingesting a turbid, foul-tasting solution of helicobacter pyroli.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is very much like me, " he said, referring to what President Chen Shui-
bian told him in a meeting the previous day that Taiwan was also rejected in its
World Health Organization (WHO) full membership bid, which was similar to what
happened to Marshall's bold hypothesis.</P>
      <P>In a 30-minute question-and-answer session after the speech, Marshall interacted
with high school students who mostly came from Taipei City and encouraged them
to always be curious about new things and work hard at "things that interest
you."</P>

      <P>A supercomputer owned by the National Center for High-Performance  Computing
(NCHC)  has been ranked 35th-fastest in the world, a NCHC official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The classification was released at the 2007 International Supercomputing
Conference (ISC) currently held in Dresden, Germany.</P>
      <P>It marks Taiwan's best performance in terms of high performance computing
ability among the top 500 world list, the official said.</P>
      <P>In Asia, Taiwan's high performance computing classification was ahead of China
(43rd) and South Korea (53rd), but lagged far behind Japan (14th), which is
represented by the Tokyo Institute of Technology.</P>
      <P>With its high performance computing capability, the supercomputer of NCHC -- IBM
System Cluster 1350 -- will be open for use by local industrial  and academic
sectors to help accelerate scientific research in meteorological phenomena,
typhoon and flood prediction, energy exploration, medical imaging and
engineering projects.</P>
      <P>The NCHC will for the first time open the supercomputer as a high performance
computing platform for a computing competition of university students later this
year, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA WILL NOT HONOR CASH AID PLEDGES: TAIWAN REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Countries  that switched their diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in
the 90s will find that it is increasingly hard for China to honor the cash aid
it has promised, Taiwan's representative to the United States Joseph Wu claimed
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks were published Friday by the U.S. monthly "The Washington Diplomat,
" which gave large coverage to Beijing's squeezing of Taiwan's diplomatic
relations with other countries.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that Beijing recently lured away Taiwan's diplomatic ally Costa Rica
with US$430 million.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has "been sincere" in assisting Costa Rica's development, the
Central American country has tried to "hide its real intention" in establishing
ties with China, Wu said. "We have the feeling of being betrayed," Wu
complained.</P>
      <P>The report analyzed that Taiwan's official ties with Guatemala and Panama are
also not looking good, as Guatemala President Daniel Ortega, a Marxist,
established diplomatic ties with Cuba, China, North Korea and Vietnam  in the
70s,  and China remains the second-largest user of Panama Canal after the United
States.</P>
      <P>Wu admitted that although there is no sign of a domino effect on Taiwan's
diplomatic relations with other countries, he said the Taiwan authorities are
concerned about China's "cash diplomacy" targeting its diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan offers aid to diplomatic allies, not cash but service and development, "
Wu claimed, adding that Taiwan extends agricultural, medical and economic
development assistance to diplomatic allies in accordance with their needs.</P>
      <P>Noting that China still has a poverty problem in some parts of the country, Wu
claimed that the more it "buys" Taiwan's diplomatic allies, the more financial
burden it suffers.</P>
      <P>Regarding U.S.-Taiwan ties, Wu said that although the countries maintain no
official relations, the United States is the most important friend of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan will order a probe into share transfers of the Taipei-based
Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) next Wednesday, government spokesman
Shieh Jyh-wey said Friday.</P>
      <P>Accusing the National Communications  Commission  (NCC)  of dereliction of duty
and illegally helping BCC new owner Jaw Shau- kong to chalk up illicit earnings,
Shieh said the Executive Yuan will submit the case with evidence July 4 to the
prosecution, and Jaw, along with NCC members, will be subject to investigation.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the alleged NCC members will be suspended from
their posts, Hsieh said the Executive Yuan has not yet to made a final decision
on the issue as it is still compiling evidence against them.</P>
      <P>Hsieh accused Jaw of setting up four dummy companies with suspicious funds in
order to purchase the BCC shares from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
-affiliated Hua Hsia Investment Holdings Co., which was in charge of managing
the KMT's assets.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Jaw's dummy companies were opened to avoid a government
regulation that "a natural person is banned from holding more than 10 percent of
a broadcasting company's stocks."</P>
      <P>Hsieh also accused the NCC of failing to carry out its duties, as the commission
stamped its approval for the BCC share transfer to Jaw without carrying out
substantial scrutiny of Jaw's funds and his four companies.</P>
      <P>"The NCC has apparently committed malfeasance in an attempt to help Jaw rack up
illegal profits," Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, three lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lodged a suit against five NCC members with the Taiwan High Prosecutors'
Office on charges of illegally allowing Jaw to profiteer by approving the BCC
share transfer. "The five men are accomplices of Jaw," they argued.</P>
      <P>In response to the lawsuit, the NCC issued a statement Friday urging political
figures to stop "groundlessly defaming" and "rashly" taking legal action against
others, claiming that such behavior "only expose their ignorance about the
highly professional case and their ambition to meddle in freedom of speech
enjoyed by media outlets."</P>
      <P>"All political figures must assume political responsibility for distributing
groundless accusations," the NCC said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Justices Limit the Use of Race in School Plans for Integration

With competing blocs of justices claiming the mantle of Brown v. Board of
Education, a bitterly divided Supreme Court declared Thursday that public school
systems cannot seek to achieve or maintain integration through measures that
take explicit account of a students race.

Voting 5 to 4, the court, in an opinion by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.,
invalidated programs in Seattle and metropolitan Louisville, Ky., that sought to
maintain school-by-school diversity by limiting transfers on the basis of race
or using race as a tiebreaker for admission to particular schools.

Wall Street Journal:A Shift in Dining Scene Nicks a Once-Hot Chain

On a visit to Marietta, Ga., last fall, TJ Palmer stopped into an Applebee's and
ordered a bruschetta burger. "I didn't like it at all," she ays. After having
visited the restaurant chain regularly for years, Ms. Palmer says, she rarely
goes anymore. "It doesn't have anything that would make me want to come back."

Applebee's was once one of the country's hottest restaurant chains, but today it
faces falling profits, a lagging stock and restless investors. In a business

      <P>Fugitive Taiwanese tycoon Wang You-theng remains in detention at an immigration
holding center in San Pedro, California, awaiting the conclusion of a legal
procedure regarding his illegal entry into the United States earlier this year,
a Taiwan official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, Taiwan's representative to the United States, said his office has
very limited information about Wang's case because judicial cases are not open
to the public in the United States.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks when asked about reports that Wang, founder of the Rebar
Asia Pacific Group, might be released from the holding center in July.</P>
      <P>Wang has been detained by U.S. immigration authorities since Feb. 2, when he
tried to return to Los Angeles with both his Republic of China and Dominican
Republic passports canceled, following a failed attempt to flee to Myanmar via
Singapore.</P>
      <P>Wang is suspected of having embezzled billions of dollars in corporate funds
from the group before fleeing with his wife, Wang Chin She-ying, to China late
last year and then to the United States in January this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities placed the couple on the country's most-wanted list Jan. 15
and have been seeking U.S. assistance to have them repatriated back to Taiwan to
face charges.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwanese prosecutors indicted Wang and 106 others involved in the
Rebar Group scandal on a long list of charges, including fraud, money laundering
and insider trading, and are seeking a prison sentence of 30 years and an
unprecedented fine of NT$1.71 billion (US$52.13 million) for Wang.</P>
      <P>Fang Hsiao-wei, a practicing lawyer in Los Angeles, told the Central News Agency
that the results of Taiwan's judicial trial over the Rebar Group scandal will be
crucial to how long Wang will remain in the holding center.</P>
      <P>Fang said based on his experience in handling immigration cases, Wang should
have applied for permanent residency in the United States through his wife or
children who hold U.S. citizenship.</P>
      <P>However, the U.S. immigration authorities are not expected to approve Wang's
application immediately but will await the outcome of his trial, Fang said,
adding that the application can be rejected if Wang is convicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CROSS-STRAIT COMMON MARKET' WILL BRING DISASTER: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that if the opposition Kuomintang's
(KMT's) advocacy of a "cross-strait common market" is put into practice, it will
mark the beginning of a disaster for the nation.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while touring Inotera Memories Inc., a joint
venture between Taiwan's Nanya Technology Corp. and Qimonda AG of Germany that
manufactures computer memory, in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that with nine months to go before the presidential election next
year, Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT presidential candidate, has begun to promote the
campaign platform of a "'92 consensus" and the "cross-strait common market."</P>
      <P>Chen said that in view of the experience of other countries, the cross-strait
common market" will mean the free flow of personnel, products and capitals
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If such a market is established, Chinese laborers will be introduced into
Taiwan, China's agriculture produce will flood Taiwan market, and Taiwan's
capital will take flight to China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"This will lead to massive losses of jobs, decreased wages for laborers, poorer
farmers and the speeding-up of the hollowing-out of the industry," he claimed.</P>
      <P>"The cross-strait common market will mark the beginning of disaster, as Taiwan
will be economically swallowed up by China, " the president said.</P>
      <P>He also took issue with Ma's advocacy of turning Taiwan into a "free trade
zone."</P>
      <P>The president said Taiwan is a "sovereign and independent" country, and not a
local government or special administrative region of any other country.</P>
      <P>"The 'one China market," coupled with the 'free trade zone,' will downgrade
Taiwan into an outlying free trade zone of China, " the president said.</P>
      <P>The president also dismissed the so-called "'92 consensus, " which the KMT
claimed is an agreement reached between Taipei and Beijing in 1992 that allows
the two sides to have different interpretations of the meaning of "one China,"
saying that it was "non-existent." The KMT was still in power in 1992.</P>
      <P>"The fact is that both sides of the Taiwan Strait reached an agreement on 'one
China, ' but have not reached a conclusion on "different interpretations," he
added.</P>
      <P>He criticized the KMT for using the "cross-strait common market " and the "'92
consensus" to cover up its true intention of giving up the "national
sovereignty" of Taiwan and paving the way for the eventual unification between
the both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Fruit traders estimate that exports of Taiwan-grown Irwin mangos to South Korea
will jump 150 percent over the 2006 level, after recent hot sales of the
tropical fruit in that country, Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Irwin mango, known as "Apple Mango" in Japan, has become more and more
popular in South Korea since it was first exported there four years ago. Sales
have increased year after year, with the price of the fruit tagged at around
5,000 won apiece -- the equivalent of NT$180 -- much higher than the price in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To further boost sales, the TAITRA recently organized a series of promotional
activities with the cooperation of several major Korean traders at supermarkets
and department stores in that country. During the nine-day promotion, a total of
120 tons of Irwin mangos were shipped from Taiwan to the neighboring country,
TAITRA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the TAITRA, Japan and South Korea are two major markets for Taiwan-
produced mangos. In 2006 the exports to Japan amounted to nearly 430 tons, while
those to South Korea reached over 150 tons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REFERENDUM COMMITTEE ACCUSED OF DEFYING PUBLIC OPINION</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of several civic groups accused the Cabinet's referendum review
committee of defying public opinion Saturday over its rejection of an initiative
raised by the ruling party to hold a referendum on the country's bid to apply to
join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The groups, including the Taiwan Society, the Taiwan North Society and the
Taiwan United Nations Alliance (TAIUNA) , suggested that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) file for an interpretation  by  the  Council  of  Grand
Justices  on the constitutionality  of  the  committee,  which  is composed  of
representatives of various political parties in proportion to the number of
seats the parties hold in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Stressing that using the name "Taiwan" to join the United Nations is the only
choice for the country, members of the groups criticized the committee's
decision as "contrary to democracy" and made in defiance of the will of 77
percent of the people who are in favor of the referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Chin Heng-wei, vice president of the Taiwan North Society, it is
not feasible for the country to apply to rejoin the United Nations under the
name "Republic of China, " whose U.N. seat was replaced by the People's Republic
of China in 1971.</P>
      <P>To counter the decision by the committee, Chin proposed that President Chen
Shui-bian initiate a referendum on the U.N. bid using his right to call
referendums on issues of "national security concern, " which are not required to
obtain the committee's approval.</P>
      <P>Lo Jung-kuang, secretary-general of the TAIUNA, said it is unfair that Taiwan's
23 million people should be excluded from the world body and he urged opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou not to block the DPP-
promoted U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the opposition-controlled committee voted down 12-8 the DPP-sponsored
initiative calling for a referendum on the country's bid to apply to join the
United Nations under the name of "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In objecting to the plan, some committee members argued that such a referendum
is unnecessary as pushing for the country's inclusion in the United Nations is a
policy already adopted by the government.</P>
      <P>Other members  mentioned  that the United  Nations  is an organization where
statehood is required for membership and that the country will need to amend its
constitution to change its official name from "Republic of China" to "Republic
of Taiwan" before it can apply to the United Nations under the name "Taiwan."
The DPP is planning to appeal the committee' ruling next week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. BID UNDER NAME 'TAIWAN' AIMS TO SAFEGUARD STATUS QUO: ENVOY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative to the United States Joseph Wu said Friday that
President Chen Shui-bian's plan to promote a referendum on the country's bid to
join the United Nations under the name "Taiwan" is aimed at safeguarding the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During a speech delivered to a group of American academic and trade
representatives, as well as Taiwanese expatriates living in Los Angeles, Wu said
that the Taiwanese people want to join the U.N. under the name "Taiwan", which
is not a move to change the status quo across the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the proposal does not violate his former commitment to U.S.
government, and has nothing to do with changing Taiwan's official designation.</P>
      <P>Wu said President Chen Shui-bian made a "four noes" pledge in his 2000 inaugural
speech that so long as China has no intention of using military force against
Taiwan, he will not declare independence, will not change the national title or
flag, will not hold referendum on "independence  versus unification"  and will
not enshrine  the "state-to-state" theory in the constitution to define cross-
Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Under the premise, Wu said the plan to hold a referendum on the bid to join U.N.
as "Taiwan" should not be regarded as a move to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>Noting that the world community is using the term "Taiwan" in documents related
to the island, Wu said even an order that the American government gave its
administrative branch in 2001 stipulated that "Taiwan" is the most appropriate
term to mention this place and its government.</P>
      <P>In related news, Wu said he will greet Vice President Annette Lu in Los Angeles
when she makes a transit stop in the city en route to her Latin American tour
earlier next month, and the reception will be in accordance with the formality
agreed upon between the governments of Taiwan and the United States.</P>

Taiwan's representative to the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lu is scheduled to make an overnight transit stop in San Francisco en route to
Latin America next month and take part in some private activities at her hotel
during her stay in the U.S. city, according to Joseph Wu.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan after the Latin American visit, Lu will make a four-
hour transit stop in Los Angeles, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Lu is scheduled to depart July 2 from Taiwan for the visit covering three of the
country's diplomatic allies, namely the Dominican Republic, Paraguay and
Guatemala. The vice president is expected to return to Taiwan July 14.</P>
      <P>In January, Chen also made an overnight transit stop in San Francisco en route
to Nicaragua and stopped over in Los Angeles on his way home.</P>
      <P>While in San Francisco, Chen met with American Institute in Taiwan Chairman
Raymond Burghardt and former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, and had

    <HEADLINE>MOFA REGRETS OUTGOING REPRESENTATIVE'S CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday that it regretted criticism
of the government by its outgoing representative to Singapore, which it
described as an act "incompatible with the duty of a diplomatic personnel."</P>
      <P>MOFA acting spokeswoman Yeh Fei-bi said Hu Wei-jen put himself above the
interests of the nation, and that the ministry will "begin to review the
matter."</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks after Hu said in a recent interview with Singapore's Lianhe
Zaobao that he didn't see eye-to-eye to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's policy to "cut links with China" and its drive to remove
statues of former President Chiang Kai-shek in a bid to shed the last vestiges
of the authoritarian rule under Chiang.</P>
      <P>This is why he has decided to end his 35-year career as a public servant, Hu
told the Chinese-language newspaper.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the stance of the ministry is that Hu, while serving as Taiwan's top
representative to Germany and Singapore, has sometimes expressed personal views
at the expense of national interest.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hu is still a representative to Singapore, the ministry regretted
that he has made such "improper remarks, " Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Hu is the oldest son of General Hu Tsung-nan, one of Chiang Kai-shek's
commanders. Hu formerly served in the MOFA and as a deputy director of National
Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>Hu assumed his current post in June 2005. He was informed that he should prepare
to step down in April. He is scheduled to return to Taiwan July 2. He has told
the CNA that he will travel to the United States in September to serve as a
visiting scholar at Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, lawmakers reacted along party lines to Hu's remarks.</P>
      <P>Both KMT Legislator John Chiang, a grandson of the late president, and People
First Party Legislator Daniel Hwang, expressed admiration for Hu for his courage
in expressing his views.</P>
      <P>But DPP Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim and Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Ying
Ling-ying said that stepping up the Taiwan-centric consciousness has become a
political mainstay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If Hu cannot identify with the Taiwan-centric consciousness and cannot serve
that cause, it may be better for him to leave at an earlier date," Hsiao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINIMUM WAGE HIKE TO COME INTO EFFECT SUNDAY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has worked out five measures to help mitigate
the impact on small- and medium-sized enterprises as the 9.09 percent minimum
wage hike is set to put into practice Sunday.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced earlier this month that the minimum wage
will be raised to NT$17.280 (US$523) per month while the hourly wage will be
NT$95.</P>
      <P>About 1.41 million "marginal" members of the country's workforce -- including
foreign laborers, part-time workers, senior citizens who have returned to the
employment market after retirement and female workers -- are expected to benefit
from the wage hike.</P>
      <P>To offset the expected negative impact, the CLA has decided to subsidize owners
of certain businesses, including fast-food chains, restaurants, supermarkets and
gas stations, with a working staff of less than 50 people. The owners will be
entitled to subsidies of NT$10 per hour per head when the staff members work
less than 32 hours a week. This subsidy incentive will be implemented for one
year on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>The CLA has also decided to offer subsidies of NT$5,000 per month per head to
owners of companies which employ disadvantaged workers, including physically and
mentally challenged people and senior citizens.</P>
      <P>To deal with the possibility that many workers may lose their jobs because of
the hike in the minimum hourly wage, the CLA will also work to help
disadvantaged workers in three-prong way by helping them find employment,
receive vocational training and unemployment subsidies.</P>
      <P>The food and accommodation allowance provided to foreign laborers working in
Taiwan is raised from the current NT$4,000 per month to NT$5,000.</P>
      <P>CLA vocational training subsidies will also be raised as the fifth measure to
deal with the impact of the hike in the minimum wage, which had remained
unchanged since 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST CHAIN CAFES HAVE SECONDHAND SMOKE, NOISE PROBLEMS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>

      <P>Most coffee chain stores in metropolitan Taipei were found to be unhealthy, with
many being smoky or noisy, or their  coffee  products  coming  with  creamer
containing health-threatening trans fat, according to a survey conducted by the
Common Health monthly journal.</P>
      <P>The survey of LOHAS, or Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability, was conducted
between May 25 and June 8 on eight large cafe chains in Taipei, including
McCafe, Dante Coffee, IS Coffee, Barista Coffee, Mr. Brown Coffee, Ikari Coffee,
Starbucks Coffee and Doutor Coffee. The survey results were released Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, whether or not the establishment had banned smoking was the
leading indicator in determining whether a healthy dining environment was
provided, according to the magazine. The survey shows that of the eight cafe
chains, only Starbucks and MaCafe adopted a comprehensive "no-smoking" ban,
while Mr. Brown allows smoking in semi-open spaces on its smoking floor separate
from its non-smoking customers.</P>
      <P>As for Doutor, IS, Ikari and Dante, the survey found that they enclosed a
smoking zone in the innermost corners of their shops. Such measures ultimately
allow harmful tobacco smoke cover the entire shop, said Han Po-cheng, a
professor at Taipei Medical University who was invited to review the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Noise was also found a problem. A Common Health senior reporter, Hsieh Hsiao-
yuan, said that within the cafes music was often found to be too loud to allow
customers to talk with each other in a normal voice.</P>
      <P>At some coffee shops, Hsieh said they measured sound levels at 65-76 decibels.
They commented that sound occasionally exceeding 70 decibles is disturbing and
unpleasant to humans.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that meals in urban coffee shops mostly contain vegetables
insufficient for a person's daily needs.</P>
      <P>Regarding environmental protection, only Starbucks and Ikari were found to
encourage customers to bring their own cups by providing coffee at a discount.</P>
      <P>In general,  the poll showed that Starbucks has the best no-smoking spaces,
while Mr. Brown has the most comfortable space for customers, and Ikari provides
the greatest variety in meals. All of the investigated cafe chains, excluding
Starbucks, were advised to strengthen their measures on environmental protection
and energy saving.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Public Television Service (PTS) signed a collaboration memorandum at a
press conference Saturday with French-German public television station ARTE for
program exchanges and further cooperation in the future.</P>
      <P>ARTE, the first transnational public television station in Europe, which was
launched in 1992, serves as a great model for PTS as it has been devoting most
of its energy to culture and arts during its 15-year existence, winning
accolades and becoming "the hope of television industry, " said PTS President Hu
Yuan-huei before signing the memo with ARTE President Jerome Clemente.</P>
      <P>"The ARTE experience" taught Taiwanese media valuable lessons in many ways,
including television production, cultural diversity and reconciliation, Hu
added.</P>
      <P>ARTE, which boasts a NT$ 16 billion annual budget that comes exclusively from
the French and German governments, had set from the beginning its goal to
promote arts and culture, especially European culture, and encourage viewers to
understand "how very different we are, and how similar at the same time, " said
Clemente.</P>
      <P>The birth of ARTE symbolized the reconciliation of Germany and France, which
have fought each other for over a century, said Patricia Kortmann, Art/Event
Coordinator of German Cultural Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Jean-Claude Poimboeuf, Director of French Institute in Taipei, also pointed out
that the creation of ARTE has been a small part of the European integration, and
revealed just how large the scale of European integration is, and how hard
Europe has tried to achieve unity.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien credited ARTE for its success in developing
young film directors through funding and collaboration and hoped that the same
efforts could be made at PTS, which has been collaborating with local young
directors and making great efforts in promoting documentaries.</P>
      <P>"Interaction between film makers and television during the collaboration process
is still not running smoothly, but it isn't easy, and it has taken a lot for PTS
to make it this far, "Hou said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's annual travel market is worth an estimated NT$340 billion (US$10.37
billion) , with nearly 71 percent of respondents to a recent survey saying they
travel to relieve stress, pollsters said upon the release of their extensive
research Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Global Views Monthly journal to explore local
people's travel activities and preferences.  The telephone poll targeted
residents between the ages of 20 and 60 in all 23 cities and counties on Taiwan
proper.</P>
      <P>A total of 815 valid samples were collected in the survey conducted from June
12-14. Among the randomly chosen respondents, 747 have made overnight domestic
leisure trips in the past three years and 392 have made overseas pleasure trips
during the same period. The poll has a confidence level of 95 percent.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's demographic map, the number of citizens aged between 20 and 60 is
about 9.38 million. Of them, 66 percent have made leisure trips either at home
or abroad, or both, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Extrapolating from the findings of the survey, including duration of their
journeys and average spending, pollsters estimate the value of Taiwan's annual
travel market at NT$340.2 billion.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 70.9 percent of the respondents said they define the
most important function of travel as "rest and relieving of stress, " while only
33.7 percent cite "broadening knowledge horizons and gaining a better
understanding of the world" as the top purpose of travel.</P>
      <P>As to what makes an ideal trip, 95.7 percent said an ideal tour package should
allow for "full mental and physical relaxation"; 94.2 percent said ideal
pleasure trips should be "slow-paced and not hectic"; while only 8.6 percent
said an ideal tour package should include as many tour destinations or tourist
attractions as possible.</P>
      <P>By age, more than 60 percent of those aged between 40 and 60 said fine-quality
meals and lodging are key elements that make for an ideal trip, while only 38
percent of those aged between 25 and 29 cited fine-quality meals and lodging as
important elements.</P>
      <P>The survey also found taht nearly 70 percent said they prefer to take part in
package tours organized by travel agencies, but 16.8 percent said they prefer
"half self-help" travel, with travel agencies reserving air tickets and hotel
rooms for them; and another 11.2 percent said they most like to go backpacking.</P>
      <P>Among young adults, referring to those aged between 20 and 24, 37 percent said
they don't like package tours organized by travel agenices and would only go
backpacking or conduct "half self-help" tours.</P>

      <P>National  Police  Agency  (NPA) Director-General Hou Yu-ih, at the head a team
of nearly 500 police officers from around the country, joined in a triathlon
Saturday on the Sun Moon Lake in the central county of Nantou.</P>
      <P>The 15th "Uni-President Enterprises Cup" Triathlon, sponsored by the Uni-
Presidential  Enterprises Corp.,  Taiwan's largest food company, kicked off at
the Ita Thao Pier on the scenic lake. The two-day event drew 3,420 athletes,
making for the most crowded field of participants since the annual event began
in 1992.</P>
      <P>Hou said the NPA has been encouraging police officers to join the triathlon
because the sport, consisting of swimming, cycling and running over various
distances, matches regular police training routines. But it's not important for
the police athletes to win the game, only that they complete the race, he added.</P>
      <P>Hou and Nantou County Magistrate Lee Chao-chin both attended the Saturday
competition, which is comprised of a 750 m swim, 20 km bike ride, and 5 km foot
race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAKKA GROUPS TO RALLY IN TAIPEI TO PUSH FOR 'HSIEH-YEH' PAIRING</HEADLINE>

      <P>Hakka celebrities will rally at 228 Peace Park in downtown Taipei Sunday to drum
up support for former Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan to become the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP's)  vice presidential  candidate,  organizers said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The rally will be jointly organized by major Hakka groups, Taiwan Hakkas
Association, the Hakkas Association for Public Affairs in Taipei and
associations of Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli natives residing in Taipei City as
well as grassroots Hakka organizations in Taipei City and Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The DPP has nominated former Premier Frank Hsieh as its candidate for the 2008
presidential election. According to the DPP tradition, Hsieh is free to pick his
running mate.</P>
      <P>But divergent views on the pairing-up issues are rife within party ranks and
among DPP supporters. While some people like to see Hsieh pick his strongest
rival in the DPP presidential primary fray -- former Premier Su Tsen-chang -- as
his running mate, others, particularly DPP Hakka members, expect Hsieh to team
up with Yeh, a female Hakka politician.</P>
      <P>Hsieh has been tight-lipped on his preferred choice, saying that premature
exposure and imprudent handling of the issue could bring confusions and even
draw backlash.</P>
      <P>Yeh herself never hides her keen expectations for the DPP to nominate a Hakka to
be its vice presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who served as acting mayor of the southern port city of Kaohsiung for more
than a year after Hsieh was transferred to serve as premier in early 2005,
campaigned hard for Hsieh in the run-up to the DPP's presidential primary in
early May. She has said on several occasions that if Hsieh offers to pick her as
his running mate, she would not hesitate to accept it.</P>
      <P>Yeh said nothing else than picking  a Hakka as its vice presidential candidate
can better manifest how serious and sincere th DPP is in heeding Hakka people's
expectations and desires.</P>
      <P>Yeh will attend Sunday's rally, but Hsieh himself cannot attend because of his
busy schedule, organizers said.</P>
      <P>Hakka is Taiwan's second largest ethnic group, accounting for about 21 percent
of its total population. So far, there have not been a Hakka president or vice
president in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At Sunday's rally, organizers said, the head of the Taiwan Hakkas Association
will present a shouldering pole to Yeh to symbolize all Hakka people's
expectations for her to shoulder the responsibilities of leading Taiwan to a
brighter future and allowing Hakka people a greater say in national affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIR FORCE EXPRESSES CONCERN TO U.S. OVER RADAR BUDGET MISUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air Force Headquarters has formed a special task force to audit budget
appropriation for an advanced radar system installation project and has
expressed serious concern to U.S. military authorities over relevant budget
misuse, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Air Force officer made the remarks after the United Daily News reported
earlier in the day that budget for the long-range early-warning radar system
procurement project has been misused by the U.S. side.</P>
      <P>According  to the report,  Raytheon Co.,  the manufacturer contracted by the
U.S. military to build the new radar system for Taiwan, has commissioned a local
helicopter company to transport construction materials and relevant equipment to
an Air Force base in remote mountainous region in northern county of Hsinchu,
known as Loshan Base.</P>
      <P>The report said even though the helicopter company has not airlifted any
material or equipment to Loshan Base during the period from late last year to
May this year, it managed to get US$700,000 in monthly payment from the U.S.
contractor. According to the report, the Air Force's radar budget has so far
been misappropriated by more than NT$100 million.</P>
      <P>The report further said that because of a legislative budget cut, the radar
system procured by the Air Force has been changed from a long-range, early-
warning one to a new surveillance type with a shorter detection range.</P>
      <P>In response, the Air Force officer said that as mountain roads linking Loshan
base to other parts of Hsinchu County have often been damaged by torrential
rains, U.S. military commissioned the local helicopter firm to transport
building materials late last year. But airborne transportation work has often
been affected by poor weather conditions and other factors, such as protests by
residents over helicopter noise.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, the officer said, the U.S. side didn't formally begin
airlifting work until April this year. However, Raytheon has continued to pay
the helicopter firm with funds from Taiwan. The officer said the Air Force has
on many occasions expressed concerns to U.S. military authorities and has
stepped up budget auditing work, adding that the Air Force task force will also
tighten monitoring of progress in the project to prevent any further delay.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:In Shift, Justices Agree to Review Detainees Case

The United States Supreme Court reversed course yesterday and agreed to hear
claims of Guantanamo detainees that they had a right to challenge their
detention in American courts.

The decision, announced in a brief order released yesterday morning, set the
stage for a legal battle that could shape debates in the Bush administration
about how to close the detention center, which has become a lightning rod for
international criticism.

Wall Street Journal:China Launches Public Response To Safety Outcry

China is showing the first signs of fighting back against an avalanche of
criticism and new restrictions based on safety concerns about its exports. But
Beijing's task is made more difficult by both its awkwardness in the public-
relations game and the increasingly hostile political environment in Washington.

Beijing's campaign illustrates how worried the Chinese are that the "Made in
China" label not be tarnished further by the controversies over the safety of
its products. In the first four months of the year, China shipped more than $95
billion of goods, or about 20% of its total exports, to the U.S., making the
American export market a key plank in the country's overall economic strategy.</TEXT>
