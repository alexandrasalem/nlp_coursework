    <HEADLINE>Android will top smartphone market in 2011: researchers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Google Inc.'s Android operating system is expected to take the biggest share of
the smartphone market next year on the back of growing interest from consumers
and handset vendors, local researchers said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Shipments of smartphones running the Android system, which are forecast to rank
in second place this year with 58.45 million units sold, will top the market in
2011 with an estimated 29.7 percent share, according to an e-mail statement from
Luke Lin, an analyst and project manager of Digitimes Research, an industry
tracking company.</P>
      <P>Nokia's Symbian will slide to second place with 28 percent of the market share,
followed by Apple Inc.'s iOS with 16.7 percent, RIM's BlackBerry with 14 percent
and Microsoft's Windows with 5.1 percent, according to a report issued that same
day by Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>Despite problems of diverse system versions and patent right lawsuits, Google
still attracts smartphone makers wishing to launch various under-US$100 models,
making Android likely to reach the top spot a year earlier than a previous
forecast in 2009, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Joey Yen,  a market  analyst  of PCs and peripherals  at International Data
Corp. Taiwan, said in a telephone interview with CNA that the Android system
will grow rapidly in 2011 because developers are more willing to produce
applications for the platform due to its open source and low license fees.</P>
      <P>Moreover, consumers and vendors are getting more interested in the phones.</P>
      <P>"With the increasing number of products and rising awareness of the Android
system, consumers and vendors have become more confident in them," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Doctors explain why KMT official's son's wounds healing so fast</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Doctors said Tuesday that as there was no major tissue damage caused by the Nov.
26 gunshot wound to Sean Lien, the son of Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman
Lien Chan, it was reasonable that he had started taking food and that his face
was no longer swollen.</P>
      <P>Lien was shot on the eve of the municipal elections while stumping for a city
councilor candidate, but his speedy recovery has fanned rumors that the whole
drama might have been staged.</P>
      <P>He was moved from an intensive care unit to a regular ward at National Taiwan
University Hospital a day earlier after doctors determined that he was out of
danger.</P>
      <P>Chou Tsung-tuo, an experienced gunshot wound specialist at the Tri-Services
General Hospital, said Lien was "extremely lucky" in that major tissue in the
mouth and throat was not damaged by the bullet.</P>
      <P>At first, the victim's face would certainly be so swollen that he might not be
able even to open his eyes, Chou said. But, he added, the facial wounds would
recover soon and it would be reasonable to see the swelling recede in three
days.</P>
      <P>NTU Hospital doctors said Lien's face was still a bit swollen under the right
eye and that it would take at least two weeks for the swelling to completely
disappear.</P>
      <P>They said the left side of his face was less damaged than the right and that he
was able to chew on the left side of his mouth.</P>
      <P>Wei Kuo-chen, chief of neurosurgery at the Chang Gung Hospital in Linkou, used
the word "miracle" to describe how lucky Lien was to have escaped major injury.</P>
      <P>It is exactly  because  of this  "miraculous"  luck  that pro-opposition
Democratic Progressive Party pundits suspect that the KMT or its sympathizers
might have manufactured or choreographed the shooting.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin has claimed that organized crime rings "really could
have staged the incident for the sake of winning a gamble."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is planning to establish
a think tank to help formulate its China policy and improve the party's
engagement with China, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The DPP welcomes any form of dialogue with China as long as no prerequisites are
set, Tsai said in a briefing for foreign media three days after her defeat in
the Nov. 27 municipality mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP secured just two of the five municipalities but won more of the popular
votes than its rival, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Tsai also highlighted the party's progress in the city council elections that
took place alongside the mayoral elections, as the DPP won as many seats on the
five city councils as the KMT, with both parties tied at 130.</P>
      <P>The DPP plans to spend several months discussing its China policy, which will be
a part of the party's "10 year platform" covering a wide range of issues, she
said, although she did not set a timetable.</P>
      <P>The DPP's new China policy under Tsai is greatly anticipated, as she has been
trying to move the party more to the middle and appeal to moderate voters after
its previous hardline stance earned it an "anti-China" label.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who received more than a million votes in the Xinbei City mayoral election
but lost to the KMT's Eric Liluan Chu, said the funding for the think tank will
come from her election subsidy of more than NT$30 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH launches safe sex campaign in night club</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang visited a night club
Tuesday evening to distribute condoms to young people in a campaign against HIV
and AIDS.</P>
      <P>"The idea of launching the campaign in a club came to mind because the ratio of
HIV carriers aged between 15 to 24 is on the rise in Taiwan, " said Yaung,
adding that as much as 90 percent of the infections are caused by unsafe sex.</P>
      <P>Admitting that he had never been to a club before and that he was uncomfortable
with the loud music, Yaung said he came to help young people establish a better
understanding of the disease that they can be so easily exposed to.</P>
      <P>"Aside from advocating the use of condoms to prevent AIDS, I also want to tell
HIV carriers that they can still lead healthy and normal lives, " said Yaung as
he hugged "Piaochung, " a muscular man who was infected 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Wearing a big smile, "Piaochung" said confidently that he has traveled to Hawaii
three times in the past five years. "My friends and colleagues often ask me
whether it is true that I have AIDS or if I am just faking," he laughed.</P>
      <P>Noting the government's support for AIDS patients, Yaung said that advanced
drugs for treating AIDS are covered by national health insurance and that there
is therefore no need for people who test HIV-positive to panic and fall into
depression.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control under the DOH, as
of the end of October, there were 19,735 Taiwanese HIV carriers, of which 3,000
were reported to have died. The highest concentration of HIV carriers by age was
in the 20-29 age bracket (38.1 percent) followed by those in the 30-39 age group
(35.2 percent).</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP members trade barbs over 2012 presidential candidate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have begun
trading barbs over how to select a candidate for the 2012 presidential race
after it secured only two out of five seats in Saturday's municipality
elections.</P>
      <P>While urging the party to start discussing the issue as soon as possible, former
DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun argued that incumbent DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen
should not have to step down to take responsibility for the election results.</P>
      <P>He contended that Tsai should stay and continue leading the DPP, as the outcome
of elections shows that it performed better than the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in
terms of ballots garnered.</P>
      <P>"Although Tsai herself lost the race in Xinbei City, the DPP, however, fought a
surprising battle under her leadership by gaining the support of half of
Taiwan's voters," Yu said.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Tsai has succeeded in getting the ballots of the youth, women
and swing voters. "She helped the party find new voters and created a new way of
fighting an electoral battle," he said.</P>
      <P>The heads of the DPP's local branches in Taipei and Taoyuan counties, as well as
younger DPP lawmakers, echoed Yu's view and asked Tsai not to quit because of
her Xinbei City defeat.</P>
      <P>The DPP lost in Taipei City, Xinbei City and Taichung City, but won in Tainan
and Kaohsiung by large margins.</P>
      <P>The party grabbed 49.87 percent of the total ballots cast, while the KMT secured
44.54 percent.</P>
      <P>Given the election results, many supporters urged Tsai and former Premier Su
Tseng-chang, who was defeated by KMT incumbent Mayor Hau Lung-bin in Taipei
City, to vie for the party's nomination to run in the next presidential
election.</P>
      <P>In response to calls for her to run for president in 2012, Tsai replied that she
will consider it, but she also made it clear that she will continue leading the
DPP.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some of the party's old guard, such as Legislator Chai Trong-rong and
former Vice President Annette Lu, are opposed to the idea and said Tsai should
opt for just one of the positions.</P>
      <P>Lu said in a recent interview on local cable TV that she is opposed to a failed
candidate representing the party in the 2012 presidential race.</P>

      <P>A proposed investment protection agreement between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will not be set up like a framework agreement, the minister of economic
affairs said Tuesday amid media reports of the signing of a framework agreement
to come before the formation of the formal pact.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has signed more than 20 investment protection agreements" with its
foreign trade partners, none of which are in the nature of framework accords,
Shih Yen-shiang said, underlining that the planned cross-strait pact on
investment protection will be a "complete agreement."</P>
      <P>Asked whether  the proposed  agreement  will be signed as anticipated in a
coming meeting between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  Chairman  Chiang Pin-
kung  and his Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, which is scheduled to take place in
Taipei City before the end of the year, Shih declined to answer.</P>
      <P>Addressing the new accord, Shih said that the two sides are still discussing a
proposed investment protection mechanism, measures to gradually remove barriers
against mutual investment activities, ways to increase the transparency of
investment regulations, and methods to facilitate the launch of investment
programs.</P>
      <P>The issues of wide concern, such as the safety of Taiwanese businessmen
operating in China will also be discussed, he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, meanwhile, ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong, arrived in
Taiwan for a visit.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Zheng will have working-level discussions with his Taiwanese
counterpart, SEF Deputy Chairman Kao Koong-lian, according to the SEF.</P>
      <P>They will exchange opinions on when the upcoming biannual meeting between Chiang
and Chen will take place, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>Zheng will return to Beijing Wednesday.</P>

      <P>The gunman suspected of shooting the son of a KMT official wants to confront his
victim over the latter's allegation that the gunman called out his victim's name
before shooting him, the suspect's legal counsel said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-wei's lawyer said his client admitted to having sworn at Sean Lien,
the son of Kuomintang Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, but said he absolutely did
not call him by his name and would like to face Lien to clear things up.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has not cooperated with police investigators, also wants to take a lie-
detector test, the lawyer said.</P>
      <P>Whether Lien heard the gunman call his name right before firing at him is a key
question prosecutors were trying to make sure of when they questioned him in
hospital where he was receiving treatment.</P>
      <P>Banciao District Court Chief Prosecutor Sun Chih-yuan, along with two other
court officials, raised a number of questions regarding where Lien was standing,
how he was attacked and other circumstances at the time of the shooting during a
Nov. 26 election-eve campaign rally in Yunghe, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>As the suspect insists that he had "identified the wrong target" and shot Lien
by mistake, the prosecutors said they will decide whether to allow Lin and Lien
to cross-examine each other.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chen Cheng-fen said many things remain unclear in Lin's accounts of
the origin of the weapon used, his motivation and his intended target.</P>
      <P>Key points in the investigation are whether there is a mastermind behind the
shooting, who the suspect talked to before committing the crime, and whether
gambling interests are involved, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor also said there is no need to publish the X-rays of Lien's
injury, since the police and hospital authorities have made public all available
details about Lien's medical treatment and condition.</P>

      <P>The Nov. 26 election-eve shooting of Sean Lien, son of Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan, has sparked various conspiracy theories. Police must resolve
the case rapidly to uphold justice for the victim and rebuild the public's
confidence in the government's ability to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>There have been suspicions that the shooting was masterminded by an underground
gambling ring taking bets on the elections, in the hope that the incident would
sway the election outcome in its favor.</P>
      <P>If proven true, it would be a serious problem. We must deal gambling rings a
blow, or else Taiwan will always hold elections under the shadow of guns, which
would constitute the greatest blow to the country's democracy.</P>
      <P>Some legislators of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
meanwhile, speculated that the incident was staged by the KMT to win sympathy
votes and that Lien's wounds were faked. We wonder whether those politicians
have any shred of humanity. Don't forget that Lien is still in the hospital
waiting to undergo rehabilitation while another innocent bystander lost his life
as a result of the incident. How far is the DPP going to tolerate such
heartlessness by its public office-holders? (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 1, 2010)</P>

sympathy votes, but that they result in endless conspiracy theories and rumors.
In the aftermath of Chen's shooting, the blue camp spent more than a year
weaving scores of conspiracy theories, while the green camp was busy rebutting
them. This time, it is the green camp's turn to suspect the blue camp of staging
Lien's shooting.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers and political pundits, on the other hand, are quick to create rumors
based on their partisan interests. These politicians and pundits should keep
their mouths shut before the outcome of the investigation is released, and they
should not impose their arbitrary interpretations if the investigation results
do not match their expectations.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors and police must also learn a lesson from the 319 shooting. They
should carefully collect related evidence to reveal the truth, so as to ease
social confrontation and unrest. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 1, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Inheritance dispute over two Chiangs' diaries</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/01/10  14:22:16
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A dispute has erupted over the right to inherit the diaries of two late
presidents of the Republic of China -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-
kuo.</P>
      <P>A fourth-generation family member has demanded that terms of the contract giving
the Hoover Institution at Stanford University the right to preserve the diaries
for 50 years be renegotiated.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, the daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo's deceased eldest son Chiang
Hsiao-wen,  issued a statement  through the international law firm Baker &amp;
Mckenzie Tuesday asking her aunt Chiang Fang Chih-yi to help in getting the U.S.
research institute to negotiate a new contract with her and other legal heirs to
the two Chiangs' diaries.</P>
      <P>The two diaries are of significant academic value because they documented
crucial historical events in modern China and recounted relevant policy-making
processes, local observers said.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 10, 2005, Chiang Fang Chih-yi, the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo's third
son, Chiang Hsiao-yung, signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution that
authorized the San Francisco-based think tank to take possession of the diaries
for the next 50 years.</P>
      <P>The diaries of Chiang Kai-shek span 1918 through 1975, a period that included a
war of resistance against Japanese invasion, a civil war with the Chinese
Communists and his exile to Taiwan and rule over the island.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo's diaries began in 1939 and ended in 1979, a period during
which he succeeded his father, serving as premier and then president of the ROC.</P>
      <P>The Hoover Institution has since made copies of the diaries available for public
inspection under strict conditions.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the dispute:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, who resides in Britain, said in the statement that Chiang Fang
Chih-yi should not have signed the contract with the Hoover Institute by
herself, because she is only one of nine legal heirs to the two Chiangs'
diaries. Her act infringed on the legal rights of the other heirs, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>As one of the legal heirs to the diaries, Chiang You-mei said she had long tried
to persuade Chiang Fang Chih-yi to push the Hoover Institution to negotiate a
new contract with all legal heirs, but had yet to receive a positive response.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei said she and other heirs will not continue tolerating Chiang Fang
Chih-yi's arbitrary action and that if necessary, they will take legal action to
protect their own rights. (Dec. 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Sources close to the Chiang family said following the death of Chiang Ching-kuo,
many important documents and files, including the two Chiangs' diaries, were
left to the custody of his third son Chiang Hsiao-yung.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei said Tuesday in a statement that Chiang Kai-shek's diaries were
part of Chiang Ching-kuo's legacy that should be equally shared by all of his
legal heirs.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hsiao-yung's widow should not have authorized the Hoover Institution to
take possession of the diaries without the consent of other heirs, she argued.</P>
      <P>CommonWealth Publishing Co. reportedly is scheduled to publish volumes of Chiang
Kai-shek's diaries from 1945 to 1949 next week. (Dec. 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The inheritance dispute shed light on disharmony among family members of the
once powerful and glamorous Chiang clan.</P>
      <P>Some pundits wondered if the issue could be settled by turning the diaries over
to the Kuomintang or to the country rather than remaining in the hands of
Chiang's heirs.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang would not comment on the suggestion, saying it would not
interfere in the Chiangs' family matters.</P>
      <P>As for the possibility of the diaries being taken over by the state, legal
experts said the two Chiangs' diaries were basically private property and would
have a hard time being defined as national files or documents under the
country's Archives Act. (Dec. 1, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>New book on China's AIDS pandemic unveiled in Taiwan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
12/01/10  14:28:05

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese AIDS activist who now lives in the United States after being
persecuted by Beijing launched her latest book on China's AIDS epidemic in
Taiwan on Tuesday, giving local readers new insight on why AIDS has become such
a major problem there.</P>
      <P>Speaking by teleconference from New York, Gao Yao-jie was excited to present to
Chinese-speaking readers "China's AIDS Plague, " one of a series of three
manuscripts aimed at exposing the seriousness of HIV transmission through blood
transfusion in China.</P>
      <P>The 84-year-old activist said that a large percentage of the AIDS population in
China had contracted the disease through contaminated blood transfusion and
unsanitary blood donation procedures.</P>
      <P>Blood contamination, Gao said, was originally the result of a "bloodhead"
scandal, in which government officials and businessmen aggressively collected
blood using unhygienic equipment in all 31 provinces of China in the early
1990s.</P>
      <P>Large groups of farmers were lured to sell their blood under unsanitary
conditions for money -- with 800 cc of blood earning 40-160 Chinese Yuan
(NT$160-NT$640) -- under the slogan "selling blood makes you richer, healthier
and keeps you away from high blood pressure."</P>
      <P>Without the proper disinfection equipment, however, the blood stations in turn
spread the HIV virus to patients undergoing blood transfusions, said Gao, who
was unable to attend the book's launch in Taiwan in person because of health
issues.</P>
      <P>She added that similar conditions contributing to the spread of AIDS through
blood transfusions still exist today, though many of the unsanitary blood
collection stations have gone underground to avoid government scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Gao's presentation set off a heated discussion among local doctors, scholars,
and social activists gathered in Taipei for the event on China's approach to the
disease.</P>
      <P>Zhang Jin-hua, a professor in National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute of
Journalism, said China had yet to recognize the problem of blood infection and
was underestimating the gravity of the issue, as seen in a Dec. 2009 report in
which China's health authorities said AIDS was spread mainly through sexual
activity.</P>
      <P>Liao Say-tsung, an HIV and AIDS specialist at Taipei Medical University
Hospital, said that while it was true that about 70 percent of AIDS patients in
liberal countries were infected through sexual intercourse, China's case was
different.</P>
      <P>He gave credit, however, to China's current AIDS prevention campaign, saying
that Chinese scholars and researchers are working hard to remedy the situation.</P>
      <P>When asked how many AIDS patients in China caught the disease through blood
transfusions, Zhang said it was hard to tell because of the lack of official
data.</P>
      <P>But based on rare reports of individuals suing the Chinese government for
compensation and the victim's stories in Gao's new book, Zhang said the problem
was clearly serious.</P>
      <P>Liao advised Taiwanese to take precautions if they required emergency blood
transfusions in China.</P>
      <P>"Have the hospital staff go over the transfusion procedure carefully so as to
protect yourself," Liao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China-funded 'Taiwan Yonghe King' permitted to register in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has approved a Chinese investor's
application to set up an enterprise called "Taiwan Yonghe King" in Taiwan to
sell food and beverages and groceries, the ministry announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the approved investment plan, the Chinese investor will put NT$5 million
(US$163,860) into the new business, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>The investment plan stirred controversy because of the company's proposed name
and speculation that the company backing it was a soybean milk-chain in Shanghai
called Shanghai Yonghe King Co.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials, however, denied the speculation, saying the investor was not
involved with the Shanghai company.</P>
      <P>Soybean milk is a traditional breakfast beverage in Taiwan that often goes with
a flat sesame seed bread stuffed with a fried dough stick.</P>
      <P>Yonghe in Taipei County has been one of the best-known places for the breakfast
foods, and its popularity has made "Yonghe" soybean milk a brand representing
the Taiwanese soybean milk breakfast.</P>
      <P>Use of the name could be seen as conflicting with existing breakfast and late-
night snack chains in Taiwan, but MOEA officials explained that companies are
allowed to register any company name in Taiwan as long as it is unique.</P>
      <P>But they acknowledged that if a company wanted to register the name "Taiwan
Yonghe King" as a trademark in Taiwan, the move would very likely  be rejected
because  there would be too little differentiation between it and other existing
trademarks, such as "Yonghe Soybean Milk" and "Yonghe Soybean Milk King."</P>
      <P>It was still unclear Wednesday if the newly approved company actually intended
to set up a soybean milk store.</P>
      <P>During Tuesday's investment review meeting at the MOEA, 24 investment projects
were approved, including 10 investment plans proposed by overseas Chinese and
foreign nationals and eight by Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>Investments in China proposed by one overseas investor and five Taiwanese
companies were also approved.</P>
      <P>One surprise was that the high-profile plan of panel maker AU Optronics Corp.
(AUO) to invest in a 7.5 generation panel factory in China was not put on the
agenda of the review meeting.</P>
      <P>MOEA Vice Minister Huang Chung-chiu said the authorities involved are still
reviewing AUO's application.</P>
      <P>AUO is one of the world's major manufacturers of large-sized TFT-LCD panels.</P>

      <P>Acer Inc., the world's second largest PC vendor, said it signed an agreement
Wednesday with the Chongqing Municipal Government to set up its second operating
hub in China.</P>
      <P>Acer said the Chongqing base is scheduled to start operations in January of next
year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The PC vendor announced last week that it would invest up to US$150 million in
the southwestern Chinese city and hoped Taiwanese component suppliers would move
to Chongqing to create a manufacturing cluster.</P>
      <P>Acer, which currently operates an operating hub in Shanghai, is joining other
local high tech companies in developing a presence in China's inland market.</P>
      <P>Quanta Computer Inc., the world's largest notebook computer ODM service
provider, and Hon Hai Group, the largest contract electronics maker in the
world, have already set up operating bases in Chongqing.</P>
      <P>According to Acer, Chongqing, which has a sound infrastructure and enjoys a
stable supply of manpower, is a transportation hub connecting Europe and
southeast China.</P>
      <P>Acer said the company will follow the Chinese government's lead in developing
the southwestern part of the country through the Chongqing base, and it expected
the new production base would help the company grab the title of largest
notebook computer vendor in the world.</P>
      <P>At present, Acer ranks as the second largest PC and notebook computer vendor
behind Hewlett-Packard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Acer and its Chinese counterpart Fonder Group have set up a strategic
alliance.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of their cooperation, Acer is allowed to use Founder's broad
distribution network in China to sell Acer products in tier 4-6 Chinese cities
-- which have populations of under 20,000 people -- as well as in rural areas.</P>
      <P>Acer said its arrangement with Founder began contributing to the company's sales
in October.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based company expects its sales in China will reach US$2.5 billion by
2011 through its cooperation with Founder, compared with US$843 million in 2009.</P>

      <P>Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said Wednesday that Taiwan-related information
obtained by the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks was not necessarily true.</P>
      <P>The ministry has kept track of the classified documents unveiled by the website
and has confirmed that none of them were leaked from Taiwan, Kao said during a
hearing of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>He said a special task force headed by Vice Minister Andrew Yang would follow
future leaks by the website and analyze and verify any details that were related
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wikileaks announced on its website that over the next few months, it will
release in stages 251,287 cables originating from 274 U.S. embassies between
Dec. 28, 1966 to Feb. 28, 2010.</P>
      <P>Among them, there are 3,456 that were sent between the U.S. State Department and
the American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S. representative office in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also mentioned in some of the documents that have already been
released. One of the documents showed that China opposed the U.S. sale of Black
Hawk helicopters and F-16 C/D fighters to Taiwan, and also opposed Taiwan's sale
or rent of SuperCobra AH-1W helicopters to Turkey.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the information, Kao said that although Beijing has openly opposed
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the government was confident it could still procure
weapons from the U.S.</P>
      <P>As to the helicopter deal with Turkey, the minister said this was the first time
he had heard of the matter.</P>
      <P>Even if the United States requested Taiwan to sell or rent the AH-1W helicopters
to Turkey, Taiwan would not have agreed to it because the helicopters  were
needed to meet its own defense requirements, Kao said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices hit their highest level in more than 29 months on Wednesday
on expectations that the next round of high-level talks between Taiwan and China
would help accelerate commercial activity between the two countries, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 147.63 points, or 1.76 percent, to close at the day's
high of 8,520.11, its highest finish since closing at 8,587.96 on June 9, 2008,
on turnover of NT$149.90 billion (US$4.92 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.69 percent as investors shrugged off a fall on Wall
Street overnight, and buying then intensified, focusing on financial firms and
property developers, which are expected to benefit from booming business ties
with China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,802 stocks closed up, and 1,406 finished down, with 363 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector scored the strongest gains, gaining 4.4 percent.
Construction, cement and textile stocks rose 2.7 percent, and paper and pulp
shares closed up 2.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastic and chemical shares added 1.9 percent, machinery and electronics shares
rose 1.2 percent, and foodstuff shares closed up 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Beijing's Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) will hold negotiations in Taiwan
later this month.</P>
      <P>The market is expecting that the two organizations will sign agreements on
investment protection and medical cooperation.</P>
      <P>"Investors have embraced high hopes that closer cross-strait business ties after
the talks will further boost the local economy, " Concord Securities analyst
Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said Saturday's  municipal  elections,  which left the China-friendly
Kuomintang government holding on to three of the five mayoral seats up for
grabs, paved the way for Taiwan's continued pursuit of economic cooperation with
China to raise domestic demand.</P>
      <P>Interest continued in property developers as investors were upbeat that local
property prices would push higher on rising demand, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He said the strong showing staged by bellwether financial firms also reflected
optimism toward the local property market as these companies, which own large
chunks of property assets, are expected to see the value of their assets rise.</P>
      <P>"After's today's gains,  the market has become technically healthier by
overcoming strong resistance at around the 8,400-8,500 point level," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"As the market remains awash in liquidity, there is room for further upward
momentum," he said.</P>
      <P>Among financial shares, Chang Hwa Bank rose 6.91 percent to NT$21.65, Hua Nan
Financial gained 6.87 percent to NT$21.00 and First Financial added 6.86 percent

Yuanta Securities said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Airtac will issue 17.05 million shares for the listing at a price of between

      <P>The government is planning to tighten restrictions on Chinese nationals
traveling to Taiwan for training to prevent employers from using the trips as a
guise to import cheap labor, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-
hsuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The permitted length of stay for "research and study" purposes will be shortened
from three months to one month, and the number of trainees will not be allowed
to exceed a quarter of the total number of Chinese visitors invited to Taiwan
for business purposes by the same employer in a single year, Wang said at a
legislative hearing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the length of training courses provided for the trainees cannot
exceed four hours per day, she said.</P>
      <P>According to existing regulations governing business visits by Chinese
nationals, business owners, managers and skilled technicians are allowed  to
visit Taiwan at the invitation  of Taiwanese organizations  for  purposes  such
as  fact-finding  missions, conferences, speeches, exhibitions, and research and
study.</P>
      <P>Training is currently grouped in the same category as research and study.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 16, prosecutors raided a factory run by touch panel manufacturer Young
Fast Optoelectronics  in Taoyuan County and discovered 28 Chinese nationals
allegedly working on the production line in the guise of receiving training.</P>
      <P>The raid was made in response to complaints by labor rights groups that the
company was using the model to bring in cheap labor from China, with 18
Taiwanese workers having been dismissed as a result.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the CLA has required Young Fast to explain the dismissal of
the workers by Dec. 9, and it has also temporarily frozen the company's right to
hire foreign workers.</P>
      <P>Young Fast on Wednesday again denied the allegations, saying that bringing
workers from the company's China facilities to Taiwan for training for such a
short stay involved high costs, making it impossible for the company to use the
model to import Chinese laborers.</P>

      <P>Sean Lien, the son of KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan, was shot in the face but
is now in stable condition. A bystander was killed in the incident.</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that when she and Chen were wounded in a similar incident on March
19, 2004 in Tainan, speculations were raised that Chen had choreographed the
shooting.</P>
      <P>Chen sustained a non-life threatening wound to the abdomen in that incident.</P>
      <P>Lu said she and Chen are both concerned about the shooting of Lien and the
ensuing "weird atmosphere" that has prevailed in the country as rumors continue
to fly that the KMT or pan-blue camp had engineered the shooting to help shore
up their sagging voter support.</P>
      <P>Such speculations have been raised mainly by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party and the wider pan-green camp.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the judicial authorities to quickly investigate the case in order to
reduce tensions between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>She also called on President Ma Ying-jeou to authorize a new probe into the
facts behind the 2004 shooting.</P>
      <P>"The threat of violence in our democracy will disappear only when the truth
behind the shootings is made known," she said.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, former President Chen cited statistics to show that the Nov. 26
shooting had not affected the results of the next day's vote, just as the 2004
shooting did not have any significant effect on the presidential poll the
following day.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Chen and Lu won a second term by a slim margin.</P>
      <P>Boasting about the effects of the shooting on voter behavior will only induce
more people to resort to violence, which would hurt Taiwan's democracy, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The comments by Lu and Chen were made amid arguments by other DPP heavyweights
that Lien's shooting had galvanized KMT moderates and swing voters into handing
the KMT candidates in Taipei and Xinbei cities a bigger-than-expected win.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Poll reveals worries of potential violence in future elections</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars have urged President Ma Ying-jeou to thoroughly investigate the truth
behind a shooting incident on the eve of Saturday's municipal elections after a
poll revealed fears that violence would be used to affect Taiwan's elections in
the future.</P>
      <P>The shooting of Sean Lien, the son of former Vice President Lien Chan, the night
before the elections, is believed to have boosted support for the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) , which won three mayoral races after being seen as potentially
vulnerable in those cities.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a Taiwan Thinktank poll released on Wednesday,
nearly two-thirds (62.4 percent) of those polled worried that guns would be used
a means to manipulate election results in every important election in the
future.</P>
      <P>Respondents were split, however, on whether a shooting would affect the fairness
of an election, with 52.3 percent saying it would and 47.7 percent saying it
would not, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Also, when asked which of the two major political parties -- the KMT or the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party -- gained the most from Friday's
shooting, two-thirds (66.5 percent) said the KMT benefited the most compared to
4.7 percent who said the DPP.</P>
      <P>Over half (53.3 percent) of those polled believed the shooting actually helped
the KMT win three out of the five mayoral races being contested, while 43.9
percent disagreed with the proposition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank analyst Hsu Yung-ming said the survey results indicated that
most people believed the shooting had affected the elections and that the
incident had raised public fears over repeated violence in future polls.</P>
      <P>He called on the president to publicly pledge that similar incidents would never
happen again during his administration.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsin-huang, director of Academia Sinica's Institute of Sociology,
suggested that Ma order a thorough investigation into the Nov. 26 incident to
dig out the truth.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Master Survey and Research Co. at the behest of
Taiwan Thinktank on Nov. 29-30 among adults aged over 20 years of age. A total
of 1,085 valid samples were collected, and the poll's margin of error was plus
or minus 3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as rumors continued to spread that the event was staged to affect the
elections, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said it was extremely unlikely that
either Lien or the suspected gunman staged the shooting.</P>
      <P>He refused to make any further comments on the case, saying only that all
aspects are under investigation.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar rose against the New Taiwan dollar Wednesday, gaining NT$0.002
to close at NT$30.852.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$641 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.950 and moved between NT$30.411 and NT$30.955
before the close.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank repeated intervention in the foreign exchange in late
trade reversed the early gains posted by the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S.
dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Before the central bank's presence, buying in the New Taiwan dollar by exporters
continued in the local foreign exchange market, in particular as investors took
cues from a rebound of the Korean won with the joint military drills of the
United States and South Korea coming to an end, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar gained momentum as the local stock market hit its highest
point in more than 29 months on expectations that the sixth round of cross-
strait talks scheduled for later this month will produce further measures to
boost economic ties between Taiwan and China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 1.76 percent at 8,520.11, the highest
closing level since June 9, 2008.</P>
      <P>The buying in the U.S. dollar by the central bank vaulted the greenback above
the NT$30.800 level at the close, off an early low, showing the bank's
determination to protect Taiwan's competitive edge in the world market, the

      <P>Digital technology has had an immense impact on artistic creation and the
government should give support in this field as the wider society would benefit,
a French official said at a seminar in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jean-Marc Prevost, an official from France's Ministry of Culture, said that the
use of advanced technology to create art has become the norm.</P>
      <P>When singers no longer need record companies to release their albums, but
instead publish their music online on their own, "we know artistic creation has
taken a completely new turn, " he said at a three-day seminar titled "Artistic
creation and digital technology."</P>
      <P>The French government is working closely with cultural centers to help create a
vibrant environment for artists and allow the public to have easy access to the
work of artists, he said.</P>
      <P>"Through government support, we hope to provide public access to artistic
creations and fulfill the concept of 'the democratization of culture' so that
everyone has more opportunities to enjoy the cultural assets," he added.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the French government has been actively involved in the
establishment of national cultural centers to better link artists with
audiences, Prevost said.</P>
      <P>These centers include Dispositif pour la Creation Artistique Multimedia
(DICREAM), a trans-border institute established in 2001 to assist artists who
are engaged in the creation of original digital art works, and Centre National
du Livre (CNL), which is dedicated to digital and multimedia publication, he
said.</P>
      <P>Curator James Giroudon from the National Center for Musical Creation in Lyon,
France said there are six national musical centers in France and the number will
continue to grow.</P>
      <P>"We are not saying all artists have to use high tech in their musical creations,
he said. "But the medium of technology is certainly the new tool to produce
artworks, and we always need new perspectives on art."</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by the Council for Cultural Affairs, which invited
several keynote speakers, mostly from France, to share their views on how the
arts could be reshaped through the application of digital technology.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp., a Taiwan-based flat panel maker, said Wednesday it has set
up a strategic alliance with Evonik Industries of Germany to jointly develop the
green energy business.</P>
      <P>Both sides have signed a memorandum of understanding to engage in the research,
development and manufacture of solar energy, lighting and other unspecified
green energy activities, AUO said.</P>
      <P>The two companies also aim to enter the business of recycling poly methyl
methacrylate (PMMA), which is a clear plastic, for use as a shatterproof
replacement for glass.</P>
      <P>Further details of the partnership have not yet been finalized, but the
cooperation with Evonik, one of the world's leading specialty chemicals makers,
will enhance AUO's capability in the areas of material research and development,
the Taiwan company said.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Forhouse Corp., an AUO affiliate, set up a joint venture with Evonik to
produce PMMA for use in thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCD).</P>
      <P>AUO said the joint venture has been going very smoothly, therefore, it was
decided that it should be extended into the green energy business.</P>
      <P>The Forhouse and Evonik joint venture, which is called Evonik Forhouse  Optical
Polymers,  is planning to double its annual production to 85 kilotons in 2012.</P>
      <P>AUO currently owns a stake of more than 90 percent in the Japan-based silicon
wafer maker M. Setek, which gives AUO access to the upstream solar-energy
business.</P>
      <P>In addition, AUO jointly runs a solar cell plant in Malaysia in cooperation with
the U.S.-based SunPower Corp.</P>
      <P>The flat panel maker is one of many Taiwanese high tech companies that have been
diversifying, in particular into renewable energy, in the hope that it will
soften any impact from a cyclical downturn in their core businesses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Medical agreement to be signed in next cross-strait meeting: DOH</HEADLINE>

      <P>An agreement on cross-strait medical cooperation that is expected to be signed
in the next round of negotations between Taiwan and China will serve to better
safeguard the health and safety of the Taiwanese people, the Department of
Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The government is aware of the problems that could derive from frequent contact
between Taiwan and China, said Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang, noting that
about 5 million people travel across the Taiwan Strait each year.</P>
      <P>For example, Yaung said, many Taiwanese visitors to China like to buy medicine
there, but "we have no way of stopping them from purchasing drugs that do not
meet medical certification standards in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Under the proposed agreement, a higher accreditation system, like the one used
in Taiwan, will be implemented in China to protect consumers, he said.</P>
      <P>It is also important to establish a platform for communication on medical
emergencies and epidemic prevention, he said.</P>
      <P>One of the gaps in Taiwan's SARS prevention and control efforts in 2003 was the
lack of a mechanism for cross-strait cooperation, the minister said.</P>
      <P>He said the details of the agreement have not yet been finalized, but both sides
have agreed to focus on four major areas -- disease control and prevention, drug
safety management, the safety of herbal medicine, and emergency rescue.</P>
      <P>Minister of Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Lai Shin-yuan said the agreement is
complex and that an inter-ministerial consultation team, including
representatives from the DOH, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Council of
Agriculture, is working on the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>The agreement will be signed under a reciprocal and egalitarian framework and a
principle of "Five Noes" will be employed to protect the rights of the Taiwanese
people, she said.</P>
      <P>The five points are no Chinese medical personnel will be allowed to obtain a
license or practice medicine in Taiwan, no China capital will be permitted for
the establishment of hospitals in Taiwan, no interference will be made in the
education of medical personnel, and medical treatment at hospitals in China will
not be covered by Taiwan's health insurance program.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday he felt deep regret over a shooting
incident on the eve of recent municipal elections, while the top U.S. liaison
officer with Taipei lauded Taiwan's response to it as a sign of political
maturity.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a meeting with American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman
Raymond Burghardt at the Presidential Office, Ma said it was very regrettable to
see the shooting at a campaign rally outside Taipei the day before the Nov. 27
polling.</P>
      <P>The shooting of Sean Lien, the son of former Vice President Lien Chan, was
reminiscent of similar election-eve violence in 2004, when then-President Chen
Shui-bian was shot while campaigning for his re-election bid in the southern
city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>"Violence is relatively rare in Taiwan. It was baffling and unfortunate to
witness recurrence of election-eve shooting while our democracy is maturing," Ma
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the case is still under probe, Ma told his guest that his
administration will make a thorough review and take steps to prevent recurrence
of similar tragedies.</P>
      <P>In response,  Burghardt said the smooth conclusion of the municipal elections
were Taiwan's yet another democratic achievement.</P>
      <P>The way both the ruling Kuomintang and the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party handled the incident "was also a sign of political maturity, " said the
head of the AIT, a quasi-official organization authorized to handle U.S.-Taiwan
relations in the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>On the just-concluded elections, Ma said the merger and upgrading of some local
administrative districts marks a historical milestone in government
restructuring.</P>
      <P>The expansion and upgrading of two southern cities -- Kaohsiung and Tainan --
also mainfests "our determination to promote balanced development in different
parts of the country," Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Ma said Taiwan faces great challenges as the
balance of military power across the Taiwan Strait is increasingly tilting in
Beijing's favor. He urged the U.S. government to sell defensive high-performance
jet fighters to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also mentioned that the number of countries that offer visa-free
privileges to Taiwan passport holders has increased from 53 to 96 since he
assumed office in May 2008. Canada and 35 European countries have recently
agreed to include Taiwan in their visa-waiver programs.</P>
      <P>By now, only 6 percent of countries where Taiwanese people often visit have not
yet offered Taiwan visa-free privilege, including the United States, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ma expressed the hope that a Taiwan-U.S. extradition agreement can be
signed soon to pave the way for notorious Taiwanese criminals taking refuge in
the U.S. to be repatriated to stand trial or serve their prison terms.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan and China signed a judicial assistance agreement last year, Ma
said, cross-strait cooperation in fighting crime has scored encouraging results,
with some most wanted fugitives having been sent home to face justice.</P>

      <P>The overall number of convenience stores in Taiwan increased last year amid a
trend of slower expansion since 2006, according to a survey released by the Fair
Trade Commission on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Five major convenience store chains -- 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, Hi-Life, OK Mart
and TSC Million -- opened 41 more outlets in 2009 to make a total of 9,245, up
from 4,950 ten years ago, the study showed.</P>
      <P>But the year-on-year increase of store numbers has dropped from 14.6 percent in
2000 to 0.4 percent last year as a result of slower expansion over the past
three years, the Cabinet-level agency said.</P>
      <P>In average, there is one convenience store per 0.26 kilometers throughout the
country, which is quite dense, results of the survey found.</P>
      <P>The density has caused the operators to hold back stretching and instead to
provide more services such as home delivery, bill payment, and pre-ordering, the
release said.</P>
      <P>In terms of geographical distribution of convenience stores, Taipei County,
Taipei City, and Taoyuan County are the three regions that have the most stores.

      <P>These companies will use a total of over 5,000 booths next year, compared with
4,861 booths used by 1,715 exhibitors this year, TAITRA added.</P>
      <P>Major companies at home and abroad often use the event, now in its 31st year, as
a platform to showcase their new products, which will include tablet computers
next year, it noted.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will take place at a time when several companies -- such as Acer,
Asustek, Samsung, ViewSonic, Dell and HP -- have unveiled or are ready to launch
their tablet devices to get their slice of a boom started by Apple's iPad.</P>
      <P>In addition to representatives from other countries, more Chinese buyers will
visit the show next year after Taiwan and China signed a landmark pact for a
more liberalized trade earlier this year, according to Brian Lee, deputy
executive director of TAITRA's Exhibition Department.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we have also been focusing on emerging markets, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The average number of foreign visitors to the show is about 36,000 every year,
but there will probably be 40,000 next year," Lee added.</P>
      <P>He also forecast that after Computex concludes, the value of transactions will
total at US$23 billion in the following 12 months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Loss of civil war was biggest setback for Chiang Kai-shek: diary</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
12/01/10  21:58:46

    <TEXT>
      <P>The loss to the Communists in China's civil war in the 1940's was the biggest
setback and humiliation for former Republic of China President Chiang Kai-shek,
according to the entries in his diary.</P>
      <P>After relocating his government to Taiwan in 1949, Chiang spent a lot of his
time in "thorough soul-searching", trying to understand why only four years
after winning a hard war against Japanese invaders in World War II, his
Nationalist forces yielded the Chinese mainland to the Communist army, the diary
shows.</P>
      <P>"The root causes, among other things, were putting the wrong persons in wrong
positions," Chiang wrote.</P>
      <P>Two such examples were naming Soong Tse-ven as premier and General Pai Chung-hsi
as his top military aide, Chiang reflected.</P>
      <P>Soong failed to adequately address the problematic economy, and Pai failed to
stop the communists from advancing, Chiang said in the diary.</P>
      <P>The diaries of Generalissimo Chiang and his son, the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo, are now on display at the Hoover Institute, Stanford University in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Shao Ming-huang, director of the Kuomintang's Party History Hall, said Wednesday
that the senior Chiang wrote in his diary every day for more than 50 years
between 1917 and 1972. This was a reflection of his one of his personal
characteristics  of "perseverance" throughout life, Shao added.</P>
      <P>The 55-volume diary of the senior Chiang, written in Chinese calligraphy,
touched on a wide range of matters such as national and party affairs, the
international situation, personnel disputes within the Nationalists government,
the China civil war, cross-Taiwan Strait confrontations, family affairs and
Chiang's romances, said Shao, who visited the U.S. to read the diaries before
they went on display.</P>
      <P>Shao said that the senior Chiang used to keep a diary as a means of "examining
himself" and correcting his mistakes.</P>
      <P>Generalissimo Chiang, who died in 1975 in Taiwan, never tried to hide his
personal feelings toward anyone, Shao said.</P>
      <P>The Generalissimo once intentionally called U.S. General George Catlett Marshall
"Ma Hsia-er", a contemptuous name in Chinese that implied the general was the
son of an indecent Marshall family.</P>
      <P>Marshall was a five-star general sent by then U.S. President Harry Truman in
1945 to broker a proposed  Chinese coalition government between the Nationalists
and Communists. But Chiang thought General Marshall had favored Mao Zedong,
leader of the Communist forces, and that the Nationalists' failure was linked to
that.</P>
      <P>When he learned of Marshall's death from a stroke in 1959, Chiang wrote "Ma
Hsia-er just got the punishment he deserved."</P>
      <P>Shao said the diary showed that the senior Chiang "went beyond the general
impression of being just a general, as he never tired of reading in his
lifetime."</P>
      <P>Chiang's personality underwent a lot of changes during the last years of his
life, and his temper softened as he grew older, Shao said.</P>
      <P>"The only thing that did not change was his determination to 'recover the
Chinese mainland' -- a dream that failed to come true before he died," Shao
said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)  impressive  performance
in the just-concluded municipal elections has raised the popularity of its
chairwoman, according to a survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Thinktank, which contracted a poll and research company to conduct the
post-election survey in late November, said 71.4 percent of the respondents
voiced support for Tsai Ing-wen to remain on the post, while 15.7 percent
opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP has only secured two out of five mayoral seats in the elections
on Nov. 27, it gained more ballots in total than the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) did
in the mayoral elections in Taipei City and other four to-be-created special
municipalities.</P>
      <P>The survey showed the satisfaction rate for Tsai's performance as DPP chairwoman
reaches 67.3 percents, while the dissatisfaction rate stands at 23.9 percent.</P>
      <P>On President Ma Ying-jeou's performance since he took the power in May 2008,
39.9 percent of the respondents said they are satisfied with Ma's
administration. Those who are dissatisfied with Ma's job performance, however,
account for 56 percent of all respondents.</P>
      <P>The poll by the non-profit research organization, which is generally perceived
as more sympathetic with the pro-independence pan-green camp headed by the DPP,
also showed that 45.9 percent of the surveyed think the DPP wins the elections,
while only 35.2 percent regard the KMT as the winner.</P>
      <P>In his analysis of the elections, Hsiao Hsin-huang, director of Academia
Sinica's Institute of Sociology, said although the DPP lost the mayoral race, it
won more votes and support.</P>
      <P>In general, the opposition party was marching toward the northern areas from its
strongholds in the south, the researcher said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted on Nov. 29-30 among adults over 20 years of age. A
total of 1,085 valid samples were collected, and the poll's margin of error was
plus or minus 3 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lien's gunshot wound authentic: hospital</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) on Wednesday scoffed at the
speculation that Lien Sheng-wen, the son of a former vice-president, had
orchestrated his own shooting on election eve last Friday, saying the patient
would not have had the "courage" to arrange for someone to shoot him in the
head.</P>
      <P>Lien, 40, also known as Sean Lien, was shot in the face while he was stumping
for a Kuomintang Xinbei council candidate last Friday night at a campaign rally
in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The bullet entered Lien's left cheek and exited below his right temple,
according to police reports. After a four-hour operation at NTUH, Lien is now
able to talk, eat, and smile, the hospital said.</P>
      <P>Lien's rapid recovery and the lack of pictures of his injury have prompted some
people, in particular a few Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers, to
speculate on the authenticity of the shooting.</P>
      <P>Some have said that Lien orchestrated the entire incident to bolster the KMT's
chances in the municipality elections.</P>
      <P>Various political commentators have argued that the incident gave the KMT a much
needed last-minute push to edge ahead in an election that they said was
deadlocked.</P>
      <P>However, such notions were strongly refuted by NTUH trauma specialist Ko Wen-je,
the head physician who treated Lien in the first 30 minutes after he was rushed
to the hospital.</P>
      <P>"I saw the injury with my own eyes and treated him personally. There is nothing
fake about it, " Ko said. " Lien would not have had the courage to arrange for a
gunman to shoot him in the head. That would have been too dangerous."</P>
      <P>The doctor said that as a staunch DPP supporter he is the most convincing
witness to vouch for Lien.</P>
      <P>Lien's wound is real and was definitely caused by a bullet that went through his
face, Ko said, lamenting the lack of trust between rival parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The doctor attributed Lien's speedy recovery to the hospital's medical expertise
as well as the patient's "good luck." Had the bullet struck one centimeter in
another direction, the patient could have lost his sight, Ko said.</P>
      <P>According to the NTUH press release, Lien remains under hospital watch and is in
stable condition.</P>
      <P>Amid calls by the public to disclose Lien's medical records, the hospital
pointed out that under the Medical Care Act health institutions are not
permitted to release patient records without the consent of the patient.</P>
      <P>"The hospital has no authority to publicize any medical records, x-ray pictures
or any related  information  regarding  Lien's condition," NTUH said.</P>
      <P>The law also requires  hospitals  to forward all relevant information and
documents to the judiciary upon request, as in this case, NTUH added.</P>
      <P>The police reported that a man was fatally shot in the same incident. It is
still unclear whether he was killed by the same bullet that struck Lien. A
suspect was immediately arrested on the scene of the incident and is still in
detention.</P>

      <P>The Goethe Institute Taipei is currently holding an exhibition of more than 40
German video art works that date back to the 1970s, showing the development of
the art form, Markus Wernhard, director of the institute, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "40 Years of Video Art in Germany, " includes a vast
collection of video shorts from 1969 to 2008 made by famous artists such as
Joseph Beuys, Klaus vom Bruch, Lutz Dammbeck, Wold Kahlen and many others. It
will run until Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>Video artworks began to emerge in Germany in the early 1970s but could not be
put on display since the format was totally different from the digital
technology in use today.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the German Federal Cultural Foundation began to collect, restore, and
covert old video artworks with the aim of saving and maintaining the cultural
heritage of video art, Wernhard told the Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>It has become one of the most influential art forms of the 20th century, he
said.</P>
      <P>On display at the exhibition are three different categories of videos -- artists
using technology to record an event, artists trying to use video to express
their artistic point of view, and works that are strongly related to social and
political movements.</P>
      <P>There are some pieces that were done by East German artists and which reflect
the historical atmosphere in the 1970s and 1980s, the director said.</P>
      <P>Compared with past video artworks, Wernhard said, the scope of modern video
creation is becoming bigger and bigger, which means the differences between film
and video art are disappearing.</P>
      <P>Contemporary video artists work with big camera teams and many of the works
consist of several projections, which need to be shown in big exhibition halls,
he said. Old video works, on the other hand, were presented on old-fashioned TV
sets only, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Artists are very interested in exploring new ways of creation. Through the
exhibition, one can get an impression of how quickly our world has changed
during the last 40 years," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen urged the
government Wednesday to uncover the truth of the election-eve shooting of Sean
Lien, the son of a former vice president, and to help prevent any recurrence of
such incidents.</P>
      <P>"The government must quickly dig out the truth and clearly explain the matter to
the public and the families of the victims, " Tsai said during the DPP's first
weekly Central Standing Committee meeting since the Nov. 27 municipality
elections.</P>
      <P>There have been speculations that the shooting, which left Lien with serious
wounds to his face and resulted in the death of a 29-year-old man at a campaign
rally in Xinbei City, helped boost the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to a 3-2 win in
the elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP maintained control of Tainan and Kaohsiung, two of its traditional
strongholds in southern Taiwan, while the KMT won in northern Taiwan's Taipei
City and Xinbei City and central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Tsai rebutted allegations hinting at the DPP's possible role in
the shooting. She said that the assailant, the mastermind, and those trying to
spread rumors should be harshly condemned for attempting to provoke
confrontations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the incident cast a shadow on the weekend elections. She called on the
government to devise measures for preventing a recurrence of such violence and
to dissuade the media from misleading the public.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the party will set up a task force to track
and monitor developments in the shooting case. Anyone caught using the incident
to smear the DPP must be prepared to take legal responsibility, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to Tsai Ing-wen's remarks, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said the KMT
fully supports the DPP's call to unearth the facts of the case. However, he
asked Tsai not to rehash the incident as means of shirking responsibility for
her party's loss in the mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Yen Da-ho, chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, said in a
legislative committee hearing later Wednesday that after checking the video
footage of the campaign rally, he had found "nothing to indicate that the
shooting was orchestrated by Sean Lien."</P>
      <P>"I will ask the Banciao Prosecutors Office to solve the case as soon as
possible, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government should seek the return of the diaries of its two late
presidents -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo -- which have been
kept at a U.S. research institute since 2005, a ruling Kuomintang lawmaker said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator John H. Chiang, the son of Chiang Ching-kuo born out of wedlock, made
the remarks after an inheritance dispute over the two Chiang diaries came into
the spotlight Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, the daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo's deceased eldest son, issued a
statement through the international law firm Baker &amp; Mckenzie Tuesday asking
her aunt Chiang Fang Chih-yi to help in getting the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University to negotiate a new contract with her and other legal heirs
to the two Chiang diaries.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 10, 2005, Chiang Fang Chih-yi, the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo's third son
Chiang Hsiao-yung, signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution that
authorized the San Francisco-based think tank to take possession of the diaries
for the next 50 years.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, who resides in Britain, said in the statement that Chiang Fang
Chih-yi should not have signed the contract with the Hoover Institute on her
own, because she is only one of nine legal heirs to the two Chiang diaries. Her
act infringed on the legal rights of the other heirs, the statement said.</P>
      <P>As one of the legal heirs to the diaries, Chiang You-mei said, she has been
trying for a long time to persuade Chiang Fang Chih-yi to push the Hoover
Institution to negotiate a new contract with all legal heirs, but has yet to
receive a positive response.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei said she and other heirs will not continue to tolerate Chiang
Fang Chih-yi's  arbitrary actions and that if necessary, they will take legal
action to protect their own rights.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang said he is not in a position to comment on the inheritance
dispute, but that he looks forward to an early solution to the controversy.</P>
      <P>"I can understand the reasons why the diaries were sent abroad in 2005, " he
said, referring to the then-pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
administration's campaign to wipe out "dictator" Chiang Kai-shek's legacy.</P>
      <P>However, since the political situation has changed, the issue should be
addressed with new way of thinking, he said.</P>
      <P>The two diaries are of significant historical value, because they document
crucial events in modern China and recount relevant policy-making processes,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, they should not be regarded as family assets. They belong to the
Kuomintang, to our people and to our country, " Chiang said. He suggested that a
special library be built to store the diaries and other historical documents and
artifacts.</P>
      <P>The 55-volume diaries of Chiang Kai-shek span 1917 to 1972, a period that
included a war of resistance against Japanese invasion, a civil war with the
Chinese Communists and his exile to Taiwan and rule over the island, according
to a KMT official.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo's diaries began in 1939 and ended in 1979, a period during
which he succeeded his father, serving as premier and then president of the ROC.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese government-backed institute plans to work with Austrian companies in
cloud computing next year, the first ever cooperation between the information
and communication technology (ICT) industries of the two countries, the Austrian
Trade Delegation (ATD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>About 20 Austrian software companies, including those in the online storage and
Internet protocol business, were interested in cooperating with Taiwanese
manufacturers, ATD Deputy Trade Delegate Martin Hiesboeck told the Central News
Agency on the sidelines of a press conference held for "ICT Month" trade fair
scheduled for Dec. 4-12.</P>
      <P>Hiesboeck  will make a proposal to Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry
(III) later this month after a business briefing to the software companies in
Austria Dec. 7-22, but he declined to name the participants.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese firms are good at hardware manufacturing, which is a complement to
the Austrian ICT industry," Hiesboeck added.</P>
      <P>In Austria, nearly 26,000 companies are running ICT business, while more than 45
percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) comes from the ICT
industry, according to the ATD website.</P>
      <P>Vienna, capital of Austria, has become the third largest ICT cluster in Europe
behind London in Britain and Munich in Germany, with more than 8,000 ICT firms
setting operation bases there, the website said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp., the world's No.4 smartphone brand, said Wednesday that the
sale of its new smartphones with the Windows operating system has been passable
so far in Asia, but the company will keep oberving the market demand until early
next year.</P>
      <P>"Sales of the Windows Phone 7 (WP7) series are O.K. in Asia after its launch in
November because many Asian consumers have got used to the Windows system, "
Jack Tong, vice president of HTC Asia-Pacific region, said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's largest telecom operator Chunghwa Telecom began to sell two WP7 models
--the HTC HD7 and the HTC 7 Mozart-- on Nov. 11, while the country's second-
largest telecom carrier, Taiwan Mobile Co., offered only the HD7 model.</P>
      <P>HTC needs time to collect responses from consumers and retailers, so it will not
make any comment on market demand for the WP7 until the first quarter of 2011,
Tong said.</P>
      <P>Shipments of the WP7 will be going smoothly beginning this month and the company
will try to meet local demand first, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen urged the
government Wednesday to uncover the truth of the election-eve shooting of Sean
Lien, the son of a former vice president, and to help prevent any recurrence of
such incidents.</P>
      <P>"The government must quickly dig out the truth and clearly explain the matter to
the public and the families of the victims, " Tsai said during the DPP's first
weekly Central Standing Committee meeting since the Nov. 27 municipality
elections.</P>
      <P>There have been speculations that the shooting, which left Lien with serious
wounds to his face and resulted in the death of a 29-year-old man at a campaign
rally in Xinbei City, helped boost the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to a 3-2 win in
the elections.</P>
      <P>The DPP maintained control of Tainan and Kaohsiung, two of its traditional
strongholds in southern Taiwan, while the KMT won in northern Taiwan's Taipei
City and Xinbei City and central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, Tsai rebutted allegations hinting at the DPP's possible role in
the shooting. She said that the assailant, the mastermind, and those trying to
spread rumors should be harshly condemned for attempting to provoke
confrontations.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the incident cast a shadow on the weekend elections. She called on the
government to devise measures for preventing a recurrence of such violence and
to dissuade the media from misleading the public.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the party will set up a task force to track
and monitor developments in the shooting case. Anyone caught using the incident
to smear the DPP must be prepared to take legal responsibility, he said.</P>
      <P>In response to Tsai Ing-wen's remarks, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said the KMT
fully supports the DPP's call to unearth the facts of the case. However, he
asked Tsai not to rehash the incident as means of shirking responsibility for
her party's loss in the mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Yen Da-ho, chief prosecutor of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, said in a
legislative committee hearing later Wednesday that after checking the video
footage of the campaign rally, he had found "nothing to indicate that the
shooting was orchestrated by Sean Lien."</P>
      <P>"I will ask the Banciao Prosecutors Office to solve the case as soon as
possible, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two Chiang diaries should be returned to Taiwan: lawmaker</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government should seek the return of the diaries of its two late
presidents -- Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo -- which have been
kept at a U.S. research institute since 2005, a ruling Kuomintang lawmaker said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator John H. Chiang, the son of Chiang Ching-kuo born out of wedlock, made
the remarks after an inheritance dispute over the two Chiang diaries came into
the spotlight Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, the daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo's deceased eldest son, issued a
statement through the international law firm Baker &amp; Mckenzie Tuesday asking
her aunt Chiang Fang Chih-yi to help in getting the Hoover Institution at
Stanford University to negotiate a new contract with her and other legal heirs
to the two Chiang diaries.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 10, 2005, Chiang Fang Chih-yi, the widow of Chiang Ching-kuo's third son
Chiang Hsiao-yung, signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution that
authorized the San Francisco-based think tank to take possession of the diaries
for the next 50 years.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei, who resides in Britain, said in the statement that Chiang Fang
Chih-yi should not have signed the contract with the Hoover Institute on her
own, because she is only one of nine legal heirs to the two Chiang diaries. Her
act infringed on the legal rights of the other heirs, the statement said.</P>
      <P>As one of the legal heirs to the diaries, Chiang You-mei said, she has been
trying for a long time to persuade Chiang Fang Chih-yi to push the Hoover
Institution to negotiate a new contract with all legal heirs, but has yet to
receive a positive response.</P>
      <P>Chiang You-mei said she and other heirs will not continue to tolerate Chiang
Fang Chih-yi's  arbitrary actions and that if necessary, they will take legal
action to protect their own rights.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang said he is not in a position to comment on the inheritance
dispute, but that he looks forward to an early solution to the controversy.</P>
      <P>"I can understand the reasons why the diaries were sent abroad in 2005, " he
said, referring to the then-pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party
administration's campaign to wipe out "dictator" Chiang Kai-shek's legacy.</P>
      <P>However, since the political situation has changed, the issue should be
addressed with new way of thinking, he said.</P>
      <P>The two diaries are of significant historical value, because they document
crucial events in modern China and recount relevant policy-making processes,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, they should not be regarded as family assets. They belong to the
Kuomintang, to our people and to our country, " Chiang said. He suggested that a
special library be built to store the diaries and other historical documents and
artifacts.</P>
      <P>The 55-volume diaries of Chiang Kai-shek span 1917 to 1972, a period that
included a war of resistance against Japanese invasion, a civil war with the
Chinese Communists and his exile to Taiwan and rule over the island, according
to a KMT official.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo's diaries began in 1939 and ended in 1979, a period during
which he succeeded his father, serving as premier and then president of the ROC.</P>

would carry out, what heaven abominated they refrained from."</TEXT>

      <P>The Nov. 27 special municipality elections were marred by an election-eve
shooting incident that resulted in the injury of Kuomintang politician Sean Lien
and the death of a bystander. The country's top priority now should be to seek
institutional reforms to prevent gang violence and the interference of outside
forces in future polls.</P>
      <P>There is a need to conduct a thorough review of election laws and plug any
loopholes that allow criminals to manipulate the outcome of elections.
Currently, an election can be suspended only in the event of the death of a
candidate. Indeed, the 2004 presidential election was held as scheduled despite
the shooting of former President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu a
day before the polls, because the pair suffered only minor wounds. The incident
was, nevertheless, believed to have reversed the expected outcome of the
election by generating sympathy votes for Chen and Lu.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Nov. 27 elections were not suspended because none of the victims
of the shooting was a candidate, and the election outcome was also influenced by
the incident.</P>
      <P>The laws should be made more comprehensive to prevent criminal acts that intend
to change election outcomes. There is also a need to consider whether the
conditions for suspending elections should be increased to include situations
other than the death of a candidate.</P>

      <P>won three of the five mayoral seats that were up for grabs in the Nov. 27
elections, it, nevertheless, secured 400,000 lesser votes than the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party in total. This, certainly, should ring alarm bells
for President Ma Ying-jeou's 2012 re-election bid.</P>
      <P>So why did a recovering economy and stable relations with China not translate
into votes for the ruling party? Generally speaking, the main focus of Ma's
economic policy was normalizing economic and trade ties with China and
incorporating Taiwan into a globalized economy. But often, common people do not
feel the benefits of such a policy.</P>
      <P>The experience  of countries worldwide has shown that the beneficiaries of
globalization have always been entrepreneurs, while workers are victimized. That
is why globalization often widens the gap between the rich and the poor and
increases the pay disparity between highly-skilled talent and low-skilled
workers.</P>
      <P>Although the Ma administration is taking the right path by adopting a policy of
liberalization, it has overlooked the policy's impact on different social
groups. One example of this is the reduction in the corporate income tax rate
and the gift and estate tax rates favoring the wealthy, which make the
disadvantaged class feel relatively deprived.</P>
      <P>Still, the Ma administration has more than a year to correct its mistake.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- TSMC to rank among top 10 global brands</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing  Co.  (TSMC)
12/02/10  13:33:11
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Morris Chang forecast Wednesday that the company's brand worth will
exceed US$10 billion in the near future, catapulting the world's largest
contract chipmaker into the ranks of the top 10 global brands.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a panel session organized by the Chinese-language Business Today
weekly, Chang said he believes the TSMC brand worth could even surpass that of
famous Japanese brand Sony in the next five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Chang recalled that three years ago, TSMC commissioned an international market
research company to evaluate his company's brand worth.</P>
      <P>"It was estimated that the 'TSMC' brand will be worth more than US$10 billion in
the next five to 10 years," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The panel session followed a speech by Nouriel Roubini, a New York University
economics professor known as "Dr. Doom" because of his pessimistic  forecasts.
The forum  was organized  by the Chinese-language Business Today weekly.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the event:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although many technology companies are investing a lot in branding, Chang said
he feels branding is not as important to high-tech firms as it was 20 to 30
years ago.</P>
      <P>"There are already many brands in the technology sectors, such as Apple, HP,
Dell and Acer in the PC field and Motorola, Samsung and Nokia in the cellphone
world," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Many tech firms' branding strategies were short-sighted, he noted.</P>
      <P>There are two categories of brands -- B2C (business to consumers) that describes
activities of businesses serving end consumers with products and/or services,
and B2B (business to business) that describes commerce transactions between
businesses, such as between a manufacturer and a wholesaler or between a
wholesaler and a retailer. Chang said TSMC falls in the B2B category.</P>
      <P>"We do not sell products directly to end consumers, but our brand is highly
valuable. TSMC would not spend huge sums on advertisement. Our brand worth is
built on our edge in technological innovation," he said confidently. (Dec. 2,
2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Chang said TSMC has consistently focused on opening up new business frontiers
since its establishment in Taiwan 20-plus years ago.</P>
      <P>"We have never been satisfied with maintaining the status quo or following
existing market trends. We have always tried to break new ground and create new
demand. This strategy has brought us big business opportunities," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He also gave an optimistic forecast on the company's business prospects for the
first quarter of next year. Although Q1 tends to be a low season for the
technology sector, TSMC is forecast to score better-than-expected sales in Q1
2011, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"Our Q1 sales will only shrink by a maximum 5 percent from the level of Q4 2010,
a range far less than in previous years, " Chang said, adding that the company's
Q1 sales are even likely to match the Q4 level.</P>
      <P>He attributed his optimism in part to China's rise as a major consumer market.</P>
      <P>"China is no longer just a world factory. It is now a promising consumer market
and Taiwan stands a good chance to cash in own China's growing domestic demands
and purchasing power," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>He also forecast that the global contract chipmarket could post a 14 percent
growth year-on-year growth in 2011. (Dec. 2, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan-grown white pomelos will be officially launched in the market in Japan
for the first time to help improve market access and increase farmers' income,
an official from central Taiwan's Changhua County said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Around two tons of the fruit that passed all the quality tests and met the
strict requirements set by the Japanese government have been shipped to Japan,
Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan said at a press conference held to celebrate the
new market access.</P>
      <P>The appearance, as well as the weight and size, of the fruits are required to
comply with Japan's regulations, which are tougher compared to that of other
foreign markets, Cho said.</P>
      <P>And although the products had undergone local inspections for chemical

      <P>Taiwan has marketed the white pomelos to China and Singapore, but the market

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait investment protection agreement delayed: MOEA</HEADLINE>

      <P>It will be very difficult to sign an investment protection agreement in the next
round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks scheduled for this month, Minister of
Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was hoping to sign an investment protection agreement and a medical
cooperation agreement with China this month in the next stage of cross-strait
cooperation after the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between
the two sides in June.</P>
      <P>"The two sides could not agree on a mechanism for settling investment disputes
and are still in talks on that aspect (of the agreement) , " Shih said in a
meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>"It will be very difficult to seal the deal in this round of negotiations," he
said.</P>
      <P>Investment protection has been one of the major issues in the follow-up
negotiations after the signing of the ECFA. Taiwan and China had agreed that
substantial agreements on trade in goods and services, investment protection and
dispute settlement should be signed within six months of the ECFA's
implementation in September.</P>
      <P>With trade and investment activities across the strait growing amid warming
bilateral ties, trade and investment disputes have also increased. According to
the Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) , 3,969 complaints related to trade
disputes have been filed by China-based Taiwanese businessmen from 1991 to
September this year.</P>
      <P>The dispute settlement mechanism cannot be routed through the World Trade
Organization (WTO) , which only deals with bilateral matters, or through the
World Bank, because Taiwan is not a World Bank member, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The two sides failed to reach a consensus in the working group meetings on
whether the mechanism  should be included in the investment protection
agreement, given that the mechanism will be regulated in one of the four follow-
up agreements, Shih told legislators.</P>
      <P>"It's more than likely that the mechanism will be established under the proposed
Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Committee, " which consists of government
official  from Taiwan and China designated to handle bilateral economic
exchanges related to the ECFA, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The sixth round of cross-strait negotiation reportedly will be held from Dec.
16-17 in Taipei, but Shih and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Chairman Kao
Charng declined to confirm the date, during the interpellation session.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait negotiations are also known as Chiang-Chen talks because they
are led by Taiwan's SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart,
Association for Relations across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) is expected to gain
accreditation to test LED lighting products that are seeking U.S. Energy Star
certification, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The accreditation will likely be achieved in the first quarter of 2011,
according to Chuang Po-nien, deputy director of the ITRI's Center for
Measurement Standards (CMS).</P>
      <P>Energy Star is an international standard that originated in the U.S. and is
applied to energy efficient consumer products. Devices carrying the Energy Star
label generally use 20 percent to 30 percent less energy than required by
government standards.</P>
      <P>The CMS is an organization authorized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs's
Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection to conduct testing for products,
including LED lighting, seeking national CNS certification.</P>
      <P>The standards adopted by the CNS program for LED lighting are almost as
stringent as those in the Energy Star program, Chuang said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the ITRI is confident that it will qualify for accreditation as an
Energy Star testing organization, he added.</P>
      <P>The ITRI's accreditation will help speed up the process for Taiwanese LED
lighting products seeking to obtain the Energy Star label, he said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih demanded Thursday that the judicial authorities investigate
the truth about the election-eve shooting of the son of a high-ranking ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) official and punish whoever is responsible.</P>
      <P>"We will absolutely not allow violent and law-breaking incidents to continue to
happen, " said the premier after hearing a Central Election Commission briefing
on the Nov. 27 elections for Taiwan's five municipalities.</P>
      <P>In a violent turn of events that night, Sean Lien, son of KMT Honorary Chairman
Lien Chan, was shot in the head during a campaign rally in suburban Taipei. He
survived, but an innocent bystander was killed.</P>
      <P>Wu instructed the relevant officials to take good care of the bereaved family of
the victim, identified as Huang Yun-sheng.</P>
      <P>While all reports  point to a greatly  improved  election environment prior to
the shooting, the incident doubtlessly has had an immense impact on the
country's social safety, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>He urged the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice to investigate
the shooting and act accordingly  in order to demonstrate the government's
determination to punish lawbreakers and to root out election irregularities.</P>
      <P>The shooting has sent a shockwave through all sectors of Taiwanese society,

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.77 percent Thursday, with buying triggered by an
overnight surge on Wall Street, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 65.66 points to 8,585.77, after moving between 8,572.65
and 8,641.13, on turnover of NT$171.20 billion (US$5.63 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.91 percent as investors were encouraged by better-than-
expected auto sales and the private sector's payroll data in the U.S., which
lifted Wall Street, the dealers said, adding that follow-through buying
continued to boost local financial stocks.</P>
      <P>However, right after the index breached the nearest resistance level of 8,600
points, profit-taking set in to compromise the gains, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,697 stocks closed up and 1,672 were down with 346 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector scored the largest gains, up 1.3 percent. Machinery and
electronic stocks rose 0.9 percent, foodstuffs added 0.5 percent, textile shares
gained 0.3 percent and the cement sector closed up 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemicals rose 0.1 percent, while paper and pulp stocks closed
unchanged and construction shares fell 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"After political uncertainty was removed following the Nov. 27 municipality
elections,  institutional investors resumed buying, targeting market bargains,
in particular financial stocks, " Taiwan International Securities analyst
Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Investors are upbeat that the government will forge closer business ties with
China in the sixth round of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations" scheduled for
later this month, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said that as the financial sector has been consolidating for a long time, its
valuation appears very attractive.</P>
      <P>"I do not think interest in financial shares will quickly fade, as many of them
have large property assets whose value is expected to rise on higher domestic
demand," he said.</P>
      <P>However, the market is likely to encounter more pressure ahead of the
8,600-point level in the short term before making another breakthrough, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>In the financial sector, Hua Nan Financial gained 4.76 percent to end at
NT$22.00, First Financial rose 4.59 percent to finish at NT$22.80, and Chang Hwa
Bank added 3.23 percent to close the day at NT$22.35.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. rose 2.48 percent to NT$66.20 after the

had suffered a head injury while stumping for Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>As the information was sketchy, Hu said, he immediately asked his supporters at
his own rally in Taichung to pray for Lien and he called off the gathering ahead
of the 10:00 p.m. schedule.</P>
      <P>"I don't think anyone can fault me for my actions at that time, and I can assure
you no one was trying to take advantage of the incident," he said.</P>
      <P>He said he acted restrained upon hearing the news.</P>
      <P>"If I had any intentions of using the incident, I would have extended my
campaign rally until 11: 00 p.m. and played up the tragic events in Taipei to
produce a different result," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu, who knows the Liens well,0 won a third term with a margin of just over

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian was moved from a detention center on the
outskirts of Taipei to a regular prison in neighboring Taoyuan County Thursday
to begin serving his corruption sentences.</P>
      <P>The transfer followed a November decision by the Supreme Court to uphold Chen's
convictions in two high-profile bribery cases involving a land deal in Lungtan,
Taoyuan County and the appointment of a chairwoman of Taipei 101 tower.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court sentenced Chen to a total of 19 years in prison for the two
bribery charges Nov. 11 in the first final verdict in a string of corruption
cases implicating him and his wife, Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>Chen -- the first president from the pro-independence opposition Democratic
Progressive Party -- is the first former president of the Republic of China to
be imprisoned for graft.</P>
      <P>The disgraced former president had an emotional meeting with his son Chen Chih-
chung Thursday as he awaited his transfer from the Tucheng Detention Center to
the Taipei Prison in Gueishan, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-chung, who himself is pursuing a political career following his
election as a member of the city council of the southern port city of Kaohsiung
last weekend, said after emerging from the meeting that his father was very
worried about his wife's health.</P>
      <P>The wheelchair-bound former first lady was also given a combined 19-year prison
sentence for her roles in the two bribery cases, but it remains unclear when she
will begin serving her time.</P>
      <P>Judicial authorities said previously that they will decide after receiving her
conviction documents at which prison in the Kaohsiung area she should be
confined or whether to grant her probation on medical grounds.</P>
      <P>Dozens of supporters gathered outside the prison, chanting "A-Bian is not
guilty" and "A-Bian Go Go, " referring to the former president by his nickname
and protesting his conviction. Some held up placards proclaiming that Taiwan is
an independent county separate from China, in support of Chen's political cause.</P>
      <P>In its Nov. 11 ruling, the Supreme Court also sent three other graft cases
involving the former first couple to the Taiwan High court for retrial --
embezzling state funds, laundering money and taking bribes in connection  with
the Nangang Exhibition Hall construction project.</P>
      <P>Chen's  office issued a statement  Thursday  blasting  his convictions as
"politically motivated" and accused the pro-China Kuomintang administration of
interfering in the court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The office also announced the establishment of a panel to continue promoting
Taiwan's de jure independence and insisting on Chen's innocence.</P>

      <P>Visiting American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Raymond Burghardt referred
Thursday to remarks he made in California 18 months ago that he would count
former President Chen Shui-bian's alleged irregularities, if true, as a betrayal
of the friendship between them.</P>
      <P>Burghardt, who had earlier in the day called on Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, was commenting to the press on the removal that day of Chen from the
Taipei Detention Center, where he had been held since late 2009, to the Taipei
Prison to serve a 19-year jail term.</P>
      <P>"In a speech in California, I was asked about my feelings about President Chen
going to jail, and what I said was that, as someone who had been his friend, if
it was true... that he did what they said he did, then I felt that our
friendship had been betrayed," Burghardt said.</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-jen, were each sentenced to 19-year jail terms by the
Supreme Court last month for taking bribes in a land acquisition deal and the

      <P>The safety of Taiwanese businessmen in China should be ensured and protected in
the proposed agreements that are scheduled to be signed in upcoming cross-Taiwan
Strait talks later this month, lawmakers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Text should be included in a proposed investment protection agreement Taiwan
hopes to sign with China later this month, along with a medical cooperation
agreement, to ensure China upholds two international human rights covenants it
has signed, lawmakers on the Economics Committee proposed in a draft resolution.</P>
      <P>"The safety of Taiwanese businessmen in China can be guaranteed only if Chinese
law enforcement is in line with the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural
Rights it has signed, " said Pan Meng-an, a legislator of the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during an interpellation session.</P>
      <P>Statistics of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , which is charged with
dealing with matters concerning Taiwan's exchanges with China, show that 2,250
of 3,969 complaints filed by China-based Taiwanese businessmen from 1991 to
October 2010 were related to personal safety. The number was more than the 1,719
complaints filed in connection with trade disputes.</P>
      <P>Among the 2,250 safety-related cases, 649 Taiwanese nationals were detained, 396
were reported missing and 103 were killed.</P>
      <P>Legislators expressed concern ahead of the sixth round of cross-strait talks,
which reportedly will be held Dec. 16-17 in Taipei. Despite the assurances of
government officials present at the interpellation session, including Minister
of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-hsiang and Mainland Affairs Council Deputy Chairman
Kao Charng, that the protection of Taiwanese nationals is the government's
priority, they said that it will be difficult to include this demand in the
agreement.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan wants the Chinese authorities to handle trade disputes in the spirit of
the two international covenants, but investment protection agreements usually do
not cover this field, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>Compared with investment protection, safety protection is even more urgent for
the bilateral negotiation agenda because Taiwanese businessmen have been
complaining about the issue for years, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wu
Ching-chih said, adding that some businessmen have had to flee China in the dead
of night to avoid being illegally detained by Chinese law enforcement
authorities.</P>
      <P>However, Ting Shou-chung, also a KMT legislator, warned that if Taiwan insists
on including the safety aspect in the text of the agreement, the negotiations
could collapse.</P>
      <P>"In any case, China does not abide by international covenants, " he said.</P>

surgery, and micro-plastic surgery, said Hsu Wen-lin, the hospital's vice
president.</P>
      <P>Tsai Shih-tzu, director of the hospital's Preventive Medicine Center, said more
and more people are taking the approach that "an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure, " and are having health checks as the best form of prevention.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tsai said, an increasing number of people are seeking to improve
their appearance and lives through plastic surgery or micro plastic surgery.</P>
      <P>"Medical tourism packages can meet these people's needs, " he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu Hsiang-ming, director of the Hualien County Government Department
of Health, noted that Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and India have all been
aggressively promoting medical tourism and have generated commendably high
values of business.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tourism and medical resources are by no means inferior to those
countries' and it would be regrettable if Taiwan decided to sit idly by and not
develop its medical tourism, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Film on immigrant social activism to be released Saturday</HEADLINE>

      <P>Holding the microphone tightly with both hands, Yadrung Chiou's voice resonated
throughout the entire room as she gave her usual rallying cry -- "sisters, let
us stand up and don't be afraid."</P>
      <P>Although small in stature, Chiou is seen as giant when it comes to fighting for
the rights of immigrants, especially other women like her from Southeast Asian
countries married to Taiwanese men.</P>
      <P>"We have to stand up proud and strong so people can hear our voices. Don't be
afraid to speak out and fight for your rights,"said the slightly built Chiou, a
social activist who came to Taiwan from Thailand 12 years ago as the bride of a
Taiwanese man.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference to promote the release of a film "Let's Not Be
Afraid," Chiou said the 47-minute documentary is the first in the country
produced entirely by the members of the TransAsia Sisters Association (TASAT).</P>
      <P>The film, which took nearly 15 years to complete, chronicles the personal
experiences of so-called "foreign brides" and their struggle over the last
decade to transform from voiceless victims into powerful activists.</P>
      <P>Some of the footage was shot in 2007 when a TASAT group took to the streets in
protest against what it said was the inherently discriminatory staffing of the
National Immigration Agency (NIA).</P>
      <P>The group said that the NIA's staffing of 70 percent policemen implied that the
agency needed a strong police presence to deal with matters pertaining to
immigrants.</P>
      <P>Throughout the years, the group has also lodged numerous protests against
government regulations such as the one requiring immigrant wives to provide
proof of substantial financial assets before they can apply for a residency
permit and thus seek employment.</P>
      <P>TASTAT Director Phayao Su, who is also a "Thai-wanese" said the documentary
demonstrates the courage and hard work of immigrant woman in Taiwan as well as
the love and acceptance they are given by their families.</P>
      <P>"At first, I cried tears of sadness because of the prejudice against me. But
now, I am crying because I am so moved by the strong love the (TASTAT) sisters
have for each other," she said.</P>
      <P>With the help of the office of an internationally famous movie director Hou
Hsiao-hsien, the women filmed, edited, and produced the documentary on their
own.</P>
      <P>Hou said he was impressed with the group's tenacity and determination to get the
job done.</P>
      <P>Taiwan would be a much better place if everyone had the same follow-through zeal
as the TASTAT sisters, he said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese title of the film is "Sister, mai dong gua" which in Mandarin
translates as "sell winter melons" but in Thai means "don't be afraid."</P>
      <P>The documentary will be shown Saturday night at SPOT Taipei Film House at 6: 00
p.m. and will be followed by a seminar on various immigration issues. The
panelists will include professors and members of TASAT.</P>

      <P>The number of generals in the military will be trimmed by 101 by early 2015,
Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan's National Defense and Foreign
Affairs Committee, Kao said that the country now has 393 generals out of a total
of some 200,000 military personnel and that the number will be reduced to 292 in
line with a government effort to streamline the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang questioned why Taiwan maintains
a higher ratio of generals to total military officers than the United Sates,
saying the ratio is 0.76 percent in Taiwan at present, compared to 0.43 percent
in the U.S. in 2007.</P>
      <P>Kao said in response that the 101 generals to be trimmed are all under the
jurisdiction of his ministry and that "there is still room" for a further
reduction in the number of high-ranking officers, as many generals work for
other agencies, including the Presidential Office, the Coast Guard
Administration, the National Security Bureau and the Education Ministry.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Sean C. Chen on Thursday ruled out the possibility of dissolving
the National Stabilization Fund in the wake of its recent retreat from the stock
market.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Chen said the fund was set up with
the aim of " helping to maintain a stable stock market" rather than earning
money.</P>
      <P>The fund is like the "fire extinguisher" in a building -- it must be in place
even if there is no blaze at the moment, he said.</P>
      <P>Operators of the fund purchased a total of around NT$60 billion (US$1.9 billion)
worth of shares on the local stock market between September and December in 2008
when the global financial crisis hit, he noted.</P>
      <P>A recovering economy and booming stock market have prompted the operators to
sell the stocks from the beginning of this year, Chen said. So far all of the
stocks have been released on the market, earning NT$31.9 billion (US$1.1
billion), he added.</P>
      <P>If the NT$1.8 billion in dividends from the stocks is included, the investment-
return rate will be as high as 56 percent, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The government has been closely monitoring the European debt crisis and the
situation on the Korean Peninsula and will reactivate the stabilization fund if
necessary, he said.</P>

      <P>Listening to Mozart's piano concertos for eight minutes a day can reduce the
frequency of seizures in young epilepsy patients by 30 percent, a study here
shows.</P>
      <P>The study, carried out by Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU) in collaboration
with scholars at National Sun Yat-sen University's music department, examined
the effects of Mozart's music on epilepsy children 17 years old and under.</P>
      <P>Lin Chang-lung, a child neurologist at KMU Hospital and a member of the research
team, said brain wave tests on 58 epilepsy patients in the age group showed that
the frequency of abnormally excited electrical signals in the brain dropped an
average of 30 percent in 47 of them, after listening to eight minutes of
Mozart's piano concerto K448.</P>
      <P>In a second-phase test over a longer period, it was found that the longer the
music healing lasted, the better its healing effects on the patients.</P>
      <P>"Six months would be the best time span for music healing, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>In a third-phase test, 18 patients with a high frequency of seizures or
convulsions were found to have experienced a whopping 53 percent reduction in
frequency after a long period of music healing, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Yang Jui-cheng, another team member and child neurology expert at KMU Hospital,
said the study found that in addition to "markedly improving" epilepsy in
children, the music can also help to reduce patients' medication dosage and side
effects.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, foreign studies have shown that music can help cure Parkinson
disease, dementia, strokes, sleeping disorders and attention deficiency
syndrome, and has a good record of improving patients' quality of life.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a medical journal reported that college students who took an IQ test
after listening to Mozart's piano concerto K448 had scored eight or nine points

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police investigators said Thursday that the brief disappearance of a key witness
in the election-eve shooting of aruling Kuomintang (KMT) official's son will not
affect their probe.</P>
      <P>Tu Yi-kai, campaign manager for Xinbei City Council candidate Chen Hung-yuan,
became a hot news item after he left for Shanghai Wednesday with police consent,
returning the following day.</P>
      <P>Sean Lien, son of KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, was shot in the head while
stumping for Chen at a campaign rally Nov. 26. The gunman, Lin Cheng-wei, was
arrested on the spot.</P>
      <P>Police found that the gunman called Tu three times before going up on the
campaign stage and shooting Lien at close range. Tu thus has become a key
witness in the case.</P>
      <P>Tu's departure from Taiwan was seen by some as an attempt to flee to China, and
opposition lawmakers demanded an explanation from the government.</P>
      <P>Kuan Bi-ling,  a legislator  of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), speculated that Tu might have gone to China to "bury evidence" and that
he might not even be safe in China.</P>
      <P>She said she did not know whether police investigators were incompetent or had
purposely let Tu go and she demanded that the government officials responsible
step down for botching the probe.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin You-chang, describing Tu's exit from Taiwan as "incredible, "
also demanded an explanation from the judicial authorities, as well as from the
KMT.</P>
      <P>Hardly had the opposition politicians finished lodging their complaints,
however, than Tu returned to a crowd of reporters at the Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>Tu immediately complained about some media reports that he was asked by the
suspect to appear at the police station soon after the shooting and to hire a
lawyer for the shooter.</P>
      <P>"Such reports are nonsense! " said Tu, who insisted that he had received police
approval before leaving for Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The police investigation has found that Tu and Lin know each other but are not
close friends.</P>
      <P>The investigation results also show that Lin did call Tu three times prior to
shooting Lien, but that Tu did not take any of the calls.</P>
      <P>Police were also focusing their efforts to find out who provided Lin with the
weapon used to commit the crime. (By Johnson Sun, Bien Chin-feng, Justin Su,

      <P>Ford Motor said Thursday it is planning to launch four new models in the Taiwan
market over the next three years on expectations that the local auto market will
continue to grow steadily.</P>
      <P>With domestic demand rising on Taiwan's  economic rebound, vehicle sales on the
island in 2010 will rise to about 330,000 units from the 290,000 units recorded
last year, said Ford Lio Ho Motor Co. Ltd., the Taiwan subsidiary of the U.S.
auto maker.</P>
      <P>Ford Lio Ho rolled out its 2 millionth car in Taiwan Thursday after 38 years in
business.</P>
      <P>The company is a joint venture with the Lio Ho Group and is 70 percent owned by
Ford Motor. It was set up in 1972 and has become one of Ford Motor's important
overseas production bases, it said.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony to unveil the 2 millionth car, Joe Hinrichs, Ford Motor Group Vice
President and President for Asia Pacific and Africa, said buying in the Taiwan
auto market is currently strong and is expected to grow further in the future.</P>
      <P>The company has announced plans to launch four new models, but Hinrichs declined
to disclose any further details.</P>
      <P>Hinrichs said sales of Ford's Asia Pacific and African markets in the first 10
months of this year rose 40 percent from a year earlier, with profit hitting
US$166 million.</P>
      <P>Last year, Ford's Asia Pacific and African division incurred net losses of US$86
million.</P>
      <P>However, the Asia Pacific and African regions are expected to serve as a key
driver of growth in the global auto market over the next 10 years, with China,
India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations making the most significant
contribution to the growth, according to Hinrichs.</P>
      <P>This year, in the 10 months to October, Ford's sales in the China market rose 40
percent from a year earlier, he added.</P>

      <P>AsusTek Computer Inc. said Thursday that it will launch a tablet computer priced
at NT$30,370 (US$1,000) early next year, as part of the world's fifth-largest PC
maker's efforts to meet the demand of the high-end market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based company will begin selling the 12-inch tablet device running
the Windows 7 operating system in the first quarter of 2011, although the local
market is not included in the first allocation of units, AsusTek Senior Product
Manager Jose Liao told reporters at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"Our tablet PCs will be available in Taiwan in March or April next year," Liao
said.</P>
      <P>At the same press conference, AsusTek announced the launch of a series of
lightweight laptops that will be sold during the Dec. 4-12 "ICT Month, " a
technology fair in which 350 companies, including giants such as Acer, AsusTek,
Sony,  HTC and Epson, will be represented.</P>
      <P>Many companies are expected to offer discounts to consumers visiting the fair,
which has free entry, according to the organizer.</P>
      <P>AsusTek expects to sell 13,000 devices at the show, including regular notebooks,
netbooks and e-readers, a gain of 30 percent compared to last year's show, said
AsusTek Sales General Manager Kevin Lin.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company's total shipments of notebooks are forecast to grow by
at least 20 percent this year, although the actual number will not be disclosed
until closer to the end of the year, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Asked about the notebook prospects in the first quarter of 2011, Lin said they
are not bad because of strong demand in the Chinese market. People will begin to

      <P>Specialties at the Taipei International Flora Expo that showcase Taiwan's
floriculture prowess, technological strength and environmental awareness are
commercially available as souvenirs, an expo official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of the specialties, paper-thin flexible speakers developed by Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) being used at the popular
Pavilion of Dreams have been probably the biggest draw for expo goers.</P>
      <P>The speakers -- basically a sandwich of paper and metal filled with an electro-
active polymer that contracts and expands with an audio signal's electric field
-- have been a research program of the ITRI since 2006 and was used and
displayed for the first time at the expo.</P>
      <P>At 22 cm by 18 cm, the units available for expo visitors as souvenirs are about
half the size of those displayed at the Pavilion of Dreams, according to the
company in charge of marketing the product.</P>
      <P>The speakers, which can be connected to an MP3 player or an iPhone, cost
NT$1,980 (US$66) per set of two.</P>
      <P>Another hot attraction at the expo -- "eternal flowers" made of genuine cut
flowers -- is also available as a souvenir.</P>
      <P>Bouquets of roses, dendrobium and hydrangea arranged with baby's breath have
been processed using a quick freeze-drying technology and are available with all
their vivid freshness that will last forever, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Other sought-after souvenir items include thermo drink bottles, expo passports
and bracelets.</P>
      <P>In related news, 4.31 million admission tickets had been sold as of Thursday,
nearly one month after the expo's official Nov. 6 opening, according to Ting
Hsi-yung, the expo's general producer.</P>
      <P>Total revenues had reached NT$820 million as of that day, with some NT$200
million coming from the sale of food, beverages, farm products and souvenirs,
Ting said.</P>
      <P>The number of souvenir items exceeds 1,500 and is expected to be increased to
2,000 in the near future, he added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei International Flora Expo 2010 -- which has not only added much needed
color to the capital city's environment but has also solidified Taiwan's place
as the world's "flower kingdom" -- is scheduled to run until April 25, 2011.</P>
      <P>It is home to 14 pavilions and more than 800 varieties of orchids, 329 million
stems of locally developed plant varieties, from impatiens and bamboo to bonsai
trees, as well as award-winning landscape and gardening designs from 22
countries and 26 cities.</P>

      <P>The "Eyes  of the Maokong  Gondola"  cabins  have  proved overwhelmingly popular

      <P>Wearing blue jeans and enjoying tea at a Maokong teahouse, Hau praised the

      <P>He said that among the 7,863 Gondola systems produced by POMA, a world leader in

      <P>"We will keep working on transport services and urban renewal projects in areas

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday the diaries of the country's two late
presidents -- Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo -- should be treated as
national property in terms of their contents.</P>
      <P>"Legally, the diaries are the private assets of the Chiang family, but judging
from their contents and from a historical and cultural perspective, they should
be regarded as public property," Ma said in response to a media inquiry after
attending an international seminar on the Chiang Kai-shek diaries and history of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks came two days after a row broke out among family members of the
Chiang clan over the rights to handle the diaries, which have been kept at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University in San Francisco since 2005.</P>
      <P>A granddaughter of Chiang Ching-kuo issued a statement Nov. 30 challenging the
right of another relative to sign over the diaries to the U.S. research
institute.</P>
      <P>Ma said he earnestly hopes that the late presidents' family members can settle
their dispute soon so that the invaluable diaries can be published for academic
study and public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the dispute arose five years ago and mediatory efforts have so
far failed to achieve any positive results.</P>
      <P>The 55-volume diaries of Chiang Kai-shek span 1917 through 1972, a period that
included a war of resistance against Japanese invasion, a civil war with the
Chinese Communists and Chiang's exile to Taiwan and rule over the island.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo's diaries began in 1939 and ended in 1979, a period during
which he succeeded his father, serving as premier and then president of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"All those diaries are national treasures. Few political leaders in the world
have so patiently and consistently written diaries for such a long time. The
diaries should be preserved for academic study, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued through the law firm Baker &amp; Mckenzie, Chiang You-mei,
the daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo's deceased eldest son, said that Chiang Fang
Chih-yi, widow of Chiang Ching-kuo's third son, had acted without the consent of
the other legal inheritors of the late presidents' estate when she entrusted the
diaries to the Hoover Institution Jan. 10, 2005.</P>
      <P>"I will not remain silent on the issue any longer, and will take legal action if
necessary," Chiang You-mei stated.</P>
      <P>She claimed that Chiang Fang Chih-yi had disregarded the rights of the other
inheritors, whom she said, "do not recognize and cannot accept her actions.</P>
      <P>Regarding publication of the diaries, Chiang You-mei said most of the inheritors
are not opposed to the move, but that the matter of Chiang Fang Chih-yi's
unauthorized action must first be resolved in order to avoid any unnecessary
trouble in the future.</P>
      <P>With Chiang Fang Chih-yi's agreement, the Institute of Modern History under
Taiwan's highest research body Academia Sinica originally planned to published
part of the diaries of Chiang Kai-shek Thursday. But the plan has been suspended
after the inheritance row came into spotlight.</P>
      <P>The institute said it will wait until the dispute is resolved to publish the
diaries.</P>

      <P>The operator of the cable car system, located near scenic Sun Moon Lake in
central Taiwan's Nantou County, congratulated Wu Pei-ju as its 3 millionth
passenger when she swiped her ticket through the turnstile.</P>
      <P>Wu, a real state broker from southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, said while being
presented with a congratulatory garland that she had been feeling lucky. "I have
had a nervous tic in my eyelid for three days, but I didn't expect to win this

      <P>Wu also won several prizes provided by the company, including lifetime free
admission to the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, free rides for life on the
ropeway and one night's accommodation at the five-star Lalu Hotel.</P>
      <P>Two other lucky riders were the 2.99 millionth and the 3.01 millionth
passengers. Chen Kuei-lan and Chen Kuei-li both won a year's free admission to
the aboriginal theme park and a year's-worth of free ropeway rides.</P>
      <P>The ropeway has caused tourist arrivals in the area to increased rapidly and it
is expected that visitor numbers will break 8 million before the end of the
year, according to Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area Administration Director
Tseng Kuo-chi.</P>
      <P>The 1.877-meter ropeway, which officially began operating in December 2009, is
the country's first build-operate-own ropeway system.</P>

      <P>Thousands of Chinese nationals visited Taiwan to have health checkups in the
first eight months of this year, taking advantage of the medical tourism offered
to Chinese tourists since 2008, a health official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tallies show that more than 3,000 Chinese who arrived as part of tour groups
received health checkups during their visits to Taiwan in the eight months, said
Shih Chung-liang, director of the Bureau of Medical Affairs under the Department
of Health, at a conference on cross-Taiwan Strait medicine and healthcare
cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chinese visitors, attracted by Taiwan's advanced medical skill and equipment,
are willing to pay as much as NT$100,000 (US$3,289) for a half-day or full-day
medical examination.</P>
      <P>Medical tourism has been working out well in terms of Chinese tourists, so is
not scheduled to be on the agenda of the next round of talks between the top
cross-strait negotiators of the two sides, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The new talks between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)
President Chen Yunlin will be held in Taipei by the end of this year, mainly to
sign accords on cross-strait medical cooperation and investment protection.</P>
      <P>It has become common for Chinese visitors to get medical checkups while here,
said Mainland Affairs Council Vice Minister Liu Te-hsun. He added that some
China-based Taiwanese businessmen also arrange checkups for their employees when
they make trips to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top health official said Thursday that China has agreed to his
"five noes" principle in the signing of a medical and health cooperation
agreement with Taiwan later this month.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH)  Minister Yaung Chih-liang told lawmakers that as
long as he is health minister, he will make sure all of the five principles in
the cross-strait agreement will prevail, both in letter and in spirit.</P>
      <P>The five principles are: that Taiwan will not allow Chinese medical
professionals to take local exams for licenses; that Taiwan will not allow
Chinese medical professionals to practice here; that Taiwan will not allow
Chinese investment in building and running hospitals; that Taiwan's national
health insurance program will not pay for medical bills incurred by its citizens
in Chinese medical facilities; and that the agreement will not contain any
provisions regarding  joint  efforts  to educate  and  cultivate  medical
professionals.</P>
      <P>In spite of Yaung's best efforts to assure lawmakers, however, the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party's Chen Chieh-ju expressed concern that Chinese
doctors will end up practicing in Taiwan in the capacity of trainees.</P>
      <P>She also voiced worry that Yaung's principles will be abandoned under increasing
pressure from China, so that he might be forced to "allow Chinese investment  in
medical services" in Taiwan and eventually to reimburse medical bills by
Taiwanese who receive treatment in Chinese medical facilities.</P>
      <P>In response to the opposition lawmaker's concerns, Yaung said the government has
strict rules on foreign medical trainees in Taiwan and additional rules that
apply to those from China.</P>
      <P>"While on a trainee program, they can only watch and cannot lay their hands on
medical equipment. If they violate the rules, the host hospitals face heavy
fines," he said.</P>
      <P>Unimpressed by Yaung's reassurances, Chen asked: "Haven't you said you will
leave your current post once the second-generation health reform bill has been
passed?"</P>
      <P>Yaung denied saying anything to that effect and said he will stay in his post.</P>
      <P>The pact, to be signed during the next round of talks between the top
negotiators on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait scheduled for mid-December in
Taipei, will enable the respective health authorities to alert each other of
disease outbreaks and to exchange information on food and drug safety.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed agreement, Taiwan and China will also work in concert to
study and manage the production and sale of Chinese herbal medicine and to
provide emergency medical assistance to each other's visiting nationals.</P>

      <P>The Washington Nationals might not retain the services of injury-hobbled
Taiwanese pitcher Chien-ming Wang any longer, the agency representing Wang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It seems hard to believe the Nationals will take Wang back, because they have
serious interest in free agent Brandon Webb, another pitcher with a serious
shoulder injury who has not pitched in a big league game in almost two years, "
Lee Wei-chuan, an agent with Octagon Baseball, which represents Wang, quoted a
news report on the Nationals official website as indicating Thursday.</P>
      <P>Whatever decision is finally made, Octagon Baseball will seek a contract for
Wang with a Major League Baseball (MLB) club, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The deadline for MLB clubs to spell out whether they are continuing player
contracts is noon Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>Wang has played only 27 games in the past three seasons because of foot and
shoulder injuries, the report said. It quoted a baseball source as saying that
Wang will listen to offers from other clubs, but his first choice is to stay
with the Nationals.</P>
      <P>In a move described as more of a gamble than a purchase by a Washington
newspaper,  the Nationals signed an incentive-laden one-year deal with the 29
-year-old right-hander in February this year, agreeing to pay Wang a guaranteed
US$2 million, with up to US$3.2 million in incentives for the 2010 season.</P>
      <P>Among the incentives, Wang would receive US$250,000 if he remained on the
Nationals' MLB roster for more than 60 consecutive days and another US$200,000
if he won the Comeback Player of the Year Award.</P>
      <P>Wang won more games than any other big league pitcher (38) between 2006 and
2007, but his injuries had limited him to just 27 appearances over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>In 2009, when he earned US$5 million, Wang was 1-6 with an atrocious 9.64 ERA
before being shut down for the season because of his shoulder.</P>
      <P>Even prior to the injury, however, Wang's sinker was clearly not as effective as
in the past, tailing sideways rather than darting downward, making it much
easier for batters to hit.</P>
      <P>The Nationals hoped that his woes were simply the result of Wang not being in
top shape. He suffered a Lisfranc injury to his right foot in July 2008 and had
trouble regaining his fitness level in early 2009 after being told by the New
York Yankees -- his previous team -- not to do his typical off-season leg
exercises.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Ming Chuan University (MCU) has received accreditation from the Middle
States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) to become the first university in
Asia to be accredited in the U.S. education system, MCU President Lee Chuan said
in a press conference in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the MSCHE, one of six regional accrediting bodies in the
U.S., granted MCU the honor Nov. 18 after more than five years of assessment
carried out between 2006 and 2010. World-famous universities including Columbia
University, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania are
accredited by the MSCHE, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>"The accreditation serves as a signal that the quality of Taiwan's higher
education is now getting positive attention on the international stage," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the achievement means that the academic degrees and credits taken by
MCU students are now acknowledged in all of the 524 MSCHE-accredited
universities, increasing the opportunities of MCU students to be accepted in
U.S. graduate schools and to find jobs on the global market.</P>
      <P>Moreover, U.S. students studying at MCU are able to apply for scholarships and
student loans offered by the U.S. government, taking effect from the day MCU was
granted accreditation, he said.</P>
      <P>Tony Lin, director of the Ministry of Education's Bureau of International
Cultural and Educational Relations, noted that the Malaysian government has yet
to recognize Taiwan's academic degrees, but said the accreditation might help
Malaysia reconsider its decision.</P>
      <P>"This is more important than just an educational achievement, " Sheila Paskman,
American Institute in Taiwan spokeswoman and chief of the institute's Public
Affairs Section, said in the press conference.</P>
      <P>"Although we are very excited about the increasing exchanges of students that
the new accreditation will bring, we are also excited because this is very
important for long-term relations between the U.S and Taiwan, for we will be
able to understand more about each other," she said.</P>

      <P>Ridership of the Maokong Gondola has doubled in the past month after the
introduction of 30 glass-floored cabins, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Thursday
during a visit to the scenic Maokong area.</P>
      <P>The "Eyes  of the Maokong  Gondola"  cabins  have  proved overwhelmingly popular
among the public, said Hau.</P>
      <P>Wearing blue jeans and enjoying tea at a Maokong teahouse, Hau praised the
gondola as "the best of its kind in the world. "</P>
      <P>He said that among the 7,863 Gondola systems produced by POMA, a world leader in
cable-driven lift systems, the Maokong Gondola has been recognized as having the
highest availability by the French company's president, Jean Gauthier.</P>
      <P>"We will keep working on transport services and urban renewal projects in areas
surrounding the gondola to attract more visitors, " Hau said.</P>
      <P>The one-way fare of the special cabins, bought at a cost of NT$275,000
(US$9,000) each, is just NT$50.</P>
      <P>The Maokong Gondola, which suffered a service hiatus of 18 months until this
March due to safety concerns, has provided over 7.58 million rides to tourists
since it was inaugurated in 2007, according to the Taipei Rapid Transit
Corporation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Diaries of two Chiangs are public property: president</HEADLINE>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday the diaries of the country's two late
presidents -- Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo -- should be treated as
national property in terms of their contents.</P>
      <P>"Legally, the diaries are the private assets of the Chiang family, but judging
from their contents and from a historical and cultural perspective, they should
be regarded as public property," Ma said in response to a media inquiry after
attending an international seminar on the Chiang Kai-shek diaries and history of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks came two days after a row broke out among family members of the
Chiang clan over the rights to handle the diaries, which have been kept at the
Hoover Institution at Stanford University in San Francisco since 2005.</P>
      <P>A granddaughter of Chiang Ching-kuo issued a statement Nov. 30 challenging the
right of another relative to sign over the diaries to the U.S. research
institute.</P>
      <P>Ma said he earnestly hopes that the late presidents' family members can settle
their dispute soon so that the invaluable diaries can be published for academic
study and public scrutiny.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the dispute arose five years ago and mediatory efforts have so
far failed to achieve any positive results.</P>
      <P>The 55-volume diaries of Chiang Kai-shek span 1917 through 1972, a period that
included a war of resistance against Japanese invasion, a civil war with the
Chinese Communists and Chiang's exile to Taiwan and rule over the island.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo's diaries began in 1939 and ended in 1979, a period during
which he succeeded his father, serving as premier and then president of the ROC.</P>
      <P>"All those diaries are national treasures. Few political leaders in the world
have so patiently and consistently written diaries for such a long time. The
diaries should be preserved for academic study, " Ma said.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued through the law firm Baker &amp; Mckenzie, Chiang You-mei,
the daughter of Chiang Ching-kuo's deceased eldest son, said that Chiang Fang
Chih-yi, widow of Chiang Ching-kuo's third son, had acted without the consent of
the other legal inheritors of the late presidents' estate when she entrusted the
diaries to the Hoover Institution Jan. 10, 2005.</P>
      <P>"I will not remain silent on the issue any longer, and will take legal action if
necessary," Chiang You-mei stated.</P>
      <P>She claimed that Chiang Fang Chih-yi had disregarded the rights of the other
inheritors, whom she said, "do not recognize and cannot accept her actions.</P>
      <P>Regarding publication of the diaries, Chiang You-mei said most of the inheritors
are not opposed to the move, but that the matter of Chiang Fang Chih-yi's
unauthorized action must first be resolved in order to avoid any unnecessary
trouble in the future.</P>
      <P>With Chiang Fang Chih-yi's agreement, the Institute of Modern History under
Taiwan's highest research body Academia Sinica originally planned to published
part of the diaries of Chiang Kai-shek Thursday. But the plan has been suspended
after the inheritance row came into spotlight.</P>
      <P>The institute said it will wait until the dispute is resolved to publish the
diaries.</P>

passenger when she swiped her ticket through the turnstile.</P>
      <P>Wu, a real state broker from southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, said while being
presented with a congratulatory garland that she had been feeling lucky. "I have
had a nervous tic in my eyelid for three days, but I didn't expect to win this
prize," she said.</P>
      <P>Wu also won several prizes provided by the company, including lifetime free
admission to the Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village, free rides for life on the
ropeway and one night's accommodation at the five-star Lalu Hotel.</P>
      <P>Two other lucky riders were the 2.99 millionth and the 3.01 millionth
passengers. Chen Kuei-lan and Chen Kuei-li both won a year's free admission to
the aboriginal theme park and a year's-worth of free ropeway rides.</P>
      <P>The ropeway has caused tourist arrivals in the area to increased rapidly and it
is expected that visitor numbers will break 8 million before the end of the
year, according to Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area Administration Director
Tseng Kuo-chi.</P>
      <P>The 1.877-meter ropeway, which officially began operating in December 2009, is

Wang with a Major League Baseball (MLB) club, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The deadline for MLB clubs to spell out whether they are continuing player
contracts is noon Dec. 3.</P>
      <P>Wang has played only 27 games in the past three seasons because of foot and
shoulder injuries, the report said. It quoted a baseball source as saying that
Wang will listen to offers from other clubs, but his first choice is to stay
with the Nationals.</P>
      <P>In a move described as more of a gamble than a purchase by a Washington
newspaper,  the Nationals signed an incentive-laden one-year deal with the 29
-year-old right-hander in February this year, agreeing to pay Wang a guaranteed
US$2 million, with up to US$3.2 million in incentives for the 2010 season.</P>
      <P>Among the incentives, Wang would receive US$250,000 if he remained on the
Nationals' MLB roster for more than 60 consecutive days and another US$200,000
if he won the Comeback Player of the Year Award.</P>
      <P>Wang won more games than any other big league pitcher (38) between 2006 and
2007, but his injuries had limited him to just 27 appearances over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>In 2009, when he earned US$5 million, Wang was 1-6 with an atrocious 9.64 ERA
before being shut down for the season because of his shoulder.</P>
      <P>Even prior to the injury, however, Wang's sinker was clearly not as effective as
in the past, tailing sideways rather than darting downward, making it much
easier for batters to hit.</P>
      <P>The Nationals hoped that his woes were simply the result of Wang not being in
top shape. He suffered a Lisfranc injury to his right foot in July 2008 and had
trouble regaining his fitness level in early 2009 after being told by the New
York Yankees -- his previous team -- not to do his typical off-season leg
exercises.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ming Chuan becomes Asia's first U.S.-accredited university</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ming Chuan University (MCU) has received accreditation from the Middle
States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) to become the first university in
Asia to be accredited in the U.S. education system, MCU President Lee Chuan said
in a press conference in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee explained that the MSCHE, one of six regional accrediting bodies in the
U.S., granted MCU the honor Nov. 18 after more than five years of assessment
carried out between 2006 and 2010. World-famous universities including Columbia
University, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania are
accredited by the MSCHE, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>"The accreditation serves as a signal that the quality of Taiwan's higher
education is now getting positive attention on the international stage," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the achievement means that the academic degrees and credits taken by
MCU students are now acknowledged in all of the 524 MSCHE-accredited
universities, increasing the opportunities of MCU students to be accepted in
U.S. graduate schools and to find jobs on the global market.</P>
      <P>Moreover, U.S. students studying at MCU are able to apply for scholarships and
student loans offered by the U.S. government, taking effect from the day MCU was
granted accreditation, he said.</P>
      <P>Tony Lin, director of the Ministry of Education's Bureau of International
Cultural and Educational Relations, noted that the Malaysian government has yet
to recognize Taiwan's academic degrees, but said the accreditation might help
Malaysia reconsider its decision.</P>
      <P>"This is more important than just an educational achievement, " Sheila Paskman,
American Institute in Taiwan spokeswoman and chief of the institute's Public
Affairs Section, said in the press conference.</P>
      <P>"Although we are very excited about the increasing exchanges of students that
the new accreditation will bring, we are also excited because this is very
important for long-term relations between the U.S and Taiwan, for we will be
able to understand more about each other," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Lessons for Beijing from Taiwan's elections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/03/10  10:51:54
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing probably has heaved a sigh of relief at the results of Taiwan's recent
municipal elections in which the ruling Kuomintang won three of the five mayoral
seats up for grabs.</P>
      <P>The narrow victory achieved by the China-friendly KMT indicates that the Taiwan
people are generally satisfied with President Ma Ying-jeou's conciliatory
approach to relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), known for its
pro-independence policy line, managed to overtake the KMT in the overall vote
count.</P>
      <P>This indicates that Taiwan's leaders might not be able to maintain their grip on
power solely with a correct and effective cross-strait policy. If there is
another change in ruling parties, the issues of national identity and cross-
strait relations could be at the forefront again.</P>
      <P>The problem lies mainly in Beijing's denial of the Republic of China's existence
as a sovereign state and its relentless suppression of the ROC's international
profile. The stronger Beijing's oppressive moves, the higher the pro-
independence sentiment in Taiwan. This is why even though President Ma's modus
vivendi approach has improved Taiwan's status at home and abroad, many people
still feel the DPP's pro-independence policy could serve as a safety valve in
Taiwan's engagement with China.</P>
      <P>We earnestly hope the Chinese leadership will carefully assess the outcome of
Taiwan's latest elections and recognize the ROC as "an equal part of China."
Only when the ROC gains a dignified status in the world can the people of Taiwan
abandon the desire to build another independent country. (Editorial abstract --

    <DATELINE>12/03/10  12:16:12
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian began serving his long prison sentences
Thursday, making history as the first former head of state in Taiwan to be
jailed for corruption.</P>
      <P>Chen's spectacular fall from grace highlights the merits of the democratic
system. It also serves as a good reference in studies on democracy.</P>
      <P>Official corruption has had a long history in traditional Chinese political
culture. In the past, most Taiwanese people did not regard political graft as a
serious crime.</P>
      <P>However, after two years of heated rhetoric by politicians and sensational
reporting in the media, more people have come to realize that political graft
should not be taken for granted and corrupt officials should not be excused.</P>
      <P>The case of A-bian (Chen's nickname) has served to strengthen Taiwan's
democratic system and rule of law.</P>
      <P>We hope A-bian will do some soul searching while he is behind bars and will
write an objective memoir of his eight years in office. (Editorial abstract --

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., the world's largest contract electronic
maker, said Friday it is planning to issue up to NT$12 billion (US$395 million)
in unsecured company bonds.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai said its board has approved the bond sale as part of efforts to boost
the company's working capital.</P>
      <P>In October, the high tech firm issued US$1 billion-worth of overseas convertible
bonds to buy production materials.</P>
      <P>"Hon Hai needs funds to further expand its operations, in particular in China,"
Hua Nan Securities analyst Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Expansion is necessary as the company expects to raise its sales by 10-20
percent per year," Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said Hon Hai is relocating its production facilities from Shenzhen on the
coast to inland Chinese areas, such as the Henan province, where labor costs are
relatively lower.</P>
      <P>According to market observers, Hon Hai has secured a large number of orders from
Apple and the funds raised from the bond sale will be used to boost production
capacity at its facilities in inland China to meet demand from Apple.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, the company is preparing to set up a comprehensive
retail network on the mainland in a bid to offset the impact from a squeezed
profit margin in the manufacturing sector due to fierce competition in the
global market.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai said the bond sales will be also used to repay its short term debts.</P>
      <P>According to Grand Cathay Securities, Hon Hai had about NT$160 billion in short
term debts as of the end of the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Miao said despite its big short term debt, Hon Hai is still financially healthy
as it is capable of generating massive revenue every year.</P>
      <P>In 2009,  Hon Hai posted NT$1.42 trillion in sales on a consolidated basis, the
highest among all Taiwan enterprises.</P>
      <P>"I expect that it will be easy for Hon Hai to raise the NT$12 billion fund
through the bond sales as investors are upbeat about the company's outlook,"
Miao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Ex-president Chen begins serving term</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/03/10  13:18:10
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian began serving his prison sentence Thursday for
corruption during his time in office, making history as Taiwan's first former
head of state to be jailed.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chen was escorted under tight security Thursday from a detention center in
Taipei County, where he had been held for 734 days, to a regular prison in
Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Dozens of supporters of the former political star gathered outside the detention
center and the prison, shouting "A-bian is innocent" and "A-bian take care."</P>
      <P>Although Chen has been deprived of the privileges for a former head of state,
the Ministry of Justice has accorded him special treatment with regard to the
prison arrangements, in light of his status as a former president.</P>
      <P>First, he was not handcuffed or shackled during the trip from the detention
center to the prison. Second, he was not required to carry his belongings
himself as other prisoners do, but bailiffs were assigned to carry them for him.
(Dec. 3, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>From this day, Chen will be identified by his inmate serial number "1020, "
instead of his name. However, he seems unable to shed his status as a former
president.</P>
      <P>When asked by a prison officer about his past experience -- a routine question
aimed at arranging suitable work for inmates -- Chen replied, "I have served as
president " and said his field of expertise is "administration."</P>
      <P>Chen appeared calm during his first day in prison and ate all the food he was
served for his first dinner there. The meal consisted of rice, stew ribs with
herbs, fried dwarf beans, tofu miso soup and coconut tart.</P>
      <P>It was arranged that he would share a 1.2 ping (3.96 square meter) cell with
another inmate. Prison officials said Chen's cellmate is a fraud convict with a
mild temperament and no political inclinations. The officials promised that the
man "will not lose his temper" even if Chen frets every day.</P>
      <P>According to sources familiar with prison affairs, the man was carefully
selected to help take care of the former president and help him adapt quickly to
prison life. (Dec. 3, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>A senior judge said Chen's time in prison will probably amount to 17 years. This
was calculated based on a 10-percent reduction of Chen's total 19-year sentence
for accepting bribes in the Lungtan land deal and the appointment of a chairman
of the Taipei Financial Center Corp. The time he spent in the detention center
can also be set off against the sentences.</P>
      <P>Chen's wheelchair-bound wife, Wu Shu-jen, who was also sentenced to a combined
19 years in the same cases, will likely be ordered next week to report to
prosecutors in preparation for imprisonment.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Era News, former Vice President Annette Lu said that
Thursday marked the most embarrassing and miserable point in Chen's life.</P>
      <P>She said Chen's imprisonment was a tragedy for him, his family, and Taiwan's
democracy. It is worth pondering why a former two-term president who was highly
popular has ended up in jail, she said.</P>
      <P>She argued that even if Chen was at fault, he should not have been made to take
all the blame. (Dec. 3, 2010).</P>

good response since it was launched Nov. 8, with many people coming from other
nearby U.S.  cities to submit their applications with the office.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.44 percent Friday, led by high-tech stocks, as
investors witnessed strong overnight performances by their counterparts in the
United States, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 38.24 points to 8,624.01, after moving between 8,618.26
and 8,659.62, on turnover of NT$158.25 billion (US$5.21 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.53 percent  after a surge on the Philadelphia
Semiconductor Index overnight, with buying focused on IC and related large-cap
stocks, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, profit-taking emerged to drag down old-economy stocks and erode the
gains after the market moved to the day's high, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,079 stocks closed up and 2,195 were down, with 354 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gains, up 1.2 percent,
while plastics and chemicals closed up 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Affected by the profit-taking, construction stocks fell 2.0 percent, paper and
pulp shares lost 1.0 percent, foodstuffs shed 0.9 percent and textiles lost 0.8
percent.</P>
      <P>Both the cement and financial sectors closed down 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"It seems that sentiment toward the global foundry business improved to some
extent after a strong showing by the U.S. semiconductor sector," TLG Asset
Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said the IC sector had previously been overshadowed by pessimism that
demand for IC and related products would weaken in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>"It turns out that global demand appears better than expected. An upbeat mood
has triggered buying at home and abroad," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the week,  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. forecast that the
foundry industry is likely to grow 14 percent next year.</P>
      <P>TSMC  rose  3.17  percent  to NT$68.30  and rival  United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) gained 1.86 percent to NT$16.40. TSMC and UMC are the world's top two
contract chip makers.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said after the market breached the key 8,600-point level,
technical pressure accumulated, prompting many investors to stay on the
sidelines.</P>
      <P>"Investors had better exercise caution at the moment," he said.</P>
      <P>Among the property developers, Prince Housing shed 2.65 percent to NT$25.70 and
Cathay Real Estate fell 2.49 percent to close at NT$17.65.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government studying ways to tax property profiteering</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is studying measures to levy land transaction
taxes on real estate that changes hands several times within a year, in an
effort to stem profiteering in the housing market, MOF officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>The ministry is considering drafting a law to regulate and permit such a tax,
which will not apply to real estate purchased for self-use, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The government was prompted to try harder to crack down on rampant profiteering
in the real estate market after a housing unit of the Hung Sheng Treasure Palace
residential complex on Renai Road in downtown Taipei was sold at an astronomical
price of NT$206 million (US$6.79 million) per ping (3.3 square meters) during a
foreclosure auction Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>Treasure Palace is one of the most expensive  residential complexes in the
capital and home to many celebrities.</P>
      <P>The deal is, however, almost tax-free, with the government able to obtain just
NT$72,000 from the housing tax based on the housing unit's publicly assessed
land value, which is just NT$6 million, according to a report by the United
Daily Evening News on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials explained Friday that under the existing income tax laws, the
capital gains from land transactions are tax-free, and that the government only
levies taxes on land value increment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the existing regulations, an assessment of the land value is
renewed once a year. If a plot of land changes hands many times within a year,
the new owners do not have to pay the land value appreciation tax because the
land value is still at the same level, the officials said.</P>
      <P>"This means tax-free for all land transactions," they said.</P>
      <P>This phenomenon indirectly encourages profiteering trading, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Sean Chen has revealed that in principle, the government will levy
taxes on real estate "trading" rather than on purchases of real estate for
personal use in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, asked about media reports Friday that said the MOF will levy a so-
called "windfall profit tax" of as high as 30 percent on transactions for real
estate that is purchased and sold within one year, MOFA officials denied that
the ministry is planning to impose such a high tax.</P>
      <P>If new taxes are levied, their target will be land speculators, not those who
buy houses to live in themselves, the officials added.</P>

      <P>Several firms in California's Silicon Valley have expressed interest in listings
on Taiwan's over-the-counter (OTC) market, the GreTai Securities Market (GTSM)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>A delegation organized by the GTSM, which operates the OTC market, and the
Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) are visiting the U.S. high-tech hub to encourage
firms there to go public in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The delegation conducted two roadshows in Silicon Valley Nov. 30 and Dec.  1 to
brief U.S.  attendees about Taiwan's business environment and regulations
related to fundraising and listings by foreign companies, the GTSM said.</P>
      <P>It said the two conferences received a warm response, with attendance by more
than 100 representatives from Silicon Valley firms.</P>
      <P>In addition to the roadshows, the GTSM delegates also visited nine Silicon
Valley companies in the biotech, electronics, Internet and communications
sectors.</P>
      <P>According to the GTSM, several companies expressed interest in listing on the
OTC market.</P>
      <P>It is the third consecutive year the GTSM has organized roadshows in Silicon
Valley to attract high-tech firms there to list in Taiwan, as the TWSE has an
ambition of transforming itself into a tech-heavy NASDAQ-like market in the
region.</P>
      <P>The TWSE said that due to the presence to boost Taiwan's international
visibility,  Silicon Valley already has a better understanding of the local
capital market.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to conclude its visit Friday and to return to Taiwan
the following Monday, the GTSM said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Animal protection activists again urged the government Friday to ban the import
and sale of seal oil in Taiwan to help stop the slaughter of the marine mammal.</P>
      <P>The Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST) has since April been
promoting a campaign calling for the boycotting of seal and sea lion products.</P>
      <P>The drive has succeeded in getting the products off the shelves of retail chains
including Cosmed, Watsons, Pxmart and Wellcome. The online health product seller
Holy Dot Com has also stopped supplying the products, EAST officials said in a
news conference held in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>However, the products are still being sold by online retailers including Momo
Shop, ETmall and PChome Online, they said.</P>
      <P>Rebecca Aldworth, executive director of the Canada chapter of Humane Society
International, noted at the news conference that the United States, European
Union, Mexico and Croatia have all banned imports of seal oil and she expressed
hope that Taiwan will follow suit.</P>
      <P>With Canada's annual seal hunt set to kick off in four months, imposing the ban
will allow Taiwan to contribute to seal protection, Aldworth said.</P>
      <P>According to EAST, Taiwan is the fourth-largest market for Canadian seal
products. From 2003 to 2009, it imported 431,364 kg of seal oil, an amount
requiring the killing of 120,000 seals.</P>
      <P>In a shocking video shown at the news conference, a Canadian hunter was seen
bludgeoning a defenseless seal pup with a cudgel before throwing the dying
animal onto a boat.</P>
      <P>A Council of Agriculture (COA) official said an EAST-backed petition calling for
the ban on seal oil has been signed by 160,000 people. After the petition is
submitted to the COA, the council will consider the proposal and notify the
Bureau of Foreign Trade of any decision made, the official said.</P>

      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.788 and moved between NT$30.290 and NT$30.815
before the close.</P>
      <P>Dealers said that as foreign institutional investors moved more funds into
Taiwan, hunting for high-tech bargains on the stock market, the New Taiwan
dollar got further support against the U.S. dollar in the local foreign exchange
market.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index rose 0.44 percent to 8,624.01.</P>
      <P>A weaker greenback against other Asian currencies in the region amid lingering
concerns over the debt problems in Europe added downward pressure on the U.S.
currency in the local market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Anticipating that the weakness of the U.S. dollar against the local currency
will continue, foreign banks kept cutting their greenback positions in the local

      <P>The central bank stepped in again in late trading to buy into the U.S. currency,
boosting its value above NT$30.50 in its continued efforts to prevent a rapid
appreciation of the local currency and protect Taiwan's exports, they added.</P>

      <P>A government-funded research center based in central Taiwan will unveil the
country's first cycle especially designed for people with physical disabilities
Saturday, after which it will donate 10 prototypes of the machine to local
charities.</P>
      <P>The three-wheeled tricycle is powered not with the feet but with the hands and
users can carry crutches or walking sticks on the bike, according to the Cycling
and Health Tech Industry R&amp;D Center.</P>
      <P>"When the bike is not in motion, the user can apply a safety brake to stop it
from rolling away, " the Taichung-based center said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"The bike can also go backward to allow greater flexibility in parking and
general maneuverability," it said.</P>
      <P>The center created the cycle, named "Freedom, " to help people with disabilities
take part in the increasingly popular trend of cycling.</P>
      <P>"Although I am physically disabled, I actually also want to come out and enjoy
the sunshine and the natural environment (by riding a bicycle), " said Chen Jen-
hao, one of the first members of the public to road-test the Freedom.</P>
      <P>"I think it would be great if such cycles can be widely available for rental at
local tourist attractions," he added.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are more than 1 million people with physical and mental
disabilities.</P>
      <P>The prototype, which the center said has passed safety tests, is the result of a
one-year research project funded by the Ministry of Economic Affair's Department
of Industrial Technology with NT$10 million (US$330,000).</P>
      <P>A number of companies have expressed interest in the cycle, but so far, there is

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (TAIEX) is expected to hit 10,000 points before
the Republic of China's next national day Oct. 10, 2011 as its economy has
entered a "super cycle" that will extend over the next decade, Morgan Stanley
said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a research report, Morgan Stanley said that over the next 10 years, Taiwan
will aim at creating a "golden decade" by forging closer business ties with
China and positioning itself to become a greater China research and development
center.</P>
      <P>On his second anniversary in office in May this year, President Ma Ying-jeou of
the China-friendly ruling Kuomintang outlined his vision of a "golden decade"
for Taiwan's economic development through innovation, culture and environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Ma has also promised to enhance social welfare and promote peace with China to
protect the nation.</P>
      <P>The  government  "should  stay  market-friendly  with  more cross-strait
policies coinciding with a global economic recovery ahead of the 2012
presidential election," the brokerage said.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley said the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) means
growth and is "a starting point to drive growth for cross-strait trade."</P>
      <P>The ECFA Taiwan and China signed in late June has become effective, granting
preferential tariff status and easy market access to 539 items of Taiwanese
products and services.</P>
      <P>According to the brokerage,  on the improving cross-strait relations, Taiwan is
expected to generate "peace dividends" and "demographic dividends" and to see
many opportunities coming from China's growth.</P>
      <P>"We believe our 2011 TAIEX target will be realized by National Day 2011 on
capital repatriation with increased confidence," it said.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 0.44 percent at 8,624.01 Friday.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley said that with more and more Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan,
the local retail, property and tourism sectors are expected to enjoy booming
business.</P>
      <P>Among the brokerage's top picks are AU Optronics., Acer, Epistar, Richtek
Technology, Ralink, WPG Holdings, President Chain Store, Yulon Motor, Huaku
Development, Taiwan Fertilizer, Cathay Financial and Yuanta Financial.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Taiwanese doctor to work with the humanitarian  organization  Medecins
Sans Frontieres (MSF)  has published a book that documents his experience
serving in a war-torn Middle East country.</P>
      <P>The book, which was launched in Taiwan Friday, is titled "The Route Home" and
features the 45-day journey of surgeon Raymond Soong to Yemen on an MSF mission.</P>
      <P>Soong, 35, was a general surgeon at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Keelung when
he decided in August 2009 to team up with MSF, also known as Doctors Without
Borders, on a Yemen mission.</P>
      <P>During his period of service in the war-torn state, he performed dozens of
operations  on patients  injured  in air raids and bombardments.</P>
      <P>"I have always thought that I need to travel to far away places to really help
people, " said Soong, who signed up for his first MSF mission in Liberia in
2004.</P>
      <P>At the book launch, Soong's father, who is also a doctor, spoke with pride of
his son's contribution.</P>
      <P>"Although my son was not trained as an orthopedist or a gynecologist, he had to
operate with whatever resources he had, using courage and wisdom, " said Soong
Yung-kuei, Vice President of Linkou Medical Center. "This is experience that
cannot be gained in medical school."</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Chih-fu Chen, a doctor with 15-some years experience in mobile medical
missions, said decisions such as the one Soong made could make a huge difference
to people in conflict zones.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't make much of a difference if we have one doctor less in Taiwan, but
it is a matter of life and death for people in war-hit areas," he said.</P>
      <P>Although there is a huge demand for doctors in MSF, there are only two Taiwanese
doctors,  including Raymond Soong, who are registered as MSF volunteers,
according to MSF Hong Kong, which is responsible for medical recruitments in
East Asia.</P>
      <P>Raymond  Soong said that there are many reasons  why the participation rate in
Taiwan is low compared with other countries.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese doctors have the dream and passion to work with MSF, but some
hospitals are unable to guarantee them their positions when they return," he
said.</P>
      <P>Two other factors are family responsibilities and the high professional
standards required by MSF, he said.</P>

      <P>The most important task in case of the Nov. 26 election-eve shooting that caused
one death and injured a former vice president's son is to find out whether there
is a mastermind behind the incident, the minister of the interior said Friday.</P>
      <P>The investigation should focus on determining "whether there is an individual
mastermind or a ring behind the perpetrator, " since prosecutors have obtained
concrete evidence on the shooting thanks to the arrest of the assailant on the
spot and the seizing of the murder weapon, Jiang Yi-huah told reporters.</P>
      <P>Asked whether there is a deadline for solving the case, Jiang said there is no
deadline, but spelled out the government's hope that investigators will uncover
the truth as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Sean Lien, the son of former Vice President Lien Chan, was shot in the face
while stumping for a city councilor candidate during a campaign rally in Xinbei
City on the eve of the municipal elections.</P>
      <P>Lien is in stable condition at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , but
a bystander who was also shot in the head died of injuries soon after the
incident.</P>
      <P>NTUH said Friday that Lien is recovering and that his facial nerves are
functioning normally.</P>
      <P>The gunman's bullet pierced the left side of Lien's face and exited near his
right temple, causing fractures of his cheekbones and two open wounds.</P>
      <P>The shooting had a great impact on the fairness of the elections and on social
order, Jiang said, pledging reinforced efforts to prevent possible election-
related violence in the future.</P>

travelers another choice for experiencing the country through customized travel
routes, a local travel agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The organizer of the service, ezTravel, said its cooperative venture with local
taxi companies launched that day will benefit in particular backpackers from
China once the authorities give a green light to entry to Taiwan by independent
travelers.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chinese tourists are only allowed to travel in Taiwan as part of a
tour group. In an interview in July, however, Premier Wu Den-yih said the
additional opening measures will take effect late this year or early in 2011, to

      <P>"We are expecting two-thirds of our future clients to be Chinese," said Jack

      <P>The works of Taiwanese artists will reach a wider audience in Eastern Europe
when an exhibition titled "Taiwan Calling" opens in two Hungarian museums later
this month, the organizer announced at a press conference in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (NTMFA), the main
organizer, 44 works by 25 local artists, covering painting, video and
installation art, were chosen to be displayed in two separate exhibitions at the
Mucsarnok museum and in the Ludwig Museum, both in the Hungarian capital of
Budapest.</P>
      <P>Viewers will see two different displays.  The one in the Mucsarnok, running from
Dec. 17-Feb. 13 next year, will feature 24 pieces centered more on how Taiwanese
artists see themselves and on Taiwan society and identity, while in the Ludwig,
20 pieces will show the multi-faceted Taiwan that is undergoing massive change
in the fields of history, society, race, politics and culture.</P>
      <P>The Ludwig exhibition also opens Dec. 17, but will remain on view until March 6,
2011.</P>
      <P>Huang Tsai-Lang, director of the NTMFA, said in the press conference that the
Muscarnok and Ludwig museums are two of the most important contemporary museums
in Eastern Europe and that he hopes the exhibition will bring more exchange
opportunities  between Taiwanese and European artists.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang Chien-chi and Yuan Guang-min, who have already established
themselves in international art circles, he said the works of the younger
generation in the two exhibitions account for the majority of the exhibits,
which he said show the diversity and vitality of Taiwan's art scene.</P>
      <P>Mia Liu, an emerging artist, will present five works made of admission tickets
to the Guggenheim Museum. She said the idea of using the tickets to create art
was born when she studied in New York two years ago, during which she had a
part-time job and worked as a ticket-seller at the famed museum.</P>
      <P>She bought 120,000 unused tickets from the Guggenheim before she quit her job,
and turned what is normally trivial into intricate paper artworks.</P>
      <P>Tsui Kuang-yu, who has contributed four video works, said that as an artist, he
keeps asking questions and is continuously in search of finding a way to express
"the invisible."</P>

      <P>More than half of the respondents to a recent poll described themselves as
satisfied with human rights in Taiwan, seeing progress in the rights of women
and indigenous people, but feeling that their economic and judicial human rights
have declined, according to the survey results released Friday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR) conducted the survey from
September through November this year, collecting 1,084 effective samples on
their views of the human rights situation in 11 areas, including politics,
judicial affairs, women, children, indigenous people, the disabled, the
environment and economics.</P>
      <P>In addition, the association gathered opinions from 180 scholars and academics
on the same questions.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 66.8 percent of the respondents gave a negative evaluation
of their economic rights, the highest ratio among all the negative views.</P>
      <P>Of the three questions  in the economic  rights category, "government role and
economic human rights" got a lower score than last year, while "consumer rights"
and "production and employment" were given better grades than in last year's
survey.</P>
      <P>Professor Chu Mei-li of National Chengchi University said most scholars also
give a minus score for the government's role in protecting people's economic
rights, and she further said it is time that the government put forward a viable
economic policy to address people's worries.</P>
      <P>Another area that received poor comments was the judicial category, with 44.9
percent of those surveyed saying people's judicial human rights have declined
compared with last year and only 24.6 percent feeling that they have improved.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-chuan, professor of law at National Taipei University, said that
although people can feel the government's determination to reform the judiciary,
its efforts still got negative comments.</P>
      <P>He cited for example that jailed former President Chen Shui-bian is incarcerated
in a 1.2-ping (one ping is equal to 3.3 square meters) cell with another
jailbird, which he said shows that there is a shortage of prison facilities.</P>
      <P>About half of the respondents gave a positive comment on their political rights,
while the other half gave exactly the opposite view, indicating the polarized
nature of the country's politics.</P>
      <P>All other areas, such as labor, culture and education, and senior citizens,
received overall positive comments.</P>
      <P>The CAHR was set up in 1979 to secure, facilitate and promote human rights based
on the respect of their values acknowledged in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.</P>

      <P>China may jump ahead of Taiwan to publish late President Chiang Kai-shek's
diaries as his descendants have yet to reach aconsensus over who has the right
to authorize the use of the historical documents, scholars said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chinese scholars are known to have been copying Chiang's diaries at the Hoover
Institution of Stanford University and, according to a professor of history at
National Chengchi University, Liu Wei-kai, if China has organized a "group
effort, " it could publish what its scholars have handcopied from the U.S. ahead
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without coordination over this matter, Liu said Taiwan may lose its advantage in
the research of modern Chinese history, Liu said. "If mainland China wins over
the right to interpret history, Taiwan may be further marginalized," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang Ke-wu, director of the Institute of Modern History of Academia Sinica,
agreed, saying if the research community here cannot have an easy access to the
historical materials, "how can we fight an academic warfare?"</P>
      <P>He urged the government to get the Chiang house in order and publish the late
president's diaries quickly, so that local students will be able to use the
historical data more conveniently.</P>
      <P>The academic circle here has called for an early publication of Chiang Kai-
shek's diaries, but Chiang's offsprings could not reach a consensus on the right
to authorize.</P>
      <P>Starting in 2006, Hoover Institution opened the microfilms of the diaries to the
academic community on the condition that students can only use pencils to copy
the text or key in their notebook computers.</P>
      <P>It's naturally not an easy task for individual scholars to copy so many volumes
of the diaries. And yet Chinese scholars have gone to California in groups, some
staying as long as three months on a single visit, just to get as much of the
content as they could.</P>

      <P>A special task force has been established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to monitor Taiwan-related documents expected to be released soon by the
whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang told CNA
Friday.</P>
      <P>"We have been in close contacts with the United States and we believe that the
leaked classified documents will not jeopardize bilateral relations, " Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Wikileaks announced on its website that over the next few months, it will
release in stages 251,287 cables originating from 274 U.S. embassies between
Dec. 28, 1966 to Feb. 28, 2010 of the total 3,456 that were sent between the
U.S. State Department and the American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S.
representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has set up a task force under its Department of North American Affairs
which has held meetings since last week to gauge and manage possible impacts of
Wikileaks' release, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, though Defense
Minister Kao Hua-chu has said in the legislature that information unveiled by
the website "was not necessarily true."</P>
      <P>It would be more appropriate to let the U.S. make comments on the case,  given
that those hacked documents were U.S. government properties, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, a special task force under the Ministry of National Defense
headed by Vice Minister Andrew Yang has been set up to follow future leaks by
the website and analyze and verify any details that were related to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A national human rights museum under the planned ministry of culture is
scheduled to open on Jan. 1, 2012, Council for Cultural Affairs Chairman Emile
Sheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, two major historical sites related to the development of
Taiwan's democracy and human rights -- Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park in
suburban Taipei and the outlying Green Island Human Rights Memorial Park -- will
be made part of the "human rights museum" under the jurisdiction of the future
ministry of culture.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan has made noticeable progress in politics, the country has not
made an organized effort to promote education in human rights and the museum
will be established to serve that end, " he explained.</P>
      <P>"The major purpose of the museum is to increase the people's awareness of human
rights," he said.</P>
      <P>Before being turned into a memorial facility, the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial
Park was used to be called Jingmei Detention Center, where political prisoners
were detained during the White Terror era in Taiwan, while convicted political
inmates were kept on the Green Island off Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park is currently overseen by the council's
Headquarters Administration of Cultural Heritage, and the Green Island park is
under the management of the National Taitung Living Art Center.</P>

      <P>Developers of a controversial naphtha cracking plant in central Taiwan made
concessions Friday by promising to establish exclusive agencies and funds for
the protection of endangered dolphins, other wildlife and the environment, as
well as residents' health.</P>
      <P>The promises, however, were not met favorably by environmental activists and
wildlife conservationists, who insisted that the development project of Taiwan's
eighth naphtha cracker by the Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co. (KPTC) in
Changhua County must stop.</P>
      <P>KPTC Chairman Chen Pao-lang promised  during a preliminary environmental  impact
assessment  meeting  at the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in
Taipei that day that KPTC will establish a foundation exclusively for the
protection of Taiwan's indigenous pink dolphins, which are facing extinction,
and their natural habitat.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged to initially allocate NT$100 million (US$3.33 million) as a
fund to finance environmental protection in the area in which KPTC hopes to
locate the naphtha cracker complex and to pay for health insurance for residents
living in the immediate vicinity of the proposed petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>Chen, said, however, that it is unrealistic for the protesters to demand that
the foundations of the proposed naphtha cracker and a seaport be built 10 meters
off the coast.</P>
      <P>He argued that moving the project's foundation 10 meters offshore would increase
the development cost by at least NT$190 billion and prolong the development
period to 15 to 20 years -- an over-long development period that would deal a
fatal blow to the pink dolphins in the area.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Chen, Lee Pei-fen, professor and director of the Institute of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology under National Taiwan University, said KPTC was wrong
in the first place to choose the location -- a 200-hectare stretch of wetland at
the mouth of the Jhuoshuei River that is also home to the pink dolphins, whose
population is believed to number fewer than 100.</P>
      <P>Saying that pushing the naphtha cracker's base -- to be built on reclaimed land
-- 10 meters further offshore is technically feasible, she questioned why KPTC
deems the idea "unrealistic."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Changhua Coast Conservation Action,
said the development project will not only destroy the dolphins' migration route
and their habitat, it will also pose a threat to the migratory Euroasian curlew
(Numenius arquata), a bird that serves as an index species for wetland
ecosystems.</P>

      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) officials said Friday that another seven Mass
Rapid Transit (MRT) stations will be opened on holidays to bicycles from Dec. 4,
adding to the existing 33 stations that allow bicycles.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) said that besides Nangang and Qiyan
stations, the stations newly opened to bicycles are mostly along the recently
inaugurated Luzhou Line -- the Luzhou, St. Ignatius High School, Sanchong
Elementary School, Minquan West Road and Songjiang Nanjing stations.</P>
      <P>The existing ticket fare for cyclists entering, exiting or transferring on the
MRT system is NT$80 (US$2.6).</P>
      <P>In another development that day, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said during an
inspection of the Nangang eastern extension work at the MRT's Taipei Nangang
Exhibition Center Station that there is no timetable for the line to begin
operating.</P>
      <P>"We declined to specify the date as we do not want the construction to be
rushed," Hau said.</P>
      <P>His remarks appeared to be in stark contrast to the website of the Department of
Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS), however, which says that the line is expected to
be open for commercial service within the next month.</P>
      <P>The transfer service at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Station has been highly
anticipated, as it will connect the Taipei World Trade Centers' venues in
suburban Nangang and in downtown Taipei. At present, passengers wishing to
travel between the two venues are forced to use a combination of MRT and shuttle
bus to make the journey.</P>

      <P>A number of local companies tendered their bids to buy the Taiwan unit of
American International Group (AIG) Friday after the indebted insurance giant
vowed to complete a new sale following a failed one earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.'s "board of directors decided to take part in
the bidding for the sale of AIG's 97.57-percent stake in Nan Shan Life Insurance
Co., " the would-be buyer said in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The statement did not offer further details.</P>
      <P>Ruenchen Investment Holding Co., a new joint venture created by Ruentex
Industries Ltd., Ruentex Development Co. and Pou Chen Corp. for the bid, also
said in a filing to the stock exchange that they joined the bidding process
Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Ruentex refused to give details, citing a confidentiality
agreement.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial Holding Co., Taiwan's largest financial services provider, also
confirmed its bid for the purchase in a stock exchange statement.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co.,  the country's second largest financial services
provider that is widely expected to make a similar move, declined to comment on
whether the company tendered its bid Friday.</P>
      <P>Both AIG's media contact in Taiwan and Nan Shan's spokeswoman told CNA by
telephone that they cannot confirm the total number of companies that have
submitted the bid earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>In a Nov. 5 statement, AIG said it believed a sale would be completed "within 12
months."</P>
      <P>On Aug. 31, Taiwan's regulators rejected the sale of the unit to a Hong Kong
consortium comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic Holdings,
over concerns about the buyer's long-term financial capability and the rights of
Nan Shan's workers.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 23,  Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Pan Meng-
an urged Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the country's top
financial regulator, to list the protection of employees' rights as one of the
criteria in reviewing the planned sale of Nan Shan.</P>
      <P>Wedding Lan, a spokesman for Nan Shan's trade union, has repeatedly urged new
bidders to strike a deal with the trade union over the protection of employees'
rights.</P>
      <P>Lan is a former Nan Shan executive who was demoted to sales agent earlier this
year for "speaking to the press about Nan Shan without the prior consent of the
company."</P>
      <P>Lan told the CNA that none of the companies that openly identified themselves as
bidders had approached the trade union.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that another bidder had promised the trade union that it will
ensure the workers' rights if it wins the bid. But Lan said he was not
authorized to identify the bidder.</P>
      <P>Local news reports said that AIG will hold a second round of bidding after this
round to choose between two final bidders before unveiling the new buyer in mid-
or late December.</P>
      <P>The bidding prices range from US$2 billion to US$3 billion, according to the
reports.</P>
      <P>Established in 1963, Nan Shan has a net worth of NT$140.3 billion (US$4.63
billion), accounting for over one-third of the local life insurance market.</P>

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng vowed Friday to push through  a bill next
week to facilitate  the introduction of a second-generation national health
insurance (NHI) premium system.</P>
      <P>After lengthy debate, legislators across partisan lines reached a preliminary
consensus on the second-generation NHI, agreeing that consultations on the issue
should be completed by Dec. 6, paving the way for the line-by-line reading of
the bill before putting it to clear the legislative floor the next day.</P>
      <P>"Whatever it takes, the bill must be passed into law Dec. 7, " a determined Wang
said.</P>
      <P>The package of legal amendments proposed by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) to resuscitate the debt-laden NHI failed to clear the floor of the
Legislative Yuan in August.</P>
      <P>The legislature has thus set a Dec. 7 deadline for completing the final round of
debate on the amendments.</P>
      <P>One of the disputes surrounding the second-generation  NHI involves its premium
system, which was recalculated with the goal of controlling the program's
deficit.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that the lawmakers had reached consensus on
most of the clauses in the bill, except for 20 that are still in dispute.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Sue-ying said the
version put forth by the Executive Yuan is not efficient enough to solve
disputes.</P>
      <P>"Disputes  will remain despite  the bill's passage by the Kuomintang-dominated
Legislative Yuan," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The bill mainly involves a new scheme for calculating premiums based on total
household income rather than the existing system, which considers only
individuals' salaries and wages. The change is considered essential to keep the
cash-strapped program operational.</P>

      <P>Almost one week after the 2010 Guangzhou Asiad, Taiwan government could not
decide whether to take the case of a controversial disqualification of a
Taiwanese female taekwondo athlete in the event to an international sports
arbitration institution.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency meeting headed by Vice Premier Sean Chen failed to come to a
conclusion Friday on whether to appeal to Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration
for Sport (CAS) about the case of Yang Shu-chun, who was disqualified during her
first-round bout in the women's taekwondo under 49-kilogram weight division on
Nov. 17 after she scored a 9-0 lead over her Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>According to World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk,
who did not have any role in the actual decision but served as the main
spokesman for the taekwondo world in the incident's aftermath, said Yang was
disqualified for wearing extra sensors on her socks in an attempt to score more
points, which was an act of cheating.</P>
      <P>All video evidence and witness accounts show that Chen had taken off the sensors
before going into the ring.</P>
      <P>The task force, which included government agencies such as the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the Sports Affairs Council, was
still unsure about the CAS' jurisdiction on the case and what remedy it is
seeking, said Sung Yao-ming, a lawyer hired by the Taiwan government to handle
the case.</P>
      <P>The CAS is established to handle sports disputes, but "we should first clarify
whether this case fits the definition of a 'sports dispute', " Sung told
reporters in a post-meeting press conference.</P>
      <P>"We are now waiting for further information from a Swiss-based lawyer who is
familiar with sports arbitration matters to have better assessment of our next
move, " he said, adding that the decision "should come within days."</P>
      <P>However, it appeared that Taiwan is not likely to file a lawsuit against
taekwondo officials in a Guangzhou court, a suggestion made by Sung after the
incident, which has ignited public outrage and an anti-Korea sentiment in Taiwan
and has received coverage from international media.</P>
      <P>The controversy was so high-profile that Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou and
Premier Wu Den-yih had personally addressed the incident as "unfair" and had
described it as damaging Taiwan's national pride.</P>
      <P>Citing an interpretation by China's supreme people's court during the 2008
Beijing Olympics stating that the court did not accept sports-related lawsuits,
Sung said that a Guangzhou court could reject the case with the same reason.</P>
      <P>SAC Chairwoman Tai Hsia-ling said that while Taiwanese fans and Taiwan
government could not accept the accusations against Yang, the task force will
appeal the case via legal channels.</P>
      <P>"We're going to approach this dispute in the same way we were trained on the
sports field -- to play it by the rule, " Tai said.</P>

      <P>Indian stage director Chongtham Jayanta of the Ex Theatre on Friday
presentedNumit Kappain Taipei on Friday, a work adapted from an ancient story
which he said showcases how tradition can survive in modern theatres.</P>
      <P>Numit  Kappa, meaningshooting  the sunin the Indian language, is an age-old
literary work which dates back to A.D. 32, according to the Indian director.</P>
      <P>Jayanta told Central News Agency in an interview that he first read the story
when he was a college student and found that the story has a universal appeal,
for it deals with power struggle and the suffering of the common people under
tyrannical rule.</P>
      <P>Comparing good leaders to the sun, he said an orderly society would fall into
chaos if there were no good rulers.</P>
      <P>Political unrest in Taiwan has nothing to do with the play, because this is not
a political drama. All the countries are facing similar problems, and everyone
watching the play can relate to it in their own way,he said.</P>
      <P>To recreate an atmosphere of the old Indian society, the director incorporated
elements of Taiwans aboriginal music and there will be live dances and singing
throughout the performance.</P>
      <P>Borrowing the form of the classical story, Jayanta said he hoped the audience
will be rediscovering the charm of tradition through his approach to modern
theatrical forms, for he found that many of the younger generation now feels
disconnected with tradition and old values.</P>
      <P>Jayanta is considered one of the most promising stage directors in India. He
founded the Ex Theatre in Taiwan in 2006.Numit Kappa will have two more showings

      <P>Taiwanese baseball pitcher Chien-Ming Wang has become a free agent after the
Washington Nationals chose not to offer a new contract to him but might try to
keep him at a cheaper price, the U.S. media reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The Nationals was more inclined to sign a contract worth less than US$2 million,
what they paid Wang this season, or even a Minor League Baseball deal, the
online CSNwashington reported. The news of the non-tender was confirmed later by
Octagon Baseball, which represents Wang.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, the team also non-tendered reliever Joel Peralta and
catcher Wil Nieves. If the Nationals had tendered the 30-year-old Wang, they
would have had to pay him US$1.6 million, the amount Wang could get in
arbitration.</P>
      <P>Wang will negotiate with other clubs, including the Nationals, said Octagon
Baseball. Wang respected the decision and thanked the Nationals for their
assistance and support in the past year, it quoted Wang as saying, adding he
would continue to train and rehabilitate by himself to return to his best as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>The former Yankees sink-baller failed to play in the MLB since he injured his
shoulder and underwent a surgery last year. He spent all year rehabbing, which
made him a not-surprizing non-tender.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (TAIEX) is expected to hit 10,000 points before
the Republic of China's next national day Oct. 10, 2011 as its economy has
entered a "super cycle" that will extend over the next decade, Morgan Stanley
said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a research report, Morgan Stanley said that over the next 10 years, Taiwan
will aim at creating a "golden decade" by forging closer business ties with
China and positioning itself to become a greater China research and development
center.</P>
      <P>On his second anniversary in office in May this year, President Ma Ying-jeou of
the China-friendly ruling Kuomintang outlined his vision of a "golden decade"
for Taiwan's economic development through innovation, culture and environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Ma has also promised to enhance social welfare and promote peace with China to
protect the nation.</P>
      <P>The  government  "should  stay  market-friendly  with  more cross-strait
policies coinciding with a global economic recovery ahead of the 2012
presidential election," the brokerage said.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley said the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) means
growth and is "a starting point to drive growth for cross-strait trade."</P>
      <P>The ECFA Taiwan and China signed in late June has become effective, granting
preferential tariff status and easy market access to 539 items of Taiwanese
products and services.</P>
      <P>According to the brokerage,  on the improving cross-strait relations, Taiwan is
expected to generate "peace dividends" and "demographic dividends" and to see
many opportunities coming from China's growth.</P>
      <P>"We believe our 2011 TAIEX target will be realized by National Day 2011 on
capital repatriation with increased confidence," it said.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 0.44 percent at 8,624.01 Friday.</P>
      <P>Morgan Stanley said that with more and more Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan,
the local retail, property and tourism sectors are expected to enjoy booming
business.</P>
      <P>Among the brokerage's top picks are AU Optronics., Acer, Epistar, Richtek
Technology, Ralink, WPG Holdings, President Chain Store, Yulon Motor, Huaku
Development, Taiwan Fertilizer, Cathay Financial and Yuanta Financial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese doctor writes book about Yemen experience</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first Taiwanese doctor to work with the humanitarian  organization  Medecins
Sans Frontieres (MSF)  has published a book that documents his experience
serving in a war-torn Middle East country.</P>
      <P>The book, which was launched in Taiwan Friday, is titled "The Route Home" and
features the 45-day journey of surgeon Raymond Soong to Yemen on an MSF mission.</P>
      <P>Soong, 35, was a general surgeon at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Keelung when
he decided in August 2009 to team up with MSF, also known as Doctors Without
Borders, on a Yemen mission.</P>
      <P>During his period of service in the war-torn state, he performed dozens of
operations  on patients  injured  in air raids and bombardments.</P>
      <P>"I have always thought that I need to travel to far away places to really help
people, " said Soong, who signed up for his first MSF mission in Liberia in
2004.</P>
      <P>At the book launch, Soong's father, who is also a doctor, spoke with pride of
his son's contribution.</P>
      <P>"Although my son was not trained as an orthopedist or a gynecologist, he had to
operate with whatever resources he had, using courage and wisdom, " said Soong
Yung-kuei, Vice President of Linkou Medical Center. "This is experience that
cannot be gained in medical school."</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Chih-fu Chen, a doctor with 15-some years experience in mobile medical
missions, said decisions such as the one Soong made could make a huge difference
to people in conflict zones.</P>
      <P>"It doesn't make much of a difference if we have one doctor less in Taiwan, but
it is a matter of life and death for people in war-hit areas," he said.</P>
      <P>Although there is a huge demand for doctors in MSF, there are only two Taiwanese
doctors,  including Raymond Soong, who are registered as MSF volunteers,
according to MSF Hong Kong, which is responsible for medical recruitments in
East Asia.</P>
      <P>Raymond  Soong said that there are many reasons  why the participation rate in
Taiwan is low compared with other countries.</P>
      <P>"Many Taiwanese doctors have the dream and passion to work with MSF, but some
hospitals are unable to guarantee them their positions when they return," he
said.</P>
      <P>Two other factors are family responsibilities and the high professional
standards required by MSF, he said.</P>

      <P>The most important task in case of the Nov. 26 election-eve shooting that caused
one death and injured a former vice president's son is to find out whether there
is a mastermind behind the incident, the minister of the interior said Friday.</P>
      <P>The investigation should focus on determining "whether there is an individual
mastermind or a ring behind the perpetrator, " since prosecutors have obtained
concrete evidence on the shooting thanks to the arrest of the assailant on the
spot and the seizing of the murder weapon, Jiang Yi-huah told reporters.</P>
      <P>Asked whether there is a deadline for solving the case, Jiang said there is no
deadline, but spelled out the government's hope that investigators will uncover
the truth as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Sean Lien, the son of former Vice President Lien Chan, was shot in the face
while stumping for a city councilor candidate during a campaign rally in Xinbei
City on the eve of the municipal elections.</P>
      <P>Lien is in stable condition at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) , but
a bystander who was also shot in the head died of injuries soon after the
incident.</P>
      <P>NTUH said Friday that Lien is recovering and that his facial nerves are
functioning normally.</P>
      <P>The gunman's bullet pierced the left side of Lien's face and exited near his
right temple, causing fractures of his cheekbones and two open wounds.</P>
      <P>The shooting had a great impact on the fairness of the elections and on social
order, Jiang said, pledging reinforced efforts to prevent possible election-
related violence in the future.</P>

      <P>A total of 100 tourist taxis in eight urban areas of Taiwan are offering foreign
travelers another choice for experiencing the country through customized travel
routes, a local travel agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The organizer of the service, ezTravel, said its cooperative venture with local
taxi companies launched that day will benefit in particular backpackers from
China once the authorities give a green light to entry to Taiwan by independent
travelers.</P>
      <P>Currently, Chinese tourists are only allowed to travel in Taiwan as part of a
tour group. In an interview in July, however, Premier Wu Den-yih said the
additional opening measures will take effect late this year or early in 2011, to
coincide with the Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>"We are expecting two-thirds of our future clients to be Chinese," said Jack
You, CEO of the agency.</P>
      <P>He said the 36 designated sightseeing routes connect with major traffic systems
such as the Taiwan High Speed Railway and the regular rail network operated by
the Taiwan Railway Administration to make traveling more convenient.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, You said, contracted taxi drivers will guide tourists
around cities such as Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung at an hourly rate.</P>
      <P>A four-hour trip in Taipei City, for example, costs NT$2,500 (US$82).</P>
      <P>The travel model is expected to draw 400,000 tourists over two years and to

      <P>The works of Taiwanese artists will reach a wider audience in Eastern Europe
when an exhibition titled "Taiwan Calling" opens in two Hungarian museums later
this month, the organizer announced at a press conference in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts (NTMFA), the main
organizer, 44 works by 25 local artists, covering painting, video and
installation art, were chosen to be displayed in two separate exhibitions at the
Mucsarnok museum and in the Ludwig Museum, both in the Hungarian capital of
Budapest.</P>
      <P>Viewers will see two different displays.  The one in the Mucsarnok, running from
Dec. 17-Feb. 13 next year, will feature 24 pieces centered more on how Taiwanese
artists see themselves and on Taiwan society and identity, while in the Ludwig,
20 pieces will show the multi-faceted Taiwan that is undergoing massive change
in the fields of history, society, race, politics and culture.</P>
      <P>The Ludwig exhibition also opens Dec. 17, but will remain on view until March 6,
2011.</P>
      <P>Huang Tsai-Lang, director of the NTMFA, said in the press conference that the
Muscarnok and Ludwig museums are two of the most important contemporary museums
in Eastern Europe and that he hopes the exhibition will bring more exchange
opportunities  between Taiwanese and European artists.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang Chien-chi and Yuan Guang-min, who have already established
themselves in international art circles, he said the works of the younger
generation in the two exhibitions account for the majority of the exhibits,
which he said show the diversity and vitality of Taiwan's art scene.</P>
      <P>Mia Liu, an emerging artist, will present five works made of admission tickets
to the Guggenheim Museum. She said the idea of using the tickets to create art
was born when she studied in New York two years ago, during which she had a
part-time job and worked as a ticket-seller at the famed museum.</P>
      <P>She bought 120,000 unused tickets from the Guggenheim before she quit her job,
and turned what is normally trivial into intricate paper artworks.</P>
      <P>Tsui Kuang-yu, who has contributed four video works, said that as an artist, he
keeps asking questions and is continuously in search of finding a way to express
"the invisible."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of the respondents to a recent poll described themselves as
satisfied with human rights in Taiwan, seeing progress in the rights of women
and indigenous people, but feeling that their economic and judicial human rights
have declined, according to the survey results released Friday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Association for Human Rights (CAHR) conducted the survey from
September through November this year, collecting 1,084 effective samples on
their views of the human rights situation in 11 areas, including politics,
judicial affairs, women, children, indigenous people, the disabled, the
environment and economics.</P>
      <P>In addition, the association gathered opinions from 180 scholars and academics
on the same questions.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 66.8 percent of the respondents gave a negative evaluation
of their economic rights, the highest ratio among all the negative views.</P>
      <P>Of the three questions  in the economic  rights category, "government role and
economic human rights" got a lower score than last year, while "consumer rights"
and "production and employment" were given better grades than in last year's
survey.</P>
      <P>Professor Chu Mei-li of National Chengchi University said most scholars also
give a minus score for the government's role in protecting people's economic
rights, and she further said it is time that the government put forward a viable
economic policy to address people's worries.</P>
      <P>Another area that received poor comments was the judicial category, with 44.9
percent of those surveyed saying people's judicial human rights have declined
compared with last year and only 24.6 percent feeling that they have improved.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-chuan, professor of law at National Taipei University, said that
although people can feel the government's determination to reform the judiciary,
its efforts still got negative comments.</P>
      <P>He cited for example that jailed former President Chen Shui-bian is incarcerated
in a 1.2-ping (one ping is equal to 3.3 square meters) cell with another
jailbird, which he said shows that there is a shortage of prison facilities.</P>
      <P>About half of the respondents gave a positive comment on their political rights,
while the other half gave exactly the opposite view, indicating the polarized
nature of the country's politics.</P>
      <P>All other areas, such as labor, culture and education, and senior citizens,
received overall positive comments.</P>
      <P>The CAHR was set up in 1979 to secure, facilitate and promote human rights based
on the respect of their values acknowledged in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.</P>

      <P>China may jump ahead of Taiwan to publish late President Chiang Kai-shek's
diaries as his descendants have yet to reach aconsensus over who has the right
to authorize the use of the historical documents, scholars said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chinese scholars are known to have been copying Chiang's diaries at the Hoover
Institution of Stanford University and, according to a professor of history at
National Chengchi University, Liu Wei-kai, if China has organized a "group
effort, " it could publish what its scholars have handcopied from the U.S. ahead
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Without coordination over this matter, Liu said Taiwan may lose its advantage in
the research of modern Chinese history, Liu said. "If mainland China wins over
the right to interpret history, Taiwan may be further marginalized," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang Ke-wu, director of the Institute of Modern History of Academia Sinica,
agreed, saying if the research community here cannot have an easy access to the
historical materials, "how can we fight an academic warfare?"</P>
      <P>He urged the government to get the Chiang house in order and publish the late
president's diaries quickly, so that local students will be able to use the
historical data more conveniently.</P>
      <P>The academic circle here has called for an early publication of Chiang Kai-
shek's diaries, but Chiang's offsprings could not reach a consensus on the right
to authorize.</P>
      <P>Starting in 2006, Hoover Institution opened the microfilms of the diaries to the
academic community on the condition that students can only use pencils to copy
the text or key in their notebook computers.</P>
      <P>It's naturally not an easy task for individual scholars to copy so many volumes
of the diaries. And yet Chinese scholars have gone to California in groups, some
staying as long as three months on a single visit, just to get as much of the
content as they could.</P>

      <P>A special task force has been established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) to monitor Taiwan-related documents expected to be released soon by the
whistle-blowing website Wikileaks, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang told CNA
Friday.</P>
      <P>"We have been in close contacts with the United States and we believe that the
leaked classified documents will not jeopardize bilateral relations, " Yang
said.</P>
      <P>Wikileaks announced on its website that over the next few months, it will
release in stages 251,287 cables originating from 274 U.S. embassies between
Dec. 28, 1966 to Feb. 28, 2010 of the total 3,456 that were sent between the
U.S. State Department and the American Institute in Taiwan -- the de facto U.S.
representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has set up a task force under its Department of North American Affairs
which has held meetings since last week to gauge and manage possible impacts of
Wikileaks' release, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang declined to comment on the authenticity of the documents, though Defense
Minister Kao Hua-chu has said in the legislature that information unveiled by
the website "was not necessarily true."</P>
      <P>It would be more appropriate to let the U.S. make comments on the case,  given
that those hacked documents were U.S. government properties, Yang said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, a special task force under the Ministry of National Defense
headed by Vice Minister Andrew Yang has been set up to follow future leaks by
the website and analyze and verify any details that were related to Taiwan.</P>

Sheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Sheng, two major historical sites related to the development of
Taiwan's democracy and human rights -- Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park in
suburban Taipei and the outlying Green Island Human Rights Memorial Park -- will
be made part of the "human rights museum" under the jurisdiction of the future
ministry of culture.</P>
      <P>"Although Taiwan has made noticeable progress in politics, the country has not
made an organized effort to promote education in human rights and the museum
will be established to serve that end, " he explained.</P>
      <P>"The major purpose of the museum is to increase the people's awareness of human
rights," he said.</P>
      <P>Before being turned into a memorial facility, the Jingmei Human Rights Memorial
Park was used to be called Jingmei Detention Center, where political prisoners
were detained during the White Terror era in Taiwan, while convicted political
inmates were kept on the Green Island off Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The Jingmei Human Rights Memorial Park is currently overseen by the council's

      <P>Developers of a controversial naphtha cracking plant in central Taiwan made
concessions Friday by promising to establish exclusive agencies and funds for
the protection of endangered dolphins, other wildlife and the environment, as
well as residents' health.</P>
      <P>The promises, however, were not met favorably by environmental activists and
wildlife conservationists, who insisted that the development project of Taiwan's
eighth naphtha cracker by the Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Co. (KPTC) in
Changhua County must stop.</P>
      <P>KPTC Chairman Chen Pao-lang promised  during a preliminary environmental  impact
assessment  meeting  at the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in
Taipei that day that KPTC will establish a foundation exclusively for the
protection of Taiwan's indigenous pink dolphins, which are facing extinction,
and their natural habitat.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged to initially allocate NT$100 million (US$3.33 million) as a
fund to finance environmental protection in the area in which KPTC hopes to
locate the naphtha cracker complex and to pay for health insurance for residents
living in the immediate vicinity of the proposed petrochemical complex.</P>
      <P>Chen, said, however, that it is unrealistic for the protesters to demand that
the foundations of the proposed naphtha cracker and a seaport be built 10 meters
off the coast.</P>
      <P>He argued that moving the project's foundation 10 meters offshore would increase
the development cost by at least NT$190 billion and prolong the development
period to 15 to 20 years -- an over-long development period that would deal a
fatal blow to the pink dolphins in the area.</P>
      <P>Rebutting Chen, Lee Pei-fen, professor and director of the Institute of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology under National Taiwan University, said KPTC was wrong
in the first place to choose the location -- a 200-hectare stretch of wetland at
the mouth of the Jhuoshuei River that is also home to the pink dolphins, whose
population is believed to number fewer than 100.</P>
      <P>Saying that pushing the naphtha cracker's base -- to be built on reclaimed land
-- 10 meters further offshore is technically feasible, she questioned why KPTC
deems the idea "unrealistic."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Tsai Chia-yang, chairman of the Changhua Coast Conservation Action,
said the development project will not only destroy the dolphins' migration route
and their habitat, it will also pose a threat to the migratory Euroasian curlew
(Numenius arquata), a bird that serves as an index species for wetland
ecosystems.</P>

      <P>Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) officials said Friday that another seven Mass
Rapid Transit (MRT) stations will be opened on holidays to bicycles from Dec. 4,
adding to the existing 33 stations that allow bicycles.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC) said that besides Nangang and Qiyan
stations, the stations newly opened to bicycles are mostly along the recently
inaugurated Luzhou Line -- the Luzhou, St. Ignatius High School, Sanchong
Elementary School, Minquan West Road and Songjiang Nanjing stations.</P>
      <P>The existing ticket fare for cyclists entering, exiting or transferring on the
MRT system is NT$80 (US$2.6).</P>
      <P>In another development that day, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said during an
inspection of the Nangang eastern extension work at the MRT's Taipei Nangang
Exhibition Center Station that there is no timetable for the line to begin
operating.</P>
      <P>"We declined to specify the date as we do not want the construction to be
rushed," Hau said.</P>
      <P>His remarks appeared to be in stark contrast to the website of the Department of
Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS), however, which says that the line is expected to
be open for commercial service within the next month.</P>
      <P>The transfer service at Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center Station has been highly
anticipated, as it will connect the Taipei World Trade Centers' venues in
suburban Nangang and in downtown Taipei. At present, passengers wishing to
travel between the two venues are forced to use a combination of MRT and shuttle

    <TEXT>
      <P>A number of local companies tendered their bids to buy the Taiwan unit of
American International Group (AIG) Friday after the indebted insurance giant
vowed to complete a new sale following a failed one earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial Holding Co.'s "board of directors decided to take part in
the bidding for the sale of AIG's 97.57-percent stake in Nan Shan Life Insurance
Co., " the would-be buyer said in a statement to the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>The statement did not offer further details.</P>
      <P>Ruenchen Investment Holding Co., a new joint venture created by Ruentex
Industries Ltd., Ruentex Development Co. and Pou Chen Corp. for the bid, also
said in a filing to the stock exchange that they joined the bidding process
Friday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Ruentex refused to give details, citing a confidentiality
agreement.</P>
      <P>Cathay Financial Holding Co., Taiwan's largest financial services provider, also
confirmed its bid for the purchase in a stock exchange statement.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co.,  the country's second largest financial services
provider that is widely expected to make a similar move, declined to comment on
whether the company tendered its bid Friday.</P>
      <P>Both AIG's media contact in Taiwan and Nan Shan's spokeswoman told CNA by
telephone that they cannot confirm the total number of companies that have
submitted the bid earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>In a Nov. 5 statement, AIG said it believed a sale would be completed "within 12
months."</P>
      <P>On Aug. 31, Taiwan's regulators rejected the sale of the unit to a Hong Kong
consortium comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic Holdings,
over concerns about the buyer's long-term financial capability and the rights of
Nan Shan's workers.</P>
      <P>On Nov. 23,  Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Pan Meng-
an urged Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the country's top
financial regulator, to list the protection of employees' rights as one of the
criteria in reviewing the planned sale of Nan Shan.</P>
      <P>Wedding Lan, a spokesman for Nan Shan's trade union, has repeatedly urged new
bidders to strike a deal with the trade union over the protection of employees'
rights.</P>
      <P>Lan is a former Nan Shan executive who was demoted to sales agent earlier this
year for "speaking to the press about Nan Shan without the prior consent of the
company."</P>
      <P>Lan told the CNA that none of the companies that openly identified themselves as
bidders had approached the trade union.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that another bidder had promised the trade union that it will
ensure the workers' rights if it wins the bid. But Lan said he was not
authorized to identify the bidder.</P>
      <P>Local news reports said that AIG will hold a second round of bidding after this
round to choose between two final bidders before unveiling the new buyer in mid-
or late December.</P>
      <P>The bidding prices range from US$2 billion to US$3 billion, according to the
reports.</P>
      <P>Established in 1963, Nan Shan has a net worth of NT$140.3 billion (US$4.63
billion), accounting for over one-third of the local life insurance market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng vowed Friday to push through  a bill next
week to facilitate  the introduction of a second-generation national health
insurance (NHI) premium system.</P>
      <P>After lengthy debate, legislators across partisan lines reached a preliminary
consensus on the second-generation NHI, agreeing that consultations on the issue
should be completed by Dec. 6, paving the way for the line-by-line reading of
the bill before putting it to clear the legislative floor the next day.</P>
      <P>"Whatever it takes, the bill must be passed into law Dec. 7, " a determined Wang
said.</P>
      <P>The package of legal amendments proposed by the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) to resuscitate the debt-laden NHI failed to clear the floor of the
Legislative Yuan in August.</P>
      <P>The legislature has thus set a Dec. 7 deadline for completing the final round of
debate on the amendments.</P>
      <P>One of the disputes surrounding the second-generation  NHI involves its premium
system, which was recalculated with the goal of controlling the program's
deficit.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that the lawmakers had reached consensus on
most of the clauses in the bill, except for 20 that are still in dispute.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Huang Sue-ying said the
version put forth by the Executive Yuan is not efficient enough to solve
disputes.</P>
      <P>"Disputes  will remain despite  the bill's passage by the Kuomintang-dominated
Legislative Yuan," Huang said.</P>
      <P>The bill mainly involves a new scheme for calculating premiums based on total
household income rather than the existing system, which considers only
individuals' salaries and wages. The change is considered essential to keep the
cash-strapped program operational.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan still unsure about taking taekwondo case to CAS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Almost one week after the 2010 Guangzhou Asiad, Taiwan government could not
decide whether to take the case of a controversial disqualification of a
Taiwanese female taekwondo athlete in the event to an international sports
arbitration institution.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency meeting headed by Vice Premier Sean Chen failed to come to a
conclusion Friday on whether to appeal to Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration
for Sport (CAS) about the case of Yang Shu-chun, who was disqualified during her
first-round bout in the women's taekwondo under 49-kilogram weight division on
Nov. 17 after she scored a 9-0 lead over her Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>According to World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk,
who did not have any role in the actual decision but served as the main
spokesman for the taekwondo world in the incident's aftermath, said Yang was
disqualified for wearing extra sensors on her socks in an attempt to score more
points, which was an act of cheating.</P>
      <P>All video evidence and witness accounts show that Chen had taken off the sensors
before going into the ring.</P>
      <P>The task force, which included government agencies such as the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice and the Sports Affairs Council, was
still unsure about the CAS' jurisdiction on the case and what remedy it is
seeking, said Sung Yao-ming, a lawyer hired by the Taiwan government to handle
the case.</P>
      <P>The CAS is established to handle sports disputes, but "we should first clarify
whether this case fits the definition of a 'sports dispute', " Sung told
reporters in a post-meeting press conference.</P>
      <P>"We are now waiting for further information from a Swiss-based lawyer who is
familiar with sports arbitration matters to have better assessment of our next
move, " he said, adding that the decision "should come within days."</P>
      <P>However, it appeared that Taiwan is not likely to file a lawsuit against
taekwondo officials in a Guangzhou court, a suggestion made by Sung after the
incident, which has ignited public outrage and an anti-Korea sentiment in Taiwan
and has received coverage from international media.</P>
      <P>The controversy was so high-profile that Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou and
Premier Wu Den-yih had personally addressed the incident as "unfair" and had
described it as damaging Taiwan's national pride.</P>
      <P>Citing an interpretation by China's supreme people's court during the 2008
Beijing Olympics stating that the court did not accept sports-related lawsuits,
Sung said that a Guangzhou court could reject the case with the same reason.</P>
      <P>SAC Chairwoman Tai Hsia-ling said that while Taiwanese fans and Taiwan
government could not accept the accusations against Yang, the task force will
appeal the case via legal channels.</P>
      <P>"We're going to approach this dispute in the same way we were trained on the
sports field -- to play it by the rule, " Tai said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Indian stage director Chongtham Jayanta of the Ex Theatre on Friday
presentedNumit Kappain Taipei on Friday, a work adapted from an ancient story
which he said showcases how tradition can survive in modern theatres.</P>
      <P>Numit  Kappa, meaningshooting  the sunin the Indian language, is an age-old
literary work which dates back to A.D. 32, according to the Indian director.</P>
      <P>Jayanta told Central News Agency in an interview that he first read the story
when he was a college student and found that the story has a universal appeal,
for it deals with power struggle and the suffering of the common people under
tyrannical rule.</P>
      <P>Comparing good leaders to the sun, he said an orderly society would fall into
chaos if there were no good rulers.</P>
      <P>Political unrest in Taiwan has nothing to do with the play, because this is not
a political drama. All the countries are facing similar problems, and everyone
watching the play can relate to it in their own way,he said.</P>
      <P>To recreate an atmosphere of the old Indian society, the director incorporated
elements of Taiwans aboriginal music and there will be live dances and singing
throughout the performance.</P>
      <P>Borrowing the form of the classical story, Jayanta said he hoped the audience
will be rediscovering the charm of tradition through his approach to modern
theatrical forms, for he found that many of the younger generation now feels
disconnected with tradition and old values.</P>
      <P>Jayanta is considered one of the most promising stage directors in India. He
founded the Ex Theatre in Taiwan in 2006.Numit Kappa will have two more showings
at the Experimental Theatre on Saturday and Sunday.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese baseball pitcher Chien-Ming Wang has become a free agent after the
Washington Nationals chose not to offer a new contract to him but might try to
keep him at a cheaper price, the U.S. media reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The Nationals was more inclined to sign a contract worth less than US$2 million,
what they paid Wang this season, or even a Minor League Baseball deal, the
online CSNwashington reported. The news of the non-tender was confirmed later by
Octagon Baseball, which represents Wang.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, the team also non-tendered reliever Joel Peralta and
catcher Wil Nieves. If the Nationals had tendered the 30-year-old Wang, they
would have had to pay him US$1.6 million, the amount Wang could get in
arbitration.</P>
      <P>Wang will negotiate with other clubs, including the Nationals, said Octagon
Baseball. Wang respected the decision and thanked the Nationals for their
assistance and support in the past year, it quoted Wang as saying, adding he
would continue to train and rehabilitate by himself to return to his best as
early as possible.</P>
      <P>The former Yankees sink-baller failed to play in the MLB since he injured his
shoulder and underwent a surgery last year. He spent all year rehabbing, which
made him a not-surprizing non-tender.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Dodgers tendered another Taiwanese pitcher Kuo Hong-
chih, whose US$950,000 contract could jump to as much as US$2 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talks on Taiwan investing in Indonesian island yet to happen: envoy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recently improved relations between Taiwan and China have enhanced Taiwans trade
ties with Indonesia, but no formal talks have been launched on the possibility
of Taiwan investing in an Indonesian island, said Andrew Hsia, Taiwans top envoy
to Indonesia, last week.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono through his
ministers invited Taiwan to invest in Moratai Island, an island one-15th the
size of Taiwan, with an area of 2,400 square kilometers on the northern tip of
Indonesia.</P>
      <P>The proposal was made to Taiwans economics minister Shih Yen-shiang, who led a
delegation of over 100 people to Indonesia in October to study the Southeast
Asian country's economic and trade environment.</P>
      <P>Hsia, who has visited Moratai, said the sparsely populated island of roughly
50,000 people is a prime location for investments in fishery, agriculture, light
industry, and tourism because it does not experience typhoons or cold fronts.</P>
      <P>Once the former military headquarters for U.S. General Douglas MacArthur during
World War II, the remote islet is equipped with a seven-runway airport, which
adds to its appeal, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>According to some newspaper reports, the deal could be cemented in early 2011.
However, Hsia insisted no timeline has been set.</P>
      <P>Both sides are carefully evaluating the options. There are still many
outstanding issues to be assessed such as what are the collective interests in
this project and what mutual benefits might arise from this collaboration, said
the former deputy foreign minister, adding that both sides are still mulling
over the details.</P>
      <P>While crediting warming China-Taiwan relations as a key factor in the improved
Taiwan-Indonesia ties, the representative said a formal trade pact with Jakarta
still remains in the far distance.</P>
      <P>Both  sides are very positive  about our current  trade relationship, but we are
still not at a stage where we can even begin to discuss a free trade
agreement,he said.</P>
      <P>As the largest economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia has long been viewed
favorably by Taiwanese investors,  especially after the formation of an ASEAN-
China Free Trade Area which went into effect on January 1 this year.</P>
      <P>Indonesia is Taiwans 10th largest trade partner. Taiwans investments in
Indonesia have amounted to over US$13.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also the most popular destination for Indonesian overseas workers due
to its higher salary and good benefits, said Hsia.</P>
      <P>According to the Council of Labor Affairs, there are around 150,000 Indonesian
workers in Taiwan, which accounts for 40 percent of Taiwans foreign labor force.</P>
      <P>On a people-to-people level, Taiwan and Indonesia share close ties. Last week,
the Indonesia city of Singkawang became a sister city of Taoyuan Countys Yangmei
City.</P>
      <P>During the initial aftermath of the recent volcanic eruptions in Indonesia's
Mount Merapi, Taiwanese compatriots in Indonesia donated blankets, slippers, and
T-shirts to the local residents. The combined money donated from the Taiwanese
government and Taiwanese public reached over US$370,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday began serving his sentence for two
corruption cases during his terms in office. He was accorded the same treatment
as other prisoners except that he could work and have meals alone and was
allowed to share a room with a specially selected inmate with a mild
temperament.</P>
      <P>Also convicted in the same cases was Chen's wheelchair-bound wife, Wu Shu-jen,
who is widely known to be in ailing health.</P>
      <P>Authorities must properly arrange her imprisonment based on humanitarian
principles. In considering whether Wu could be granted bail for medical reasons
or put under home confinement,  the authorities do not need to go strictly by
the rigid clauses of the law and should not be afraid of making exceptions.
After all, this is the country's first imprisonment case involving a former head
of state and his wife.</P>
      <P>The imprisonment of Chen and Wu is a sad shame for the entire nation. The public
should show their sympathy and understanding for the former first lady and allow
the authorities greater freedom in dealing with her imprisonment. (Editorial

      <P>Chinese manufacturers of non-smartphones altogether will occupy a bigger market
share than Nokia Corp., the world's largest handset maker, for the first time
this year, according to a local research firm.</P>
      <P>The world will see sales of 1.17 billion non-smartphone units in 2010, with
Nokia taking the largest share of 29.4 percent, Digitimes Research forecast
Friday.</P>
      <P>The company's senior analyst Roger Huang said that if Chinese non-smartphone
makers are seen as a collective group, their combined market share, forecast at
34.2 percent, will surpass Nokia's for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>He attributed Chinese manufacturers' competitive advantage to their efforts to
meet the demands of emerging markets and their ability to turn out low-priced
products with good specifications.</P>
      <P>In 2011, global shipments of handsets that are not smartphones are likely to
reach 1.11 billion units, down 5 percent from this year due to the growth of
smartphones, the research company noted.</P>
      <P>In terms of companies, Nokia will remain in top place next year with a 29.7
percent market share, while the total market share of Chinese makers will hit a
higher 34.8 percent, according to the research firm.</P>
      <P>Samsung Electronics will come in second place with a 19.8 percent market share
predicted for 2011, down from 20.5 percent in 2010; and LG Electronics will
enjoy a 10.1 percent market share, up from 9.9 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Huang added that Chinese handset makers, Nokia, Samsung and LG will remain major
players in the non-smartphone market, while other brand  companies  have
started  shifting  their  focus  from non-smartphones to smartphones.</P>

than other international investment agreements because of the delicate
relationship between the two sides. It is therefore not surprising that the
negotiations have not been smooth.</P>
      <P>It seems the government was too optimistic about setting a timetable for the

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Where will the ex-president's wife be jailed?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/04/10  14:33:40
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the convicted former president Chen Shui-bian settled in a cell smaller than
4 square meters at a prison in the northern Taiwan county of Taoyuan, it is
still unclear where his wheelchair-bound wife Wu Shu-jen, also given a combined
19-year sentence for her roles in two bribery cases that involved her husband,
will serve her term.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office will convene a special meeting of several
chief prosecutors next Monday to discuss how to carry out Wu's imprisonment.
Meanwhile, some said the authorities are inclined to a proposal of sending Wu to
the hospital affiliated to the Taichung Prison in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the Prison Act, a prison can refuse to accept an inmate when such a person
is old, disabled or cannot take care of himself or herself.</P>
      <P>When an inmate is refused by a prison under these regulations, the person has to
be sent to a hospital, guardian, or other appropriate institution after a
prosecutor considers their condition.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are expected to come up with a solution for Wu's case in a planned
special meeting. They will consider options including having Wu stay at the
Taichung Prison-affiliated hospital with Wu covering all the medical costs by
herself; releasing Wu on bail at a huge sum; or sending the ailment-suffering
convicted to a "hospital, guardian, or other appropriate institution" based on
the Prison Act.</P>
      <P>Now, it is certain that the widely-discussed proposals, such as house
confinement or having Wu wear electronic ankle bracelets fetters, will not be
adopted because there is no law in the country regulating home confinement and
electronic bracelets are only applied to those convicted of sexual assault
charges who are released on parole. (Dec. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Chen, who is identified by his inmate serial number "1020" at the Taipei Prison,
spent his first night peacefully at the prison Friday. He only asked for a small
desk for writing from the jail management, to which he had pledged to respect
all the rules at jail to avoid the image that he is given preferential treatment
due to his status as a former president.</P>
      <P>Different from the quiet atmosphere in Chen's cell, it was noisy outside the
prison Friday morning, when many Chen supporters waited to visit Chen with food
as a gift, which they said are his favorite.</P>
      <P>Chen was sentenced on Nov. 11 to a total of 19 years in prison for two bribery
charges in the cases involving a land deal in Lungtan, Taoyuan County and the
appointment of a chairwoman of the Taipei 101 skyscraper. The court is expected
to decide later whether the two sentences will be served consecutively or
concurrently or the exact duration of his time behind the bars. (Dec. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ting-fei of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
visited Chen at the prison Friday. She said Chen told her that it is the
politics, instead of the judiciary system, that put him behind bars.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Chen Yu-chang reiterated the party's call for a fair trial for
Chen, who withdrew from the DPP in August 2008 after being accused of
corruption. (Dec. 4, 2010).</P>

      <P>Companies of Taiwan and Switzerland attending exhibitions or engaging in
business activities on either side now can apply for a refund of the value-added
tax (VAT) they have paid to the host country, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The MOF announced that from July 1, foreign enterprises with no regular venues
to do business in Taiwan are eligible to request a VAT refund with local tax
offices, as long as they have paid more than NT$5,000 (US$64) in VAT for goods
or services they purchased while attending trade shows or taking part in
business activities in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following in the footsteps of Slovenia and Germany, Switzerland was the third
country to have reached agreement with Taiwan on this mutually beneficial
measure after the MOF put it in place.</P>
      <P>The measure, retroactive to July 1, 2010, was designed to help reduce operating
costs for Taiwanese companies and lure more foreign businesses to participate in
trade fairs here,  MOF officials explained.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest consumer electronics show, featuring new products and
technologies from companies, government agencies and research institutes, kicked
off a month-long run in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ICT Month fair brings together more than 350 exhibitors from home and abroad
in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry every year,
creating business opportunities worth more than NT$10 billion (US$331 million),
according to the Taipei Computer Association, which is organizing the event.</P>
      <P>"During the one-month period, the fair also brings the latest technology trends
and applications to the more-than 2 million people who are expected to attend, "
said Raff Liu, the head of the event's organizing committee, in his opening
remarks.</P>
      <P>On the 2010 event's theme, "Embracing a Smart Life, " Liu said this refers to
how technological developments can improve the quality of life.</P>
      <P>"The products at the fair no longer highlight just enhanced efficiency or
specifications, but rather focus on user friendliness," he said.</P>
      <P>The public can also learn about how the ICT industry has transformed itself to
focus on innovative services, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih, speaking at the opening ceremony, said the government is
working to build Taiwan as a base for innovative technology products.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to boost the development of smart handheld devices,
cloud computing online technology and wireless broadband services have not only
created an "intelligent environment" for local citizens but have also reduced
carbon emissions and conserved energy due to enhanced efficiency, he added.</P>
      <P>The annual fair, now in its 31st year, will also be held in central Taiwan's
Taichung City Dec. 17-22 and in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City Dec. 30-Jan. 4
after running until Dec. 12 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>A total of 350 exhibitors, including Acer, Asustek, Sony, HTC and Epson can

percent compared to last year's show, according to the organizer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait development should be virtuous cycle: foreign minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
12/04/10  16:26:08
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is imperative for China to respect the will of the people of Taiwan and make
the development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations a virtuous, rather a vicious
cycle, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang told CNA in an interview Friday.</P>
      <P>"China needs to know that both sides of the strait have fought over the issue of
sovereignty for decades without a solution. And that's why we say it's time to
set the dispute aside and stop touching upon the issue, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>"We also think that China should take the passion and consensus of the 23
million  Taiwanese  people  to participate  in the international community
seriously, " said Yang.</P>
      <P>Economically, Taiwan and China have been stepping up efforts to liberalize
bilateral trade ties by signing the historic economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) in June. Bilateral personnel exchanges have also increased
since the relaxation of regulations, he said.</P>
      <P>On the political front, President Ma Ying-jeou has called for rapprochement,
flexible diplomacy and a diplomatic truce with China since assuming office in
May 2008 to reduce tension and stop a diplomatic war over international allies,
which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars under previous administrations.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's international space is still limited, Yang said.  For many
Taiwanese,  various incidents on international occasions suggest that China is
still hesitant to further extend its goodwill.</P>
      <P>China has to understand that "cross-strait relations and Taiwan's external
relations should go hand-in-hand in a virtuous cycle, " Yang said, so that the
Taiwanese people will be more supportive of government policy.</P>
      <P>"In the past, it has been a vicious cycle and a relentless diplomatic war, "
said Yang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has done its part in extending olive branches, choosing not to escalate
tension in its efforts to participate in politically sensitive international
organizations, such as the United Nations, asking instead only for meaningful
participation, he said.</P>
      <P>In the Southeast Asian countries of Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, where Taiwan
intends to boost its economic presence, friendly gestures from China are thin on
the ground, however, Yang went on.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not intend to alter these countries' relations with China, nor is
it approaching them with hidden agendas, " said Yang, adding that China's
diplomatic approach to Taiwan "has not been well thought through."</P>
      <P>Looking at the coming year,  Yang said Taiwan's diplomacy priorities will focus
on consolidating relations with its current 23 diplomatic allies and its
relations with the European Union, the United States, Japan, South Korea and
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan may not enjoy official diplomatic relations with these countries, but we
are allies who share the same values of freedom and democracy, " he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also actively seek more meaningful participation in international
organizations, as well as international non-government organizations, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 6,170 couples filed their marriage registrations Sept. 9 this year,
marking the highest daily number recorded over the past 20 years, according to a
report released Saturday by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The date is seen as auspicious in Taiwan because of the series of nines, which
in Mandarin Chinese is a homonym for "long-lasting." 2010 is the 99th year of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>On another date that is also considered propitious -- Oct. 10, 2010 -- 2,527
couples registered their marriages, eight times the daily average of 300 couples
in 2009, the report shows.</P>
      <P>The number 10 implies completeness and perfection in Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that 112,020 couples tied the knot during the first 10
months of this year, up 20.5 percent from the same period of 2009.</P>
      <P>According to superstition, 2009 was a "lonely phoenix year" unfavorable to the
longevity of marriages. Only 117,099 marriages were recorded that year, a
decrease of 37,767 from 2008.</P>
      <P>During the January-October period, there were 17,534 marriages involving a non-
Taiwanese spouse, accounting for 15.65 percent of all the marriages registered.
The number represents a drop of 647, or 3.56 percent, from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The report also shows that people in Taiwan are getting married later and later
in life.</P>
      <P>In 2009, the average age of newlyweds was 31.6 for first-time grooms and 28.9
for first-time brides, an increase of 0.5 years from 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Scholars call for more action on human rights education in Asia</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Human rights education in many parts of Asia is still lacking and needs
substantive change, scholars and human rights defenders from Asia said Saturday
in a seminar in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taipei Municipal University of Education, the scholars and
human rights workers from across Asia were participating in the three-day
international conference titled "Propagation and Implementation of the Idea of
Human Rights."</P>
      <P>Jefferson Plantilla, a lawyer and human rights educator based in Japan, noted
that there were many cases of human rights violations reported throughout
Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s, a time when rulers would put economic
growth ahead of raising human rights education awareness and training.</P>
      <P>Since 2000, human rights education centers have been established across the
region, and as of November this year, 90 such centers were in place to help
promote human rights education, he said. The lack of coordination among these
centers, however, still poses a big problem for citizens, he went on.</P>
      <P>Li Dan, an AIDS activist and human rights defender from China, said that since
he was young, he felt strongly deprived of human rights education.</P>
      <P>"If you are an optimist, you would say things are gradually changing in China.
But the truth is that courses and teaching on human rights education remain very
scant, because the last thing the Chinese government wants is to push for the
development of human rights," Lee said.</P>
      <P>In China, many human rights workers do not tell others what they do for fear of
being labeled dissidents, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>He said there are only two universities in China that offer lessons that
correspond to the universal values of human rights, while the majority of the
schools give lessons to brainwash students that Chinese people do not need the
kind of human rights education that Western people receive.</P>
      <P>Yvonne Liu, a member of Hong Kong's Alliance of Civil Education, said human
rights education is not institutionalized in schools at all levels. As a result,
human rights education in Hong Kong is very weak. Liu, a teacher, said her
students often ask her about the sensational words and pictures carried on the
front page of Apple Daily, and that she found it difficult to help change the
learning environment for the younger generation.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan's part, Professor Tang Mei-ying, who has conducted several surveys on
teachers' attitudes on pushing for human rights education, said most of the
teachers in Taiwan are supportive of the teaching and promotion of human rights-
related educational classes.</P>
      <P>She said the responsibility of creating a positive environment to push for human
rights education in Taiwan is not just in the hands of educators and that the
government and the media should be more actively involved, while not
intervening.</P>
      <P>"When it comes to human rights education in Taiwan, we need more action and
fewer slogans, " she said, adding that "political influence should also be wiped
out."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A full-size replica of a 17th century Ming Dynasty armed merchant vessel set off
on its maiden voyage from Anping Harbor in the southern Taiwan city of Tainan
Saturday to re-enact the scene of the arrival of a Chinese general over 300
years ago.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair  launched the boat along with Oscar-winning director
Ang Lee.</P>
      <P>The 29.5-meter wooden replica sailed, escorted by more than 10 modern ships and
police helicopters, to the mouth of the Luermen River,  the site of the landing
of the Ming Dynasty's Cheng Cheng-kung, better known as Koxinga, in 1661.</P>
      <P>The replica of the ancient ship is named "Taiwan Cheng Kung" to commemorate the
military leader for his success in forcing the Dutch out of Taiwan in 1662 and
making Taiwan his base for a campaign against the Manchu-ruled Qing dynasty.</P>
      <P>To recreate the ship, the Tainan city government sent officials to Japan in 2008
to obtain a copy of a painting of the vessel kept at the Matsura History Museum
in Hirado City, Nagasaki Prefecture, where Koxinga was born in 1624.</P>
      <P>Based on the 1706 painting,  the 300-ton replica, with a displacement of 150
tons, was completed in 18 months, with funding of NT$80 million (US$2.5 million)
from the Council for Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>Unlike its sail-driven original, the replica is equipped with modern navigation
devices and an engine. It will conduct a one-week, round-the-island voyage next
year as part of celebrations for the 100th founding anniversary of the Republic
of China.</P>
      <P>The ship will also sail to Koxinga's birthplace in Hirado, as well as Quanzhou
in Fujiang Province, and the outlying islands of Kinmen and Penghu, where
Koxinga's army was once based, according to the Tainan city government.</P>

      <P>Products or services featuring lower carbon emissions can better appeal to
consumers amid rising environmental awareness, and new information and
communications technology (ICT) plays a big role in this process, Acer's
chairman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Consumers worldwide are being educated (on the issue) and are changing their
values and concepts as they experience the real impact of extreme weather, "
said J.T. Wang, the head of the world's second-largest PC brand, at the opening
ceremony in Taipei of ICT Month, Taiwan's largest consumer electronics show.</P>
      <P>"Consumers are now more willing to pay for products or services that can help
reduce energy and cut carbon emissions," he said.</P>
      <P>The global efforts to conserve energy can benefit from the technologies and
applications of the ICT industry, which can greatly enhance efficiency, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Many countries have applied new ICT technologies  to city infrastructure,
buildings, transport and power systems, he noted.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the use of new ICT technologies will make a 15-percent to 20-
percent contribution to cutting carbon emissions and energy use.</P>
      <P>In addition,  Wang  said that Taiwan,  with  its existing technological
advantage, will be able to serve as a leader in the new ICT industry that will
spawn new services through the integration of computer, communications, consumer
electronics and content.</P>
      <P>"The mixture of these different technologies and content will create many new
products and services that we have never seen before," he said.</P>
      <P>"These new markets represent huge opportunities worth hundreds of billions of
U.S. dollars, " he said, citing as examples new handheld devices such as tablet
computers, e-readers and smartphones.</P>
      <P>"This change has just started and is likely to last for more than 10 years," he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has a good opportunity to come out ahead in these fields, as the country
already has a competitive edge in the ICT industry, Wang said, urging the

      <P>The global market for notebook computers will grow between 20 percent and 25
percent next year on the back of rising demand in emerging  markets,  the head
of the world's second-largest PC brand Acer said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Company Chairman J.T. Wang expressed optimism over upcoming sales for the
Christmas holiday season and the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>During the first three months of 2011, Intel Corp., the world's largest chip
maker, will launch several new central processing units (CPUs) , which he
predicted will create a new wave of business opportunities.</P>
      <P>On market speculation that the emergence of tablet computers will replace
personal computers, he said that growing demand in the emerging markets will
help drive demand for notebooks.</P>
      <P>As a result, he forecast that the compound annual growth rate for global

      <P>No quota will be set on the number of applicants for a micro loan from the
government as part of its efforts to help startup companies, Premier Wu Den-yih
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"I have discussed the issue with President Ma Ying-jeou and we have agreed that
no cap will be imposed on the number of borrowers of this kind of government-
provided small loan, " Wu said during an address at an award ceremony to honor
successful small business startups.</P>
      <P>"The government will do its utmost to help as many people as it can, no matter
whether it is 10,000 or 30,000, at a time when Taiwan has yet to recover from
the blow of the global financial crisis, " he said.</P>

age group, a borrower can borrow a maximum amount of NT$1 million (US$33,000)

      <P>According to the CLA, the measure has benefited more than 6,000 small business
startups, helping create some 16,000 jobs since its inception in 2007.</P>

      <P>The winners of a contest to use mass transport to travel around Taiwan in
creative ways were announced Saturday after a five-month campaign to spread the
message of eco-friendliness and to encourage the public to experience "the real
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The four winners, each of whom was awarded NT$100,000 (US$3,300) in prize money,
carried out their travel projects in four different categories -- most
interesting, most economical, most touching and the most mass-transport
supportive.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Highways, which organized the contest, said it was
inspired by the total of 133 entries on how to make mass transport systems and
transfer services work better.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a couple in their 70s, whose travel project won the "most economical"
category,  said they "felt younger as they traveled."</P>
      <P>"As you can see, our age has saved us a lot of money since we hardly ever need
to pay full ticket prices, " said Chang Ti, who along with his wife spent
NT$19,411 (US$636.43) on one week of travel.</P>
      <P>"I'd encourage people, old and young, to travel around Taiwan and enjoy
themselves, " Chang said. "After all, you can't take it with you when you go."</P>

    <HEADLINE>New health insurance system might be implemented in 2012</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 4 (CNA)
12/04/10  21:03:51

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang expressed hope Saturday
that a second-generation national health insurance (NHI) premium system can be
put into practice in 2012.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony to mark the 13th anniversary of the Formosa Cancer
Foundation, Yaung said legal revisions to pave the way for implementation of the
new premium system are 90 percent complete and that the remaining 10 percent
require more work.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT)-controlled Legislative Yuan has set a Dec. 7
deadline for the passage of the DOH-proposed amendments to the existing NHI Act
to permit the introduction of the new premium system.</P>
      <P>Twenty clauses of the bill, however, have yet to receive majority support from
lawmakers. In addition to lawmakers from the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), some KMT legislators also remain skeptical about the fairness of
the new premium calculation formula.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, the NHI premium will be levied in terms of total household
income instead of the individual salaries or wages of the insured as is the case
at present. The new system is considered fairer and an essential move if the
cash-strapped NHI system is to remain viable.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying said the proposed new system is still flawed
because it excludes capital gains, overseas earnings and some other sources of
income from the household income that will be used as the basis for health
insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of Finance statistics, 56 percent of the total income of
Taiwan's richest 1 percent of families comes from stock capital gains.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang said, the new premium system should not exclude
capital gains from the NHI premium levy calculations.</P>
      <P>Moreover, she went on, the new system might increase the burden on impoverished
families because the DOH-proposed bill does not include clear provisions in this
regard.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Li-huan said the inclusion of capital gains could make the
premium calculations too difficult, but she added that the party might come up
with a new version of the revised NHI bill to make the new system fairer and to
facilitate its passage.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, who concurrently serves as chairman of
the Formosa Cancer Foundation,  reaffirmed his confidence that same day that the
legislature will finalize the screening of the NHI bill by Dec. 7 as scheduled.</P>

      <P>Hundreds of students and local citizens streamed into National Chung Hsing
University in Taichung on Saturday to listen to a speech by Oscar-winning
Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee, who is currently in Taiwan to shoot his
latest film creation "Life of Pi."</P>
      <P>Lee will shoot the entire movie in 3D and about two-thirds of the film will be
shot in Taiwan, mostly in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the film is still in its early production stage, as he and the
screenwriter are still working on the script, but more than 100 international
film crew members who he used to work with in the United States have stayed in
Taiwan for a while for location scouting.</P>
      <P>"I want to find a new way of speaking/narrating in film, and 3D could be a good
way," he said.</P>
      <P>It's very challenging to shoot a movie in 3D because the technology is still
very new and nobody really understands it, he said.</P>
      <P>"But I've always wanted to challenge myself, " said Lee. "I may look like a
gentle person from the outside, but I like challenges more than anyone else."</P>
      <P>"Life of Pi" is a production based on a prize-winning novel with the same name
written by Canadian writer Yann Martel about an Indian boy adrift on a lifeboat
in the Pacific with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a tiger.</P>
      <P>Many Hollywood producers have attempted a film adaptation from the book, yet
many give up because it is considered too difficult to visualize the story on
the big screen.</P>
      <P>Lee said that,  during his nearly 20 years of filmmaking experience, he found
that it is important to "have faith" and to really believe everything will work
out eventually.</P>
      <P>"The greatest idea always comes from nowhere, so you have to go to nowhere to
get it," he said philosophically.</P>
      <P>The 56-year-old filmmaker, who is based in New York, was hailed as the "the
pride of Taiwan" after wining an Oscar in 2005 for directing "Brokeback
Mountain". He is the first Asian filmmaker to receive the Academay Award for
Best Director.</P>

2000: A total of 105 young Indonesians begin to receive two years of
professional training in Taiwan as part of the ROC's efforts to help its major
Southeast Asian trading partner develop small- and medium-sized enterprises.

2001: Beijing authorities sternly rejects Taiwan's proposal that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait commence dialogue on the "three direct links" issue under
the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The "three direct links"
refers to direct cross-strait trade, postal and transportation links.

Motse's lesson of the day: "When the administration of the ruler answers to the
desire of the subjects, it manifests an understanding of approvals and
disapprovals of the people. When there is such an understanding, the good will
be discovered and rewarded and the bad will be discovered and punished, and the
country will surely attain order."</TEXT>

      <P>Three Taiwanese golfers have swung to the final round of the LPGA Tour
Championship at the Grand Cypress Golf Club in Orlando, Florida.</P>
      <P>The 72-hole season-ending event features a total purse of US$1.5 million and a
unique two-cut format. The field was reduced to the low-70 players and ties
after 36 holes and to the low-30 players and ties after 54 holes.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese golfers Yani Tseng, Candie Kung and Amy Hung have managed to make the
lowest 30 players and ties list, finishing the third round Saturday at 29th,
16th and 21st, respectively.</P>
      <P>Tseng -- who won the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April and the RICOH Women's
British Open in August and is considered one of the top five in the field to
have a chance to grab the LPGA's Player of the Year Award 2010 -- did not play
well in the third round.</P>
      <P>Despite her one-under-par shots on the 7th, 11th, 14th and 17th holes, she
suffered a tough tee time, with bogeys on the third and 18th holes and agonizing
double bogeys on the ninth and 13th holes.</P>
      <P>The 21-year-old Tseng, who became the world's fourth-ranked player this year,
finished the first three rounds with 222, six shots over par, to a 29th tie -- a
narrow escape from being ousted from the lowest 30.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the bad breaks were not just mental. "There's something wrong with my
technique," she said.</P>
      <P>"Luckily, I still have a chance to improve tomorrow, " the undaunted Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kung, who was comparatively more stable Saturday, finished the third
round at a 16th position tie, with three shots over par.</P>
      <P>Hung finished with a 21st tie, with four shots over par.</P>

      <P>Nearly 75 percent of office workers in a recent survey said they want to visit
the 2010 Taipei Flora Expo but have yet to do so, mainly because the crowds and
long waiting lines have put them off, according to the poll results released
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the online job bank 1111.com, found that 73 percent of
the respondents said they had yet to visit the expo, compared with 8.6 percent
who said they had visited.</P>
      <P>In a multiple choice series of questions, up to 82.7 precent said they were most
concerned about the crowds, followed by long waiting lines (66.4 percent) and a
dirty and chaotic environment (29.8 percent).</P>
      <P>Among the respondents who have already visited the expo, most said it is
attractive because of the high-tech planning in the exhibition halls (58.1
percent) , because it is an international extravaganza (50.5 percent) , and
because it is a hot topic (37.1 percent).</P>
      <P>Further analysis found that those who have already visited the expo gave it a
score of 73.2 points, higher than the 68.9 points given by those who have not
actually seen it.</P>
      <P>With five months to go before the expo closes in April next year, over half of
those polled said they will visit the show between February and April next year,
mainly because they want to avoid the crowds (39.4 percent) , or because they
have holidays at that time (38.0 percent).</P>
      <P>However, 18.4 percent have no intention of visiting the show, mainly because
they do not like the crowds (29.9 percent) , they do not feel it to be anything
special (23.2 percent) , or they are not interested in flowers or gardening
(17.1 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 22 and Nov. 30, collecting 1.147 effective
samples with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIFA talks can be broken down</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) talks between Taiwan and the
United States can be broken down to make them more manageable if the negotiators
from the two sides find it difficult to complete them in one shot, Premier Wu
Den-yih said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the U.S. can resume the long-stalled TIFA talks topic by topic if the
two sides have problems reaching consensus on certain issues, Wu said during a
function to mark International Migrants Day in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is close to signing a free trade agreement (FTA) with South Korea and
the premier was asked by a reporter how Taiwan will face the issue of a
U.S.-South Korea FTA.</P>
      <P>The signing of such an FTA will mean that South Korea -- Taiwan's major rival in
the global market -- will be in a better position to compete against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu responded that South Korea was alarmed and felt pressure after Taiwan
concluded  the landmark Economic  Cooperation  Framework Agreement (ECFA) with
China earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The signing of a U.S.-South Korea FTA, therefore, would also cause Taiwan to
feel pressured, the premier said.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, Taiwan should take the approach that is most conducive to
protecting the people's interests when restarting the TIFA talks with the U.S.,
he said.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the issue, Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang reassured the
public that the TIFA talks will certainly take place before the end of the year,
albeit a bit later than expected.</P>
      <P>"Just sitting at the negotiating table is easier than working out an agenda and
sorting out barriers beforehand," Yang said.</P>
      <P>The new round of TIFA talks will most likely take place in Taipei, according to
the foreign minister.</P>
      <P>The TIFA framework, signed in September 1994, provides an official channel for
Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade and economic issues, but the two sides have not
held any talks since 2007 due mainly to conflict over a Taiwanese ban on U.S.
beef imports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the prospects of the U.S. granting Taiwanese passport holders
visa-free treatment, Yang said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has been
working toward that goal, but so far, "there is no timetable for its
implementation."</P>
      <P>The MOFA has recently launched a trial drive to get more Taiwanese citizens to
apply for their passports in person, as part of efforts to persuade the U.S. to
grant Taiwanese passport holders visa-free treatment, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>The U.S. wants Taiwan to increase the percentage of in-person passport
applications  and to make applicants  have their ID photographs taken when they
apply, on the grounds that Taiwanese passports are easily misused at present
because applicants do not need to present themselves in person for positive
identification.</P>
      <P>From January 2011, at least one household registration office in each city and
county  will be opened  to in-person  passport applications on a trial basis,
Yang said.</P>
      <P>He quoted the results of a recent opinion poll as indicating that nearly 90
percent of Taiwanese citizens are prepared to visit household registration
offices in person to file their passport applications if the move is conducive
to the U.S. visa-waiver policy.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bian said Sunday that with the steady increase in the
number of visitors to the 2010 Taipei Flora Expo, he is no longer worried about
too few visitors, but rather about too many visitors.</P>
      <P>Hau said that at present, visitor numbers at the expo are increasing rapidly.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that contrary to allegations, he is not concerned about too few
visitors. "In fact, I am more worried that too many visitors each day could
compromise the quality of the experience," he said.</P>
      <P>Hau was responding to reports by the Liberty Times newspaper citing parents who
said their children's school have arranged for students to have two outdoor
education sessions at the expo twice each semester and who questioned whether
the expo wants to "make use of school students to help boost the number of
visitors."</P>
      <P>Asked if he is satisfied with the results of a survey showing that office
workers who have visited the expo gave an average of 73.2 out of a perfect 100
points on the expo, Hau said that he accepts the views of the public.</P>
      <P>But he also said he is gratified that most of the people are satisfied with the
expo.</P>
      <P>The expo kicked off its six-month run Nov. 6 with an opening ceremony in which
Doeke Faber, president of the International Association of Horticultural Growers
(AIPH) , praised it as the best he has seen in 50 years.</P>

      <P>More people in Taiwan have been acknowledged as low-income following a law
amendment to lower the property value threshold for public assistance, a
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-hsia, director of the MOI's Department of Social Affairs, quoted MOI
tallies as indicating that the number of low-income households totaled 110,055
at the end of September this year, accounting for 267,717 people, marking a
year-on-year increase of 10,000 households and 20,000-odd people, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Public Assistance Act was amended in 2005 and again in 2008, relaxing  the
eligibility  requirements  for public assistance, including relaxing property
assets calculation criteria and adjusting income calculation methods for
indigenous households.</P>
      <P>From this year, Huang said, the government has pushed the poverty line higher,
allowing low-income households in Taiwan Province, Taipei County and Kaohsiung
City with homes worth up to NT$3 million (US$100,000) to be entitled to public
assistance, compared to the previous NT$2.6 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the allowable level in Taipei City -- which has a much higher cost of
living than other parts of the country -- was adjusted to NT$5.5 million, up
from the previous NT$5 million, according to Huang.</P>

      <P>Figures released by the Ministry of the Interior Saturday show that the number
of couples tying the knot in the first 10 months of this year reached 112,020,
an increase of nearly 20,000 from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Among these couples, 15 percent were comprised of a local and a spouse from
China, Hong Kong, Macao or other foreign country.</P>
      <P>The figures also show a trend of people getting married later in life. In 2008,
the average age of brides and bridegrooms was 29.5 and 32.9, respectively. By
2009, the average age for both had reached 30.3 and 33.9, respectively.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said that looking ahead, he is sure the number
will set a new high in 2011.</P>
      <P>Jiang said next year will be a good year for marriage, given the fact that local
residents prefer to have "dragon boys" or "dragon girls" -- the next Year of the
Dragon falls in 2012 according to the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with the centennial anniversary of the Republic of China, as well
as a steady economic recovery, means that Jiang "can hardly wait to see the
record being broken."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has launched a series of campaigns and
activities this year to encourage people to get married and have more children,
which Jiang said have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that local people usually get married according to traditional
customs, noting that last year was a "lonely bird year, " considered
inauspicious for marriage, so that the number of couples tying the knot
decreased markedly.</P>
      <P>However, Sept. 9, which translates to "everlasting" in Chinese, was an
auspicious day, so that on that day, more than 6,000 couples took their vows,
setting a single-day record for the last two decades.</P>
      <P>Oct. 10 also conveys the sense of "a perfect 10" and on that day, 2,500 couples
registered their marriages, far outnumbering last year's daily average of 300
couples.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 100 couples will hold a mass wedding on the first day of the
centennial of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The mass wedding will be presided over by President Ma Ying-jeou, with Vice
President Vincent Siew acting as a matchmaker. Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Although the MOI estimates that the number of couples getting married could
reach over 140,000 this year, an increase of 20 percent from last year, it will
still lag far behind the 170,000 couples annually prior to 2003.</P>
      <P>An MOI official said that in addition to the custom factor, the drop in the
marriage rate is related to the younger generation's ideas about the
institution, while economic factors are also a major reason.</P>
      <P>Due to the soaring cost of housing and declining wages, young people are more
reluctant to tie the knot, the official said.</P>
      <P>They simply cannot afford houses, spouses or children, he said.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry has put a lot of effort into encouraging
marriage and childbirth, but Taiwan's marriage rate is still slipping, while its
birthrate is the lowest in the world.</P>
      <P>"It is indeed a difficult problem to solve," he said.</P>

      <P>Just as post-it notes are used by many people in daily life, it is now possible
to use a modern version with a computer, a Taiwanese optronics company said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tainan-based U-PAX unveiled its flexible writing pad that day for the first time
at the ICT Month fair in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "Paste and Play, " made of thin-film material that can be bent and cleaned
with water, allows consumers to draw or sign signatures on computers using
simply a USB connection to connect the device, U-PAX Manager Jason Yu told CNA
at the fair.</P>
      <P>"It is an environmentally friendly product that can be attached to a computer
screen and removed repeatedly, like a post-it note," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The paper-thin pad, sized from 3.5 to 7 inches, can also work with a micro-
projector -- another emerging technology -- applying the use of an image
projector in a handheld device to create a virtual keyboard or touch pad, he
added.</P>
      <P>The company is now in talks with buyers from Japan, India, Germany, New Zealand,
Italy and Australia, and expects to sell the product in the first quarter of
2011 for a minimum price of NT$500 (US$16.55).</P>
      <P>Coming on the heels of the increasing use of multi-touch tablet computers, the
writing pad is expected to attract application developers to meet consumers'
emerging demands, Yu said.</P>
      <P>A local consumer surnamed Lee said he would like to buy a larger model of the
product if it was available.</P>
      <P>"It is interesting. I would stick one to my 12-inch notebook if there was a
larger size," he said.</P>

      <P>Both Premier Wu Den-yih and Interior Minister  Jiang Yi-huah declined  to
speculate  Sunday on the probability that the next presidential and legislative
elections will be held on the same day.</P>
      <P>They said it is up to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to determine whether
the next presidential poll should be combined with the next legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>The next presidential poll is scheduled to take place in March 2012 and the next
legislative elections are likely to be held in December 2011 or January 2012, if
the existing rules are followed.</P>
      <P>Some ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators are planning to propose a combination
of presidential and legislative polls in a bid to save electoral costs and
reduce the impact of excessive social movement caused by people returning to
their registered residences to vote.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you said the commission has decided to convene a meeting
in January to discuss the matter, in the hope that a consensus can be reached in
the first half of 2011 and the issue finalized by June at the latest.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairwoman Chang Po-ya said the combined poll initiative involves many
issues that will need to be addressed and deliberated over.</P>
      <P>She said that if the government's proposed absentee voting system is introduced
for the 2012 presidential election only, the holding of the next presidential
and legislative polls in tandem will be impossible.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, executive director of the KMT's Policy Committee, called on the
government to consider the issue with prudence.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has yet to put forward any
concrete ideas about the issue. Nevertheless, Hung Yao-fu, a DPP vice secretary-
general, said it would not be a blessing for society if the KMT schemes to
implement combined presidential and legislative polls simply for its own
political gains. (By Lin Shen-hsu, Hsieh Chia-chen, Wen Kuei-hsiang, Lee Shu-hua

      <P>The government pledged Sunday to protect the rights of migrants in the country
and to promote cultural diversity, because Taiwan itself has always been a
migrant country.</P>
      <P>"From the days of Koxinga to 1949, when millions of people from China came here,
to the present, when there are about 910,000 migrants in Taiwan, this place has
always been a country of migrants, " Premier  Wu Den-yih said at the opening
ceremony  of the International Migrants Day Carnival that was held in the
National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall plaza.</P>
      <P>The carnival wrapped up a series of events organized by the National Immigration
Agency (NIA) to celebrate International Migrants Day Dec. 18, which was
appointed in 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly to take into account
the large and increasing number of migrants around the world.</P>
      <P>The migrant population in Taiwan consists mainly of foreign spouses, of whom a
large number come from Southeast Asian countries and China, and foreign workers,
most of whom came from Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>"Being a stranger in a country one hardly understands can be frightening, "
Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said, adding that "this is why new migrants in
Taiwan need as much help as physically handicapped or under-privileged people."</P>
      <P>In the past, the biggest challenges for migrants were the language barrier and
adapting to a different culture and society, said Hsieh Li-kung, NIA director-
general.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the help and assistance  of hundreds  of local non-government
organizations (NGOs) and local government agencies, those issues have become of
less concern, he said.</P>
      <P>With one in six marriages being transnational and one in eight babies born to
families in which one spouse is a migrant, Hsieh said, the new challenges for
Taiwan in the future will be creating jobs for migrants and providing help to
children of migrant families in terms of education and development.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of 12-year-old Penny Hsieh, who won the national women's
tennis title in the age-12 group and whose mother is originally from Cambodia,
the director-general said his agency has helped Hsieh to secure local
sponsorship to cover her training expenses.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who comes from the central county of Changhua, attended the carnival,
which had more than 100 booths, including food stands and stalls run by local
government agencies and NGOs to promote awareness of cultural diversity.</P>
      <P>Foreign representatives from the Marshall Islands, Peru, Haiti, The Gambia and

full marathon and the other nine of which ran the half marathon, completed the
races about six hours later.</P>
      <P>The runners with sight problems needed the guides to tell them the road

      <P>blue camp kept its grip on central and northern Taiwan in the Nov. 27
municipality elections, but the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) green camp grabbed more votes than the KMT. What does this election
outcome mean?</P>
      <P>It reflects the gap in economic and social development between northern and
southern Taiwan, but it also reflects the manipulation carried out by
politicians.</P>
      <P>This regional divide has provoked unease because it has led to stereotypical
political party choices by voters according to the region in which they live,
resulting in an increasing rift in society.</P>
      <P>In every election, we see voters who want to break the mode of either green or
blue camps and try to inject new thought into politics, and although the number
of so-called swing voters is not as great as the supporters of the two camps,
they sometimes play a pivotal role.</P>
      <P>The narrowing gap between the number of votes garnered by the two camps in two
of the municipalities -- Taichung (a merger of Taichung City and Taichung
County) and Xinbei (an upgrade of Taipei County) -- reflects such a sentiment.</P>
      <P>But even if the number of swing voters in Taiwan is no less than 2 million, it
seems that no credible third party can draw their votes,  evidenced by the
failure of Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's bid for Kaohsiung mayor. Yang,
a former DPP member who ran as an independent after failing to get his party's
nomination, has been recognized for his top performance in many polls.</P>
      <P>The DPP won a lot of swing voters this time by refraining from trumpeting its
past agenda of independence vs. unification with China.</P>
      <P>For its part, the KMT should learn that in a fast-changing society, if it still
leans on its old strategy of using traditional support bases such as the
agricultural and fishery associations or local factions, it will not be able to
fire up the modern-thinking voters and could also risk losing youth support.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Preventive health care important in NHI reform: organization</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
12/05/10  21:14:03
(By Nancy Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Preventive health care is to be highlighted to ensure the sustainability of the
national health insurance (NHI) system, a reform organization said in a public
forum attended by Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang Sunday, two
days before the second-generation NHI is expected to clear the legislative
floor.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problems of the NHI lie not only in the balance of revenue and
expenditure, but also in payment models and the way the system is used,
according to the Taiwan Association for Promoting Public Health (TAPPH), which
organized the forum.</P>
      <P>"The public and the media tend to be keeping a keen eye on the premium increases
that will be brought in under the new system, while overlooking other more
important issues in our health care system, " said Liu Mei-chun, chief executive
officer of the Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liu cited as an example the fact that many doctors take advantage of the current
model of payment -- fee-for-service -- by offering unnecessary services to
patients and then billing the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) for
reimbursement, wasting medical resources.</P>
      <P>In response to Liu's concerns, Yaung, who has an academic background in public
health, said the NHI is planning to adopt a new capitation payment model next
year in which health care providers will be paid a set amount for each insured
person assigned to them, encouraging hospitals to place greater emphasis on
preventive health care.</P>
      <P>"It makes more sense if doctors can earn more by keeping people away from
disease, " said Yaung, who was quoted in a media report in November as
advocating that bonuses be paid to hospitals that successfully administer
preventive health care.</P>
      <P>So far, four hospitals have applied to join the new system.</P>
      <P>Liu  also  noted  that  the  existing  system  is  overly hospital-centric. "We
should focus on how well-trained public health nurses can work in partnership
with the hospitals in terms of preventive health care," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Meei-shia, TAPPH president and a professor at the public health department
of National Cheng Kung University's College of Medicine, said that as the
objective of national health insurance is to keep everyone healthy, it is
logical that more budget should be spent on preventive health work.</P>
      <P>"At present, only about 3 percent of the national health and medical expenditure
is allocated to preventive health care. However, 54 percent is spent on
medicines and treatments for patients who are already sick, " said Chen, noting
that most of the diseases can be prevented with appropriate measures.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with the concept that "prevention is better than cure, " BNHI Director-
General Day Guey-ing said that regrettably, there is no law that regulates how
much resources should be distributed to preventive health work, making budget
allocation difficult.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the plight and complexity of the NHI system, Yaung concluded that
although the system in Taiwan is already much better than that in some other
countries, it still needs to undergo constant reform.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has set a Dec. 7 deadline for the passage of the second-
generation health insurance system in which premium will be levied according to
total household incomes instead of the individual salaries of the insured as is
the case at present.</P>
      <P>Although the new system is considered fairer and an essential move to make the
cash-strapped NHI viable, there remain concerns as to whether the new system can
actually address the core problems in the health system.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More people in Taiwan have been acknowledged as low-income following a law
amendment to lower the property value threshold for public assistance, a
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-hsia, director of the MOI's Department of Social Affairs, quoted MOI
tallies as indicating that the number of low-income households totaled 110,055
at the end of September this year, accounting for 267,717 people, marking a
year-on-year increase of 10,000 households and 20,000-odd people, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Public Assistance Act was amended in 2005 and again in 2008, relaxing  the
eligibility  requirements  for public assistance, including relaxing property
assets calculation criteria and adjusting income calculation methods for
indigenous households.</P>
      <P>From this year, Huang said, the government has pushed the poverty line higher,
allowing low-income households in Taiwan Province, Taipei County and Kaohsiung
City with homes worth up to NT$3 million (US$100,000) to be entitled to public
assistance, compared to the previous NT$2.6 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the allowable level in Taipei City -- which has a much higher cost of
living than other parts of the country -- was adjusted to NT$5.5 million, up
from the previous NT$5 million, according to Huang.</P>

      <P>Figures released by the Ministry of the Interior Saturday show that the number
of couples tying the knot in the first 10 months of this year reached 112,020,
an increase of nearly 20,000 from the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Among these couples, 15 percent were comprised of a local and a spouse from
China, Hong Kong, Macao or other foreign country.</P>
      <P>The figures also show a trend of people getting married later in life. In 2008,
the average age of brides and bridegrooms was 29.5 and 32.9, respectively. By
2009, the average age for both had reached 30.3 and 33.9, respectively.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said that looking ahead, he is sure the number
will set a new high in 2011.</P>
      <P>Jiang said next year will be a good year for marriage, given the fact that local
residents prefer to have "dragon boys" or "dragon girls" -- the next Year of the
Dragon falls in 2012 according to the Chinese calendar.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with the centennial anniversary of the Republic of China, as well
as a steady economic recovery, means that Jiang "can hardly wait to see the
record being broken."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has launched a series of campaigns and
activities this year to encourage people to get married and have more children,
which Jiang said have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that local people usually get married according to traditional
customs, noting that last year was a "lonely bird year, " considered
inauspicious for marriage, so that the number of couples tying the knot
decreased markedly.</P>
      <P>However, Sept. 9, which translates to "everlasting" in Chinese, was an
auspicious day, so that on that day, more than 6,000 couples took their vows,
setting a single-day record for the last two decades.</P>
      <P>Oct. 10 also conveys the sense of "a perfect 10" and on that day, 2,500 couples
registered their marriages, far outnumbering last year's daily average of 300
couples.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 100 couples will hold a mass wedding on the first day of the
centennial of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The mass wedding will be presided over by President Ma Ying-jeou, with Vice
President Vincent Siew acting as a matchmaker. Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Although the MOI estimates that the number of couples getting married could
reach over 140,000 this year, an increase of 20 percent from last year, it will
still lag far behind the 170,000 couples annually prior to 2003.</P>
      <P>An MOI official said that in addition to the custom factor, the drop in the
marriage rate is related to the younger generation's ideas about the
institution, while economic factors are also a major reason.</P>
      <P>Due to the soaring cost of housing and declining wages, young people are more
reluctant to tie the knot, the official said.</P>
      <P>They simply cannot afford houses, spouses or children, he said.</P>
      <P>The official said that the ministry has put a lot of effort into encouraging
marriage and childbirth, but Taiwan's marriage rate is still slipping, while its
birthrate is the lowest in the world.</P>
      <P>"It is indeed a difficult problem to solve," he said.</P>

      <P>Just as post-it notes are used by many people in daily life, it is now possible
to use a modern version with a computer, a Taiwanese optronics company said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tainan-based U-PAX unveiled its flexible writing pad that day for the first time
at the ICT Month fair in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The "Paste and Play, " made of thin-film material that can be bent and cleaned
with water, allows consumers to draw or sign signatures on computers using
simply a USB connection to connect the device, U-PAX Manager Jason Yu told CNA
at the fair.</P>
      <P>"It is an environmentally friendly product that can be attached to a computer
screen and removed repeatedly, like a post-it note," Yu said.</P>
      <P>The paper-thin pad, sized from 3.5 to 7 inches, can also work with a micro-
projector -- another emerging technology -- applying the use of an image
projector in a handheld device to create a virtual keyboard or touch pad, he
added.</P>
      <P>The company is now in talks with buyers from Japan, India, Germany, New Zealand,
Italy and Australia, and expects to sell the product in the first quarter of
2011 for a minimum price of NT$500 (US$16.55).</P>
      <P>Coming on the heels of the increasing use of multi-touch tablet computers, the
writing pad is expected to attract application developers to meet consumers'
emerging demands, Yu said.</P>
      <P>A local consumer surnamed Lee said he would like to buy a larger model of the
product if it was available.</P>
      <P>"It is interesting. I would stick one to my 12-inch notebook if there was a
larger size," he said.</P>

      <P>Both Premier Wu Den-yih and Interior Minister  Jiang Yi-huah declined  to
speculate  Sunday on the probability that the next presidential and legislative
elections will be held on the same day.</P>
      <P>They said it is up to the Central Election Commission (CEC) to determine whether
the next presidential poll should be combined with the next legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>The next presidential poll is scheduled to take place in March 2012 and the next
legislative elections are likely to be held in December 2011 or January 2012, if
the existing rules are followed.</P>
      <P>Some ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators are planning to propose a combination
of presidential and legislative polls in a bid to save electoral costs and
reduce the impact of excessive social movement caused by people returning to
their registered residences to vote.</P>
      <P>CEC spokesman Teng Tien-you said the commission has decided to convene a meeting
in January to discuss the matter, in the hope that a consensus can be reached in
the first half of 2011 and the issue finalized by June at the latest.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairwoman Chang Po-ya said the combined poll initiative involves many
issues that will need to be addressed and deliberated over.</P>
      <P>She said that if the government's proposed absentee voting system is introduced
for the 2012 presidential election only, the holding of the next presidential
and legislative polls in tandem will be impossible.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, executive director of the KMT's Policy Committee, called on the
government to consider the issue with prudence.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has yet to put forward any
concrete ideas about the issue. Nevertheless, Hung Yao-fu, a DPP vice secretary-
general, said it would not be a blessing for society if the KMT schemes to
implement combined presidential and legislative polls simply for its own
political gains. (By Lin Shen-hsu, Hsieh Chia-chen, Wen Kuei-hsiang, Lee Shu-hua

      <P>blue camp kept its grip on central and northern Taiwan in the Nov. 27
municipality elections, but the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) green camp grabbed more votes than the KMT. What does this election
outcome mean?</P>
      <P>It reflects the gap in economic and social development between northern and
southern Taiwan, but it also reflects the manipulation carried out by
politicians.</P>
      <P>This regional divide has provoked unease because it has led to stereotypical
political party choices by voters according to the region in which they live,
resulting in an increasing rift in society.</P>
      <P>In every election, we see voters who want to break the mode of either green or
blue camps and try to inject new thought into politics, and although the number
of so-called swing voters is not as great as the supporters of the two camps,
they sometimes play a pivotal role.</P>
      <P>The narrowing gap between the number of votes garnered by the two camps in two
of the municipalities -- Taichung (a merger of Taichung City and Taichung
County) and Xinbei (an upgrade of Taipei County) -- reflects such a sentiment.</P>
      <P>But even if the number of swing voters in Taiwan is no less than 2 million, it
seems that no credible third party can draw their votes,  evidenced by the
failure of Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing's bid for Kaohsiung mayor. Yang,
a former DPP member who ran as an independent after failing to get his party's
nomination, has been recognized for his top performance in many polls.</P>
      <P>The DPP won a lot of swing voters this time by refraining from trumpeting its
past agenda of independence vs. unification with China.</P>
      <P>For its part, the KMT should learn that in a fast-changing society, if it still
leans on its old strategy of using traditional support bases such as the
agricultural and fishery associations or local factions, it will not be able to
fire up the modern-thinking voters and could also risk losing youth support.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Preventive health care important in NHI reform: organization</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 5 (CNA)
12/05/10  21:14:03
(By Nancy Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Preventive health care is to be highlighted to ensure the sustainability of the
national health insurance (NHI) system, a reform organization said in a public
forum attended by Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang Sunday, two
days before the second-generation NHI is expected to clear the legislative
floor.</P>
      <P>The fundamental problems of the NHI lie not only in the balance of revenue and
expenditure, but also in payment models and the way the system is used,
according to the Taiwan Association for Promoting Public Health (TAPPH), which
organized the forum.</P>
      <P>"The public and the media tend to be keeping a keen eye on the premium increases
that will be brought in under the new system, while overlooking other more
important issues in our health care system, " said Liu Mei-chun, chief executive
officer of the Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation.</P>
      <P>Liu cited as an example the fact that many doctors take advantage of the current
model of payment -- fee-for-service -- by offering unnecessary services to
patients and then billing the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) for
reimbursement, wasting medical resources.</P>
      <P>In response to Liu's concerns, Yaung, who has an academic background in public
health, said the NHI is planning to adopt a new capitation payment model next
year in which health care providers will be paid a set amount for each insured
person assigned to them, encouraging hospitals to place greater emphasis on
preventive health care.</P>
      <P>"It makes more sense if doctors can earn more by keeping people away from
disease, " said Yaung, who was quoted in a media report in November as
advocating that bonuses be paid to hospitals that successfully administer
preventive health care.</P>
      <P>So far, four hospitals have applied to join the new system.</P>
      <P>Liu  also  noted  that  the  existing  system  is  overly hospital-centric. "We
should focus on how well-trained public health nurses can work in partnership
with the hospitals in terms of preventive health care," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Meei-shia, TAPPH president and a professor at the public health department
of National Cheng Kung University's College of Medicine, said that as the
objective of national health insurance is to keep everyone healthy, it is
logical that more budget should be spent on preventive health work.</P>
      <P>"At present, only about 3 percent of the national health and medical expenditure
is allocated to preventive health care. However, 54 percent is spent on
medicines and treatments for patients who are already sick, " said Chen, noting
that most of the diseases can be prevented with appropriate measures.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with the concept that "prevention is better than cure, " BNHI Director-
General Day Guey-ing said that regrettably, there is no law that regulates how
much resources should be distributed to preventive health work, making budget
allocation difficult.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging the plight and complexity of the NHI system, Yaung concluded that
although the system in Taiwan is already much better than that in some other
countries, it still needs to undergo constant reform.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has set a Dec. 7 deadline for the passage of the second-
generation health insurance system in which premium will be levied according to
total household incomes instead of the individual salaries of the insured as is
the case at present.</P>
      <P>Although the new system is considered fairer and an essential move to make the
cash-strapped NHI viable, there remain concerns as to whether the new system can
actually address the core problems in the health system.</P>

approvals and disapprovals of the subjects. When there is no such understanding,
then the good will not be discovered and rewarded and the bad will not be
punished."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's Yani Tseng clinches LPGA Player of the Year award</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng won the LPGA Player of the Year 2010 award in
Orlando, Florida Sunday, becoming the first golfer from Taiwan to do so.</P>
      <P>Tseng said she was overwhelmed when the announcement was made at the end of the
LPGA Tour Championship at the Grand Cypress Golf Club.</P>
      <P>"I never thought I would be holding this trophy, " she said. "I was always
holding the trophy in a tournament, but just one week, but this feels like I'm
holding for a year. I've been working so hard to chase this title."</P>
      <P>Tseng won three titles  this year --  the Kraft  Nabisco Championship in April,
the RICOH Women's British Open in August and the LPGA Northwest Arkansas
Championship in September. Two of them were majors.</P>
      <P>The 21-year-old was a front-runner for the Player of the Year award coming into
this week, but had to look over her shoulder at Cristie Kerr of the United
States and Na Yeon Choi of South Korea who were both close contenders.</P>
      <P>Teeing off early on Sunday, Tseng managed a 1-under-par 71, but was relegated to
spectator status as Kerr and Choi came down the stretch with opportunities to
win the LPGA Tour Championship and stand in line for the Player of the Year
award.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng, who finished 21st on 293, took the award as neither Kerr nor
Choi could edge past her despite their top-six finishes.</P>
      <P>"It's my honor to be the Player of the Year and when it was announced that 'Yani
Tseng is Player of the Year, ' the emotion just -- it's kind of overwhelming," a
teary-eyed Tseng said.</P>
      <P>In an interview after receiving the award, Tseng said that 2010 was a fabulous
year for her and that she was most grateful for the firm support of her parents
in her pursuit of career excellence.</P>
      <P>"I really love them and want to thank them for supporting me... It's very tough
for them to stay here with me, but they are always supporting me. They never say
they are tired of anything. They just care about me," an emotional Tseng said.</P>
      <P>On her off-season plans, Tseng said she will take part-time English classes.</P>
      <P>"I need to improve my English. I will go to English class in the morning and
practice (golf) in the afternoon," she added.</P>
      <P>Sweden's Maria Hjorth fired a par-72 final round on Sunday to capture her first
LPGA title since 2007, winning the season-ending LPGA Tour Championship by one
stroke from South Korean Amy Yang.</P>
      <P>Tseng said earlier this year that winning a career grand slam is her next goal.
Of her five LPGA titles won during her career, three have been majors -- the
LPGA Championship in 2008, the Kraft Nabisco Championship and the RICOH Women's
British Open, leaving the U.S. Women's Open as the one major she has yet to win.
According to the LPGA website, only seven players in history have completed
career grand slams.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Ratings on Monday confirmed its "twAA-" rating for Taiwan Fire &amp;
Marine Insurance Co. Ltd. (TFMI) , based on the insurer's financial strength and
counterparty credit, and said the outlook on the rating is stable.</P>
      <P>This is a reflection  of the insurance  company's  strong capitalization and its
above-average underwriting performance, Taiwan Ratings said.</P>
      <P>The stable outlook on the company was based on the anticipation that its strong
capitalization will enable it to maintain its current profile, Taiwan Ratings
said.</P>
      <P>The ratings agency said it also expects the insurer will continue with its
prudent business growth strategy in a highly competitive environment.</P>
      <P>"We may raise the rating if TFMI can continue to expand its franchise  to
personal  lines and at same time maintain  its above-average performance along
with a more prudent investment mix, " Taiwan Ratings said.</P>
      <P>However, TFMI is also faced with some counterbalancing factors, including its
sensitivity to market risks as a result of its aggressive investment allocation
in the local market.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan Ratings, TFMI has allocated massive funds in the property
and stock market, which are generally exposed to higher risks that other
investments.</P>
      <P>In 2009, investments in the property and stock market accounted for more than 50
percent of TFMI's total investments, the ratings agency said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Ratings said there have been concerns that such an aggressive investment
allocation may compromise TFMI's performance.</P>
      <P>"We may lower the ratings if the insurer pursues a more aggressive investment
strategy, which could eventually hurt its capitalization," Taiwan Ratings said.</P>
      <P>TFMI, capitalized at NT$3.64 billion (US$119 million) , posted NT$809.41 million
in net profit in 2009, compared with NT$138.42 million recorded in 2008.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Largan Precision Co. Ltd., the world's largest cell phone camera lens maker,
said Monday its sales in November hit a record high for the sixth consecutive
month on an increase in shipments.</P>
      <P>Last month, Largan posted NT$1.29 billion (US$42.61 million) in sales, up 2
percent from October and up 37 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the 11 months to November, Largan said, it recorded NT$11.03 billion in
sales, up 52 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>"Demand  for consumer  electronic  products,  in particular smartphones,
remained strong," Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Companies like Largan are no doubt the beneficiaries of the market trend," he
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the rising shipments, Chiang said, Largan has also seen benefits
from its strategy to develop high-end products, which refer to 5 megapixel
lenses or more advanced models.</P>
      <P>"The high-end products have boosted the company's average sales price. I expect
Largan will again break its monthly sales record in December," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>At an investors conference in late October, Largan Chairman Chen Shih-ching said
5-8 megapixel lenses accounted for more than 50 percent of the company's total
sales in the third quarter, and that the ratio was expected to rise in the
fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Eight megapixel lenses alone account for almost 10 percent of the company's
sales, market observers said.</P>
      <P>They said investors have been upbeat about the company's earnings outlook on
high hopes that the second generation of Apple's iPad will be equipped with a
camera, which will further boost Largan's shipments.</P>
      <P>"Such optimism has largely factored in Largan's share price as the stock has had
a strong showing recently," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Since the end of October, Largan shares have risen more than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang said due to the significant gains, investors had better exercise
caution when trading the stock as there is limited room for upside.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a High Court ruling Monday, it was decided that former President Chen Shui-
bian's prison term should amount to 17 and a half years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the court has determined that the fines on Chen, who has been
convicted and jailed on corruption charges in two separate cases, would total
NT$154 million (US$5.05 million).</P>
      <P>On Nov. 11, the Supreme Court sentenced the former president to 11 years in
prison for taking bribes in a land deal during his time in office and also gave
Chen an eight-year sentence in another bribery case. The rulings were the first
final convictions in a string of corruption cases implicating Chen and his wife.</P>
      <P>According to the current law, the Taiwan High Court is authorized to determine
whether the combined 19-year sentence should be served concurrently or
consecutively.</P>
      <P>After careful review, a collegial panel at the high court ruled that Chen's
total prison time should be 17 and a half years, a court spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chen,  the first president from the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
began serving his prison sentence at a jail in Taoyuan County Dec. 2, making
history as Taiwan's first former head of state to be jailed.</P>
      <P>His wife Wu Shu-jen has also been given a combined 19-year sentence in the same
two bribery cases. Judicial authorities will decide later today how and where
the wheelchair-bound former first lady should serve her time.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Issues relating to medical cooperation between Taiwan and China will be on the
agenda of the next round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks scheduled for late
December in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said that the agreement will be negotiated on the
understanding that Chinese medical personnel will not be allowed to practice in
Taiwan and Chinese investment in Taiwan hospitals will not be permitted.</P>
      <P>However, in the cross-strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement that was
signed in June, China agreed to allow Taiwanese doctors to practice  on the
mainland and to permit Taiwanese investment in new hospitals in its territories.</P>
      <P>This lack of balance in the negotiations between the two sides has occurred from
time to time in recent years.</P>
      <P>Besides that, the cross-strait talks have often hit a wall on topics that
involve international regulations because China insists that any agreement
between the two sides should not be regarded as a pact between two countries, in
line with its "one-China" policy.</P>
      <P>Moreover, many of the cross-strait agreements exist only on paper and do not
actually benefit the people on the two sides.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan signed a food safety agreement with China in 2008 and a pact
for cooperation on safety checks on agricultural products in 2009. However, to
date, few people in Taiwan have confidence in the safety of food and
agricultural products from China. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 6, 2010).</P>

      <P>A total of 2,387 stocks closed up and 1,885 down, while 351 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector scored the highest gains, rising 4.3 percent. Financial firms
rose 2.2 percent, paper and pulp stocks added 1.8 percent, foodstuffs gained 1.6
percent and construction shares closed up 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector rose 1.2 percent, the cement sector gained 0.6
percent and the machinery and electronic sector closed up 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the rise of the New Taiwan dollar, I suspect foreign institutional
investors moved more funds into the bourse today," Mega Securities analyst Alex
Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Basically, we are in a liquidity-driven market," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the market could challenge the 8,800 point mark soon.</P>
      <P>Bernanke's comments on the U.S. possible easing of liquidity prompted investors
at home and abroad to leave behind the sluggishness of the U.S. economy, which
reported a rise in unemployment for November, dealers said.</P>
      <P>"What's on investors' minds now is that higher liquidity will boost share
prices. Such sentiment is simply a knee-jerk reaction to Bernanke's comments,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>"In the short term, the local market is expected to continue to ride the upside
wave until investors calm down and start to think about how bad the U.S. economy
could be and why it needs further fund injections," he said.</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, the textile firm Far Eastern New Century rose 6.18
percent to NT$49.00, Wei-Chuan Foods increased 3.22 percent to NT$35.30 and
Shihlin Paper gained 3.21 percent to reach NT$77.20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan thorniest issue in U.S.-China ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/06/10  16:48:52
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Classified U.S. government documents newly released by the whistle-blowing
website Wikileaks said Taiwan was the biggest issue holding up the establishment
of diplomatic relations between the United States and China 30 years ago.</P>
      <P>They also show that Taiwan continues to remain the toughest issue between the
two countries despite improving cross-Taiwan Strait ties since the election of
President Ma Ying-jeou in March 2008.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Among the leaked files was a classified document dated Jan. 6, 2009 from the
U.S. embassy in Beijing, titled "Looking at the Next 30 years of the U.S.-China
relationship."</P>
      <P>The document said Taiwan would remain a delicate topic in U.S.-China relations
for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>"We should continue to support Taiwan and Mainland efforts to reduce tension by
increasing Taiwan's 'international space' and reducing Mainland's military
build-up across from Taiwan, " read the document, which was classified by
then-U.S. Ambassador to China Clark T. Randt.</P>
      <P>Another document from the U.S. embassy in Beijing, titled "Hu Jintao in charge
of Tibet policy; leadership unified, buoyed and constrained by nationalist
sentiment, " said that in the years to come, U.S. defense experts would need to
closely monitor China's contingency plans.</P>
      <P>The U.S. also needed to use every diplomatic and strategic tool it had to
prevent China from making moves to intimidate Taiwan, the document advised.
(Dec. 6, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The leaked document regarding Tibet said Chinese President Hu Jintao had "great
confidence" when it came to Tibet, putting him in a virtually unassailable
position.</P>
      <P>There might be room within the Chinese leadership to express differences with Hu
on issues such as Taiwan, economic development or political reform, but not on
Tibet, according to the leaked files posted on the Wikileaks website.</P>
      <P>The document further stated that a range of contacts had acknowledged that there
were differences of opinion within the Communist Party of China and among elites
regarding Tibet, though none believed this reflected  any disagreement  among
the top leadership.</P>
      <P>Hu Jintao was "completely" in charge of China's Tibet policy, it said.</P>
      <P>The document further revealed  that Tibet policy was more sensitive for China's
leadership than even Taiwan, noting that despite its rhetoric, Beijing had
tacitly accepted the involvement of the United States in Taiwan but could never
accept the "interference" of foreign powers in Tibet. (Dec. 6, 2010).</P>

      <P>Democracy, sovereignty, security and the right of free choice on the future of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations rank among Taiwan's seven core interests in
engaging with China, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan
said Monday.</P>
      <P>The right to meaningful participation in the international community, the right
not to be discriminated against, and the right of the disadvantaged to survive
were also key interests, said Taiwan's top China policy-maker at an
international symposium on "Cross-Strait Interactions and Power Relations in
East Asia."</P>
      <P>Democracy  is Taiwan's  "basic  prerequisite  in addressing cross-strait
relations, " said Lai at the seminar, organized by the MAC and the Institute for
National Policy Research.</P>
      <P>"We are absolutely adamant that no development in cross-strait relations and no
connection between us will or can be allowed to harm the democratic way of life
of the Taiwanese people."</P>
      <P>That is why Taiwan's people should be able to freely decide their own future,
she said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on discrimination against the country, Lai said that Taiwan, as a
major trading nation and member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) , had the
right to enjoy fair competitive trade conditions.</P>
      <P>"That includes the right to participate in regional economic integration and the
right to negotiate and sign economic agreements with our main trading partners,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Lai highlighted two significant factors that have made an impact on East Asia's
situation -- China's rise and U.S. President Barack Obama's strategy of renewed
U.S. engagement in Asia.</P>
      <P>"Compared to the exchanges of artillery fire between the two Koreas, the peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait stands out as all the more precious an
achievement."</P>
      <P>But that achievement has not come easily, she contended.</P>
      <P>"We consider the people to be the main actors in cross-strait relations. Only if
we understand, respect and safeguard the core interests of Taiwan's people will
cross-strait relations be able to develop in a more stable forward direction, "
she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese scholar sees signs of shift in China-DPP relations</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese expert on Taiwan affairs said Sunday there are "signals" of what he
called positive development of relations between Beijing and Taiwan's pro-
independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The comment by Liu Guoshen, head of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen
University, came in the wake of a recent statement by DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen that her party will establish a think tank with the primary aim of engaging
in dialogue with China,</P>
      <P>The DPP,  Taiwan's main opposition  party,  has since its establishment in 1986
advocated independence for Taiwan and refused to have any official dialogue with
Beijing on China's terms.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT), which returned to power in 2008, has since adopted a more
China-friendly policy.</P>
      <P>Lin said on the sidelines of a symposium in Shenzhen that in order to play a
bigger role in the development of cross-strait relations, the DPP has to
"reposition" itself.</P>
      <P>This is imperative in light of the fact that the KMT's shift from hostility
towards China to rapprochement has contributed greatly to maintaining peace and
stability in the Taiwan Straits and bringing greater prosperity to the people on
both sides, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP needs to rationally talk with the Communist Party of China (CPC), said
Liu, whose institute is regarded as an authority on Taiwan affairs.</P>
      <P>However, it does not necessarily mean that the CPC and DPP would have to agree
on matters of mutual concern in the short term, he said. Rather it calls for
contact between the CPC and the DPP and "exploration," sooner rather than later,
he said.</P>
      <P>He added that it would be a blessing for the people of both Taiwan and China if
the DPP think tank could engage in talks with Beijing soon to discuss how CPC-
DPP exchanges should be conducted.</P>
      <P>Political pundits have said that the DPP will have to adjust its China policy
prior to Taiwan's 2012 presidential election in order to win the support of an
increasing number of swing voters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A dispute over the profits from land deals was the main reason behind an
election-eve shooting late last month, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The minister, who oversees the National Police Agency, told lawmakers that
police investigators have found that the suspect intended to kill Kuomintang
(KMT) Xinbei City Council candidate Chen Hung-yuan but ended up shooting two
other people.</P>
      <P>The assailant, Lin Cheng-wei, fired a single shot from a handgun, injuring Sean
Lien, son of the KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan, and killing a bystander, Jiang
said in a briefing to legislators on the investigation into the Nov. 26 shooting
at a campaign rally.</P>
      <P>Lin, whose nickname is Horse Face, told investigators that he had a dispute with
Chen's father, Chen Ming-hsiung, over commissions for brokering land
transactions.</P>
      <P>Lin reportedly told the police that he tried to shoot Chen Hung-yuan in a fit of
anger because the candidate's father had refused to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Because Lien is a member of the KMT Central Committee and is from a prominent
family, it was widely speculated that the incident was politically motivated.</P>
      <P>According to the police investigation report, the right-handed Lin grabbed Sean
Lien's right collar with his left hand and fired the gun with his right. Sean
Lien tried to duck when he was grabbed but the bullet entered his left cheek and
exited near his right temple.</P>
      <P>A 29-year-old man Huang Yun-sheng, who was sitting 31 meters from the campaign
stage, was hit in the right eye by the same bullet, the investigators reported.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the bullet found in Huang's head was fired from Lin's German-made
P220 .90 handgun.</P>
      <P>When Chen was immediately arrested on the scene of the shooting, he was found to
be carrying the gun and 48 rounds of ammunition in two cartridges.</P>
      <P>The findings of the investigation were confirmed by video footage from the scene
of the incident, the police said.</P>
      <P>Jiang quoted the police report as saying that based on Lin's cell phone records
and witness accounts, it was determined that the assailant had no accomplices on
the scene of the crime.</P>
      <P>The police are now examining Lin's bank records and those of the Chen family and
checking the inter-personal relationships among the people concerned to try to
determine whether the shooting was instigated by someone other than the suspect.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Monday, dropping NT$0.12 to
close at NT$30.625.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$643 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at the day's high of NT$30.745 and moved to a low of
NT$30.110 before rebounding.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the Taiwan dollar was boosted by gains in the local stock market,
which were driven by high hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would engage in an
additional round of quantitative easing to boost the economy.</P>
      <P>Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes that
further quantitative easing was "certainly possible."</P>
      <P>Quantitative easing refers to the practice by governments of creating money out
of thin air by buying back debt that they have issued.</P>
      <P>The Fed has opted for the unorthodox tactic because it has already lowered
interest rates -- its normal policy tool -- to near-zero levels.</P>
      <P>Dealers said that once the U.S. central bank pumped more funds into the economy,
foreign institutional investors were expected to move money into Asian markets,
including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index rose 0.90 percent in heavy trade to close above the
8,700 point level Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank intervened again in late trading to help the U.S. dollar
regain most of its early losses and send its value above NT$30.50, dealers said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Medical school students know little about risks of smoking: DOH poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical school students in Taiwan lack proper knowledge about the risks
associated with smoking and how to help people quit the habit, according to the
results of a survey released by the Department of Health (DOH) Monday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in 2009 among university juniors in the departments of
medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and nursing, found that although 83.5 percent of
them learn in school about the health risks of smoking, only 35.2 percent are
aware of the effects of second-hand smoke.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, 28 percent are under the false impression that lighter brands of
cigarettes are less dangerous to human health, according to the poll conducted
by the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that medical school students are being poorly  trained  to
help patients  quit smoking,  said  BHP's director-general Chiou Shu-ti.</P>
      <P>Only 11.6 percent of the respondents had attended formal courses on how to help
people quit, she said.</P>
      <P>"This is a wake-up call for us, " said Lai Chi-wan, chairman of the Ministry of
Education (MOE)'s Medical Education Committee.</P>
      <P>Lai said that he was previously not aware of the issue but will present the
problem to other members of the committee and devise a comprehensive smoking
education plan for medical school students.</P>
      <P>Doctors should serve as role models for their patients and have a social
responsibility to take care of their patients' health as well as their own, he
said.</P>
      <P>His point of view was shared by Huang Song-lih, secretary-general of Taiwan
International Medical Alliance, who said that doctors play an important role in
preventive medicine.</P>
      <P>"If they can approach patients who smoke and offer immediate help, there would
be fewer smoking-related illnesses, he said.</P>
      <P>As of June 25 this year, 73 of the 163 university campuses in Taiwan were smoke-
free, thanks to the joint efforts of the MOE and DOH, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>The rate of smoking among students is expected to drop as a result of this
policy, he said.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways, one of Taiwan's leading international carriers, said Monday it will
launch flights to more destinations in China later this month to capitalize on
the booming cross-Taiwan Strait tourism business.</P>
      <P>Along with its subsidiary Uni Airways, EVA Air said it would fly between Taipei
and Zhengzhou in Henan Province twice a week from Dec. 10 and between Taipei and
Jinan in Shandong Province once a week from Dec. 18, the carrier said.</P>
      <P>Starting from Dec. 20, EVA Air will also operate one flight a week between
Taichung and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province to add to its two flights per week
between Taipei and Ningbo and one flight a week between Kaohsiung and Ningbo.</P>
      <P>The carrier said it would become the first Taiwanese airline to fly between
Taipei and Jinan once the new services are launched.</P>
      <P>In an initial phase, the Taipei-Jinan route will be operated on a charter flight
basis, offering all of the seats to travel agencies located in China, because of
the strong interest people in the province have shown toward visiting Taiwan,
the carrier said.</P>
      <P>EVA Air added that it could increase the number of charters in the future and
eventually operate the route on a regularly scheduled basis.</P>
      <P>The airline expected the load factors on the Taipei-Jinan and Taipei-Zhengzhou
route to both be at least 80 percent.</P>
      <P>Zhengzhou, which ranks among China's top eight ancient cities, has long been a
tourism attraction, but EVA Air also anticipates interest from business
travelers.</P>
      <P>Many major Taiwanese companies, such as Formosa Plastics, Want Want Holdings,
Uni-President Enterprises and Hon Hai Group, have set up footholds in Henan,
leading the carrier to forecast that business passengers will account for about
20 percent of the customers on the route.</P>
      <P>The new flights will expand EVA Air's cross-Taiwan Strait service to 77 round-
trip flights between Taiwan and 17 destinations in China per week.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Central Committee member Sean Lien, who was shot in the face
during an election-eve campaign rally on Nov. 26, thanked doctors and others
Monday for saving him after he came within 0.5 centimeters of being killed.</P>
      <P>In a statement  released by Lien the morning after being discharged from the
hospital late Sunday night, he expressed his gratitude to all those who helped
him miraculously get through "a life-threatening crisis, " in which the distance
between life and death was less than 0.5 cm.</P>
      <P>"It was in such a narrow space that I felt the greatest warmth and caring in my
life, " the son of former Vice President Lien Chan said in the statement.</P>
      <P>Lien was shot while stumping for a KMT Xinbei City Council candidate at a
campaign rally on the eve of the Nov. 27 municipality elections. Another victim
died from the same bullet that traveled through Lien's face.</P>
      <P>The bullet entered Lien's left cheek and exited from below his right temple,
fracturing his cheekbone,  said National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) ,
where he was treated until being discharged Sunday night.</P>
      <P>The high-profile shooting has drawn considerable media attention because it is
believed to have had an impact on some of the five mayoral races being
contested, of which the KMT won three.</P>
      <P>Though the shooting suspect was immediately apprehended, the police have yet to
determine his true motive for shooting Lien or whether Lien was even his
intended target.</P>
      <P>Besides  offering  his thanks to NTUH's medical  team and well-wishers, Lien
specifically thanked Liu Chen-nan, a former leader of a gang who was on hand to
stop the gunman from firing a second shot at Lien, saving his life.</P>
      <P>"Now that the heavens have ordained that I live on, I think it means I should be
a good man who helps others. I promise I will work hard toward that goal," he

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 60 percent of the people covered by national health insurance (NHI) will
have lower premiums when a second-generation NHI system is implemented, Health
Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The new system will be to the advantage of more instead of fewer people" since
most people in Taiwan have dependent family members and are salaried employees,
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH data on NNI premium rates in the past two years, some 60
percent of the insured would have lower payments once the new insurance system
is introduced, he added.</P>
      <P>The NHI system proposes that insurance premiums be calculated based on total
household income instead of individual salaries of the insured, as is the case
at present.</P>
      <P>However, opposition party lawmakers have raised concerns that the majority of
people would have to pay higher premiums under the new system.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has set Dec. 7 as its deadline for passing the DOH-proposed
amendments to the existing NHI Act, which would allow for the new premium system
to take effect.</P>
      <P>But there are 20 clauses in the bill that have not yet been put to a vote. In
addition, lawmakers from across party lines have expressed reservations about
the fairness of the proposed formula for calculating premiums.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held Monday by KMT lawmakers, Yaung said the amendments
are aimed at expanding care for the disadvantaged, and include a premium
exemption  for severely disabled people and unemployed aboriginal people over 55
and under 19 years of age.</P>
      <P>In addition, the number of people who would be exempt from premium payments
would increase further if the proposed amendments to the Public Assistance Act
are also passed, Yaung noted.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments, low-income households are not required to pay health
insurance premiums and the bar for being defined as a low income family has been
lowered, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ex-NSC head calls for 'Taiwan consensus,' cross-party dialogue</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Su Chi, a former secretary-general of the National Security Council (NSC),
called for a "Taiwan consensus" and much-needed  dialogue between domestic and
cross-Taiwan  Strait political rivals Monday.</P>
      <P>Su, who resigned from the NSC in February but remains a close confidant of
President Ma Ying-jeou, encouraged the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) to engage in dialogue with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to form a Taiwan
consensus that could enable Taiwan to negotiate with China boldly and
confidently.</P>
      <P>Speaking on Taiwan's external and internal relations at an international
symposium, Su said the Taiwan-China-United States triangular relationship, which
he called the "Big Triangle," had been stable over the past two and a half years
under Ma.</P>
      <P>But the "Small Triangle" -- describing relations among the KMT, the DPP and
China's Communist Party -- had not been as stable mainly because "the DPP has
not been talking to the KMT and the CPC" at all, he said.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem, he said, was that the DPP's elite had yet to forge a
consensus on the pro-independence party's China policy, with some insisting on
anti-China positions and others taking more moderate stances.</P>
      <P>He contended that incumbent DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and former President
Chen Shui-bian had not made a big enough effort to forge a consensus on the
issue, and he said the lack of a DPP consensus was "actually dragging Taiwan
down."</P>
      <P>Su, who coined the formula for dealing with China as the "1992 Consensus" --
also known as "one China, different interpretations" -- advised the DPP to form
a party consensus  before eventually communicating with China's Communist Party.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that internal dialogue between the KMT and DPP could be
difficult because of Taiwan's domestic political past and the level of
politicization, but he still expressed a certain level of optimism.</P>
      <P>Some DPP elites have begun to realize that the world was changing and that
people's needs were changing as well, he said.</P>
      <P>"They also have realized that Taiwan independence  may be desirable, but not
plausible, " said Su, now a professor at Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the DPP might not agree on everything, "but at least we can agree on
something, " Su said, adding that the lack of communication  will  be  dangerous
because  it  could  cause misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Su said that while the two parties have not talked to each other or respected
each other in the past, Taiwan's democracy has matured, making dialogue
possible.</P>
      <P>He welcomed Tsai's plans to establish a think tank to help formulate the DPP's
China policy and policies on external relations.</P>
      <P>Looking at future cross-strait development, the former national intelligence
chief said he had four major concerns -- the "one-China" principle, Taiwan's
international space, confidence-building measures and a peace agreement.</P>
      <P>The "one-China" principle, he said, would be the key because the other three
issues were all related to it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  engagement  with China before the critical  2012 presidential election
is expected to remain focused on economic issues, with political issues unlikely
to move onto the agenda, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index in November saw its biggest year-on-year leap in
nine months, driven largely by higher food prices, the government said Monday.</P>
      <P>Inflation rose 1.53 percent in November compared with the same month a year
earlier, the largest gain since a rise of 2.34 percent posted in February, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said.</P>
      <P>November's CPI also rose 0.21 percent from October largely on higher clothing
costs and transportation spending, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>In November, food prices rose 3.65 percent from a year earlier, with vegetable
prices up 26.21 percent year-on-year, fish prices up 7.54 percent, and the
prices of milk and related products up 5.45 percent, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The prices of eggs and fruit, however, fell during the same period by 2.06
percent and 1.42 percent respectively, it added.</P>
      <P>Last month, the core price index, which excludes vegetables, fruit, fish and
energy prices, rose 0.91 percent from a year earlier, while  the wholesale
price index (WPI)  gained  2.43 percent year-on-year on higher chemical, base
metal and iron ore prices, the agency said.</P>
      <P>Month-on-month, the November core price index rose 0.21 percent from October,
while the WPI fell 0.04 percent from a month earlier due to a rising Taiwan
dollar, it said.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, the CPI rose 0.94 percent from a year
earlier, the core price index added 0.40 percent and the WPI gained 5.76
percent, the DGBAS said.</P>

      <P>Su Jia-chyuan, who was narrowly defeated in the Taichung mayoral race on Nov.
27, agreed to serve again as the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
secretary general as part of the party's post-election shake-up of key posts on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Su, whose showing against incumbent Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu of the
Kuomintang exceeded expectations, will assume his "old post" on Dec. 13, DPP
spokesman Lin You-chang said. Su was the party's secretary-general before he
entered the mayoral race.</P>
      <P>Su replaces Wu Nai-jen, who tendered his resignation after the DPP lost three of
the five mayoral races being contested in late November. Wu will become the
chief executive of the DPP's think tank under the New Frontier Foundation.</P>
      <P>The think tank will focus its efforts on preparing a set of policy proposals
that will likely become the party's platform in the 2012  presidential
election.  Tsai has said that to win the presidential election, the party will
need a China policy that stabilizes Taiwan's relations with China.</P>
      <P>Six senior DPP officials are expected to step down from their posts to run in
the next Legislative Yuan election, setting the stage for Tsai to recruit new
blood into the party's key positions.</P>
      <P>Those said to be eyeing legislative seats include Lee Kun-tse, Tsai's special
assistant; party spokesmen Tsai Chi-chang and Lin You-chang;  Department of
International  Affairs Director Hsiao Bi-khim; and Department of Hakka Affairs
Director Yang Chang-chen.</P>
      <P>Tsai will also have to find a new director of the Department of Organizational
Development after Liu Chao-hao's departure and a new director of the Department
of Indigenous People's Affairs after incumbent Icyang Parod won a seat on the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
called for leniency Monday in carrying out the sentence of wheelchair-bound
former first lady Wu Shu-jen.</P>
      <P>"The prison authorities should refuse to jail Wu in accordance with Article 11
of the Prison Execution Act, " said Guan Bi-ling, head of the DPP caucus, at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>Guan asked that Wu, who has been paralyzed from the waist down for over 20
years, serve her sentence by remaining confined at her home rather than be sent
to a local jail.</P>
      <P>Guan's call came hours before the Justice Ministry convened a special meeting to
address the thorny issue of how Wu should be jailed.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics, Guan said that over the past five years, around 760 seriously
ill convicts were not kept behind bars under the act.</P>
      <P>Wu and her husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, were each sentenced to a
total of 19 years in jail last month by the Supreme Court for taking bribes
while Chen was president.</P>
      <P>They were found guilty of having taken bribes in two separate cases, one
involving a land acquisition deal, the other involving the appointment of the
Taipei 101 chairperson.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had been held at a detention center since late 2008, was moved to
Taipei Prison in Taoyuan County on Dec. 2 to serve his time. Prison authorities
are now considering how Wu should be jailed, given her condition.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment, Premier Wu Den-yih said the government should take into
account the principles of fairness and justice as well as Wu's health in
handling the case.</P>
      <P>Lin Pang-liang,  the chief secretary  of the Taiwan  High Prosecutors Office,
the agency responsible for jailing the former first couple, said Wu would be
kept at the Pei Teh Hospital affiliated with Taichung Prison if prosecutors
decided to have her serve her jail term.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu, the daughter of the former first couple, urged the authorities to
decide her mother's fate based on doctors' assessment of her health.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu, now a dentist, was quoted by a local newspaper days ago as
threatening  to sue the government "if something undesirable happened to her
mother in person."</P>
      <P>"We are not asking for any special privileges, but the same treatment as other
convicts,  " Chen Hsing-yu said Monday in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>"Even just helping her (Wu) go to the bathroom would be troublesome, " Chen
Hsing-yu said, questioning the ability of Pei Teh Hospital to take care of her
mother.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should step up its efforts to sign trade agreements with other countries
to cope with the threat from South Korea, which could soon complete a free trade
deal with the United States, Taiwanese officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese products in the U.S. market are likely to be replaced with South
Korean ones when the free trade agreement (FTA) between South Korea and the U.S.
takes effect, " the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Office of Trade Negotiations
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea share similar industrial development patterns and often
compete head-to-head in the United States market and elsewhere around the globe.</P>
      <P>If the parliaments of the U.S. and South Korea ratify the deal recently
concluded by negotiators from the two countries, South Korea could be in a
better position to compete against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. was Taiwan's third largest export market and South Korea's second
largest in 2009, according to the office.</P>
      <P>The U.S. imported US$39.22 billion in goods from South Korea and U$$28.36
billion in goods from Taiwan that year.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-South Korea trade agreement, which had been stalled over the past three
years, will likely be implemented in mid-2011 and trigger phased-in tariff
reductions.</P>
      <P>Taking TV products as an example, the U.S. will eliminate tariffs of between 3.9
percent and 5 percent on South Korea-made products, threatening similar items
made in Taiwan, the office noted.</P>
      <P>"However, whether Taiwanese products will be completely replaced by South Korean
items will still depend on how Taiwan's industries enhance their competitiveness
and how they differentiate their markets from those of South Korea," the office
said.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Liang told the Central News Agency on
Saturday, however, that the U.S.-South Korea FTA would only have a limited
impact on Taiwan because of the nature of the country's trade with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Liang said Taiwan's information and communications technology products, which
comprise the majority of the country's exports to the U.S., already enjoy duty-
free treatment from the U.S. under the World Trade Organization's Information
Technology Agreement.</P>
      <P>For other items where Taiwan could stand at a disadvantage, it hopes to
negotiate such issues with the U.S. under the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said on Dec. 4 that talks under the
deal would resume soon.</P>
      <P>The TIFA deal, signed in September 1994, provides an official channel for
Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade and economic issues, but talks have been suspended
since 2007 due mainly to a conflict over a Taiwanese ban on imports of some U.S.
beef products.</P>
      <P>Though Liang believed that Taiwan's trade with the U.S. would not suffer too
much from the U.S.-South Korea deal, he did say that the FTA could have a
negative impact on U.S. investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is the largest source of Taiwan's foreign investment and after inking
the free trade deal, South Korea will be better positioned  to attract
investment  from many U.S.  companies, particularly in the fields of finance and
other services, Liang predicted.</P>
      <P>To cope with this possible impact, Taiwan needed to ease limits on foreign
investment in its service sector, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Screening of 1st nuclear plant's extension put off by a year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A review of a plan to extend the operating life of Taiwan's first nuclear power
plant will be put off for another year because Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has
asked to increase the plant's power generation, a request that could take up to
18 months to evaluate.</P>
      <P>According to information  presented at a Legislative  Yuan Education and Culture
Committee meeting Monday, the nuclear power plant, located in Shihmen Township,
Taipei County, has been in operation for 30 years and is scheduled to be shut
down in 2018.</P>
      <P>In answer to a lawmaker's question, Atomic Energy Council Chairman Tsai Chuen-
horng said his agency started a review of the plant's application to extend its
operations in September 2009 and had hoped to come to a conclusion in two years.</P>
      <P>"We may not be able to make a decision (regarding the extension request) when
the two-year deadline comes, " Tsai said after Taipower's request to increase
the plant's generating capacity.</P>
      <P>A decision on the extension application will now not likely be made until 2012,
officials said.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-pin, an AEC official in charge of nuclear energy policy, explained that
Taipower, which operates the power plant, has filed a new request to raise the
plant's power-generating capacity -- called a stretch power uprate -- by 3
percent.</P>
      <P>The need to prolong the plant's operation and to raise its power generation
apparently reflected concerns that the fourth nuclear power plant cannot be
ready for commercial operation in time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang Legislator Kuo Su-chun said that if the first nuclear
power plant eventually extends its operations beyond 2018, then a new lease
would have to be negotiated because the original 40-year lease between Taipower
and local landowners would expire at around that time.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his agency was not responsible for reaching a deal with local
landowners, but he agreed it would be reasonable for Taipower to negotiate a new
deal, including funds the power plant would contribute to local development.</P>

      <P>Classified U.S. documents released by the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks will
not include information about intelligence cooperation between Taiwan and the

      <P>"U.S.  intelligence  authorities  have assured  us that no intelligence  related
to our bilateral intelligence cooperation projects have ever been leaked, "
Chang Wei-ming, an NSB division chief, said at a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign and Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from ruling Kuomintang  Legislator Chang Hsien-yao  about the
possible fallout on Taiwan's intelligence network, Chang Wei-ming said the
leaked files were mainly from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , which
represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Wikileaks announced on its website recently that over the next few months, it
will release 251,287 cables originating from 274 U.S. embassies and consulates
between Dec. 28, 1966 to Feb. 28, 2010.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 3,456 were sent between the U.S. Department of State and the AIT,
and 136 of them were classified as "secret."</P>
      <P>The NSB official said AIT-related documents had yet to be released, but to his
knowledge, the list included memos regarding AIT staff's code of conduct and
Taiwan-U.S. cooperation in preventing weapons proliferation.</P>
      <P>He said the NSB has joined an interministerial task force to monitor future
leaks by the website and analyze and verify any details related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Wikileaks released a U.S. State Department document dated
February 2009 that listed some critical infrastructure facilities  or
telecommunication  hubs whose destruction  might seriously disrupt global
communications.</P>
      <P>The document,  titled  2008 Critical  Foreign  Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) ,
listed landing sites for major Taiwan-related undersea cable networks, including
Fangshan in southern Taiwan and Danshui in the north for C2C (city-to-city)
cable network undersea cable landings.</P>
      <P>It also cited Bali for Taiwan EAC undersea cable landings, Fangshan for Taiwan-

      <P>In their latest version of proposed amendments to the National Health Insurance
Act, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators have eliminated patient copayments on
drugs covered by the country's compulsory health insurance system, according to
the new plan released Monday.</P>
      <P>The proposal comes as legislators consider amendments to the National Health
Insurance Act to introduce a second-generation health insurance system that
would primarily change the way health insurance premiums are calculated.</P>
      <P>On the issue of drug copayments, the version of the amendments proposed by the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) would still require the insured to bear
a proportion of the cost of some NHI-covered drugs whose prices exceed the
amount the NHI system is willing to cover.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Li-huan explained that the proposal to remove the caps on
NHI payments for some expensive medications was made mostly to help patients
suffering from rare or acute diseases.</P>
      <P>Under the existing system, those patients have to make high copayments on new
drugs that are usually priced expensively when first launched in the market.</P>
      <P>Expressing support for the proposal that allows all the insured, regardless of
their income, to have the same access to NHI-covered drugs, KMT lawmaker Hou
Tsai-feng said the current system prevents poorer patients from using better
drugs that are only partially covered by the health insurance system.</P>
      <P>National Health Insurance Civic Surveillance Alliance spokeswoman Eva Teng
touted the KMT proposal because it would help ease the financial burdens of
cancer patients who need expensive target therapies.</P>
      <P>Though the drug benefit would give the insured greater access to medications,
the added cost could make it more difficult for the second-generation system to
achieve its goals: increase premium revenue and narrow the financially ailing
system's growing deficits.</P>
      <P>Legislators did not offer any estimates of how much the new drug benefit would
cost.</P>
      <P>The legislature set Tuesday as the deadline for passage of the new amendments,
but lawmakers across party lines continued to wrangle over the various versions
of the revisions making their way around the legislative body, making it unclear
if the deadline will be met.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tablet to fuel Taiwanese battery makers growth: researcher</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese battery makers are well positioned to benefit from the growing tablet
computer market due to an increasing demand for the lithium cells that power
them, a local researcher said Monday.</P>
      <P>The emerging market of tablet devices, with projected sales of 54.8 million
units in 2011, will strengthen demand for the lithium cells that are mostly made
by Taiwanese companies, said Tung Chung-ming, a researcher with Taiwan's semi-
official Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), at a seminar in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwanese cell makers alone, Simplo Technology Co. and Dynapack
International Technology Corp., supply 60 percent of the lithium polymer
batteries Apple Inc. uses to power its popular iPad.</P>
      <P>"As the major suppliers to Apple, Taiwanese cell makers have been acknowledged
as quality firms, helping them compete for more battery orders from other tablet
brands," Tung said.</P>
      <P>But the smaller and lighter battery type used in tablet PCs have a lower average
price than those used in regular notebooks, and they will likely hurt Taiwanese
battery makers' gross margins, he said.</P>
      <P>"It depends on if the tablets will replace the use of notebooks or create a new
market for cell manufacturers," he said.</P>
      <P>International PC vendors such as Acer,  AsusTek,  Samsung, ViewSonic, Dell and
HP have unveiled or are ready to launch their own tablet devices to grab a slice
of the potential boom started by Apple's iPad.</P>
      <P>The ITRI expects that Apple will continue to dominate the global tablet market
in 2011 with a 70 percent share, followed by smartphone brands with 20 percent
and regular notebook makers with 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, global shipments of the tablet device will reach 12.28 million units
before the end of this year, then grow by 183 percent to 34.81 million units in
2011 and by 45.7 percent to 50 million units in 2012, according to a study by
the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC).</P>
      <P>The rapid growing popularity of tablet computers since the launch of iPad will
make them the third biggest mobile device segment in the final quarter of 2010
and for all of 2011, said market tracker Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>However, the world's No. 2 PC maker Acer Inc. said on Saturday the global market

the back of rising demand in emerging markets.</P>
      <P>On market speculation that the emergence of tablet computers will replace
personal computers, Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said growing demand in emerging
markets will help drive demand for notebooks.</P>
      <P>As a result, he forecast that the compound annual growth rate for global

      <P>A proposed cross-Taiwan Strait investment agreement will not be signed as

      <P>The personal belongings of Taiwanese baseball celebrities will go on sale at a
charity bazaar this week to raise money for premature children, the Premature
Baby Foundation (PBF), the organizer of the event, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Though national health insurance (NHI) subsidizes 80 to 90 percent of the
medical care expenses for premature babies, some families still find it hard to
afford extra treatments and counseling services that are not reimbursed by the
insurance system, said PBF President Lee Hung-chang.</P>
      <P>"I hope to raise public awareness about the needs of families with premature
children through the sale," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Yuki Huang, the mother of two premature babies born at 28 and 26 weeks,
respectively, said she was thankful for the financial and mental support offered
by the foundation.</P>
      <P>"Preemie  parents  have constant  doubts about the babies' well-being after
being discharged from the hospital, " said Huang, whose worries gradually eased
after enrolling in the foundation's free follow-up program that tracked the

      <P>Profits from the charity sale will go to the foundation, which is dedicated to
improving medical care for the premature.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should step up its efforts to sign trade agreements with other countries
to cope with the threat from South Korea, which could soon complete a free trade
deal with the United States, Taiwanese officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese products in the U.S. market are likely to be replaced with South
Korean ones when the free trade agreement (FTA) between South Korea and the U.S.
takes effect, " the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Office of Trade Negotiations
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea share similar industrial development patterns and often
compete head-to-head in the United States market and elsewhere around the globe.</P>
      <P>If the parliaments of the U.S. and South Korea ratify the deal recently
concluded by negotiators from the two countries, South Korea could be in a
better position to compete against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. was Taiwan's third largest export market and South Korea's second
largest in 2009, according to the office.</P>
      <P>The U.S. imported US$39.22 billion in goods from South Korea and U$$28.36
billion in goods from Taiwan that year.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-South Korea trade agreement, which had been stalled over the past three
years, will likely be implemented in mid-2011 and trigger phased-in tariff
reductions.</P>
      <P>Taking TV products as an example, the U.S. will eliminate tariffs of between 3.9
percent and 5 percent on South Korea-made products, threatening similar items
made in Taiwan, the office noted.</P>
      <P>"However, whether Taiwanese products will be completely replaced by South Korean
items will still depend on how Taiwan's industries enhance their competitiveness
and how they differentiate their markets from those of South Korea," the office
said.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Liang told the Central News Agency on
Saturday, however, that the U.S.-South Korea FTA would only have a limited
impact on Taiwan because of the nature of the country's trade with the U.S.</P>
      <P>Liang said Taiwan's information and communications technology products, which
comprise the majority of the country's exports to the U.S., already enjoy duty-
free treatment from the U.S. under the World Trade Organization's Information
Technology Agreement.</P>
      <P>For other items where Taiwan could stand at a disadvantage, it hopes to
negotiate such issues with the U.S. under the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA).</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said on Dec. 4 that talks under the
deal would resume soon.</P>
      <P>The TIFA deal, signed in September 1994, provides an official channel for
Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade and economic issues, but talks have been suspended
since 2007 due mainly to a conflict over a Taiwanese ban on imports of some U.S.
beef products.</P>
      <P>Though Liang believed that Taiwan's trade with the U.S. would not suffer too
much from the U.S.-South Korea deal, he did say that the FTA could have a
negative impact on U.S. investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The U.S. is the largest source of Taiwan's foreign investment and after inking
the free trade deal, South Korea will be better positioned  to attract
investment  from many U.S.  companies, particularly in the fields of finance and
other services, Liang predicted.</P>
      <P>To cope with this possible impact, Taiwan needed to ease limits on foreign
investment in its service sector, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Screening of 1st nuclear plant's extension put off by a year</HEADLINE>

      <P>A review of a plan to extend the operating life of Taiwan's first nuclear power
plant will be put off for another year because Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has
asked to increase the plant's power generation, a request that could take up to
18 months to evaluate.</P>
      <P>According to information  presented at a Legislative  Yuan Education and Culture
Committee meeting Monday, the nuclear power plant, located in Shihmen Township,
Taipei County, has been in operation for 30 years and is scheduled to be shut
down in 2018.</P>
      <P>In answer to a lawmaker's question, Atomic Energy Council Chairman Tsai Chuen-
horng said his agency started a review of the plant's application to extend its
operations in September 2009 and had hoped to come to a conclusion in two years.</P>
      <P>"We may not be able to make a decision (regarding the extension request) when
the two-year deadline comes, " Tsai said after Taipower's request to increase
the plant's generating capacity.</P>
      <P>A decision on the extension application will now not likely be made until 2012,
officials said.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-pin, an AEC official in charge of nuclear energy policy, explained that
Taipower, which operates the power plant, has filed a new request to raise the
plant's power-generating capacity -- called a stretch power uprate -- by 3
percent.</P>
      <P>The need to prolong the plant's operation and to raise its power generation
apparently reflected concerns that the fourth nuclear power plant cannot be
ready for commercial operation in time.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kuomintang Legislator Kuo Su-chun said that if the first nuclear
power plant eventually extends its operations beyond 2018, then a new lease
would have to be negotiated because the original 40-year lease between Taipower
and local landowners would expire at around that time.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his agency was not responsible for reaching a deal with local
landowners, but he agreed it would be reasonable for Taipower to negotiate a new
deal, including funds the power plant would contribute to local development.</P>

      <P>Classified U.S. documents released by the whistle-blowing website Wikileaks will
not include information about intelligence cooperation between Taiwan and the
United States, a National Security Bureau (NSB) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"U.S.  intelligence  authorities  have assured  us that no intelligence  related
to our bilateral intelligence cooperation projects have ever been leaked, "
Chang Wei-ming, an NSB division chief, said at a meeting of the Legislative
Yuan's Foreign and Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from ruling Kuomintang  Legislator Chang Hsien-yao  about the
possible fallout on Taiwan's intelligence network, Chang Wei-ming said the
leaked files were mainly from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , which
represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Wikileaks announced on its website recently that over the next few months, it
will release 251,287 cables originating from 274 U.S. embassies and consulates
between Dec. 28, 1966 to Feb. 28, 2010.</P>
      <P>Of the total, 3,456 were sent between the U.S. Department of State and the AIT,
and 136 of them were classified as "secret."</P>
      <P>The NSB official said AIT-related documents had yet to be released, but to his
knowledge, the list included memos regarding AIT staff's code of conduct and
Taiwan-U.S. cooperation in preventing weapons proliferation.</P>
      <P>He said the NSB has joined an interministerial task force to monitor future
leaks by the website and analyze and verify any details related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Wikileaks released a U.S. State Department document dated
February 2009 that listed some critical infrastructure facilities  or
telecommunication  hubs whose destruction  might seriously disrupt global
communications.</P>
      <P>The document,  titled  2008 Critical  Foreign  Dependencies Initiative (CFDI) ,
listed landing sites for major Taiwan-related undersea cable networks, including
Fangshan in southern Taiwan and Danshui in the north for C2C (city-to-city)
cable network undersea cable landings.</P>
      <P>It also cited Bali for Taiwan EAC undersea cable landings, Fangshan for Taiwan-
China-U.S. undersea cable landings, and Toucheng for Taiwan FLAG/REACH North
Asia Loop undersea cable landings.</P>
      <P>The A to Z list documented undersea cable landing sites from Austria to New
Zeland as well as major communication hubs, ports, minerals and strategic
industrial  companies  critical to the functioning of the global supply chain.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang said he was worried the list was just the beginning

      <P>In their latest version of proposed amendments to the National Health Insurance
Act, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators have eliminated patient copayments on
drugs covered by the country's compulsory health insurance system, according to
the new plan released Monday.</P>
      <P>The proposal comes as legislators consider amendments to the National Health
Insurance Act to introduce a second-generation health insurance system that
would primarily change the way health insurance premiums are calculated.</P>
      <P>On the issue of drug copayments, the version of the amendments proposed by the
Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) would still require the insured to bear
a proportion of the cost of some NHI-covered drugs whose prices exceed the
amount the NHI system is willing to cover.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Li-huan explained that the proposal to remove the caps on
NHI payments for some expensive medications was made mostly to help patients
suffering from rare or acute diseases.</P>
      <P>Under the existing system, those patients have to make high copayments on new
drugs that are usually priced expensively when first launched in the market.</P>
      <P>Expressing support for the proposal that allows all the insured, regardless of
their income, to have the same access to NHI-covered drugs, KMT lawmaker Hou
Tsai-feng said the current system prevents poorer patients from using better
drugs that are only partially covered by the health insurance system.</P>
      <P>National Health Insurance Civic Surveillance Alliance spokeswoman Eva Teng
touted the KMT proposal because it would help ease the financial burdens of
cancer patients who need expensive target therapies.</P>
      <P>Though the drug benefit would give the insured greater access to medications,
the added cost could make it more difficult for the second-generation system to
achieve its goals: increase premium revenue and narrow the financially ailing
system's growing deficits.</P>
      <P>Legislators did not offer any estimates of how much the new drug benefit would
cost.</P>
      <P>The legislature set Tuesday as the deadline for passage of the new amendments,
but lawmakers across party lines continued to wrangle over the various versions
of the revisions making their way around the legislative body, making it unclear
if the deadline will be met.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese battery makers are well positioned to benefit from the growing tablet
computer market due to an increasing demand for the lithium cells that power
them, a local researcher said Monday.</P>
      <P>The emerging market of tablet devices, with projected sales of 54.8 million
units in 2011, will strengthen demand for the lithium cells that are mostly made
by Taiwanese companies, said Tung Chung-ming, a researcher with Taiwan's semi-
official Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), at a seminar in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwanese cell makers alone, Simplo Technology Co. and Dynapack
International Technology Corp., supply 60 percent of the lithium polymer
batteries Apple Inc. uses to power its popular iPad.</P>
      <P>"As the major suppliers to Apple, Taiwanese cell makers have been acknowledged
as quality firms, helping them compete for more battery orders from other tablet
brands," Tung said.</P>
      <P>But the smaller and lighter battery type used in tablet PCs have a lower average
price than those used in regular notebooks, and they will likely hurt Taiwanese
battery makers' gross margins, he said.</P>
      <P>"It depends on if the tablets will replace the use of notebooks or create a new
market for cell manufacturers," he said.</P>
      <P>International PC vendors such as Acer,  AsusTek,  Samsung, ViewSonic, Dell and
HP have unveiled or are ready to launch their own tablet devices to grab a slice
of the potential boom started by Apple's iPad.</P>
      <P>The ITRI expects that Apple will continue to dominate the global tablet market
in 2011 with a 70 percent share, followed by smartphone brands with 20 percent
and regular notebook makers with 10 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, global shipments of the tablet device will reach 12.28 million units
before the end of this year, then grow by 183 percent to 34.81 million units in
2011 and by 45.7 percent to 50 million units in 2012, according to a study by
the Market Intelligence and Consulting Institute (MIC).</P>
      <P>The rapid growing popularity of tablet computers since the launch of iPad will
make them the third biggest mobile device segment in the final quarter of 2010
and for all of 2011, said market tracker Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>However, the world's No. 2 PC maker Acer Inc. said on Saturday the global market
for notebook computers will grow between 20 percent and 25 percent next year on
the back of rising demand in emerging markets.</P>
      <P>On market speculation that the emergence of tablet computers will replace
personal computers, Acer Chairman J.T. Wang said growing demand in emerging
markets will help drive demand for notebooks.</P>
      <P>As a result, he forecast that the compound annual growth rate for global
notebook shipments would remain at more than 20 percent for the next few years.</P>

      <P>The personal belongings of Taiwanese baseball celebrities will go on sale at a
charity bazaar this week to raise money for premature children, the Premature
Baby Foundation (PBF), the organizer of the event, said Monday.</P>
      <P>Though national health insurance (NHI) subsidizes 80 to 90 percent of the
medical care expenses for premature babies, some families still find it hard to
afford extra treatments and counseling services that are not reimbursed by the
insurance system, said PBF President Lee Hung-chang.</P>
      <P>"I hope to raise public awareness about the needs of families with premature
children through the sale," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Yuki Huang, the mother of two premature babies born at 28 and 26 weeks,
respectively, said she was thankful for the financial and mental support offered
by the foundation.</P>
      <P>"Preemie  parents  have constant  doubts about the babies' well-being after
being discharged from the hospital, " said Huang, whose worries gradually eased
after enrolling in the foundation's free follow-up program that tracked the
infants' developmental progress.</P>
      <P>Profits from the charity sale will go to the foundation, which is dedicated to
improving medical care for the premature.</P>
      <P>According to PBF statistics, there are about 200,000 newborn infants in Taiwan
each year, of which 8.5 to 8.9 percent are born prematurely.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Set up a joint arbitration center</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/07/10  11:54:21
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the chief negotiators of Taiwan and China set to hold their sixth round of
talks since June 2008 later this month, an issue of concern is whether a cross-
Taiwan Strait investment protection agreement can be signed at the meeting as
planned.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention in the deal involves the designation of a neutral
arbitration organization to settle disputes. With the lack of any arbitration
organizations that can truly be considered neutral in China, Taiwan has hoped to
introduce a mechanism of "international arbitration" to protect Taiwanese
investors.</P>
      <P>Possibilities  included  the International  Center  for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) under the World Bank and the Paris-based
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) . These proposals, however, have proven
infeasible because of the sensitive sovereignty dispute across the strait.</P>
      <P>To resolve the deadlock, we suggest that the two sides seek to set up a joint
arbitration center dedicated to the settlement of cross-strait investment
disputes.  The center would be run by qualified arbitrators from the two sides
and other countries and operated according to rules that are mutually accepted
as fair and neutral. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 7, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>MediaTek sales in November down 0.19 percent</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
12/07/10  12:30:47

    <TEXT>
      <P>Integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. said Tuesday that its sales in
November fell 0.19 percent from October to NT$7.36 billion (US$244 million) ,
compared with a 25.16 percent month-on-month decline recorded in the previous
month.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, MediaTek's sales totaled NT$105.52 billion,
down 0.36 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said the much narrower month-on-month
fall in November sales resulted from recovering demand in China.</P>
      <P>"But the higher demand came after the company aggressively slashed the prices of
its cell phone chips to secure orders amid fierce competition in the mainland
market, " said Hsu, who put the cut in the company's average selling price up to
around 20 percent.</P>
      <P>With demand in China expected to continue to rise in December ahead of an
anticipated buying spree during the Lunar Chinese New Year holiday, MediaTek's
sales in December are expected to rise substantially to about NT$8.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that due to higher shipments in December, MediaTek is expected to meet
the guidance it gave in October when it said the company's sales for the fourth
quarter could fall 15-20 percent below third quarter sales.</P>
      <P>"Although the company's sales have stabilized, the lower product prices may
further erode its gross margin, " Hsu said. "I expect its gross margin will fall
below 50 percent in the fourth quarter."</P>
      <P>In the third quarter of this year, MediaTek's gross margin fell 2.81 percentage
points from the second quarter to 52.22 percent.</P>
      <P>Cell phone chips account for about 75 percent of the company's total sales, but
its major customers are producers of "bandit, "or unbranded, Chinese cell
phones, whose products are price-sensitive.</P>
      <P>Due to the price competition, MediaTek's cell phone chip market share in China
fell to below 80 percent in the third quarter from more than 90 percent in the
first quarter, according to the analyst.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that unless MediaTek makes a breakthrough in its technology upgrade to
3G chips from the current 2.5-2.75G to take on competition, downward pressure on
its gross margin will continue to exist.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- FSC gets tough on foreign insurer pullouts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/07/10  12:59:19
(The Taiwan Banker, November 2010) (Translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's financial regulator is applying stricter standards to the sales of
domestic insurers by their foreign parent companies after three European
financial institutions unexpectedly sold their Taiwan units between 2008 and
2009.</P>
      <P>Though the global financial crisis was one of the main reasons behind the
pullouts, which began with Netherlands-based ING Group in October 2008, the
exodus has cast a shadow over Taiwan's insurance sector and alarmed the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC).</P>
      <P>ING Group's sale of its life insurance unit was followed in February 2009 by
British insurer Prudential Plc's sale of its Taiwan unit to China Life, in which
it transferred 11,000 sales agents and 1 million policies to the buyer.
Prudential held on to only its banking channels and telemarketing business.</P>
      <P>Then, in April 2009, Netherlands-based Aegon Group sold its Taiwan operation.</P>
      <P>Six months later, American International Group announced that it had found a
buyer for its subsidiary, Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., prompting the FSC to
unveil a month later five principles to be used in reviewing such cases.</P>
      <P>Due to public concern that Chinese investors were behind the consortium vying
for Nan Shan, and that the consortium consisted of a company set up for the sale
and a group whose core business was batteries, the deal was carefully
scrutinized.</P>
      <P>Before regulators rejected the sale on Aug. 31, 2010, the consortium had been
asked to submit supplemental information 13 times over a nine-month period to
clarify its shareholder structure, which was constantly changing.</P>
      <P>While the Council of Labor Affairs was against the deal because the prospective
buyer was not committed to protecting Nan Shan employees' rights, the commission
said the buyer did not meet two of the five criteria it had established --
showing long-term commitment and the ability to raise capital in the future.</P>
      <P>Another proposed deal,  American insurer Metropolitan  Life Insurance Co.'s
proposed sale of its Taiwan unit announced in April, also came under careful
scrutiny and was rejected by the commission in early October, one month after
the deal was sent for regulatory approval.</P>
      <P>The deal failed to meet the same two criteria that killed the Nan Shan sale, and
regulators also questioned the ability of the prospective buyer -- Waterland
Financial Holdings -- to run an insurance  business  because  of disagreement
among  Waterland shareholders over the purchase.</P>
      <P>One reason behind the European insurers' desire to sell was the European Union's
adoption of International  Financial Reporting Standards for the industry, which
aim for more transparency in financial reporting and also require higher
reserves for policies.</P>
      <P>But U.S. insurers, who do not have to follow the accounting standard, are also
pulling out of Taiwan, and European insurers are holding on to their other
subsidiaries in Asia, despite the more stringent accounting guidelines. The
moves indicate that in fact specific  conditions  in Taiwan's  market,  such  as
cutthroat competition, are driving foreign companies away.</P>
      <P>With New York Life now putting its units in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea up
for sale and MassMutual Financial Group said to be pulling out from its joint-
venture with Taiwan's Mercuries Life, Taiwan should look into the issue and try
to find market-based reasons to stop foreign insurers from leaving.</P>

      <P>Food business operators from Taiwan and the United States exchanged ideas on how
to break into each other's market on the opening day of the Gourmet Taiwan
International Conference in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was attended by more than 200 participants, including a
group of 30 people from the U.S. engaged in the food and hotel sectors,
according to the ROC-USA Business Council, the main organizer of the four-day
conference.</P>
      <P>Chen Fei-lung, executive supervisor of the business council, said he hoped that
with the support of the government, Taiwan's foods and food businesses would be
able to go international.</P>
      <P>Working with overseas compatriots and exploring global markets will be a
positive force for Taiwan's food industry because more jobs and business
opportunities will be created, he said.</P>
      <P>The conference will include a series of keynote speeches, and Taiwan's food
business operators will have the opportunity to hold discussions with their
counterparts from the U.S.</P>
      <P>Among the other topics of discussion will be visas for chefs specializing in
Chinese food.</P>
      <P>Helen Hwang, commercial chief of the American Institute in Taiwan, said the U.S.
has many restaurants serving Chinese food, but only a few mainstream restaurants
there have achieved success.</P>
      <P>She believed that the market for Chinese restaurants in the U.S. has not yet
reached a saturation point.</P>
      <P>"America is open for business, " said Hwang. "The U.S. is still the land of
dreams and goals."</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranked 47th among 57 high-carbon dioxide emitting countries in the
Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) , placing at the bottom of the index's
"poor" performer category, a report released on Monday by Germanwatch and
Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe showed.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan scored 50.2 points in the performance index,
lagging behind India, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Japan but ahead of
Malaysia and China among Asia countries assessed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was also ranked 47th in the index in 2009.</P>
      <P>Despite the poor overall ranking, Taiwan rose two notches to 13th in the climate
policy category, indicating the government's measures to cut carbon dioxide
emissions  have worked to improve  the environment, the report said.</P>
      <P>The climate policy category accounted for 20 percent of the overall index score.
The emissions level category and emissions trend category account for 30 percent
and 50 percent respectively of the overall index.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan made improvements in road and air transportation
emission reductions, but failed to lower emissions generated in the energy,
manufacturing and construction sectors and by private residences.</P>
      <P>The report also showed Taiwan needed to work harder to cut its carbon dioxide
emissions per primary energy unit and lower its primary energy consumption.</P>
      <P>The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the United States, dropped a
few notches compared to last year, with China ranking 56th and the U.S. 54th,

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan lists TEM, visa-waivers as priorities in Europe in 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to take an initial step toward signing a Trade Enhancement Measures
(TEM) deal with the European Union (EU) and secure more visa-exemptions in the
region next year, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official in charge of
European affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Negotiating TEM and pushing for visa waivers from 24 European countries or
territories were the priorities on the country's European affairs agenda for
2011, James Lee, director-general of the ministry's Department of European
Affairs, said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already secured a breakthrough in Europe on Nov. 25 when the Council of
the European Union approved visa exemptions for Taiwanese citizens in 35
European countries, including the 25 in the Schengen Area. The new visa-waivers
will take effect in January 2011.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan will now turn to six Balkan countries -- Albania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia -- and 18 British and
French overseas territories, such as Tahiti in French Polynesia, to push for
visa exemptions.</P>
      <P>As for the Trade Enhancement Measures, Lee said negotiating them was a natural
priority after Taiwan signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
with China in June, because the EU is Taiwan's fourth largest trade partner.</P>
      <P>"We would like to take the first step of a feasibility study (for a TEM) next
year. After that a joint study," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT) has actively urged  the EU to
initiate  talks  with Taiwan  on the trade liberalization measures, according to
Lee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has been in regular contact with the EU on the issue and has
advocated a "block-building" approach to lowering Taiwan-EU trade barriers if a
package deal were not plausible, he said.</P>
      <P>An inter-agency task force consisting of the MOFA and the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) has been established to work on Taiwan-EU trade liberalization
issues, he added.</P>
      <P>"We think that more urgent issues, such as investment, tariffs and standards,
could be negotiated in separate agreements to benefit Taiwanese and European
businesses, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lee was not optimistic that negotiations on the issues could begin immediately,
however, because the EU is engaged in free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations
with South Korea, India and Brazil, and he was not sure the EU would have other
teams to work with Taiwan on the TEM.</P>
      <P>That is why the possibility of doing separate and then joint feasibility studies
were more realistic goals in 2011, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Looking back at 2010, Lee listed the passage of visa exemptions in the Schengen
Area as one of Taiwan's biggest accomplishments last year. Taiwan also signed a
new aviation agreement with the United Kingdom and a double taxation avoidance
agreement with Hungary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Former first lady assigned to prison hospital</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/07/10  16:37:55

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office decided Monday that former first lady Wu Shu-
jen, who is a wheelchair user, will be confined to a prison hospital in central
Taiwan for medical evaluation, after which a final decision will be made on
where she would serve her 19-year jail sentence.</P>
      <P>Pei Teh Hospital, where she will be evaluated, is part of Taichung Prison.</P>
      <P>Wu and former President Chen Shui-bian were each sentenced in November to a
total of 19 years in jail for corruption during Chen's term in office between
2000 and 2008.</P>
      <P>They were both found guilty of accepting bribes in two separate cases, one
involving a land acquisition deal and the other involving the appointment of the
Taipei 101 chairperson.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ministry of Justice (MOJ) officials and prison authorities said that they are
doing their best to make special arrangements for Wu.</P>
      <P>Wu could be given parole for medical treatment at other hospitals if the
Taichung prison hospital cannot handle her health problems, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As a district hospital, Pei Teh has links with China Medical College Hospital in
central Taiwan and is well equipped to treat prisoners who are wheelchair users,
the MOJ said.</P>
      <P>Wu's daughter Chen Hsing-yu said she respected the decision to keep her mother
at Pei Teh, but was skeptical about the hospital's ability to care for her sick
mother.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsing-yu said she hopes other prisoners will not be assigned to tend to her
mother and that she is very worried about the toilet arrangements.</P>
      <P>"The hospital may think the problem can be dealt with by simply carrying her to
the toilet, but it can't, " Chen Hsing-yu said.</P>
      <P>"You can shoot a person to death if the penalty is death, but you can not abuse
her to death with lack of proper toilet facilities and nutritional care, " Wu's
daughter said. (Dec. 7, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Asked to respond to Chen Hsing-yu's recent statement that she will take legal
action against the government if her mother dies in jail, Yen Da-ho, chief
prosector of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, said he cannot comment on
"something that has not happened."</P>
      <P>The office explained that the decision to confine Wu to Pei Teh hospital was
based on "humanitarian concerns and fairness in carrying out penalties."</P>
      <P>The decision leaves open the possibility that the 57-year-old former first lady
would not be put behind bars if it is found that she is too ill to be held in
prison, the office said.</P>
      <P>The best-case senario is that Wu will be confined to Pei Teh for a period of
time then released on parole, based on the hospital's medical evaluation, the
office said. (Dec. 7, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Guan Bi-ling accused the
Ministry of Justice of interfering in the issue of Wu's confinement.</P>
      <P>Guan said it is a matter that should be decided by Kaohsiung Women's Prison,
which is in charge of implementing Wu's prison sentence. The ministry's decision
to assign Wu to Pei Teh Hospital in Taichung City overrode the Kaohsiung
prison's authority, Guan argued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Guard against inflation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/07/10  16:50:43
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to the latest forecast by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan's economic growth is expected to reach 4.5
percent in 2011, with the consumer price index rising moderately by 1.85
percent.</P>
      <P>Although the government  is optimistic  about the economic situation, the rally
in global commodity prices -- fueled by the quantitative easing policy in the
United States -- will be a major source of uncertainty for the economy next
year. Rising import prices will inevitably push up consumer costs.</P>
      <P>The soar in domestic real estate prices, meanwhile, will likely increase
inflationary  pressure.  Inflation  expectations  could encourage people to buy
property to preserve the value of their assets, which might in turn worsen the
inflation situation.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the government must seek to cool the housing  market
by strengthening  credit controls  on housing speculators and imposing heavy
taxes on speculative transactions. The central bank should also consider
significantly raising key interest rates. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 7, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Tuesday after a tug of war between
follow-through buying in select old-economy stocks and selling in the high-tech
sector that was overshadowed by a rising New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 2.16 points or 0.02 percent to 8,704.39, after moving
between 8,654.49 and 8,716.00, on turnover of NT$123.50 billion (US$4.10
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.16 percent at the day's high amid ample liquidity, while
concerns over Taiwan's global competitiveness on the New Taiwan dollar's
appreciation dampened investor sentiment toward the bellwether electronics
sector, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,949 stocks closed up and 2,072 were down, with 440 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The cement sector posted the highest gains, up 1.4 percent. Foodstuffs rose 1.0
percent, construction, and financial stocks added 0.2 percent, while the paper
and pulp sector closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>However, the textile sector fell 1.3 percent and the machinery and electronics
sector lost 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"Following a recent strong showing, the market needs some time to consolidate
before another take-off, " Horizon Securities analyst Benson Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said a lackluster showing on Wall Street overnight also pushed many
investors to the sidelines.</P>
      <P>After the removal of political uncertainty caused by the Nov. 27 municipal
elections, further inflows of foreign funds have boosted the index by more than
4.7 percent.</P>
      <P>"Some profit-taking emerged during the trading session to erode some of the
gains after the index breached the nearest technical resistance at the
8,700-point level," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said investors are watching closely how China will report its November
inflation data after a 25-month high of 4.4 percent recorded in October.</P>
      <P>"There are fears that China will further tighten liquidity to fight inflation,
which could prompt foreign funds to leave the markets in the region," he said.</P>
      <P>Among  the  high-tech  heavyweights,  Taiwan  Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
fell 0.73 percent to close at NT$68.00 and PC vendor Asustek lost 1.92 percent
to end the day at NT$281.00.</P>

      <P>Two students from the Caribbean country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines made
their debut this week as the first foreign players in Taiwan's top collegiate
basketball division.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, Craiglee Sam, 23, and Cregg Friday, 21, of Ming Chuan University
had helped their school to a 1-1 start in its first two games in the preliminary
round of the University Basketball Association Division 1 competition.</P>
      <P>Sam and Friday have made history not only as the first foreign players to appear
in the UBA Division 1, but also as the first foreign students to receive sports
scholarships from Ming Chuan University in 2009.</P>
      <P>The two players are from the Grenadine island of Bequia and are both majoring in
tourism at Ming Chuan University, which has campuses in Taipei and Taoyuan
cities.</P>
      <P>Sam, who is 198cm tall, had eight points and nine rebounds in his first Division
1 game Sunday, which Ming Chuan lost 80-54 to defending champion National Taiwan
Normal University.</P>
      <P>In his second game Monday, Sam scored three points and grabbed nine rebounds to
help Ming Chuan to its first ever victory in a Division 1 game -- a 60-50 win
over Taipei Physical Education College.</P>
      <P>Friday, who also stands 198cm, had 18 points, 15 rebounds and an impressive
eight blocked shots in the two games.</P>
      <P>The pair led Ming Chuan to a fourth place finish in the UBA Division II last
year as freshmen. The school was promoted this year to Division I, which has
been expanded from 12 to 16 teams.</P>
      <P>Sam has won several Most Valuable Player awards in his home country and received

    <HEADLINE>Consensus before speed: premier on NHI amendments</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that the administration respects the Legislative
Yuan's mission to screen and legislate amendments to the National Health
Insurance (NHI) Act that would allow for a new premium system to take effect,
but added that consensus must not be sacrificed for speed.</P>
      <P>The legislature had set that day as the deadline for passage of the new
amendments, but lawmakers across party lines continued to wrangle over various
versions of the revisions, making it unclear if the deadline will be met.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed hope that the lawmakers will pass the amendments into law with the
greatest possible consensus.</P>
      <P>"Nobody wants to see it passed rashly just because we have a deadline to meet,"
the premier said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang denied
accusations that the DOH is issuing a "blank check" to a soon-to-be established
committee that will determine the premium calculation formula by proposing the
amendments.</P>
      <P>Even the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislators lambasted the revisions to the
premium rates and a plan to calculate premiums based on "presumed income, "
under which the very poorest sector of society will be charged according to the
premise that they are earning at least NT$17,280 per month, whether they are
actually earning money or not. The lawmakers therefore refused to endorse the
amendments.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the premium rates to be proposed in the new NHI system would be
controlled at under 3.5 percent of household income and that the DOH is not
issuing any "blank check."</P>
      <P>Responding to the idea of a 2 percent rate that has been put forward by the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , Yaung said that "that is
absolutely impossible."</P>
      <P>The new premium calculation formula is devised in part to revitalize the cash-
strapped NHI system.</P>
      <P>"Where will the money come from if the premiums are lowered so sharply across
the board?" he asked.</P>
      <P>Yaung said that neither the DOH nor the National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB)
will determine the premium rates once the new NHI premium  system  is passed and
put into practice,  but by a yet-to-be-organized, independent NHI committee.</P>
      <P>On criticism lodged by DPP lawmakers on the plan to calculate premiums based on
presumed income, Yaung said the plan was devised because more than 40 percent of
the Taiwanese public did not pay income tax.</P>
      <P>The new NHI system proposes that insurance premiums should be calculated based
on total household incomes instead of the individual salaries of the insured, as
is the case at present.</P>
      <P>The new, or second-generation NHI system, if passed soon, is expected to be
implemented in 2013, according to NHIB.</P>

      <P>The Pei Teh Hospital of the Taichung Prison said Tuesday that it is capable of
jailing the wheelchair-bound former first lady Wu Shu-jen if it is instructed to
do so.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-hsiung, chief secretary of the Taichung Prison, said that in
cooperation with the China Medical University Hospital, Pei Teh can jail
seriously ill convicts, including amputees.</P>
      <P>Lin's comment came on the heels of questions asked by Chen Hsing-yu, Wu'
daughter, that the Pei Teh may not be an ideal place for Wu to serve her
sentence, given the fact that Wu has been paralyzed from the waist down for over
20 years.</P>
      <P>The Pei Teh can offer the same level of medical services as any other top-notch
hospital, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The Taichung Prison hospital was selected by the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office
as the facility in which Wu will serve her time if prosecutors decide to carry
out the sentence.</P>
      <P>Wu and her husband, former President Chen Shui-bian, were each sentenced to a
total of 19 years in jail last month by the Supreme Court for taking bribes
while Chen was president.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu were found guilty of having taken bribes in two separate cases, one
involving a land acquisition deal and the other involving the appointment of the
Taipei 101 chairwoman.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had been held at a detention center since late 2008, was moved to
Taipei Prison in Taoyuan County Dec. 2 to serve his time. Prison authorities are
now considering how Wu should be jailed, given her condition.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu said that whether the former first lady will
serve her time in the Pei Teh Hospital will depend on a medical assessment of
her condition.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have called on
the government to be lenient toward Wu by either allowing her to remain confined
under house arrest or releasing her on medical bail.</P>

      <P>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecast on Tuesday that Taiwan's economy will
expand by 4.0 percent in 2011 as its growth momentum moderates after a strong
showing in 2010.</P>
      <P>In its Asia Economic Monitor report, the ADB said Taiwan's exports will likely
see its exports affected by weaker global demand, and growth in other areas,
including industrial production and retail sales, is expected to moderate.</P>
      <P>The report also expected Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) to rise 9.8
percent for all of 2010 after the economy posted 13.2 percent growth in the
first half of the year and 9.8 percent growth in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>The report assesses the outlook for emerging East Asia, which comprises the 10
economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations along with China, Hong
Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, which is classified by the ADB as a newly
industrial economy (NIE).</P>
      <P>The other NIEs analyzed in the survey -- Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore --
are also expected to experience a similar slowdown in economic momentum next
year, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong is expected to grow 4.3 percent clip in 2011, while South Korea and
Singapore are seen as growing by 4.6 percent and 5.0 percent respectively, the
report said.</P>
      <P>China's economy is expected to remain strong, though signs exist that exports,
industrial production, and fixed asset investment will moderate to some extent
in 2011, the bank said.</P>
      <P>The ADB projected China's economy to grow 10.1 percent in 2010 and 9.1 percent
in 2011.</P>
      <P>Average growth in emerging East Asia is likely to be 7.3 percent in 2011 after
growing 8.8 percent in 2010, the bank said.</P>
      <P>"Emerging East Asia's large,  long-standing trade surpluses against developed
economies' increasing debt have raised tensions culminating in calls for
emerging East Asia to allow its currencies to appreciate to match its growing
economic strength, " the report said.</P>
      <P>"Rapidly growing interdependence in trade and finance and the increasing
importance of spillovers and contagion effects within the region make regional
exchange rate cooperation essential," the report added.</P>

raised the local currency above the previous closing level during most of the

      <P>Foreign banks remained the major buyers of the New Taiwan dollar. They cut their
U.S. dollar positions as they were betting that the local currency would extend
its momentum once the U.S. engaged in further quantitative easing to boost its

      <P>Despite the gains posted by the New Taiwan dollar, the daily trading volume
remained moderate as many traders took to the sidelines, waiting for China to

    <TEXT>
      <P>It was uncertain Tuesday whether amendments to the National Health Insurance
(NHI) Act would clear the floor of the Legislative Yuan that day as scheduled,
after ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers refused to endorse the bill.</P>
      <P>"It is the most ridiculous bill I have ever reviewed, " blasted Legislator Yang
Li-huan at a KMT caucus meeting earlier in the day, accusing the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) of failing to establish a clear premium calculation
base and premium rates when trying to introduce a second-generation NHI system
through the amendments.</P>
      <P>Yang said the DOH has merely drawn lines to divide employers, the government and
the rest of the public into three groups, but has failed to clearly define their
individual premium payment rates.</P>
      <P>The DOH hopes to leave that problem for a planned NHI committee in charge of the
review of premium rates to decide, a move that Yang said is like offering a
blank check allowing the committee to do basically as it pleases.</P>
      <P>Regardless of an order from the party to support the amendments, several KMT
lawmakers, dissatisfied with some clauses in the bill, refused to attend a
plenary meeting of the Legislative Yuan that day. Their absence threatened the
fulfillment of the Dec. 7 deadline set by the legislature for the passage of the
NHI Act amendments.</P>
      <P>Under the DOH-promoted second-generation NHI system, which it says is designed
to achieve fairness in the calculation of premiums, the insurance premiums are
calculated based on total household incomes instead of the individual salaries
of the insured.</P>
      <P>However, disputes have been raised on many controversial issues, including how
household incomes should be calculated and how much the government should pay in
its premium subsidies.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) also raised concerns that the
new compulsory health insurance system will increase the financial burden on
most of the insured.</P>
      <P>Releasing the results of a survey on the second-generation system, the DPP said
it found that 76.8 percent of the respondents have no idea about the content of
the new system, while 22.3 percent said they do.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government can achieve the goal of "having the rich people pay
more for their premiums to allow the poor to pay less" that it has set for the
introduction of the new NHI system, only 25.8 percent of the respondents said
the government can do this, while 58.9 percent said it cannot, DPP spokesman Lin
Yu-chang said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that 56.8 percent of the people surveyed assessed that they will have
to pay a higher premium once the new health system is implemented, while 17.1
percent said their premiums will drop.</P>
      <P>While the DOH says that over 60 percent of the people will enjoy lower premiums,
the survey results show that most of the respondents have a different view, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Monday with a total of 548 valid samples collected. The
margin of error was plus or minus 4.27 percentage points, according to Lin.</P>

      <P>A seal designer showcased 100 of his works Tuesday that capture the beauty of
100 railway stations around Taiwan, part of the Taiwan Railway Administration's
(TRA's) efforts to encourage the public to take the train to celebrate the
nation's 100th founding anniversary next year.</P>
      <P>Chen shih-chu, a 42-year-old who has been an engraver since he was 19, presented
the seals to the TRA at the launch of a railway travel journal dedicated to the
Republic of China's 100th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>The seals are printed in a "passport" introducing 219 train stations around the
country, with spaces for 100 of the stations in which train-lovers can mark a
space proving they have been there.</P>
      <P>To get a feeling for each station, Chen said he spent more than six months
discussing with historians and visiting local areas before engraving his passion
for the railway into three-square-centimeter "canvases."</P>
      <P>"Trains are like birds to me, " Chen said. "They bring you to secret corners
that people don't know about."</P>
      <P>To create a nostalgic ambiance, Chen used cypress and rubber to first draft 200
samples and then whittled the number by half to select the 100 official symbols.
The remainder of the 219 stations featured in the "passport" are described only
in writing.</P>
      <P>"Coming up with 100 snapshots of 100 train stations requires much effort," Chen
said. "It's not only about the buildings themselves but also about the
surrounding streets, the cultures and the people."</P>
      <P>According to the TRA, the "passports" will be available in the stations they
represent throughout next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Passage of NHI amendments hits snag</HEADLINE>

      <P>Legislative proceedings on amendments to a bill that will allow the introduction
of a second-generation national health insurance (NHI) system hit a snag Tuesday
amid widespread uproar from lawmakers across party lines, mainly because of the
proposed premium calculation formula.</P>
      <P>The  legislators  did  not  let the Department  of Health (DOH)-proposed
amendments to the NHI Act clear the legislative floor, nor did they review most
of the 20 clauses in the bill that are still in dispute.</P>
      <P>They resolved that the disputed clauses should be debated during the next
legislative session on Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to the impasse, President Ma Ying-jeou, who doubles as chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , said a well-designed and operated national health
insurance is a must for the country, meaning that the second-generation NHI
system must clear the legislative floor, according to KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>The president, nevertheless, stressed that while seeking to have the amendments
passed into law, the KMT and its legislative caucus should handle it carefully
and try to avoid creating negative implications for society, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The development was a disappointment for Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng,
who vowed the previous week to push through the bill and who said that "whatever
it takes, the bill must be passed into law Dec. 7."</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang was apparently also disappointed with the
development,  saying that "the legislators  were too calculating."</P>
      <P>The bill mainly involves a new scheme for calculating premiums based on total
household income rather than the existing system, which considers only
individuals' salaries and wages. The change is considered essential to keep the
cash-strapped program operational.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators lambasted the revision to the premium rates and a plan to
calculate premiums based on "presumed income, " under which the very poorest
sector of society will be charged according to the premise that they are earning
more than NT$17,280 per month, whether they are actually earning money or not.
The KMT lawmakers refused to endorse the amendments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) spelled out its opposition to the plan to calculate premiums based on
"presumed income" and a plan under which salaried workers will be required to
pay higher premiums.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmakers also suggested that a health insurance donation be included in
the land value increment tax as a means of making the wealthy pay more for
health insurance.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that the new premium rates to be stipulated in the second-
generation NHI system should be capped at under 2.7 percent of household income
-- compared to a figure of 3.5 percent put forward by the DOH.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, the non-profit Consumers' Foundation opposed the proposed
amendments, saying that they will end up causing the health insurance system to
"rob the poor to help the rich." (By Lee Shu-hua, Justin Su, Chen Ching-fang, Ho

      <P>SIM Technology Group Ltd, a China-based provider of handsets, wireless
communication modules and related applications, is seeking to list Taiwan
depositary receipts (TDRs) on the main board, the Taiwan Stock Exchange said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>SIM, which has submitted an application to the TWSE for approval, is planning to
raise about NT$1.85 billion (US$61.36 million) by issuing up to 165 million
TDRs, each of which will represent two common shares of the company, according
to its prospectus.</P>
      <P>The Chinese company, which has production facilities and research and
development centers in Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen and Shenyang, will use the
proceeds to expand its production capacity and purchase production equipment,
the prospectus said.</P>
      <P>The company has been listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since 2005.</P>
      <P>After more than 20 years of providing mobile communications products, SIM said,
it has established close business ties through strategic alliances with cell

      <P>It said it has also built partnerships with three major telecom operators in
China -- China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the TDR Issue will not only broaden the shareholder base of the

    <HEADLINE>Asustek's LCD shipments expected to surge in 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asustek Computer Inc.,  the world's fifth-largest PC maker, said Tuesday that it
plans to sell 4.5 million LCD monitors next year, representing better-than-
expected growth in a saturated market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based company, with shipments that grew by 12.1 percent from 3.3
million LCD monitors in 2009 to an estimated 3.7 million units this year, aims
to strengthen its global ranking in 2011 with a year-on-year growth of 21.6
percent, said Asustek Sales General Manager Kevin Du at a press conference held
for the ICT Month tech fair.</P>
      <P>Asustek expects a 2.5 percent share of the 2010 LCD market globally, increasing
to 3 percent in 2011, Du said.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy to record growth in the LCD market, as it is saturated.
Therefore, we plan to introduce a series of products that will meet consumer
demand, such as 3D built-in and super-thin models," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company will still top the local LCD market with an estimated
500,000 units shipped this year, about 28 percent of the total shipments in
Taiwan, followed by Acer Inc., ViewSonic Corp. and Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp., said Vincent Chiou, associate vice president of Asustek's display
business unit.</P>
      <P>Unlike personal computer and cellphone markets, in which the top three brands
have a nearly 70 percent-80 percent share, Taiwan's LCD market is better
distributed, despite a combined total of 49 percent market share by Asustek and
Acer, he said.</P>
      <P>Asustek also plans to launch more monitors with the energy-saving LED technology
before the end of the year, as the company forecast its penetration rate of LED
monitors in Taiwan will grow from 30 percent in 2010 to 45 percent-50 percent
next year, Chiou noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to monitors, Asustek will begin to sell a handheld LED projector in
the second half of 2011, targeting business workers holding 10-member group
meetings, he said.</P>
      <P>"With the advantages of quick booting and low-cost components, LED projectors
are a better choice for consumers compared to the traditional models that use
incandescent lightbulbs," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>He said the company will then launch larger-sized LED projectors for use in
offices and homes, respectively, but he declined to reveal a timetable for this
plan.</P>

      <P>A performance artist who spent five months taking pictures of himself doing
handstands in various unusual locations will present a solo performance Dec.
9-11 in Taipei to share "a different Taiwan" through his less-familiar artform,
the artist said in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Ming-cheng, a renowned stuntman and a dancer with the Lafa Dance Company
who has been nicknamed "Mr. Candle, " spent almost half of this year traveling
around Taiwan and the outlying islands taking more than 1,200 pictures and 250
video clips from his unusual vantage point.</P>
      <P>From March to August, Huang took photos of himself standing upside down at
locations such as near cliffs, on rocks in the sea, on top of roofs, even on the
back seat of a scooter.</P>
      <P>He told reporters at a press conference that he suffered extreme pain from the
handstand project, but carried on with the mission because he wanted to show the
beauty of Taiwan to more people and because it was something he had wanted to do
since the age of 13.</P>
      <P>He said the solo performance is inspired by what he saw and heard during his
journey.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a place full of quiet heroes, as well as those who do not care too
much about the environment, and I would like to show the two forces in my
production," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said performance art shows, particularly those performed by a single
artist, are not a mainstream thing in Taiwan, but he promised that his
performance is fun, entertaining, and at the same time offers something that is
close to "our collective memory."</P>
      <P>He said he knows the secret of how to make audiences laugh and enjoy the show,
as he staged more than 500 performances across Taiwan working as a street
entertainer for eight months prior to the launch of his handstand project.</P>
      <P>In the solo performance titled "Transparent Kingdom, " he will play  six roles,
portraying  various  personalities  including politicians, ordinary men and a
young man in search of freedom.</P>
      <P>Projections of the pictures and videos of the artist doing handstands will be
included in the one-hour performance, and Huang will also demonstrate his
amazing vocal mimicry and acrobatic skills.</P>

      <P>Two of Taiwan's major wireless service providers said Tuesday they plan to
expand their paid wireless coverage, amid the growing popularity of wireless-
based smartphones and tablet computers.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest telecom service operator, said in a
statement that by the end of this year it will provide wireless access at some
4,700 convenience stores in the 7-Eleven chain, which is operated by President
Chain Store Corp.</P>
      <P>This will increase the number of Chunghwa Telecom "hotspots" to 6,000, allowing
its mobile device subscribers more opportunities for wireless connection, the
company said.</P>
      <P>"Chunghwa Telecom will continue to invest more than NT$3 billion (US$99.6
million) per year in the expansion and upgrade of its Internet infrastructure,"
company president Chang Shaio-tung said.</P>
      <P>By next year, the number of hotspots is expected to exceed 10,000, he added.</P>
      <P>At present, Chunghwa Telecom has 5.26 million third-generation (3G) wireless
service subscribers, some of whom will have free access to the wireless service
at 7-Eleven stores, depending on their telecom packages.</P>
      <P>James Hsieh, chief operating officer of President Chain Store, said that the
introduction of wireless hotspots at 7-Eleven stores will be an expansion of the
role the chain now plays in the lives of consumers.</P>
      <P>He added that 7-Eleven is working to turn itself into a "cloud convenience
store" aimed at meeting consumers' mobile Internet needs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Q-ware Communications Co., a Taipei-based company that operates the
largest wireless Wi-Fi service network in Taiwan under the brand WIFLY, also
plans to broaden its coverage.</P>
      <P>"The number of WIFLY service spots will be doubled from the existing 5,000 to
nearly 10,000 by the end of this year, " the company's Product Manager Yu Chih-
ming told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Right now, we have already achieved 70 percent of that target, " he said,
adding that the goal for next year is 15,000 hotspots.</P>

      <P>A prominent local banker denied Tuesday his involvement in an offshore paper
company's buying and selling of structured notes or in Chinatrust Financial
Holdings Co.'s bid to take over Mega Financial Holdings Co.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo Jr., former vice chairman of Chinatrust Financial, read his appeal
before a second trial of what Taiwan media are calling the "Red Fire case" after
the name of the paper firm.</P>
      <P>"I did not have any role in making those investment decisions. Both were made
based on the professional judgment of my managers, " Koo told the Taiwan High
Court.</P>
      <P>Koo and other senior Chinatrust executives were charged with using Red Fire
Developments, owned by Chinatrust, to gain NT$1 billion in illicit profits
through transactions of structured notes in 2004.</P>
      <P>The scam surfaced following prosecutors' intensive investigations into a bid by
Chinatrust Financial to take over Mega Financial.</P>
      <P>The prosecution also charged Koo with using NT$300 million of the illicit gains
to curry favor with the family of former President Chen Shui-bian in exchange
for possible influence in Chinatrust's bid to merge Mega Financial Holdings in
2005-2006.</P>
      <P>In the first trial, the Taipei District Court found Koo guilty of violating the
Securities and Exchange Act and the Banking Act and on Oct. 18, sentenced him to
nine years in jail.</P>
      <P>Both Koo and the prosecution appealed the sentence, setting the stage for
Tuesday's second trial.</P>
      <P>The High Court also heard testimony from a witness called by Chinatrust's former
chief financial officer, Chang Ming-tien, and Lin Hsiang-hsi, who worked under
Chang as a deputy manager. Chang and Lin had already been handed sentences
ranging from seven years and two months to eight years, in a trial in 2008.</P>
      <P>The witness, Chou Chao-ting -- a former junior manager at Chinatrust -- said he
saw company files on the purchase of the structured notes but did not know the
purpose of buying them.</P>
      <P>Details of investment projects were under the control of the company's
financial  investment  department  and many  of the prosecutors' questions
should be directed at this department, Chou told the court.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office appealed Tuesday the High Court's acquittal
ruling in November of three suspects in a high-profile murder case known as the
"Hsichih Trio" that has been going on for nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors filed the appeal based on their position that the report
produced by U.S.-based forensic expert Henry Lee to prove the trio's innocence
was "not evidence at all" and that the entire acquittal ruling ran counter to
laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, the Taiwan High Court on Nov. 12 acquitted the
three suspects -- Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-lang and Chuang Lin-hsun -- who had been
charged with the murder of a couple and rape of the wife in their home in the
Taipei suburb of Hsichih in 1991.</P>
      <P>The ruling was the second acquittal by the High Court in the hearings of the
case against the trio. The first acquittal was granted in 2003.</P>
      <P>One of the key factors in the most recent verdict was an investigative report
made by Lee, which concluded that a single assailant could have committed the
crime. Another defendant, soldier Wang Wen-hsiao, had already been executed
after he was convicted by a military court in the same case.</P>
      <P>Based on the photos of the crime scene, Lee said, he did not rule out the
possibility that Wang could have carried out the double murder and rape.</P>
      <P>Lee's report was backed by the fact that only one set of fingerprints was found
at the crime scene. In addition, there is the fact that the confessions
extracted from the trio were coerced, according to the second acquittal report.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, nevertheless, argued Tuesday that Lee's
report, released in July 2009, was compiled with data provided by the three
defendants' lawyer that is seriously flawed and therefore should not be allowed
to serve as evidence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the prosecutors said, it is also debatable whether the trio were
coerced into confessing.</P>

Ministry of Finance Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Imports for the month, meanwhile, totaled US$23.96 billion, representing a 33.8
percent rise from the same month of last year, the figures show.</P>
      <P>November's trade surplus of US$410 million was the lowest for any single month
since September 2008, said Lin Li-chen, chief of the ministry's statistics
department, adding that the decline was due mainly to increased imports of
capital equipment for a combined US$4.4 billion, which included three airplanes
worth a total of US$440 million.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if the export momentum continues in December, the export volume
for 2010 will exceed the projected goal of US$272.7 billion and reach a new
high.</P>
      <P>November's export value was a growth of only US$180 million from the previous
month. The items that saw increased imports included minerals (up by US$290
million) , optronics goods (an increase of US$220 million), and information and
communication technologies (ICT) goods (a rise of US$210 million).</P>
      <P>For the first 11 months of this year, exports amounted to US$250.8 billion,
while imports reached US$229.1 billion, both the highest on record for the
period, giving a surplus of US$21.7 billion.</P>
      <P>During the 11-month period, exports of optronics, chemicals, plastics and
machinery and transport equipment all reached record highs, with machinery
exports posting the highest growth of 54.1 percent year-on-year, followed by ICT
goods with a 52.3-percent rise, optronics goods up by 51.6 percent and chemicals
up by 41.4 percent.</P>
      <P>China and Hong Kong together was the largest export market for Taiwan in
November, absorbing US$9.83 billion-worth of goods. This was followed by
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with US$3.53 billion-worth of
goods imported from Taiwan, ahead of the United States (US$ 2.95 billion) and
Europe (US$2.94 billion).</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of the year, China and Hong Kong imported US$104.93
billion-worth of goods from Taiwan, while ASEAN countries were worth US$37.76
billion,  the U.S. accounted for US$28.76 billion-worth of Taiwanese exports,
Europe spent US$26.54 billion on goods from Taiwan and Japan absorbed goods
worth US$16.6 billion.</P>
      <P>Japan was the largest source of Taiwanese imports, shipping US$4.6  billion-
worth  of goods  in November  and  a US$47.53 billion-worth in the January-
November period.</P>
      <P>China (including Hong Kong) was the second-largest exporter to Taiwan, providing
US$3.76 billion-worth of goods in November and US$34.05 billion-worth in the

in a press release that day.</P>
      <P>The OAG noted that Chen was recently convicted of corruption. He is serving a
19-year jail term at the Taipei Prison in Guishan, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The special prosecutors team, which is responsible for tracking down the public
assets hidden by the Chen family abroad, said that because of currency
fluctuations, the money that was deposited by Chen and his family in the Swiss
banks is worth less today than it was several years ago.</P>
      <P>For instance, it said, on Nov. 15, the money was worth NT$667.31 million. As of
Tuesday, the Swiss authorities had returned CHF20 million (some NT$620 million)
to Taiwan. Based on Tuesday's exchange rate of NT$30.075 to the U.S. dollar,
Taiwan has "lost" over NT$30 million.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  according to the OAG release,  proceedings are continuing in order
to establish the origin of the remainder of the Chen assets frozen in
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>Some CHF37 million has been seized in response to a request for mutual
assistance filed by the Taiwanese authorities, said the release.</P>
      <P>The prosecution said that only some US$493,000 of the US$21 million seized by
the Swiss authorities remains to be returned to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Asustek's LCD shipments expected to surge in 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Asustek Computer Inc.,  the world's fifth-largest PC maker, said Tuesday that it
plans to sell 4.5 million LCD monitors next year, representing better-than-
expected growth in a saturated market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-based company, with shipments that grew by 12.1 percent from 3.3
million LCD monitors in 2009 to an estimated 3.7 million units this year, aims
to strengthen its global ranking in 2011 with a year-on-year growth of 21.6
percent, said Asustek Sales General Manager Kevin Du at a press conference held
for the ICT Month tech fair.</P>
      <P>Asustek expects a 2.5 percent share of the 2010 LCD market globally, increasing
to 3 percent in 2011, Du said.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy to record growth in the LCD market, as it is saturated.
Therefore, we plan to introduce a series of products that will meet consumer
demand, such as 3D built-in and super-thin models," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company will still top the local LCD market with an estimated
500,000 units shipped this year, about 28 percent of the total shipments in
Taiwan, followed by Acer Inc., ViewSonic Corp. and Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp., said Vincent Chiou, associate vice president of Asustek's display
business unit.</P>
      <P>Unlike personal computer and cellphone markets, in which the top three brands
have a nearly 70 percent-80 percent share, Taiwan's LCD market is better
distributed, despite a combined total of 49 percent market share by Asustek and
Acer, he said.</P>
      <P>Asustek also plans to launch more monitors with the energy-saving LED technology
before the end of the year, as the company forecast its penetration rate of LED
monitors in Taiwan will grow from 30 percent in 2010 to 45 percent-50 percent
next year, Chiou noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to monitors, Asustek will begin to sell a handheld LED projector in
the second half of 2011, targeting business workers holding 10-member group
meetings, he said.</P>
      <P>"With the advantages of quick booting and low-cost components, LED projectors
are a better choice for consumers compared to the traditional models that use
incandescent lightbulbs," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>He said the company will then launch larger-sized LED projectors for use in
offices and homes, respectively, but he declined to reveal a timetable for this
plan.</P>

      <P>A performance artist who spent five months taking pictures of himself doing
handstands in various unusual locations will present a solo performance Dec.
9-11 in Taipei to share "a different Taiwan" through his less-familiar artform,
the artist said in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Ming-cheng, a renowned stuntman and a dancer with the Lafa Dance Company
who has been nicknamed "Mr. Candle, " spent almost half of this year traveling
around Taiwan and the outlying islands taking more than 1,200 pictures and 250
video clips from his unusual vantage point.</P>
      <P>From March to August, Huang took photos of himself standing upside down at
locations such as near cliffs, on rocks in the sea, on top of roofs, even on the
back seat of a scooter.</P>
      <P>He told reporters at a press conference that he suffered extreme pain from the
handstand project, but carried on with the mission because he wanted to show the
beauty of Taiwan to more people and because it was something he had wanted to do
since the age of 13.</P>
      <P>He said the solo performance is inspired by what he saw and heard during his
journey.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a place full of quiet heroes, as well as those who do not care too
much about the environment, and I would like to show the two forces in my
production," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said performance art shows, particularly those performed by a single
artist, are not a mainstream thing in Taiwan, but he promised that his
performance is fun, entertaining, and at the same time offers something that is
close to "our collective memory."</P>
      <P>He said he knows the secret of how to make audiences laugh and enjoy the show,
as he staged more than 500 performances across Taiwan working as a street
entertainer for eight months prior to the launch of his handstand project.</P>
      <P>In the solo performance titled "Transparent Kingdom, " he will play  six roles,
portraying  various  personalities  including politicians, ordinary men and a
young man in search of freedom.</P>
      <P>Projections of the pictures and videos of the artist doing handstands will be
included in the one-hour performance, and Huang will also demonstrate his
amazing vocal mimicry and acrobatic skills.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of Taiwan's major wireless service providers said Tuesday they plan to
expand their paid wireless coverage, amid the growing popularity of wireless-
based smartphones and tablet computers.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest telecom service operator, said in a
statement that by the end of this year it will provide wireless access at some
4,700 convenience stores in the 7-Eleven chain, which is operated by President
Chain Store Corp.</P>
      <P>This will increase the number of Chunghwa Telecom "hotspots" to 6,000, allowing
its mobile device subscribers more opportunities for wireless connection, the
company said.</P>
      <P>"Chunghwa Telecom will continue to invest more than NT$3 billion (US$99.6
million) per year in the expansion and upgrade of its Internet infrastructure,"
company president Chang Shaio-tung said.</P>
      <P>By next year, the number of hotspots is expected to exceed 10,000, he added.</P>
      <P>At present, Chunghwa Telecom has 5.26 million third-generation (3G) wireless
service subscribers, some of whom will have free access to the wireless service
at 7-Eleven stores, depending on their telecom packages.</P>
      <P>James Hsieh, chief operating officer of President Chain Store, said that the
introduction of wireless hotspots at 7-Eleven stores will be an expansion of the
role the chain now plays in the lives of consumers.</P>
      <P>He added that 7-Eleven is working to turn itself into a "cloud convenience
store" aimed at meeting consumers' mobile Internet needs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Q-ware Communications Co., a Taipei-based company that operates the
largest wireless Wi-Fi service network in Taiwan under the brand WIFLY, also
plans to broaden its coverage.</P>
      <P>"The number of WIFLY service spots will be doubled from the existing 5,000 to
nearly 10,000 by the end of this year, " the company's Product Manager Yu Chih-
ming told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Right now, we have already achieved 70 percent of that target, " he said,
adding that the goal for next year is 15,000 hotspots.</P>

      <P>A prominent local banker denied Tuesday his involvement in an offshore paper
company's buying and selling of structured notes or in Chinatrust Financial
Holdings Co.'s bid to take over Mega Financial Holdings Co.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo Jr., former vice chairman of Chinatrust Financial, read his appeal
before a second trial of what Taiwan media are calling the "Red Fire case" after
the name of the paper firm.</P>
      <P>"I did not have any role in making those investment decisions. Both were made
based on the professional judgment of my managers, " Koo told the Taiwan High
Court.</P>
      <P>Koo and other senior Chinatrust executives were charged with using Red Fire
Developments, owned by Chinatrust, to gain NT$1 billion in illicit profits
through transactions of structured notes in 2004.</P>
      <P>The scam surfaced following prosecutors' intensive investigations into a bid by
Chinatrust Financial to take over Mega Financial.</P>
      <P>The prosecution also charged Koo with using NT$300 million of the illicit gains
to curry favor with the family of former President Chen Shui-bian in exchange
for possible influence in Chinatrust's bid to merge Mega Financial Holdings in
2005-2006.</P>
      <P>In the first trial, the Taipei District Court found Koo guilty of violating the
Securities and Exchange Act and the Banking Act and on Oct. 18, sentenced him to
nine years in jail.</P>
      <P>Both Koo and the prosecution appealed the sentence, setting the stage for
Tuesday's second trial.</P>
      <P>The High Court also heard testimony from a witness called by Chinatrust's former
chief financial officer, Chang Ming-tien, and Lin Hsiang-hsi, who worked under
Chang as a deputy manager. Chang and Lin had already been handed sentences
ranging from seven years and two months to eight years, in a trial in 2008.</P>
      <P>The witness, Chou Chao-ting -- a former junior manager at Chinatrust -- said he
saw company files on the purchase of the structured notes but did not know the
purpose of buying them.</P>
      <P>Details of investment projects were under the control of the company's
financial  investment  department  and many  of the prosecutors' questions
should be directed at this department, Chou told the court.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office appealed Tuesday the High Court's acquittal
ruling in November of three suspects in a high-profile murder case known as the
"Hsichih Trio" that has been going on for nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors filed the appeal based on their position that the report
produced by U.S.-based forensic expert Henry Lee to prove the trio's innocence
was "not evidence at all" and that the entire acquittal ruling ran counter to
laws and regulations.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, the Taiwan High Court on Nov. 12 acquitted the
three suspects -- Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-lang and Chuang Lin-hsun -- who had been
charged with the murder of a couple and rape of the wife in their home in the
Taipei suburb of Hsichih in 1991.</P>
      <P>The ruling was the second acquittal by the High Court in the hearings of the
case against the trio. The first acquittal was granted in 2003.</P>
      <P>One of the key factors in the most recent verdict was an investigative report
made by Lee, which concluded that a single assailant could have committed the
crime. Another defendant, soldier Wang Wen-hsiao, had already been executed
after he was convicted by a military court in the same case.</P>
      <P>Based on the photos of the crime scene, Lee said, he did not rule out the
possibility that Wang could have carried out the double murder and rape.</P>
      <P>Lee's report was backed by the fact that only one set of fingerprints was found
at the crime scene. In addition, there is the fact that the confessions
extracted from the trio were coerced, according to the second acquittal report.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office, nevertheless, argued Tuesday that Lee's
report, released in July 2009, was compiled with data provided by the three
defendants' lawyer that is seriously flawed and therefore should not be allowed
to serve as evidence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the prosecutors said, it is also debatable whether the trio were
coerced into confessing.</P>

Ministry of Finance Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Imports for the month, meanwhile, totaled US$23.96 billion, representing a 33.8
percent rise from the same month of last year, the figures show.</P>
      <P>November's trade surplus of US$410 million was the lowest for any single month
since September 2008, said Lin Li-chen, chief of the ministry's statistics
department, adding that the decline was due mainly to increased imports of
capital equipment for a combined US$4.4 billion, which included three airplanes
worth a total of US$440 million.</P>
      <P>Lin said that if the export momentum continues in December, the export volume
for 2010 will exceed the projected goal of US$272.7 billion and reach a new
high.</P>
      <P>November's export value was a growth of only US$180 million from the previous
month. The items that saw increased imports included minerals (up by US$290
million) , optronics goods (an increase of US$220 million), and information and
communication technologies (ICT) goods (a rise of US$210 million).</P>
      <P>For the first 11 months of this year, exports amounted to US$250.8 billion,
while imports reached US$229.1 billion, both the highest on record for the
period, giving a surplus of US$21.7 billion.</P>
      <P>During the 11-month period, exports of optronics, chemicals, plastics and
machinery and transport equipment all reached record highs, with machinery
exports posting the highest growth of 54.1 percent year-on-year, followed by ICT
goods with a 52.3-percent rise, optronics goods up by 51.6 percent and chemicals
up by 41.4 percent.</P>
      <P>China and Hong Kong together was the largest export market for Taiwan in
November, absorbing US$9.83 billion-worth of goods. This was followed by
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with US$3.53 billion-worth of
goods imported from Taiwan, ahead of the United States (US$ 2.95 billion) and
Europe (US$2.94 billion).</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of the year, China and Hong Kong imported US$104.93
billion-worth of goods from Taiwan, while ASEAN countries were worth US$37.76
billion,  the U.S. accounted for US$28.76 billion-worth of Taiwanese exports,
Europe spent US$26.54 billion on goods from Taiwan and Japan absorbed goods
worth US$16.6 billion.</P>
      <P>Japan was the largest source of Taiwanese imports, shipping US$4.6  billion-
worth  of goods  in November  and  a US$47.53 billion-worth in the January-
November period.</P>
      <P>China (including Hong Kong) was the second-largest exporter to Taiwan, providing
US$3.76 billion-worth of goods in November and US$34.05 billion-worth in the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Higher demand from China helped flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) post a
month-on-month increase in sales in November, reversing a double-digit fall in
the previous month, an analyst said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>AUO on Tuesday reported November sales of NT$36.87 billion (US$1.23 billion), up
5 percent from October, after October revenues dropped 16.3 percent from
September.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months to November, AUO's sales totaled NT$436.55 billion, up
35.4 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In November, AUO's shipments of large-sized panels -- panels 10 inches or larger
used to produce desktop computers,  notebook computers and TVs -- rose 6.3
percent from October to about 9.72 million units.</P>
      <P>During the same period, its shipments of small- and medium-sized panels rose 1.5
percent from a month earlier to exceed 18.04 million units.</P>
      <P>"Ahead of the anticipated buying spree for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday,
many Chinese buyers are raising their inventories to meet demand," Grand Cathay
Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"AUO is simply one of the beneficiaries of the positive seasonal factor, in
particular as China has accounted for more than 20 percent of the company's
sales," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen,  however, whether AUO's sales are stabilizing, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"As TV panel prices continue to fall amid fierce competition, AUO may feel the
pinch from the lingering impact," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter of 2010, panels used in TVs accounted for 56 percent of
AUO's total sales, up from the 51 percent recorded in the second quarter,
leaving the company more vulnerable to price volatility in the TV market.</P>
      <P>A report released by Taiwan-based Topology Research Institute in late November
said flat panel display prices are expected to bottom out in the first quarter
of 2011 after inventory adjustments.</P>

      <P>A bill that would introduce a second-generation national health insurance system
did not clear the legislative floor Tuesday as previously expected, mainly
because of differences between ruling and opposition lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The greatest controversy surrounding the bill involves the income base used to
calculate premiums. The new system would refer to personal income tax data of
all individuals insured under the program to determine the income on which
premiums would be charged.</P>
      <P>This is a questionable concept because the existing tax system is widely
considered to be unfair, with salary earners contributing 75 percent of personal
income tax revenue. Capital gains and transitory income (gifts, inheritances)
are not taxed and would be excluded.</P>
      <P>Also, the bill does not specify the premium rate and the share of the premium to
be paid by the government, employers and insured persons, which would be
tantamount to giving administrative agencies a blank check to arbitrarily set
premium rates and distribute the burden of paying premiums.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bill barely addresses the issue of waste of medical resources,
the most serious component of the system's huge deficit.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps not a bad thing for the bill to get cut down. Stopping to look and
listen before moving forward will increase our chances of creating a sustainable
health insurance system. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 8, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan remained under the influence of a cold front Wednesday, with temperatures
dropping as low as 9.4 degrees Celsius in Danshui in northern Taiwan, the
Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>The cold front, which the CWB expects to keep a chill in the air until Friday,
sent the mercury falling to its lowest level in Taiwan since temperatures began
to cool.</P>
      <P>The CWB said temperatures would range between 11 degrees and 21 degrees on
Wednesday, and the skies over most parts of the country would remain clear
because of the dry air brought to Taiwan by the cold front.</P>
      <P>Hualien and Taitung counties along Taiwan's eastern coast were expected to see
more clouds than in other areas, forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The CWB predicted temperatures for Wednesday of 11-16 degrees in northern
Taiwan, 12-18 degrees in central Taiwan, and 13-21 degrees in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mercury should fall below 10 degrees overnight in areas north of Chiayi
County and along the northeastern coast.</P>
      <P>The cold weather will last until Friday, according to the bureau.</P>
      <P>A low temperature warning has been issued to remind people and fish breeders to
take necessary precautions, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on Jade Mountain, also known as Yushan, temperatures fell as low as
minus 8.3 degrees early Wednesday morning, the lowest reading seen anywhere in
Taiwan since temperatures started to cool.</P>
      <P>After the sun came out, temperatures warmed to minus 4-5 degrees, according to

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan's soft power</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/08/10  14:42:29
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Joseph Nye, a Harvard University professor, said in an interview with a local
newspaper  Tuesday that the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
signed between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in June is the best testament
to Taiwan's soft power.</P>
      <P>Nye, a former dean of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government who
served as assistant secretary of defense during the Bill Clinton administration,
is considered one of the 10 most influential international relations scholars in
the United States.</P>
      <P>He was scheduled to deliver a public speech in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The following is an excerpt of a United Daily News report of an interview with
Nye:</P>
      <P>Nye said Taiwan has deftly used its soft power and hard power to improve cross-
strait relations and its own international standing over the past two years.</P>
      <P>He especially lauded President Ma Ying-jeou's move to sign the ECFA with China,
describing it as a very important step and the best testament to Taiwan's soft
power.</P>
      <P>Nye said he believes the ECFA, which lays out provisions for mutual tariff
concessions and easier market access to boost bilateral trade and investment,
will definitely benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging  that he noticed there are still doubts and criticism about the
pact in Taiwanese society, Nye said a smart leader should deal with such
differing views properly.</P>
      <P>Nye pointed out that the procurement of weapons from the United States is no
longer Taiwan's only bargaining chip in negotiations with China. Soft power is a
more effective and enduring way to solve cross-strait disputes, he said.</P>
      <P>For instance, he went on, Taiwan's democratic system and free market economy can
not only win recognition from the United States and European countries but can
also attract the admiration of Chinese young people.</P>
      <P>Nye, who has also served as a deputy assistant secretary of state, said that at
present, China's People's Liberation Army still cannot take over Taiwan easily.</P>
      <P>Noting that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are aimed primarily at increasing Taiwan's
bargaining power in negotiations with China, Nye said military might has never
been the only choice and that Taiwan has better options.</P>
      <P>He recognized Taiwan's launch of peaceful dialogue with China while striving to
beef up its self-defense capability, saying that the practice provides the best
model for the exercise of smart power that he has been advocating.</P>
      <P>Nye further said he looks forward to seeing Taiwan and China kick off political
talks following the smooth start of their economic dialogue.</P>
      <P>Even though China is not expected to recognize Taiwan's sovereign status, Nye
said, Taiwan should still endeavor to assert its cause and should at least try
to have its voice heard in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Nye also said that Beijing should allow Taiwan to have its own international
space.</P>
      <P>Although it might take time for Beijing to change its position, Nye said,
Taiwan will be able to realize that goal through negotiations.</P>
      <P>Nye also said that if anybody were to think the U.S. will "abandon" Taiwan
because of the cross-strait detente, it would be a misconception or misplaced
worry, because Taiwan has used its soft power, such as culture and economy, to
win itself a spot on the international stage. (Dec. 8, 2010).</P>

      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang said Wednesday that he had not received
any information of a reported planned  visit  by South  Korean  military
personnel  to the Taiwan-controlled former frontline island of Kinmen, but that
if the report is true, the two countries can learn from each other.</P>
      <P>"The Defense Ministry will do whatever it can about promoting military
diplomacy, " Chao told reporters in response to foreign wire reports that
according to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, a South Korean military
delegation may visit Kinmen this month.</P>
      <P>It was reported that South Korea wishes to gain knowledge about the
establishment of the Kinmen fortifications as a reference for its own efforts to
fortify its five western border islands, including Yeonpyeong, which was
attacked by North Korea last month.</P>
      <P>Asked what Kinmen -- a military outpost now transformed into a tourist
attraction following improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations -- can teach,
Chao noted that the military controlled the outlying island just off the coast
of southeastern China for many years.</P>
      <P>As a result, there is still a solid underground infrastructure on the island
that survived many Chinese strikes, including extensive shelling in 1958, Chao
said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang
suggested that the Defense Ministry should ask South Korea to allow Taiwanese
officials to inspect South Korean military facilities in return, since the two
countries are not diplomatic allies.</P>

      <P>The office of ruling Kuomintang honorary Chairman and former Vice President Lien
Chan dismissed on Wednesday an Associated Press report that a nongovernmental
Beijing-based committee had picked him as this year's recipient of the
"Confucius Peace Prize."</P>
      <P>"There is absolutely no such thing as Lien receiving such an award. We have
never heard of it, " said Ting Yuan-chao, the director and spokesman of Lien's
office.</P>
      <P>Another person in Lien's office also said the office had not received any
information related to the news.</P>
      <P>According to the AP report, the award was first suggested by a Chinese tabloid
last month as an answer to the Nobel Peace Prize won by Chinese dissident Liu
Xiaobo for his struggle to implement democracy in the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>What started as a semi-farce reportedly became a reality three weeks later, as
AP said it has received a statement from the committee confirming the award and
the name of the honoree.</P>
      <P>"Named after the famed philosopher, the new prize was created to interpret the
viewpoints of peace of (the) Chinese (people) , the awards committee said in a
statement it released to the AP on Tuesday," the story said.</P>
      <P>The article also cited the chairman of the award committee, Tan Changliu, as
saying his group was not an official government body but did work closely with
China's Ministry of Culture.</P>
      <P>Lien, 75, was reportedly chosen from among a number of nominees, including
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former South African President Nelson Mandela,
former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and the China-appointed Panchen Lama, the

      <P>The report quoted the award committee as saying that Lien was selected for
"having built a bridge of peace between the mainland and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In 2005, Lien became the first Kuomintang chairman to set foot in China since
1949 when he met with Hu Jintao in Beijing, who received him in his capacity as

    <HEADLINE>EU visa waiver signals improving Taiwan-Europe ties</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
12/08/10  16:59:19
(By Emmanuelle Tzeng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When the Council of the European Union unanimously finalized the inclusion of
Taiwan in its visa-waiver program in late November, local travelers were the
main winners, but it also highlighted Taiwan's improving ties with Europe.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hailed the EU approval as "an important accomplishment in
the diplomatic history of the Republic of China, " one that he said also showed
that Taiwan is a "respectable" country.</P>
      <P>The visa exemption was another sign of progress in Taiwan's relations with
European countries, following its signing of a new aviation agreement with the
United Kingdom and a double taxation avoidance agreement with Hungary earlier
this year.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, a former foreign affairs minister who served as Taiwan's
representative to the EU from 2004 to 2006, attributed the breakthrough and
improving ties with Europe in part to Ma's "flexible diplomacy" policy aimed at
reducing tensions with China.</P>
      <P>Chen said the EU has always hoped for peace across the Taiwan Strait and that
the two sides become more engaged with each other.</P>
      <P>The confrontational relations between Taiwan and China that existed when the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was in power from 2000 to 2008 and its
advocacy of "one country on either side" limited to some extent progress in
negotiating the visa-waiver issue with the EU, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"The success in securing visa exemptions for the Schengen Area is a positive
result of improving cross-strait relations, " said Chen, who was Taiwan's
representative to the United States from 2000 to 2004.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials echoed Chen's view. They said that
getting the EU visa exemption was once considered a "mission impossible" because
Taiwan's relations with Europe have traditionally not been as close as its ties
with the United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>But Ma's conciliatory approach and pragmatic efforts to improve relations with
China drew public recognition from EU authorities on many occasions, the
officials said, and MOFA diplomats at home and in Europe took advantage of the
new atmosphere to push for the goal.</P>
      <P>The drive finally took off in July when the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, put forth a concrete bill to include Taiwan in the visa-waiver
program.</P>
      <P>The proposal then went through a 15-step process and is now waiting only to be
signed by the European Parliament speaker and rotating EU president on Dec. 15,
considered to be a formality, before taking effect in January 2011.</P>
      <P>After the proposal cleared its last hurdle in the Council of the European Union
on Nov. 25 by unanimous consent without discussion, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Timothy C.T. Yang said it was great news that Taiwan had long waited for.</P>
      <P>The visa waiver means that Republic of China (Taiwan) passport holders will be
able to enter the 35 European countries included in the program visa-free and
stay for up to 90 days within a six-month period.</P>
      <P>The exemption  will apply to 25 Schengen  Area countries, comprising 22 EU
member states and three non-EU states -- Norway, Iceland and Switzerland -- and
three non-Schengen EU member states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It also includes seven smaller European countries and territories -- the
Vatican, Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands.</P>
      <P>"The EU inclusion marks a giant step toward our aim to boost the number of
countries that grant Taiwan visa-waiver privileges to 100 by 2011, when we
celebrate our country's 100th anniversary, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>There are now 96 countries and territories offering Taiwanese citizens visa
exemptions, with 75 granting local passport holders visa-waiver privileges and
21 others allowing travelers to pick up visas on arrival.</P>
      <P>In the two and a half years since Ma launched his "flexible diplomacy" approach,
43 more countries or territories have granted visa-free access to ROC passport
holders.</P>
      <P>The EU exemption came three days after Canada granted Taiwan the same privilege
on Nov. 22. Yang said the EU and Canada exemptions would save Taiwan people visa
application fee of around NT$1.5 billion (US$49.18 million) every year,
including more than NT$ 1 billion for the Schengen visas. An average of 310,000
Taiwan nationals visit Europe every year, according to MOFA statistics.</P>
      <P>In the coming years, Yang said, Taiwan will be exploring visa-free opportunities
in countries such as the United States, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Myanmar,
the Philippines and 18 oversea territories of the United Kingdom, France and the
Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also keep seeking visa exemptions in six Balkan countries --
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, the

    <HEADLINE>Public Art Work of NCKU Hospital Clinic Building Inaugurated</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/08/10  17:10:05</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening ceremony of the public art work Window of Firmamentby artist Aso
Hideho is held at 8:30am, December 8th, in the Culture Hall of the Clinic
Building of NCKU Hospital, where President Michael Ming-Chiao Lai, Senior
Executive Vice-President Hwung-Hweng Hwung, Superintendent Pin-Wen Lin of NCKU
Hospital, Dean Chyi-Her Lin of College of Medicine, artist Aso Hideho and
creator Lin Shuen-Long from DADA Art, as well as teachers, students and
personnel from NCKU Hospital have attended the event.</P>
      <P>NCKU President Michael Ming-Chiao Lai expressed,I believe art can cultivate our
mind and change ones temperament. For the past few years, National Cheng Kung
University has undergone artistic transformation, and today, NCKU Hospital is
undergoing an artistic transformation as well. Patients who enter the hospital
need physical treatment and also psychological treatment. Thus, I believe it is
a wonderful thing that a piece of artwork can reside in a hospital. It is a
historical moment for National Cheng Kung University and a new milestone for the
Hospital.</P>
      <P>Superintendent Pin-Wen Lin of NCKU Hospital revealed,Many people have spared
time to attend this significant event and observe the public art work.Window of
Firmament,located at the top ceiling of the Culture Hall, can elevate space
aesthetics and urban environmental quality to reduce the gloominess and sadness
of the Hospital, without affecting the work space and the treatment operations.
In the future, I hope the Hospital can install a telescope for the visiting
guests, patients, colleagues as well as citizens to appreciate and observe the
beautiful piece of artwork in greater detail.</P>
      <P>Artist Aso Hideho said,I am extremely pleased to be here to observe my work with
all the guests. It has taken me about one year of efforts to get here, as I have
traveled back and forth between Japan and Taiwan for 9 times and stayed in
Taiwan for approximately 180 days. The artwork formed by La Mosaique and La
Fresque is the efforts of more than one thousand people, and I want to express
my gratitude particularly toward DADA Art.</P>
      <P>He stated,In the past, I have always completed my artwork from a compilation of
thoughts, but this time is different. When I explored NCKU Hospital one year
ago, the image of theWindow Firmamentalready appeared before my eyes.</P>
      <P>He further explained,The creative concept of a window slowly descending on the
land from the sky has always been on my mind, and this piece of artwork is one
of the realizations of my idea. The original semantics of the word La Mosaique
is the same as the word music. Ancient Greeks believed that besides stars, there
were also beautiful melodies in the sky. The shiny stars are small pieces of
work, representing colors and shapes, in La Mosaique, just like the notes which
compose melodies. Thus, La Mosaique has been considered a work to be presented
to the goddess.</P>
      <P>Aso Hideho added,Inheriting the classical vocabulary and re-performing in the
modern space, one can see dots of stars shining in the Window of Firmament.I
hope my work can trace back to the origin of life, remind people of the old
banyan trees most commonly seen in Tainan, the ancient capital, allow people to
experience the mysteries and wonders of the universe, and integrate into peoples
lives and bring new hope.</P>
      <P>TheWindow of Firmamentis a large dome with a circular arch, which is 10m in
diameter and 80cm in concave and made up of Glass Fiber Reinforced Cement as its
base, and it resembles a starry sky painted in constellation myths with marble
lines, hiding the origin of human life and capturing the hymns for human life.

      <P>Taiwan is continuing to negotiate with China on an investment protection
agreement with the goal of narrowing the remaining differences between the two
sides, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the talks have not been easy because the government needs to
ensure that the agreement is in line with internationally accepted practices,
takes into consideration the special status of cross-Taiwan Strait ties, and
meets the needs of Taiwanese investors in China.</P>
      <P>"We would rather be cautious than sign the agreement in haste, " said Shih.</P>
      <P>The failure to reach consensus has led the two sides to postpone the signing of
the deal, which was originally scheduled for the next meeting between the chief
negotiators on each side slated to take place later this month.</P>
      <P>The deadlock is mainly because of China's opposition to Taiwan's proposal to
have an international organization settle cross-strait investment disputes, out
of fear that cross-strait relations would be "internationalized" as a result.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to help flat panel makers after EU hands down fines</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) expressed concerns on Wednesday over
potential fines the European Commission could slap on several Taiwanese flat
panel makers for alleged price fixing and said the government would provide any
assistance necessary.</P>
      <P>Duh Tyzz-jiun,  director  general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau,
told the Central News Agency that as long as the accused companies needed
assistance when facing disciplinary action, the government would try its best to
help them.</P>
      <P>In July last year, the European Commission brought charges against four
Taiwanese firms -- Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., AU Optronics Corp. Chunghwa
Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. -- along with LG Display of South
Korea for price fixing.</P>
      <P>Samsung Electronics, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged since
it alerted the European Commission  to the price-fixing practices.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei merged with Innolux Display Corp. to form Chimei Innolux Corp. in March.</P>
      <P>The EU antitrust regulator accused these firms of violating EU laws through a
conspiracy to engage in unfair price fixing practices to hurt flat panel buyers
in the production of products such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital
watches and MP3 players.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is expected to issue a decision Wednesday against the
five manufacturers, which could face total fines ranging between 600 million
euros (US$801 million) and 700 million euros.</P>
      <P>Duh said the MOEA has made contact with the four local companies and offered its
help that will be based on the decision laid down by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>He said the companies have told the ministry they will carefully study the
decision and figure out the impact it will have on them.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar rose against the New Taiwan dollar Wednesday, gaining NT$0.076
to close at the day's high of NT$30.706.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$532 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.680 and moved to a low of NT$30.115 before
rebounding.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the U.S. dollar regained steam against other Asian currencies in
the region, in particular against the South Korean won, amid escalating tensions
on the Korean Peninsula after reports of an artillery drill by North Korea.</P>
      <P>The strength of the greenback in the region offset selling of the currency to
some extent in the Taiwan foreign exchange market, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar has been boosted by continued inflows of foreign funds,
prompting investors, in particular foreign banks, to buy into the local currency
while cutting their U.S.  dollar positions, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Foreign traders are betting that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will adopt
further measures to ease liquidity to boost the U.S. economy and that the
liquidity will spill over to the markets in Asia, including Taiwan, to shore up
the value of the New Taiwan dollar, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A stronger U.S. dollar in the region has made it easier for Taiwan's central
bank in its intervention efforts on the Taiwan foreign exchange market to boost
the U.S. dollar to above the NT$30.50 level.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's defense ministry on Wednesday denied a news report that it is exploring
the possibility of collaborating with Russia to build and acquire submarines to
boost the island's defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>"There is absolutely no such plan, " Vice Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang said
while fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's National Defense
and Foreign Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Next Magazine reported that a task force comprising
officials of the Navy and the CSBC Corp. Taiwan visited Russia in October to
discuss the possibility of collaborating with shipbuilders there to build
submarines for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Navy Command Headquarters also rebutted the report in a statement.</P>
      <P>"The Navy has no plans to acquire submarines from sources other than the United
States," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has been the biggest supplier of defense weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The administration of former U.S. President George W. Bush announced a robust
arms sale package to Taiwan in 2001, including eight conventional submarines,
but the submarine deal has yet to be substantiated.</P>
      <P>The Navy Command Headquarters said that the submarine procurement deal is being
screened by the U.S. Department of State and other related agencies and that it
will make every effort to prompt the U.S. authorities to speed up the sale of
the vessels to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has four submarines but only two of them -- the Swordfish
models purchased in 1980s from the Netherlands -- are in active service. The two
other, which have been in service since World War II, are used mainly for
training purposes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CSBC Corp Taiwan did not deny the reported trip to Russia but said
"it had nothing to do with the Navy."</P>
      <P>"No naval officers were part of the team that visited Russia last October for
business purposes, " said Ying Tze-hsiang, a ranking CSBC official who led the
delegation.</P>
      <P>Ying said the CSBC delegation was seeking to tap into business opportunities in
Russia on one hand and to try to strike technical cooperation deals with Russian
builders on the other.</P>
      <P>He explained that his corporation needs to expand its overseas market to cope
with the increasing competition from shipbuilders in South Korea, Japan and
China.</P>
      <P>In addition, CSBC plans to acquire Russian expertise in building ice-breaking
ships, as part of CSBC's efforts to meet increasing demand for transportation on
the route between the North Pole and Shanghai, China, Ying said.</P>
      <P>Besides, Russia, with its rich in marine resources, is in urgent need of
financial support to build fishing vessels -- another reason for the leading
Taiwan shipbuilder to consider partnerships with shipbuilders there, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's fruit and its food have become major attractions for Japanese students

      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second largest contract
chipmaker, said Wednesday it saw a slight drop in sales in November as a result
of the New Taiwan dollar's surge against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Last month, UMC posted NT$10.44 billion (US$347 million) in sales, down 2.43
percent from October, but 14.03 percent higher than the previous year.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, UMC's sales totaled NT$110.25 billion, up
38.99 percent year-on-year.</P>
      <P>However, in October, the foundry operator's sales fell 2.23 percent from
September to NT$10.7 billion on appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>"The export oriented electronic sector is sensitive to exchange rate changes,"
Horizon Securities analyst Benson Huang said.</P>
      <P>"The recent significant gains posted by the New Taiwan dollar against the
greenback has affected the revenue of many local high tech firms, and UMC is no
exception," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Since the end of August, the New Taiwan dollar has risen more than 4 percent
against the U.S. dollar as foreign funds continue to flow into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>UMC said if the New Taiwan dollar gains 1 percent against the U.S. dollar, its
quarterly sales can be expected to fall by 1 percent.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter of this year, UMC recorded NT$32.65 billion in sales, up
19.10 precent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>Huang forecast that UMC's sales in December will continue to be affected by the
foreign exchange factor unless the New Taiwan dollar turns weaker.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) chief defended his department's proposed
amendments to the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act Wednesday, saying that
even among single-person households, 30 percent of such households will have
lower national health insurance (NHI) premiums.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang made the statement to reporters after the
amendments failed to clear the legislative floor the previous day.</P>
      <P>Many lawmakers refused to endorse the amendment bill, which mainly involves a
new scheme for calculating premiums based on total household incomes instead of
personal salaries, until disputes over some controversial clauses have been
resolved.</P>
      <P>The disputes mostly focus on the new premium calculation formula and a plan to
calculate premiums based on so-called "presumed income" that is proposed to be
used for those who have no income records, such as dependent housewives.</P>
      <P>The idea of "presumed income" drew strong opposition from lawmakers of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , as well as from a handful of
ruling Kuomintang legislators, who argued that it is unreasonable to treat
people with no income as earners.</P>
      <P>Under the concept of "presumed income, " people without income records on their
annual tax reports will be charged an NHI premium calculated on the national
minimum wage of NT$17,880 (US$590) per month.</P>
      <P>The DPP and some civic groups have accused the concept of violating the spirit
of the planned new NHI system -- which is supposed to pursue social equality by
making the rich pay more to allow the poor to pay less.</P>
      <P>Yaung explained that statistics show nearly 40 percent of the population have no
income records. In fact some of these people have been found to have "hidden
incomes, " he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, under the DOH's preliminary calculation, some housewives without a
job will have even lower premiums than under the existing system, he added.</P>
      <P>Yaung said households can roughly calculate their new monthly NHI premiums by
multiplying their gross composite household income in 2009 by a roughly assessed
rate of 2.5 percent to 2.7 percent, and then dividing the result by 12.</P>
      <P>The DOH is considering setting up a telephone hotline to answer questions on the
second-generation NHI system, he added.</P>

      <P>Jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaopo, winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize,
will make what he calls his "last statement" titled: "I have no enemies" at the
Dec. 10 award ceremony, although he will be unable to attend in person, an
overseas friend of Liu said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Xu Wenli, an exiled Chinese dissident, told CNA that an American actor will read
the statement for the prisoner of conscience, as neither he nor his wife Liu Xia
will be allowed to accept the prize in the Norwegian capital of Oslo.</P>
      <P>In the statement, Liu Xiaopo says he has fulfilled a Chinese citizen's social
responsibility by carrying out his constitutionally protected right of freedom
of speech.</P>
      <P>Liu is serving an 11-year sentence after being convicted of sedition. His
"crime" is advocating freedom of speech and drafting a new Chinese constitution
that has been endorsed by many other Chinese intellectuals -- the so-called
"Charter 08."</P>
      <P>"What I have done is innocent. I have no complaints, even though I have been
accused [by the state],"   Xu quoted Liu's statement as saying.</P>
      <P>Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights; it is the basis of
human nature and the mother of truth. Suppressing freedom of speech is
tantamount to trampling on human rights, stifling human nature and oppressing
the truth, Liu says in the statement.</P>
      <P>He says hatred erodes a person's wisdom and conscience, and hostility poisons
the spirit. "Once a cruel, life-or-death struggle has been fanned, a society's
spirit of tolerance and human nature will be destroyed and a nation's progress
toward freedom and democracy will be hindered," he adds.</P>
      <P>Xu said the award ceremony will be held at 1 p.m. local time and that as no one
will be accepting the prize in person, "it is believed that a two-to-three-
minute silence will be observed before a foreign dignitary makes a speech."</P>
      <P>Xu, who himself was nominated for the prize in 1999, has been invited to witness
the award ceremony honoring Liu.</P>
      <P>Yang Jianli, another Chinese dissident currently living in the United States,
said he has been trying to help arrange for Liu Xia to attend on behalf of her
husband, but that the Chinese authorities will not allow her to go.</P>
      <P>"I'm sure no-one will accept the prize and that it -- along with the cash award
-- will likely be kept by the Nobel Prize Committee, " Yang said.</P>
      <P>Yang said he does not see any possibility of the Chinese government softening
its stance on this issue in the near future. But within one year, he predicted,
China will take a more conciliatory approach by putting Liu under house arrest
and incommunicado in the Beijing area rather than keeping him in jail.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan, another well-known Chinese dissident and a student leader during the
1989 Tiananmen protests, told CNA that if precedent is any indicator, Liu will
likely be sent abroad into exile "on medical grounds."</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese man, who spent eight years in the United Kingdom before returning
home, died earlier this year from what appeared to be mad-cow disease, the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The man, who was in the UK from 1978-1986, died in May 2010 at the  age of 36.
In 2008,  he began  to show  symptoms  of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) such
as memory loss and hypersomnia, and was reported as a suspected CJD case in
March 2009, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>However, the man's family refused to provide tissue for testing or to give
permission for an autopsy, therefore, it is difficult to confirm the cause of
his death, said CDC Deputy Director Lin Ting.</P>
      <P>"We cannot exclude this as a CJD case either," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Based on the patient's symptoms and his MRI and EEG records, a medical team has
determined this was an "extremely likely case" of CJD, the CDC said in a press
release.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, judging from the fact that the patient was studying in the UK
during the peak period of mad-cow disease there, his death could be counted as
an imported case of CJD that, however, will not pose any threat to Taiwan's
disease control network, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>Medically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, mad-cow disease
causes spongy holes in the brain. In people, a rare but fatal form of the
disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD) has been linked to
eating infected tissue from cows.</P>

      <P>A rare exhibition featuring the work of the prolific French novelist Honore De
Balzac will open at National Museum of Taiwan Literature in Tainan Dec. 15, the
organizers said Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The exhibition comprises more than 300 items borrowed from public and private
collections around the world in the largest ever Balzac display outside of
France, according to one of the organizers, Maison Balzac Director Yves Gagneux.</P>
      <P>It will be a very visual experience, for it not only displays many original
manuscripts written by Balzac, but also brings under a single roof a number of
paintings, sculptures, pictures, sketches and woodcuts created in tribute to the
famous 19th century writer and reveals much about his life, Gagneux said.</P>
      <P>Manuscripts by authors from the same period as Balzac, including George Sand,
Eugene Sue, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, will also be on display.</P>
      <P>Gagneux said Balzac, who wrote more than 120 novels before his death at the age
of 51, was an accomplished craftsman in his field.</P>
      <P>"To really understand Balzac, one has to understand the ideas of tradition and
innovation, because Balzac's work is a combination of the two," the director
said.</P>
      <P>Balzac's ability to blend realistic details, acute observation and visionary
imagination made him unrivaled in his time, he added.</P>
      <P>One of the items on display is the manuscript of "Illusions perdues, " written
by Balzac between 1837 and 1843, with a preface by Hugo.</P>
      <P>Gagneux said Balzac and Hugo had a cat-and-dog friendship. Balzac was fond of
Hugo's poems and theatrical works, but thought Hugo's novels were "not worth
mentioning," he said.</P>
      <P>The Balzac exhibition will be run at National Museum of Taiwan Literature until
Feb. 15 next year and at National Taiwan Museum in Taipei from March 3 to April
5, 2011.</P>

      <P>The mass production of two missile systems developed by Taiwan has been
proceeding smoothly, Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chao  was  referring  to  the  Hsiungfeng  IIE  (HF-2E) surface-to-surface
cruise missile system and Hsingfeng III supersonic anti-ship missile, both of
which were developed by the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and
Technology.</P>
      <P>During a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Defense Committee,
Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the ruling Kuomintang asked Chao about the production
of several indigenous weapon systems which is scheduled to peak in 2011.</P>
      <P>In response, Chao said the problems of acquiring key components for the
indigenous missile systems have been resolved and production is now going
smoothly as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Moreover, mass production of several new indigenous weapon systems, such as the
Leiting 2000 multiple rocket launcher, an unmanned aerial vehicle and the Yunpao
(Cloud Leopard) armored vehicle, will soon begin, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should negotiate with China to lift a ban on the employment of Republic
of China (Taiwan) nationals at UN-affiliated agencies as relations between the
two sides have improved recently, the former top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The People's Republic of China signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) that
barred the agencies from hiring people from Taiwan after it joined the United
Nations in 1971 by replacing the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name, said
Douglas Paal, who was director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) office
in Taipei until 2006.</P>
      <P>The AIT is the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"Why should that be the case now? " he said, referring to the 39-year-old ban in
an interview with the Central News Agency during a visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>His remarks came at a time when Taiwan enjoys a much warmer relationship with
China after Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Taiwan signed a pact with China earlier this year to further liberalize two-way
trade and has opened itself to more tourists from China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it remains difficult for Taiwan to take part in U.N.-related
activities due to Beijing's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Paal, who is now vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a Washington think-tank, suggested that Taiwan should try
to have the ban removed.</P>
      <P>"I am not asking for Taiwan to be officially represented, " he said. "But Taiwan
has lots of good people."</P>
      <P>Taiwanese people should be allowed to compete for jobs at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) , the International Energy Agency (IEA), the World Health
Organization (WHO) and others, he said.</P>
      <P>"Put people forward and have the SEF negotiate with China, getting rid of these
MOUs, " he said, referring to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-
official body charged with handling daily affairs with China.</P>
      <P>"Make a clear understanding [to China]. This will not be our effort to represent
ourselves. But we think we can play a role, " he added.</P>
      <P>With time, he said, Taiwan will become an "indispensable" part of the world that
way.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The introduction last month of a state-of-the-art multimedia physical treatment
center in Taipei called  Smart  Ambience  has taken  the drudgery  out of the
rehabilitation routine, according to some users.</P>
      <P>"I was amazed when I first set foot in the center, " said Liu Yu- yuan, a 51
-year-old mastectomy patient.</P>
      <P>The aesthetics include walls of aquariums with tropical fishes swimming around
and colorful bottles that are meant to produce a healing and calming effect on
the mind.</P>
      <P>The center offers six different rehabilitation training programs that feature
LEDs, sensors and newly developed software.</P>
      <P>Patients can go through a one-hour exercise routine that is based on high-end
computer technology and is tailored to individual needs, all free of charge.</P>
      <P>In the diaphragmatic breathing program, for example, a sensor band attached to
the patient tells the therapist whether or not the exercise is being done
correctly, said Chien Chu-chun, a nurse at the Taiwan Breast Cancer Foundation
(TBCF) that founded the center.</P>
      <P>"To help the patients relax, we have an overhead projector that displays videos
of a figure doing the breathing exercise in a forest to soft relaxing music,"
said Chien.</P>
      <P>The forest scene turns into a night sky with stars that brighten or dim
depending how deeply the patient breathes during the exercise, she said.</P>
      <P>Diaphragmatic breathing can calm the mind, Chien explained, adding that this is
a state most cancer patients find difficult to achieve.</P>
      <P>At the  center,  patients  can concentrate  fully  on the rehabilitation
routines since the space is used by one person at a time, with an assigned
therapist offering assistance, she said.</P>
      <P>"When I can't fall asleep at home, I would picture the forest and practice the
breathing method I learned here," said Liu. " Although I knew the breathing
method before, my technique was wrong. The therapist corrected me and
demonstrated it for me, which was nice and thoughtful."</P>
      <P>The center, a brainchild of TBCF and National Taiwan University's Graduate
Institute of Networking and Multimedia (GINM) , took two years to complete.</P>
      <P>Hung Yi-ping, a GINM professor and leading researcher, said that the biggest
challenge on the project was the synchronization and integration of all the
multimedia resources.</P>
      <P>"There was a lot of trial and error. Sometimes we had to toss out what we had
done and build something better,"said Hung.</P>
      <P>The project experience  was presented  at an international conference in Italy
last year, he said.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party on Wednesday accused the Ministry of

claiming that the newly launched national debt clock is "seriously delayed and
inaccurate."</P>
      <P>The MOF on Tuesday night officially launched the national debt clock, a web-

month.</P>
      <P>According to the figures released on the webpage, as of the end of November, the
nation's outstanding debt totaled NT$4.328 trillion (US$141 billion), and the
short-term loans stood at NT$235 billion -- meaning an average debt burden of
NT$197,000 for each citizen.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said that the information carried on the net is
false, because the hidden debt -- mainly debt incurred to cover deficits in
pensions programs for civil servants and social security programs -- is not
included in the government statistics.</P>
      <P>She said if the hidden debt were added, the average debt every citizen has to
shoulder would reach NT$900,000, four times more than the MOF debt clock
indicates.</P>
      <P>Lee Chun-yee, another DPP Legislator, criticized the MOF's debt clock as a
"seriously delayed, inaccurate clock, " saying the national debt has increased
dramatically since President Ma Ying-jeou was sworn into office on May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>The current debt to GDP ratio surged 4 percentage points to 34 percent, compared

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acer Inc. said Wednesday that it is set to launch netbooks running Google's
newly unveiled operating system, Google Chrome, in 2011.</P>
      <P>Acer's netbooks with the Chrome OS will be available in March or April next
year, company Chairman J.T. Wang told reporters on the sidelines of a conference
at which he was re-elected as chairman of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA).</P>
      <P>"There is still a demand for netbooks in developing countries despite the impact
of tablet computers," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that global shipments of netbooks will slide to 30-40 million units
in 2011, dropping from this year's 20 percent to 25 percent share of the
personal computer market to around 15 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Samsung Electronic Co. will also be using the Chrome OS, but it will
fall into a special category of a competitor with Acer, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Samsung will be a special case in the field because it is a brand vendor and
also a key component supplier to other brands, which makes it hard for the
company to manage customer relations, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said Acer will keep an eye on the business strategy of the South Korean-based
company now that it has a new general manager.</P>
      <P>The Chrome OS is designed to expand the use of the Chrome browser and web-based
services, according to Google.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Google unveiled a Chrome-based prototype notebook "CR-48"
used in a testing program for limited applicants, in a move to attract about 120
million active users of the Chrome browser.</P>
      <P>The all-black  notebook,  with a 12.1-inch  screen and 3G connectivity, does not
have a brand logo on it as part of Google's effort to strengthen its ties with
manufacturers, said Sean Lien, head of Google's business development division,
at a press briefing to introduce the product.</P>
      <P>"We will not launch Google-branded computers with the Chrome OS as manufacturers
can decide to install the system on any kind of device, including notebooks,
netbooks and tablets," he added.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the company is in contact with all Taiwanese original  equipment
manufacturers  (OEMs)  and original design manufacturers (ODMs), but he declined
to name any apart from Samsung and Acer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's democracy and emphasis on human rights are its most effective forms of
'soft power, ' and its adherence to these values will influence China positively
in the long run, Harvard professor Joseph Nye said in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan's democratic development and its efforts to achieve warmer
cross-strait ties in the past two years, the former Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Security Affairs said Taiwan is a model worthy of
emulation in Asia, particularly by China.</P>
      <P>"My feeling is that China is going to change and Taiwan can be part of that
change, " he said in a speech, describing Taiwan as a "success story."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's recent public call for Beijing to release Chinese
dissident and Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo is indicative of Ma's sound
leadership and his dedication to preserving Taiwan's democracy, Nye said.</P>
      <P>Comparing the current administration to the previous one under former President
Chen Shui-bian, Nye said that Taiwan-U.S. relations are in much better shape now
than before when some of the actions by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government,  such as a constitutional amendment, agitated Washington.</P>
      <P>He said that while U.S. arms sales would give Taiwan more bargaining chips in
its engagements with China, Taiwan's best defense is not a strong warfare
capability but rather its commitment to democratic values that are shared by the
American people.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to keep itself attractive to the U.S. by appealing to American
values, and a military solution would be a mistake, " he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Nye met with Ma at the Presidential Office where he lauded
the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) , a landmark trade pact
signed between Taiwan and China in June, as a crucial tool to ensuring Taiwan's
benefits.</P>
      <P>The agreement, coupled with Taiwan's steps to hone its military strength, is an
example of Taiwan exercising "smart power" to advance its interests, he said.</P>

      <P>Taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun will go to Seoul, South Korea next week to give
an explanation to the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) over her disputed
disqualification at a recent Asian Games event in Guangzhou, China, the Sports
Affairs Council (SAC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The SAC said in a press release that the WTF has already informed the Chinese
Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) of its decision to hold a disciplinary
committee meeting in Seoul on Dec. 18 over Yang's disqualification.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after Vice Premier Sean Chen called a task force meeting
the previous night with Yang, SAC Minister Tai Shia-ling, Sung Yao-ming, a
lawyer in charge of handling the case, and Liu Ching-wen, the chief referee of
the CTTA, according to the SAC.</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, was disqualified over allegations that she wore two extra electronic
sensors in her socks during her first-round bout in the Asiad women's taekwondo
under 49-kilogram division on Nov. 17, after having scored a 9-0 lead over her
Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>The incident created a shock wave around Taiwan as all video footage of the
match and witness accounts in a news conference sponsored by the Executive Yuan
showed that Yang had taken off the sensors before going into the ring.</P>
      <P>An online accusation against Yang by the Asian Taekwondo Union the following day
prompted Taiwan's sports and taekwondo authorities to file a complaint with the
Olympic Council of Asia. The sports council also threatened to appeal the case
to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to pursue justice for
the athlete if it is not fairly handled by the WTF.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that the Seoul meeting might result in
disciplinary measures against Yang, Tai said "we will collect all evidence,
favorable or unfavorable, and assess all possible scenarios in advance in a bid
to serve our best interests."</P>
      <P>At a news conference later Wednesday, SAC Vice Minister Steven S.K. Chen said
the council is prepared to bring the case to the CAS or take action via legal
channels if WTF comes up with a verdict that jeopardizes Yang's rights.</P>

      <P>In the aftermath of an election-eve shooting, Taiwan's major opposition party
said Wednesday it will take four ruling party lawmakers to court for slander and
intent to make opposition candidates lose votes.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, a spokesman for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said
that soon after the Nov. 26 shooting at a Kuomintang (KMT) campaign rally, Chiu
Yi, Lu Hsiu-yen and two other KMT legislators purposely tried to mislead the
public into thinking that the shooting of KMT Central Committee member Sean Lien
was somehow linked to the DPP.</P>
      <P>For example, KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng openly called on the electorate to "use
your ballots to reject violence," insinuating that the DPP was linked to the
shooting, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Wu's statements violated the criminal code on public insult and defamation, as
well as the election law which lays out penalties for those "intending to make
certain candidates fail in the elections, " said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his party has decided to file lawsuits against Chiu, Lu, Wu and Kuo
Su-chun on charges of breaching the criminal code and the election law.</P>
      <P>A DPP lawyer, Chang Tien-chin, said the party will file the lawsuits and then
decide whether to seek compensation or a public apology.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said his party had called for calm
immediately after the shooting incident and restrained its politicians from
making too many speculations.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Su said, "DPP has changed its statements so often that no one
knows what its position is regarding the shooting incident."</P>
      <P>"We did much more than the DPP" to minimize the effects of the incident on the
elections, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Wu denied the DPP charges, saying he simply called on the public to
remain calm and rational and to use their votes to reject violence.</P>
      <P>"I did not insinuate or suggest that the shooting may have been a political
assassination attempt, " he said. "The DPP should not make that claim."</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun said that the opposition party is not broad-minded enough to accept
its defeat in the election and she would gladly "play the DPP's legal game to
the end."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Sean Lien,  who was shot in the face at the election-eve rally, said
he cannot accept the suspect's statement of "having misidentified the target."</P>
      <P>Through his special assistant Hsu Hung-ting, Lien said he is more eager than
anyone else to help clear up the truth about the shooting.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that in the coming days, Lien will likely explain in person how he felt
about being shot on the night before the election.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. of Taiwan said Wednesday night that it will appeal a European
Commission decision to slap heavy fines on it and three other Taiwanese flat
panel makers and a South Korean manufacturer for allegedly fixing prices on the
EU market.</P>
      <P>AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar
Display Corp. were fined a total of 433.92 million euro (some NT$17.3 billion)
for violating EU's competition rules and trying to hide their "law-breaking
behavior."</P>
      <P>An AUO spokesman said it has cooperated with EU authorities over the past four
years in their investigation into industry practices regarding the production
and marketing of TFT-LCD products.</P>
      <P>The company, which was fined 116.8 million euro, has decided to file an appeal
with the General Court in Luxemburg and vigorously defend its business
practices, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei and Chunghwa said they are taking a closer look at the EU decision
before taking their next steps. A Chi Mei executive said the fine on his
company, 300 million euro, is "really too harsh." Chunghua was fined 9.02
million euro.</P>
      <P>HannStar Display Corp., which got a fine of 8.1 million euro, would not comment
on the EC action.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the Taiwanese manufacturers are not making big profits and
the fines are "simply too heavy."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the government would provide all
necessary assistance to the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Duh Tyzz-jiun,  director  general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau,
told the Central News Agency that as long as the accused companies need
assistance when facing disciplinary action, the government would try its best to
help them.</P>
      <P>Duh and other economics officials admitted the heavy fines will have impacts on
Taiwan's flat panel industry.</P>
      <P>LG Display of South Korea was also on the hitting list, being given a 215
million euro fine.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acer, Samsung to launch netbooks with Google Chrome OS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Acer Inc. said Wednesday that it is set to launch netbooks running Google's
newly unveiled operating system, Google Chrome, in 2011.</P>
      <P>Acer's netbooks with the Chrome OS will be available in March or April next
year, company Chairman J.T. Wang told reporters on the sidelines of a conference
at which he was re-elected as chairman of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA).</P>
      <P>"There is still a demand for netbooks in developing countries despite the impact
of tablet computers," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that global shipments of netbooks will slide to 30-40 million units
in 2011, dropping from this year's 20 percent to 25 percent share of the
personal computer market to around 15 percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Samsung Electronic Co. will also be using the Chrome OS, but it will
fall into a special category of a competitor with Acer, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Samsung will be a special case in the field because it is a brand vendor and
also a key component supplier to other brands, which makes it hard for the
company to manage customer relations, " Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said Acer will keep an eye on the business strategy of the South Korean-based
company now that it has a new general manager.</P>
      <P>The Chrome OS is designed to expand the use of the Chrome browser and web-based
services, according to Google.</P>
      <P>Earlier Wednesday, Google unveiled a Chrome-based prototype notebook "CR-48"
used in a testing program for limited applicants, in a move to attract about 120
million active users of the Chrome browser.</P>
      <P>The all-black  notebook,  with a 12.1-inch  screen and 3G connectivity, does not
have a brand logo on it as part of Google's effort to strengthen its ties with
manufacturers, said Sean Lien, head of Google's business development division,
at a press briefing to introduce the product.</P>
      <P>"We will not launch Google-branded computers with the Chrome OS as manufacturers
can decide to install the system on any kind of device, including notebooks,
netbooks and tablets," he added.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the company is in contact with all Taiwanese original  equipment
manufacturers  (OEMs)  and original design manufacturers (ODMs), but he declined
to name any apart from Samsung and Acer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Democracy is Taiwan's best form of 'soft power': U.S. scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's democracy and emphasis on human rights are its most effective forms of
'soft power, ' and its adherence to these values will influence China positively
in the long run, Harvard professor Joseph Nye said in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Praising Taiwan's democratic development and its efforts to achieve warmer
cross-strait ties in the past two years, the former Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Security Affairs said Taiwan is a model worthy of
emulation in Asia, particularly by China.</P>
      <P>"My feeling is that China is going to change and Taiwan can be part of that
change, " he said in a speech, describing Taiwan as a "success story."</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's recent public call for Beijing to release Chinese
dissident and Nobel Prize winner Liu Xiaobo is indicative of Ma's sound
leadership and his dedication to preserving Taiwan's democracy, Nye said.</P>
      <P>Comparing the current administration to the previous one under former President
Chen Shui-bian, Nye said that Taiwan-U.S. relations are in much better shape now
than before when some of the actions by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government,  such as a constitutional amendment, agitated Washington.</P>
      <P>He said that while U.S. arms sales would give Taiwan more bargaining chips in
its engagements with China, Taiwan's best defense is not a strong warfare
capability but rather its commitment to democratic values that are shared by the
American people.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to keep itself attractive to the U.S. by appealing to American
values, and a military solution would be a mistake, " he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Nye met with Ma at the Presidential Office where he lauded
the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) , a landmark trade pact
signed between Taiwan and China in June, as a crucial tool to ensuring Taiwan's
benefits.</P>
      <P>The agreement, coupled with Taiwan's steps to hone its military strength, is an
example of Taiwan exercising "smart power" to advance its interests, he said.</P>

      <P>Taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun will go to Seoul, South Korea next week to give
an explanation to the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) over her disputed
disqualification at a recent Asian Games event in Guangzhou, China, the Sports
Affairs Council (SAC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The SAC said in a press release that the WTF has already informed the Chinese
Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) of its decision to hold a disciplinary
committee meeting in Seoul on Dec. 18 over Yang's disqualification.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after Vice Premier Sean Chen called a task force meeting
the previous night with Yang, SAC Minister Tai Shia-ling, Sung Yao-ming, a
lawyer in charge of handling the case, and Liu Ching-wen, the chief referee of
the CTTA, according to the SAC.</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, was disqualified over allegations that she wore two extra electronic
sensors in her socks during her first-round bout in the Asiad women's taekwondo
under 49-kilogram division on Nov. 17, after having scored a 9-0 lead over her
Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>The incident created a shock wave around Taiwan as all video footage of the
match and witness accounts in a news conference sponsored by the Executive Yuan
showed that Yang had taken off the sensors before going into the ring.</P>
      <P>An online accusation against Yang by the Asian Taekwondo Union the following day
prompted Taiwan's sports and taekwondo authorities to file a complaint with the
Olympic Council of Asia. The sports council also threatened to appeal the case
to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to pursue justice for
the athlete if it is not fairly handled by the WTF.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that the Seoul meeting might result in
disciplinary measures against Yang, Tai said "we will collect all evidence,
favorable or unfavorable, and assess all possible scenarios in advance in a bid
to serve our best interests."</P>
      <P>At a news conference later Wednesday, SAC Vice Minister Steven S.K. Chen said
the council is prepared to bring the case to the CAS or take action via legal
channels if WTF comes up with a verdict that jeopardizes Yang's rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP to sue four KMT lawmakers on charges of breaking election law</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the aftermath of an election-eve shooting, Taiwan's major opposition party
said Wednesday it will take four ruling party lawmakers to court for slander and
intent to make opposition candidates lose votes.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, a spokesman for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said
that soon after the Nov. 26 shooting at a Kuomintang (KMT) campaign rally, Chiu
Yi, Lu Hsiu-yen and two other KMT legislators purposely tried to mislead the
public into thinking that the shooting of KMT Central Committee member Sean Lien
was somehow linked to the DPP.</P>
      <P>For example, KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng openly called on the electorate to "use
your ballots to reject violence," insinuating that the DPP was linked to the
shooting, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Wu's statements violated the criminal code on public insult and defamation, as
well as the election law which lays out penalties for those "intending to make
certain candidates fail in the elections, " said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>Tsai said his party has decided to file lawsuits against Chiu, Lu, Wu and Kuo
Su-chun on charges of breaching the criminal code and the election law.</P>
      <P>A DPP lawyer, Chang Tien-chin, said the party will file the lawsuits and then
decide whether to seek compensation or a public apology.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said his party had called for calm
immediately after the shooting incident and restrained its politicians from
making too many speculations.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Su said, "DPP has changed its statements so often that no one
knows what its position is regarding the shooting incident."</P>
      <P>"We did much more than the DPP" to minimize the effects of the incident on the
elections, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Wu denied the DPP charges, saying he simply called on the public to
remain calm and rational and to use their votes to reject violence.</P>
      <P>"I did not insinuate or suggest that the shooting may have been a political
assassination attempt, " he said. "The DPP should not make that claim."</P>
      <P>Kuo Su-chun said that the opposition party is not broad-minded enough to accept
its defeat in the election and she would gladly "play the DPP's legal game to
the end."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Sean Lien,  who was shot in the face at the election-eve rally, said
he cannot accept the suspect's statement of "having misidentified the target."</P>
      <P>Through his special assistant Hsu Hung-ting, Lien said he is more eager than
anyone else to help clear up the truth about the shooting.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that in the coming days, Lien will likely explain in person how he felt
about being shot on the night before the election.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. of Taiwan said Wednesday night that it will appeal a European
Commission decision to slap heavy fines on it and three other Taiwanese flat
panel makers and a South Korean manufacturer for allegedly fixing prices on the
EU market.</P>
      <P>AUO, Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar
Display Corp. were fined a total of 433.92 million euro (some NT$17.3 billion)
for violating EU's competition rules and trying to hide their "law-breaking
behavior."</P>
      <P>An AUO spokesman said it has cooperated with EU authorities over the past four
years in their investigation into industry practices regarding the production
and marketing of TFT-LCD products.</P>
      <P>The company, which was fined 116.8 million euro, has decided to file an appeal
with the General Court in Luxemburg and vigorously defend its business
practices, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei and Chunghwa said they are taking a closer look at the EU decision
before taking their next steps. A Chi Mei executive said the fine on his
company, 300 million euro, is "really too harsh." Chunghua was fined 9.02
million euro.</P>
      <P>HannStar Display Corp., which got a fine of 8.1 million euro, would not comment
on the EC action.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the Taiwanese manufacturers are not making big profits and
the fines are "simply too heavy."</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said the government would provide all
necessary assistance to the manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Duh Tyzz-jiun,  director  general of the MOEA's Industrial Development Bureau,
told the Central News Agency that as long as the accused companies need
assistance when facing disciplinary action, the government would try its best to
help them.</P>
      <P>Duh and other economics officials admitted the heavy fines will have impacts on
Taiwan's flat panel industry.</P>
      <P>LG Display of South Korea was also on the hitting list, being given a 215
million euro fine.</P>
      <P>Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the world's largest flat panel maker, was
not charged since it alerted the European Commission to the price-fixing
practices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Pay hikes for civil servants</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/09/10  11:57:04
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth for 2010 is forecast to rise to 9.98 percent, the
highest since 1987. However, the vast majority of people, whose main source of
income is salaries, have not benefited from this economic growth because
salaries have only risen by an average 0.78 percent per year over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>That's why the issue of hiking pay for civil servants has come up once again.
Supporters of the proposal believe that hiking salaries would allow government
employees to enjoy the fruits of economic growth and encourage the private
sector to raise the pay of its workers as well.</P>
      <P>It is also believed that adjusting the pay of civil servants would prevent the
country's wealth disparity from widening further and stimulate private
consumption.</P>
      <P>A 3 percent rise in the salaries of civil servants is likely to increase the
government's expenditure by NT$21 billion a year. However, this would not exert
much financial pressure on the government because revenues are expected to rise
as the economy recovers.</P>
      <P>The government should stop making excuses for not going ahead with the plan and
should think about the intangible benefits that could be created by hiking
employee salaries. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 9, 2010)</P>

      <P>Even after two weeks, little progress has been made in the investigation into
the election-eve shooting of Kuomintang politician Sean Lien, despite the fact
that the gunman had been arrested quickly. Indeed, during this time,
speculation and conspiracy theories have only continued to grow.</P>

prey to such vicious speculation.</P>

reasoning, yet both the green and blue camps have kept encouraging unfounded
theories in a vicious manner.</P>
      <P>If this situation continues, even a simple incident of public disorder could
quickly turn into a political issue. The way things are going, even if the case
is eventually resolved, we believe that there will be many skeptics.
Unfortunately, this will not bring true justice for the victims and neither will
it help in regaining public confidence in Taiwan's democracy and social order.

HannStar Display Corp. was 8.1 million euros.</P>
      <P>A Chimei Innolux executive said the punishment was "really too harsh."</P>
      <P>"Yes, the fine is heavy. That's why investors rushed to dump their Chimei
Innolux shares this morning, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst Jeff Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux said it will take a close look at the EU decision before deciding
how to react to the punishment.</P>
      <P>"If Chimei Innolux decides to assign a provision in the fourth quarter to cover
the loss from the fine, I expect the impact on its bottom line cannot be
ignored," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said the fine could cut the company's earnings per share by NT$1.64 for
2010.</P>
      <P>The analyst had previously expected the company would post an EPS at NT$0.4 and
the fine could make Chimei Innolux post a loss per share at NT$1.24.</P>
      <P>For AU Optronics, Chang said the fine is expected to cut the company's EPS to
NT$0.98 for 2010 from the previously estimated NT$1.50 if it also assigns a
provision to cover the fine in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>However, AUO has said it will file an appeal with the General Court in Luxemburg
and vigorously defend its business practices.</P>
      <P>AUO shares fell 1.79 percent to NT$30.25 in Thursday morning trade.</P>
      <P>For Chunghwa Picture Tubes and HannStar Display, the impact on their bottom
lines could be limited due to the relatively small amounts of fines, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The European Commission also slapped a fine of 215 million euros on LG Display
of South Korea for the same accusation.</P>

      <P>Preparatory talks for the sixth high-level cross-Taiwan Strait meeting will be
held in Shanghai Dec. 14, a senior Taiwanese negotiator with China said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Shanghai talks will set the date, venue and agenda for the new round of
institutionalized high-level cross-strait talks to be held in Taipei in the
second half of this month, " said Kao Koong-lian,  deputy  chairman  and
secretary-general  of  the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>As in the past, Kao will head the Taiwanese delegation to the Shanghai
preparatory talks with its Chinese counterpart to be led by Zheng Lichong, vice
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Interior Affairs Committee, Kao
said that the main agenda for the sixth round of cross-strait meeting between
SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin will be signing a
bilateral medical cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>Through  five  rounds  of  intensive  negotiations  between working-level
officials, Kao said, the two sides have reached consensus on key provisions of
the medical cooperation pact.</P>
      <P>As to a proposed cross-strait investment protection agreement, it will be
excluded from the agenda for the sixth round of "Chiang-Chen meeting" because
the two sides have yet to come to terms on certain clauses, Kao said.</P>
      <P>"The investment protection accord covers many complicated issues on which we
need more time to hammer out an investment dispute solution mechanism, "he
explained, adding that both sides have agreed not to seal the pact at the
upcoming round of Chiang-Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>The exact date for the sixth Chiang-Chen meeting will be announced at the end of
the Shanghai preparatory talks next Tuesday, Kao added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said at the same
occasion that it was a common decision not to sign the investment protection
agreement at the sixth Chiang-Chen meeting.</P>
      <P>She denied speculations that talks in this aspect were hindered by a sovereignty
dispute, saying arbitration of investment disputes does not involve sovereignty
issues.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the snag mainly lies in protection of the safety of Taiwanese
businessmen  operating in China and their dependents, compensation for property
expropriation and technical details regarding the dispute settlement mechanism.</P>
      <P>"Some of these issues involve different legal provisions of our two sides which
need more time to address, " Lai noted, adding that the MAC hopes globally
applicable standards will be adopted to better protect the rights and interests
of Taiwanese investors in China.</P>
      <P>"In cross-strait talks, any deal or agreement to be sealed with China must meet
our interests and expectations, " Lai assured lawmakers.</P>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency (NIA) said Thursday it has cracked a counterfeit
ring that was producing almost flawless identification cards for illegal foreign
workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ring is probably the country's largest fake identification syndicate
targeting runaway foreign workers as its clientele, the NIA said. It was cracked
after more than five months of investigation, and should help cut down on the
incidence of runaways in Taiwan, NIA officials said.</P>
      <P>In a joint operation launched by the NIA and police early Thursday, 15 suspects
were arrested at various locations in Taipei City, Taipei County, Hsinchu County
and Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>Computers,  printers and thousands of completed and partly completed fake Alien
Resident Certificates, work permits and national health insurance cards were
seized.</P>
      <P>The lead suspect, identified by his surnamed Hsiao, told police that the fake
documents were intended for sale to labor brokers, insurance agents,  foreign
workers,  and contractors  of major construction projects where foreign labor
might be needed.</P>
      <P>Hsiao was also found to have set up a dormitory to hide and control runaway
foreign workers, the NIA said.</P>
      <P>Official statistics show that there are around 34,000 runaway foreign workers in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The issue has drawn much attention in the wake of the deaths of six illegal
foreign workers in an accident at a construction site on the No. 6 Freeway on
Sept. 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Despite China's rise, it must not underestimate U.S.: expert</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's booming economy and military strength has dramatically expanded its
clout in Asia but its rise will not threaten U.S. influence in the region,
particularly in the short term, Douglas Paal, an expert on U.S.-Asia relations,
said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the 39th Taiwan-American Conference on Contemporary China, Paal said
Beijing should not underestimate the resilience of the U.S. or assume that the
world will sit idly by as China continues to profit from a heavily subsidized
market share.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, Paal said China's fast growing
prowess on all fronts has already "ended the sanctuary status of the Western
Pacific, which the U.S. enjoyed for the previous six decades."</P>
      <P>Beijing's bullish growth brings to the fore the question of whether the U.S.'
partners in the region can trust Washington's ability to deliver the right
forces, at the right time, to deter or defeat aggression, Paal said.</P>
      <P>"For the near term, the answer is clearly yes. Just look at the scale and
intensity of the recent exercises conducted with South Korea and Japan," he
said,  adding that these events have reinforced alliances that had been wobbling
in the last few years.</P>
      <P>The joint foreign ministers meeting that took place on Monday and was attended
by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Japan's Seiji Maehara, and Kim Sung-
hwan of South Korea is another example of firmly anchored ties, Paal said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Obama administration is now engaged in quiet "strategic
rebalancing" as it gradually extracts itself from the Middle East, and is
relocating resources to the Pacific because it recognizes the growing strength
of the region, Paal said.</P>
      <P>Paal however, was cautiously optimistic about Washington's grip on the region in
the long term.</P>
      <P>"My honest answer to the question of U.S. sustainability has to be, I don't
know, but don't be too quick to count the U.S. out, " he said.</P>
      <P>After two exhaustive wars, it would be "unsurprising if Americans were to turn
to a more non-interventionist foreign policy," he said.</P>
      <P>Paal recounted the history of the U.S.' success in bouncing back from different
political and financial  setbacks in the past, stressing that despite the
current global economic woes, there are grounds to be optimistic that Washington
will do the same again.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. still has the competitive advantage in innovation, demographics,
technology savvy, quality universities, a diverse and enterprising population
and a Constitution that abhors and punishes failure," he said. "Massive
correctives have already been applied to industries that engaged in the excess
in the past decades."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, while China is becoming a top investor, practices such as
distorting pricing in the global marketplace are not welcome, Paal said.</P>
      <P>"In my view, China has a worrisomely premature sense that its moment of destiny
has arrived. It underestimates the U.S. and fails to see that underestimation
may also be premature," he said.</P>
      <P>China may think now is the moment to secure its interests, but it lacks the
strength to succeed through direct confrontation, he said.</P>
      <P>And "if it waits for a few years to build its strength, it may discover that the
U.S. is back, and a tougher potential adversary, " Paal said.</P>
      <P>If Beijing thinks the world will sit by and permit market share to be taken by a
heavily subsidized China, without resistance, "it is likely to be surprised,
sooner rather than later," he said.</P>
      <P>Paal served as the director of the American Institute in Taiwan, Taipei Office,
from 2002 to 2006. He now is the vice-president for studies at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will toughen the penalties for illegal labor
brokering, as part of its effort to resolve the problem of runaway foreign
workers, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At present, the maximum fine for the brokering of illegal workers is NT$500,000,
and repeat offenders within a five year period could be sentenced to one year in
jail and a fine of up to NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>The CLA is planning to raise the maximum fine for the first offense to NT$1.5
million, and for repeat offenses to a maximum prison term of five years and a
fine of up to NT$2.4 million, said Tsai Meng-liang, chief of the foreign workers
management division at the CLA's Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training.</P>
      <P>As to measures targeting the more than 1,000 registered labor brokers in the
country, brokers will have their license revoked if it is found that there is an
excessively high runaway rate among the workers they bring in, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He added that the government believes brokers must take major responsibility for
the problem of runaways because brokers are the suppliers of foreign labor.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to the National Immigration Agency's recent
crackdown on a fake identification ring that targeted runaway foreign workers as
its clientele.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics show that there are around 34,000 runaway foreign workers in
Taiwan. The issue has drawn much attention in the wake of the Sept. 6 deaths of
six runaway foreign workers, who were illegally employed at a construction site

      <P>Taiwan has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the
case of the disqualification of taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun at the 2010
Asian Games, sports authorities said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) , via a law firm, filed the appeal Wednesday
with the CAS, which is based Lausanne, Switzerland, asking for an arbitration in
the matter of Yang's controversial dismissal from the women's under 49-kilogram
division at the Asiad in Guangzhou, China on Nov. 17, said SAC Minister Tai
Shia-ling.</P>
      <P>The appeal was filed by Lee and Li Attorneys-at-Law on behalf of the council,
which fears it would be too late if Taiwan waited until after Dec. 18, the date
when the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) is expected to convene a disciplinary
committee meeting in Seoul to discuss Yang's case.</P>
      <P>According to SAC officials, Taiwan could withdraw the arbitration appeal if the
WTF issues an acceptable statement after its Dec. 18 meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan will proceed with the case in the international court if the WTF
comes up any statements that would jeopardize Yang's rights, SAC officials said.</P>
      <P>Yang, who was one Taiwan's main contenders for a gold medal at the Asian Games,
was disqualified during her opening bout of the tournament for allegedly wearing
extra sensors in her socks in an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match, which was released later, showed that Yang was not
wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations by WTF and Asian
Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials of why Yang was disqualified have added to the
controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
but also vowed to take the case to the Court of Arbitration  for Sport if other
appeals failed to provide  a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that the Seoul meeting might result in
disciplinary measures against Yang, Tai said "we will collect all evidence,
favorable or unfavorable, and assess all possible scenarios in advance, in an
effort to protect our best interests."</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.57 percent Thursday as buying rotated to the
high-tech sector after its recent consolidation, boosting the index to a
30-month high, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 50.05 points to 8,753.84, the highest level since May
27, 2008, after moving between 8,736.77 and 8,782.82, on turnover of NT$159.63
billion (US$5.29 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.79 percent and moved to the day's high as buying focused
on integrated circuit (IC) stocks on optimism over their earnings outlook in
2011, but profit taking set in to compromise the gains, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,227 stocks closed up and 1,944 down, while 383 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronic sector scored the highest gains, rising 0.9
percent. Financial stocks gained 0.4 percent, and plastics and chemical stocks
added 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the construction and foodstuff sectors fell 1.0 percent, the textile
sector shed 0.7 percent and the paper and pulp sector lost 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's
largest contract chipmaker, said sales of the global foundry business in 2011 is
expected to rise 14 percent from 2010.</P>
      <P>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose almost 1 percent overnight in the U.S.
market.</P>
      <P>"Sentiment toward the IC sector improved, so interest rotated to the bellwether
electronic sector to push the index higher, " Hua Nan Securities analyst Henry
Miao said.</P>
      <P>TSMC  rose  2.94  percent  to NT$70.00  and rival  United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) increased 3.73 percent to NT$16.70.</P>
      <P>"Today's gains remained liquidity-driven as many investors tended to park their
funds in safe havens," Miao said.</P>
      <P>However, as the market moved closer to 8,800 points, investors tended to pocket
their gains, which limited the upside, Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said profit was concentrated in the old economy sector, which had been
significantly boosted by a rising New Taiwan dollar, on hopes that the value of
their domestic assets would rise accordingly.</P>
      <P>Among  the old economy  stocks,  food maker  Uni-President Enterprises fell 1.15
percent to NT$43.10 and Cathay Real Estate dropped 1.13 percent to NT$17.35.</P>

      <P>Small and medium-sized hotels in northern Taiwan, where Chinese tour groups
usually base themselves, and their neighboring shops, are forecast to see a
further business boom upon the anticipated opening to independent tourists from
China, according to a local real estate broker.</P>
      <P>Unrestricted by the constraints of traveling in tour groups, individual Chinese
travelers can move around Taiwan more freely, which will help boost business for
shops and malls near the hotels in which they stay, said Bright Lee, Evertrust
Rehouse Co. company communications manager.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese nationals can only visit Taiwan as part of a tour group.
Chinese business travelers from Shanghai and Beijing could be the first group to
be allowed to visit the country on their own in the first quarter of 2011 at the
earliest, the local media has reported. Details regarding the exact date of
opening and the cap on the number of visitors are still under discussion.</P>
      <P>The hotels in Taipei that focus on receiving Chinese tour groups are very likely
to maintain their business once individual tourists come, because their names
are already known to travel agencies and travelers from China, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, hotels in Taoyuan, the site of Taiwan's main international
airport, have been a top choice for Chinese tour groups since the country opened
its doors to Chinese visitors in 2008.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taoyuan's convenient location, the lower hotel prices are also a
reason for its popularity, Lee said.</P>
      <P>A total of 135,334 Chinese visitors stayed at hotels in a special art and
culture district of Taoyuan in the first nine months of the year, the largest
number of all the hotels in Taiwan, Lee went on, citing statistics released by
the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>Hotels in Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli in northern Taiwan saw the biggest surge
in the number of visitors from China, Lee added.</P>
      <P>In a related development, meanwhile, direct flights between Taipei International
Airport and Hefei Luogang International Airport in China's Anhui Province began
operating Dec. 7, which is expected to further benefit commercial districts
around the airport in downtown Taipei, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The number of travelers to Taiwan in the first eleven months of this year
reached 5 million, up 27 percent from a year earlier, according to statistics.</P>
      <P>More than 1.34 million Chinese nationals visited Taiwan in the first 10 months
of 2010, making China surpass Japan as the country's biggest source of visitors.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/09/10  18:06:59
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Historica terminated an Internet poll Wednesday to select the 100 most
influential figures in the history of the Republic of China after the campaign
drew criticism from lawmakers and military officials.</P>
      <P>In addition to celebrating the ROC's 100th founding anniversary in 2011, the
activity was also aimed at enhancing local people's interest in history, said
Academia Historica Director Lin Man-houng.</P>
      <P>The program, however, came under fire due to its poor planning and the inclusion
of some highly controversial figures on its candidate list.</P>
      <P>For instance, the institute-selected candidates included Mao Zedong and Deng
Xiaoping -- top leaders of the Communist Party of China, which defeated Taiwan's
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) in a bloody civil war in China in the 1940s and forced
the KMT-led ROC government to retreat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Critics said the biggest flop lies in the institute's failure to uphold the
principle of picking candidates who had contributed to the ROC's cause of
bringing democracy and prosperity to its people.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the event:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The controversy came to light Wednesday when KMT Legislator Justin Chou asked
Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting
about the propriety of listing Deng in the military category for the top 100
influential figures in ROC history.</P>
      <P>In response, Chao said the listing was absolutely inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Academia Hisotrica Deputy Director Chu Chung-sheng, previously said that Deng
was chosen because, during the War of Resistance against Japan, he lead areas of
resitance behind enemy lines in northern China, which qualified him for the
title.</P>
      <P>But shortly after Chao's criticism, Academia Historica removed Deng and Mao from
the online list. Before their removal, Mao ranked No. 3 in the category of
political leaders, ahead of his longtime enemy -- the late ROC President and KMT
leader Chiang Kai-shek, while Deng ranked first as the most influential figure
in the military category with 90 votes.</P>
      <P>The website carrying the poll was shut down later that day. Presidential Office
sources said President Ma Ying-jeou ordered the closure. Academia Historica is
under the direct jurisdiction of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Ma was very concerned about the controversy and demanded the institution deal
seriously with the matter, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Academia Historica said in a press statement that the online poll was flawed and
was therefore closed.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely apologize for any controversy caused by the voting program," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, the list of candidates was decided by a panel of Academia
Historica experts. Only ROC citizens who died before 2010 are qualified for
listing. The panel chose 100 candidates in eight categories -- politics,
military, finance and economy, diplomacy, social service, religion, academic,
and arts and literature.</P>
      <P>The candidates comprise 40 figures famous during the ROC's years in China and 60
prominent figures during its years in Taiwan. (Dec. 9, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Hsueh Hua-yuan, a professor at National Chengchi University's Graduate Institute
of Taiwan History, noted that when the ROC was established in 1911, Taiwan was
under Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>As the KMT-dominated ROC government moved its seat to Taiwan from China in 1949
after being defeated by the Chinese communists, Hsueh said, it is understandable
that Academia Historica included pre-1949 communist figures in the list.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsiao-feng,  a professor at the Graduate Institute of Taiwanese Culture at
National Taipei University  of Education, however, said the inclusion of
communist figures was absurd.</P>
      <P>"Academia Historica's move serves only to highlight its lack of Taiwan
identity," he added. (Dec. 9, 2010).</P>

percent in August 2009 to 4.92 percent in October this year, Ma said, adding
that this shows that the economic rebound has gained greater strength.</P>
      <P>Wu said in March that he would resign if he failed to bring down the
unemployment rate to below 5 percent before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The public should be able to enjoy the fruits of the economic recovery next
year, as "this year was a year of investment, which will be followed by a year
of consumption," according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Consumer Price Index is also the lowest and most stable among the four
"Asian Tigers" even though the unemployment rate is the highest, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Directorate  General of Budget,  Accounting and Statistics
forecasted that Taiwan's economic growth would reach 9.98 percent for the whole
of 2010, the highest in nearly 21 years, while per capita GNP (gross national
product) is expected to exceed US$20,000 next year for the first time in
history.</P>
      <P>Wu said Thursday that attracting foreign investors is a long- term effort that
could create even more jobs and that Taiwan will focus on improving its soft
power and hardware facilities to build a better investment environment.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is considering imposing different tax rates on
residential properties based on their value, in an effort to narrow the widening
gap between the rich and the poor, FInance Minister Lee Sush-der said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOF is planning to have home values assessed every year instead
of every three years as is currently the case, Lee said in a report to the
Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee.</P>
      <P>Under the existing House Tax Act, the tax rate -- which currently stands at 1.2
percent -- applies to all residential properties regardless of their value. The
change will be intended to subject high-price housing to higher tax rates than
average-value homes.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ministry is also seeking to amend the Land Tax Act to forbid
married couples and their adult children to register their dwellings at
different addresses.</P>
      <P>This is aimed at preventing people who own more than one home from using the
method to take advantage of the preferential 0.2 percent land tax rate on
property for self-residing purposes, Lee explained.</P>

      <P>A pro-China group, composed mainly of restaurateurs in Norway, will stage a
protest in that country to show their disapproval of the Nobel Prize Committee's
decision to honor a leading Chinese dissident with this year's Peace Prize,
according to a Voice of America report Thursday.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the award ceremony, more and more voices are being heard in
support of Liu Xiaopo, the dissident who has been imprisoned in China for
demanding freedom of expression in the communist country, VOA reported.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, the Chinese Association in Norway is planning a march in
Oslo on Dec. 10 in protest against the Nobel Peace Prize Committee's decision,
VOA said.</P>
      <P>The members of the association  are mostly people in the restaurant business
who, according to the association's president Yuan Yaming, "did not know who Liu
Xiaopo was when his name was announced as the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace
Prize."</P>
      <P>"When we found out who he was from the Web, we disapproved of his ideas and
proposals," Yuan was quoted by the VOA as saying.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Amnesty International workers as saying Beijing has been
pressuring Yuan's group to stage a protest rally on the day of the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Although Liu's seat will be empty at the Nobel Prize ceremony, ambassadors from
more than 20 countries, including Russia, will boycott the occasion at the
request of -- or under pressure from -- China.</P>
      <P>China has done its best to limit media exposure of Friday's award ceremony  and
the possible  effects  of the event on China's international image.</P>
      <P>According to Ming Pao Daily News of Hong Kong, at least 722 people were
arrested, put under house arrest or banned from leaving China because they had
voiced support for Liu.</P>
      <P>Liu's wife, Liu Xia, was under constant surveillance in her Beijing  residence
and security  guards were trying to deter journalists and photographers getting
a glimpse of her, Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily News said.</P>
      <P>Liu Xia could not be reached on landline or cell phone, and her Twitter web page
had not been updated for quite a long time.</P>
      <P>The VOA has published a long list of dissidents and academics who, it said, are
being persecuted in China simply because the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony is
approaching.</P>
      <P>Part of the list is as follows:</P>
      <P>--Zhang Boshu, a Chinese scholar who was invited to attend a seminar on
"intellectuals'  rights,  academic  suppression  and administrative persecution"
in Taiwan, was prevented from departing for Taiwan;</P>
      <P>--Wang Zhongxia and Liu Shasha, human rights activists, were taken away in
Beijing. No one knows where they were being kept;</P>
      <P>--Tang Jitian, human rights lawyer, was forced back to his hometown in Jilin
province;</P>
      <P>--Wang Lixiong, famous writer and expert on Tibet, and his wife Wei Se were kept
under house arrest;</P>
      <P>--Qin Yongmin, founder of the Democratic Party of China, was detained.</P>
      <P>However, there are several Chinese nationals who will not succumb to explicit or
implicit pressure from Beijing on the matter of Liu's award, according to
reports.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, a number of Legislative Council members, including Emily Lau, Lee
Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho Chun-yan, and leaders of civilian groups departed
Wednesday for Oslo.</P>
      <P>They will attend the award ceremony as "representatives from the Chinese
territory," supporting Liu Xiaopo.</P>
      <P>As they witness a historic moment in Oslo, they are likely to hear another voice
of support, in the form of music, from Chinese American violinist Lynn Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang told the BBC that he is honored to have a chance to perform "Jasmine" (Mo
Li Hua in Chinese) and other songs at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>He said he will try to use music to interpret what a pity Liu's absence is from
the award ceremony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government concerned over EU flat panel fines</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government expressed concern Thursday over heavy fines the European
Commission has slapped on four Taiwanese flat panel makers for alleged price-
fixing.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said the government will provide
any assistance necessary if the fined companies ask for help.</P>
      <P>Shih said, however, that the government should have confidence in the companies'
ability to deal with international lawsuits, as all of them have multinational
operations and have their own legal teams.</P>
      <P>In July last year, the European Commission -- the European Union's top decision-
maker -- brought charges against Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp., AU Optronics
Corp. (AUO) , Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp., along with
LG Display of South Korea, accusing them of price-fixing.</P>
      <P>Samsung Electronics, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged,
since it blew the whistle to the European Commission on the price-fixing.</P>
      <P>The EU antitrust regulator accused the firms of violating EU law through a
conspiracy to engage in unfair price-fixing practices to hurt flat panel buyers
in the production of products such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital
watches and MP3 players.</P>
      <P>The European Commission issued its decision Wednesday against the five
manufacturers, which could face combined total fines to the tune of 649 million
euros (US$862 million).</P>
      <P>Of the five, Chi Mei -- which merged with Innolux Display Corp. to form Chimei
Innolux Corp. in March -- received the heaviest penalty, with a fine of 300
million euros.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun Li-chun, a commissioner with the Cabinet-level Fair Trade
Commission, said the agency is willing to extend a helping hand if the
government is allowed to intervene.</P>
      <P>Sun noted that based on past experience, the amounts of that fines are
negotiable if the accused companies appeal and explain their situations.</P>
      <P>AUO, which was fined 116.8 million euros, has already said it will appeal.</P>
      <P>An AUO spokesman said it has cooperated with the EU authorities over the past
four years in their investigation into industry practices regarding the
production and marketing of TFT-LCD products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman
Christina Liu also said the government will try its best to help if the four
companies ask.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the EU move -- a repetition of a similar antitrust case in the
United States -- in part to the economic downturn in Europe and the U.S.</P>
      <P>"These two areas tend to take more aggressive approaches when their economies
are not in good shape," she said.</P>
      <P>Chi Mei and Chunghwa said they will examine the EU decision more closely before
taking their next steps. A Chi Mei executive said the 300 million-euro fine is
"really too harsh."</P>
      <P>Chunghua was fined 9 million euros, while HannStar got a fine of 8.1 million
euros.</P>

      <P>Taipei City will make an all-out effort to host the 2019 Asian Games, using the
momentum of its success in winning  the  bid Wednesday  for the Asia  Masters
Athletics Championships, the city's mayor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The experience gained in organizing the championships, scheduled for 2012, will
help Taipei in its efforts to bid for other big international games, including
the Asiad and the East Asian Games, said Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>It was confirmed Wednesday that Taipei had won the bid to host the 17th Asia
Masters Athletics Championships, dubbed "the senior Olympics,"  Hau told a group
of athletes who competed in this year's Asiad and were visiting the Taipei
International Flora Exposition.</P>
      <P>"The senior Olympics" are being held this year from December 6-12 in Malaysia.
Athletes aged 35-95 from 24 Asian countries affiliated to the Asia Masters
Athletics (AMA) association are competing in 25 events.</P>
      <P>Hau said the bid for the 2019 Asian Games will be submitted next February, and
if Taipei wins, it will have adequate time to prepare.</P>
      <P>The plan is to make Guandu in suburban Taipei the main venue and to build sports
stadiums in the adjoining Taipei County, Hau said.</P>
      <P>The 2014 Asiad will be held in Incheon, South Korea.</P>
      <P>On a different occasion Thursday, Hau said the 2009 Summer Deaflympics in Taipei
represented a milestone in Taiwan's history of hosting international sports
events.</P>
      <P>That experience also contributed to the successful opening on Nov. 6 of the
Flora Expo, and must be built on, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA, DOH censured over problems relating to pig blood cakes</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's highest watchdog body on Thursday censured two government agencies
for failing to ensure that a local snack called pig blood cake is produced under
sanitary conditions.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan passed a motion moved by two of its members, Cheng Jen-huang
and Yang Mei-lin, to censure the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the Department
of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Cheng said the COA had failed to formulate a standard hygienic procedure for
collecting pig's blood, while the DOH had neglected to make it mandatory for pig
blood cakes to be subject to health inspections.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, pig's blood is collected at 45 of the 59 legal pig abattoirs
in Taiwan for use in food recipes.</P>
      <P>"Because the COA has not stipulated a standard method for pig's blood
collection, there have been incidents of stool contamination of the blood during
the collection process," he said.</P>
      <P>In response, a COA official said that a standard operating procedure for pig's
blood collection will be introduced at abattoirs from next year.</P>
      <P>Huang Kwo-ching, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said the bureau will select several abattoirs
at which to run a pilot project for blood collection, and if it proves feasible,
all abattoirs will be required to adopt the procedure.</P>
      <P>The procedure will involve the use of a hollow knife to collect blood from
sedated pigs and the blood will collected in special bags to avoid
contamination, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another problem is the storage of the blood once it has been
collected, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>Pig's blood contains about 17-18 percent protein and it decomposes fast at room
temperature, he noted. But according to COA statistics, 73.3 percent of the
abattoirs in Taiwan store the blood in an environment warmer than 5 degrees
Celsius, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that neither the COA nor the DOH have kept track of where pig's blood
goes from the abattoirs, let alone monitor the conditions under which pig blood
cakes are made for sale in night markets and on the Internet.</P>
      <P>When asked whether pig blood cakes were being exported to the United States,
the two government  agencies  gave conflicting responses, he said.</P>
      <P>The DOH's reply was that no pig's blood products had been exported to Europe or
the United States since an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Taiwan in 1997,
while the COA said its data showed that 28,960 kilograms of pig blood cakes had
been exported to the United States between 2003 and 2006, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The issue of pig blood cakes first came to the forefront earlier this year when
a local newspaper reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had banned
the production and sale of the product throughout the U.S. because it was being
made in unsanitary conditions.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, pig blood cake is usually eaten as a steamed snack served on a wooden
stick or cooked as a hot-pot ingredient. .</P>

      <P>Famed Chinese cellist Jian Wang will join Taiwan's National Symphony Orchestra
(NSO) in two concerts in Taipei on Friday and Saturday, an experience he said
will be "inspiring and very exciting."</P>
      <P>The cellist, born and raised in China, gained worldwide attention at the age of
10 when he was discovered by Ukrainian-born violin virtuoso Isaac Stern, whose
encouragement and support paved the way for Wang to study music in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Wang has performed with many of the world's top symphony orchestras,  including
the  Philadelphia  Orchestra,  Berliner Philharmoniker and NHK Symphony
Orchestra, to name a few.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Thursday, he said he was very excited about the two
concerts because he would be performing under the baton of NSO resident maestro
Lu Shao-chia. Wang described Lu a real friend and a conductor with an
outstanding sense of music style and a clear beat.</P>
      <P>"Lu is 10 times better than any of other foreign conductors I have worked with
in the past," Wang told reporters.</P>
      <P>Lu, who is based in Germany, returned to Taiwan in September and took up the
position of music director and principal conductor of the NSO.</P>
      <P>He will perform with Wang for the first time in Taiwan at the weekend concerts.
They have performed together once in Germany.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Friday's program at National Concert Hall will open with
Sibelius's Pohjola's Daughter, Op. 49, followed by Bartok's Music for Strings,
Percussion and Celesta, and Dvorak's Cello Concerto in B minor, Op. 104.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, the concert will be held at Palm Trees Boulevard at National Taiwan
University. Wang will perform Dvorak's Cello Concerto of 1896 with the NSO in
the free concert. Sibelius' Finlandia, Op. 26 and Beethoven's symphony No.9 Mov.

      <P>Quanta Computer Inc., the world's largest notebook computer ODM service
provider, said Thursday that its sales hit a record high in November on an
increase in shipments of high-end products.</P>
      <P>In November, Quanta posted sales of NT$100.28 billion (US$3.32 billion), up 11.3
percent from October and up 7.5 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of the year, the company's sales totaled NT$995.85
billion, up 42.15 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Market observers said it is very likely that Quanta will reach its goal of more
than NT$1 trillion in sales for 2010, thanks to November's strong showing.</P>
      <P>They said the company is also very likely to realize another goal of shipping a
total of 50 million notebook computers this year after selling 47.10 million
units in the first 11 months.</P>
      <P>Local media reported that Quanta has secured orders from Apple to manufacturer
iPads, but the company declined to comment on any specific customers.</P>
      <P>The company said the guidance it gave in October that its sales in the fourth
quarter of this year will rise by as much as 5 percent from the third quarter
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the November sales figure, buying in Quanta shares resumed to
boost its share price to close at NT$63.50 Wednesday, up 4.10 percent from a day
earlier, dealers said.</P>
      <P>They said the buying largely came from foreign institutional investors in an

      <P>Production capacity of the global foundry business is expected to grow 8 percent
in 2011 from this year after an estimated 8 percent increase in 2010,
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), an industrial group,
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Production capacity in 2012 is expected to rise another 9 percent year-on-year,
the group said.</P>
      <P>SEMI is a global industrial association for the microelectronic, display and
photovoltaic industries.</P>
      <P>The group said the estimates are based on the input of announced capacity plans
and other analyses about foundry investments.</P>
      <P>Despite the expansion, the increases over the three years are modest compared to
the double-digit growth seen each year from 2003 to 2007, according to SEMI.</P>
      <P>In the past, the memory chip segment led growth in the foundry business, with
growth rates twice as high as the growth in the industry as a whole, but memory
chip production capacity is expected to increase at only the same rate as the
rest of the foundry industry through 2012, SEMI said.</P>
      <P>SEMI said spending on new wafer plant construction projects for 2011 is expected
to fall 11 percent from a year earlier and that the trend might accelerate in
2012.</P>
      <P>Despite the falls in spending on construction projects, spending on chip
production equipment is expected to rise 23 percent from 2010 to hit about US$40
billion in 2011, according to SEMI.</P>

      <P>Taiwan hopes to conclude an investment protection agreement with China in the
seventh round of high-level negotiations that will be held between the two sides
in the first half of next year, Taiwan's top China policy planner said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said
the cross-Taiwan Strait investment protection pact involves many issues that are
not only complicated  but also wide-ranging and far-reaching.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there will not be enough time to sort out all the related issues and
sign the agreement in the upcoming round of talks between the two sides this
month, Lai said during a meeting of the legislature's Interior Affairs
Committee.</P>
      <P>The next round of institutionalized  talks between  Chiang Pin-kung,  chairman
of Taiwan's intermediary  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , is scheduled to be held in Taipei in the second half of
December.</P>
      <P>The main item on the agenda for the sixth "Chiang-Chen meeting" will be the
signing of a bilateral medical cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>Lai told the lawmakers that the proposed investment protection agreement will be
excluded from the agenda for the sixth "Chiang-Chen meeting" because the two
sides have not yet come to terms on certain issues.</P>
      <P>These issues include the personal safety of Taiwanese businessmen in China,
compensation for land expropriation and the technical details of a dispute
settlement mechanism, she elaborated.</P>
      <P>Besides, she said, the two sides need more time to formulate a set of investment
protection regulations that would be in line with world standards and acceptable
to both sides.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has signed investment protection accords with 130 nations
while Taiwan has concluded 29, Lai said each side has a certain formula for
protecting the overseas investments of its citizens.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait investment protection accord is relatively complicated because
of the unique relationship between Taiwan and China and their different legal
systems, she added.</P>
      <P>However, she denied rumors that the talks on the agreement were being hindered
by a sovereignty dispute, saying that the arbitration of investment disputes
does not involve sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>According to SEF statistics, in the period from January 1991 to October 2010, it
had received 3,969 complaints filed by Taiwanese doing business on the Chinese
mainland.</P>
      <P>Of that number, 2,250 cases involved danger to personal and financial safety,
and 1,719 involved breaches of financial rights and interests.</P>
      <P>Only about 30 percent of those cases have been settled, according to SEF Vice
Chairman and Secretary-General Kao Koong-lian.</P>

      <P>The Royal Ballet, a world-class classical ballet company based in London, will
perform in Taiwan over a four-day period as part of the country's 100th
anniversary celebrations next year, one of the cultural organizers said in
Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>In its first ever performance in Taiwan, the world famous ballet company will
present two dance programs to the accompaniment of the National Symphony
Orchestra, according to the National Theatre and Concert Hall (NTCH).</P>
      <P>The first piece comprises three short dances and the second features the full-
length romantic ballet "Giselle, " the NTCH said. They will be staged Jun. 30 to
July 3 at National Theatre Hall.</P>
      <P>Kevin O'Hare, administrative director of the Royal Ballet, said at a promotional
press conference in Taipei that the two programs will give Taiwan audiences a
chance to see the range of the company.</P>
      <P>In "Giselle, " there will be four movements and they will be led by four sets of
principal dancers.</P>
      <P>"No role is too small, " O'Hare said. "Everyone in the company is very involved
in the performance, and whenever you look, you will see the story continue."</P>
      <P>He said the Royal Ballet always brings the full company -- 92 dancers and more
than 50 technical personnel -- when it is on tour.</P>
      <P>"If you come to see a ballet, and you don't know anything about ballet, you
still will be moved by the performance, because the whole company is telling the
story," he added.</P>
      <P>Coincidentally, the Royal ballet will be celebrating its 80th founding
anniversary next year, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang Pi-twan, artistic director of the NTCH, said at the press conference that
the Royal Ballet presentation is one of the 20 top-notch performances that will
be held, along with 100 free cultural activities, as part of the NTCH's efforts
to encourage public participation in the centennial celebrations next year.</P>
      <P>Starting from the last day of this month and running through the last day of
2011, there will be a number of exciting performances in Taiwan, she said.</P>

      <P>Acer Inc. said Thursday that the company will meet its goal for smartphone
shipments by the end of this year and expects to sell more Android-based models
in 2011.</P>
      <P>The world's second-biggest PC vendor said it will sell 2 million smartphones
worldwide in 2010 and achieve a 1 percent share in the local market, said Peter
Shieh, vice president of Acer's corporate account business division, at a press
conference to announce the launch of a new Acer smartphone.</P>
      <P>The success of the firm's sales, Shieh said, can be attributed to Acer's
partnerships  with telecom  operators  after a similar cooperation venture on
netbooks.</P>
      <P>Acer entered the smartphone market in 2009 using the Windows operating system
and later introduced four more models using the Android operating system through
local telecom carriers.</P>
      <P>"We are going to launch a further  four to five Android smartphones in the first
half of 2011 because the market is growing so quickly, " he added.</P>
      <P>Global shipments of Android-based smartphones recorded major growth in the third
quarter of 2010, up 1,297 percent year-on-year from 1.4 million in the same
period of 2009 to more than 20 million units this year, passing Apple Inc. and
Research In Motion to become the second-largest mobile operating system, with a
25-percent market share, according to research firm Canalys.</P>
      <P>The annual market share of Android-based smartphones will rise to 23 percent in
2011 from an estimated 20 percent this year, as the number-one OS -- Symbian --
is expected to drop from 41 percent in 2010 to 37 percent next year, said
technology consultant Ovum.</P>
      <P>The product launch earlier in the day saw two of Taiwan's major telecom
operators rolling out new Android-based smartphones in a bid to jump on the
bandwagon of the fast-growing market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile Co., the country's second-largest telecom service provider,
launched a 3.7-inch Motorola smartphone,  while the third-biggest telecom
operator, Far EasTone, introduced the new Acer device.</P>
      <P>Far EasTone, with a first allocation of 4,000-5,000 units of the new smartphone,
expects to sell 50,000 units in Taiwan within six months, said Benjamin Ho,
executive vice president of the company's marketing division.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile declined to forecast the sales of its Motorola venture but said it
will face a great challenge next year, as the company plans to sell more tablet
computers at the same time, said Cliff Lai, chief operating officer of Taiwan
Mobile.</P>

      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Thursday it will seek during
Dec. 27 negotiations to add an additional 120 flights on cross-Taiwan Strait
routes to all Chinese destinations for the coming Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>However, as Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen remain the most popular
cross-strait destinations, Taiwan's proposal to increase flights to these cities
might not be fully realized, since the Chinese government has set quotas for all
four destinations, said CAA Director-General Yin Chen-pong.</P>
      <P>During the one-month Lunar New Year holiday in 2010, Taiwanese carriers offered
an additional 88 flights -- 32 to Shanghai, 20 to Beijing, 20 to Guangzhou and
16 to Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>Many of these extra flights had very inconvenient departure and arrival times,
though, and the CAA said it will try to get better time slots for the coming
Lunar New Year period between Jan. 20 and Feb. 17, 2011.</P>
      <P>Even if red-eye flights are inevitable, Taiwan-based carriers have agreed that
fares for such flights will be slashed by at least 40 percent if customers buy
their tickets online.</P>
      <P>"At least half of the tickets will be available online, " Yin said. "The public
are welcome to report to us should any of the carriers break this deal," he
added.</P>

      <P>Ten years after stealing a cup, a blanket and a set of dining utensils from a
Cathay Pacific plane, the repentant passenger sent them back to the airline,
along with NT$900 (US$29.82), airline sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The airline's Kaohsiung office received the package July 19, but as they were
unable to contact the sender, who called himself Chiu Chan-ho, they initially
did not open it.</P>
      <P>Finally, a female staffer's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the
package.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsiung-ta, a manager in charge of the carrier's business in southern Taiwan,
speculated that Chiu might be a frequent flyer who pilfered the objects a long
time ago and was now sending them back after being struck with remorse.</P>
      <P>Lee told CNA that all the items were no longer in production and should be seen
as collector's items.</P>
      <P>Since the staff could not reach the sender, they decided to donate that NT$900
"interest  payment"  to the United Nations Children's Fund.</P>
      <P>Lee further reported that this year alone, Cathay Pacific has lost 1,000 of the
life vests that are placed under passengers' seats, a big loss to the company

    <TEXT>
      <P>A production crew from South Korea's public television broadcaster, the Korean
Broadcasting System (KBS), visited Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen Thursday
to get a glimpse into the underground military bases and facilities there.</P>
      <P>The four-member KBS crew, including journalist Park Sang-min and Lee Chang-
heung, a retired researcher with South Korea's Defense Ministry, visited a deep
underground military base (DUMB) tunnel and two fortifications on Little Kinmen
-- a smaller islet to the west of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The crew also visited Chiunglin Village on Kinmen to film DUMB tunnels there.</P>
      <P>The group is on a three-day tour of Kinmen to find out how Kinmen survived the
many Chinese communist strikes against it in years gone by, including extensive
shelling in 1958, and how it has been transformed from a frontline anti-
communist bastion into a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>The group also visited the island's Shuitou Wharf to see how Kinmen serves as a
gateway between Taiwan and China's nearby Fujian Province, allowing people from
the two sides to exchange visits freely via ferry.</P>
      <P>According to a Kinmen military source, the Korean visitors showed great
admiration for the close and peaceful interaction between the people on either
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The KBS crew made the visit as a planned trip to Kinmen by South Korean military
personnel hit a snag after news of the visit was disclosed.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire reports quoted South Korean President Lee Myung-bak as saying two
days earlier that a South Korean military delegation might visit the island this
month.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, South Korea wishes to gain knowledge about Kinmen's
DUMB facilities and fortifications as a reference for its own efforts to fortify
its five western border islands, including Yeonpyeong, which was attacked by
North Korea last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH denies concealing suspected human mad-cow disease case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
12/09/10  22:21:53

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) denied Thursday that it tried to conceal
information about a suspected human mad-cow disease case in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to questioning from the Consumers' Foundation about its handling of
the first suspected human mad-cow disease death in Taiwan, the DOH's Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) said in a statement that the center has never tried to
keep any information about the case secret.</P>
      <P>The CDC was referring to a 36-year-old man who died in May this year from what
appeared to be human mad-cow disease, medically known as Creutzfeldt-Jacob
Disease (CJD), a rare but fatal form of disease linked to eating infected tissue
from cows.</P>
      <P>The man, who lived in the United Kingdom from 1978-1986, began to show symptoms
of CJD such as memory loss and hypersomnia, and was reported to the CDC as a
suspected CJD case in March 2009.</P>
      <P>The CDC statement said that because the man's family refused to provide tissue
for testing or to give permission for an autopsy, it is difficult to confirm the
cause of his death.</P>
      <P>Based on the patient's symptoms and his MRI and EEG records, a medical team
determined it was an "extremely likely case" of CJD, the CDC statement said.</P>
      <P>Judging from the fact that the patient was studying in the U.K. during the peak
period of mad-cow disease there, the center said, his death could be counted as
an imported case of CJD and unlikely to pose any threat to Taiwan's disease
control network.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the center added that it has carefully tracked the patient's  medical
and blood donation records and has adopted precautionary measures to prevent any
spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Medically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, mad-cow disease
causes spongy holes in the brains of infected cattle. Taiwan does not import
beef from the U.K.</P>
      <P>The CDC said its CJD reporting and monitoring system has been functioning well
since 1997 and that it has also commissioned the Taiwan Neurological Society to
form a special panel to screen reported  CJD cases  and train  relevant  medical
staff  and epidemiological personnel.</P>
      <P>The CDC did not reveal information  about the case until Wednesday, when a local
financial biweekly published an article about the death in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday that the DOH should have released
information about the case as soon as it was reported by a local medical
institution to the Centers for Disease Control in March 2009.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, the minister in charge at the time felt there was no need to release
relevant information since the case did not originate in Taiwan, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, I think otherwise. Since we are an open and pluralistic society,
our people have the right to know. We should have informed the public of the
case as soon as we received the report, regardless of whether the patient
contracted the disease at home or abroad," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Responding to Yaung's remarks, then-DOH Minister Yeh Chin-chuan said that during
his tenure, the patient's symptoms were not clear enough to make a positive CJD
diagnosis.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that his family declined to provide tissue for testing or allow
the patient to have advanced examinations, there was no way to confirm the case,
" Yeh said, adding that this was why he did not inform Yaung of the case during
the changeover of the post.</P>
      <P>On speculation that the case had not been revealed mainly because the DOH was
afraid the exposure would inspire opposition to the government's plan to end a
ban on U.S. beef imports, Yeh said the speculation is unfounded and that the
case had nothing to do with U.S. beef.</P>

      <P>A man who accidentally shredded NT$200,000 (US$6,600) thanked a government
forensic expert for saving his money Thursday after the Central Bank decided to
honor the notes.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his surname of Lin, inadvertently put 200 NT$1,000
notes into a shredder last month. Through a lawmaker, he requested help from
Ministry of Justice forensic experts.</P>
      <P>Liu Hui-fen, a 30-year government employee who trained herself as a "jigsaw
expert, " spent seven days, including four nights of overtime, piecing the notes
back together.</P>
      <P>Liu said it took patience and skill to complete the puzzle of the shredded
notes. As each note needs to be just 75 percent complete to be recognized by the
central bank, however, she did not finish the remaining 25 percent in order to
save time.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, Liu has been asked by the Central Bank to look into 247 cases of
damaged banknotes, involving a total of NT$7.57 million.</P>
      <P>She joined the government as a handwriting analyst and later passed internal
exams to become a forensic scientist. She is now the only "jigsaw expert" for
restoring bank notes at the ministry's Bureau of Investigation.</P>
      <P>Lin, who runs a plastics factory in Taipei County, visited the bureau Thursday

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu said Thursday that an anti-corruption agency
could be set up next April at the earliest after a draft organic law of the
agency passed an initial screening by a legislative committee that day.</P>
      <P>The Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee of the Legislative Yuan
passed the draft law proposed by the Ministry of Justice, but not without
expressions of concern that its functions could overlap with existing
organizations.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming,  caucus whip of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
pointed out that currently, the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)
and the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office are
already cracking down on corruption.</P>
      <P>In response, Tseng said the proposed agency would be used to prevent and act
against corruption, with the actual cracking down on corruption only a last
resort.</P>
      <P>According to the draft law, the agency will be in charge of the nation's anti-
corruption policy, the formulation, coordination and promotion of related
statutes, corruption prevention and related crime investigation, as well as the
supervision and assessment of the government's various ethics bodies.</P>
      <P>"The Investigation Bureau has to handle other cases in addition to cracking down
on corruption, " Tseng said, adding that if the MJIB and the proposed agency end
up probing the same case, the prosecutors will decide which will lead the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Tseng also said that if the draft law can clear the legislature during the
current session that closes at the end of the month, the agency can be launched
next April at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Calls for the establishment of an independent anti-corruption agency mounted
after the exposure of a high-profile bribery case implicating three senior
judges and a prosecutor earlier this year.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou demanded that the agency be set up as soon as possible to
improve the country's crackdown on corruption.</P>

      <P>The police is the most corrupt agency in the country, according to the results
of a survey released Thursday by Transparency International (TI).</P>
      <P>The agency scored 3.9 points on a five-band scale, while the Legislative Yuan
was ranked as the second-most corrupt institution, with the score of 3.8, the
results show. The scale ranks a score of 1 as least corrupt and 5 as most
corrupt.</P>
      <P>The survey, part of a global poll on corruption, was conducted online between
June and July this year, polling more than 97,000 respondents aged over 15 from
86 countries and territories around the world for TI, the Berlin-based anti-
graft group.</P>
      <P>The perception of police corruption might be a result of the shooting in May of
Weng Chi-nan, a gang leader in central Taiwan's Taichung City who was shot and
killed in the presence of several police officers with whom he was drinking and
gambling, said Chen Chun -ming, executive director of the TI's Taiwan chapter.</P>
      <P>The political parties and the private sector both received the same scores of
3.5, followed by 3.3 points for the judiciary and 3.2 points for the media.</P>
      <P>Compared with the results of a similar survey released in 2006, corruption in
Taiwan has improved significantly, as the political parties and legislature both
received 4.5 points on that occasion, followed by the police, with 4.1, the
judiciary with 3.9, the private sector with 3.7 and the media with 3.3.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 37 percent of the Taiwanese people polled agreed that the
government has made some achievements in fighting corruption.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, political parties around the world achieved an average
score of 4.2 among the global respondents, making them considered the most
corrupt institutions worldwide.</P>
      <P>Of the three other "Asian Tigers", respondents in Hong Kong gave the highest
score of 3.6 to the private sector and the media in Singapore received 3 points,
while South Koreans named political parties and the legislature as their most
corruption institutions.</P>

cross-strait destinations, Taiwan's proposal to increase flights to these cities
might not be fully realized, since the Chinese government has set quotas for all
four destinations, said CAA Director-General Yin Chen-pong.</P>
      <P>During the one-month Lunar New Year holiday in 2010, Taiwanese carriers offered
an additional 88 flights -- 32 to Shanghai, 20 to Beijing, 20 to Guangzhou and
16 to Shenzhen.</P>
      <P>Many of these extra flights had very inconvenient departure and arrival times,
though, and the CAA said it will try to get better time slots for the coming
Lunar New Year period between Jan. 20 and Feb. 17, 2011.</P>
      <P>Even if red-eye flights are inevitable, Taiwan-based carriers have agreed that
fares for such flights will be slashed by at least 40 percent if customers buy
their tickets online.</P>
      <P>"At least half of the tickets will be available online, " Yin said. "The public
are welcome to report to us should any of the carriers break this deal," he
added.</P>

      <P>Ten years after stealing a cup, a blanket and a set of dining utensils from a
Cathay Pacific plane, the repentant passenger sent them back to the airline,
along with NT$900 (US$29.82), airline sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The airline's Kaohsiung office received the package July 19, but as they were
unable to contact the sender, who called himself Chiu Chan-ho, they initially
did not open it.</P>
      <P>Finally, a female staffer's curiosity got the better of her and she opened the
package.</P>
      <P>Lee Hsiung-ta, a manager in charge of the carrier's business in southern Taiwan,
speculated that Chiu might be a frequent flyer who pilfered the objects a long
time ago and was now sending them back after being struck with remorse.</P>
      <P>Lee told CNA that all the items were no longer in production and should be seen
as collector's items.</P>
      <P>Since the staff could not reach the sender, they decided to donate that NT$900
"interest  payment"  to the United Nations Children's Fund.</P>
      <P>Lee further reported that this year alone, Cathay Pacific has lost 1,000 of the
life vests that are placed under passengers' seats, a big loss to the company
since each is worth around NT$1,000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A production crew from South Korea's public television broadcaster, the Korean
Broadcasting System (KBS), visited Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen Thursday
to get a glimpse into the underground military bases and facilities there.</P>
      <P>The four-member KBS crew, including journalist Park Sang-min and Lee Chang-
heung, a retired researcher with South Korea's Defense Ministry, visited a deep
underground military base (DUMB) tunnel and two fortifications on Little Kinmen
-- a smaller islet to the west of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The crew also visited Chiunglin Village on Kinmen to film DUMB tunnels there.</P>
      <P>The group is on a three-day tour of Kinmen to find out how Kinmen survived the
many Chinese communist strikes against it in years gone by, including extensive
shelling in 1958, and how it has been transformed from a frontline anti-
communist bastion into a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>The group also visited the island's Shuitou Wharf to see how Kinmen serves as a
gateway between Taiwan and China's nearby Fujian Province, allowing people from
the two sides to exchange visits freely via ferry.</P>
      <P>According to a Kinmen military source, the Korean visitors showed great
admiration for the close and peaceful interaction between the people on either
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The KBS crew made the visit as a planned trip to Kinmen by South Korean military
personnel hit a snag after news of the visit was disclosed.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire reports quoted South Korean President Lee Myung-bak as saying two
days earlier that a South Korean military delegation might visit the island this
month.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, South Korea wishes to gain knowledge about Kinmen's
DUMB facilities and fortifications as a reference for its own efforts to fortify
its five western border islands, including Yeonpyeong, which was attacked by
North Korea last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH denies concealing suspected human mad-cow disease case</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
12/09/10  22:21:53
(By Chen Ching-fang, Lee Ming-chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) denied Thursday that it tried to conceal
information about a suspected human mad-cow disease case in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to questioning from the Consumers' Foundation about its handling of
the first suspected human mad-cow disease death in Taiwan, the DOH's Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) said in a statement that the center has never tried to
keep any information about the case secret.</P>
      <P>The CDC was referring to a 36-year-old man who died in May this year from what
appeared to be human mad-cow disease, medically known as Creutzfeldt-Jacob
Disease (CJD), a rare but fatal form of disease linked to eating infected tissue
from cows.</P>
      <P>The man, who lived in the United Kingdom from 1978-1986, began to show symptoms
of CJD such as memory loss and hypersomnia, and was reported to the CDC as a
suspected CJD case in March 2009.</P>
      <P>The CDC statement said that because the man's family refused to provide tissue
for testing or to give permission for an autopsy, it is difficult to confirm the
cause of his death.</P>
      <P>Based on the patient's symptoms and his MRI and EEG records, a medical team
determined it was an "extremely likely case" of CJD, the CDC statement said.</P>
      <P>Judging from the fact that the patient was studying in the U.K. during the peak
period of mad-cow disease there, the center said, his death could be counted as
an imported case of CJD and unlikely to pose any threat to Taiwan's disease
control network.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the center added that it has carefully tracked the patient's  medical
and blood donation records and has adopted precautionary measures to prevent any
spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Medically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, mad-cow disease
causes spongy holes in the brains of infected cattle. Taiwan does not import
beef from the U.K.</P>
      <P>The CDC said its CJD reporting and monitoring system has been functioning well
since 1997 and that it has also commissioned the Taiwan Neurological Society to
form a special panel to screen reported  CJD cases  and train  relevant  medical
staff  and epidemiological personnel.</P>
      <P>The CDC did not reveal information  about the case until Wednesday, when a local
financial biweekly published an article about the death in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday that the DOH should have released
information about the case as soon as it was reported by a local medical
institution to the Centers for Disease Control in March 2009.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, the minister in charge at the time felt there was no need to release
relevant information since the case did not originate in Taiwan, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, I think otherwise. Since we are an open and pluralistic society,
our people have the right to know. We should have informed the public of the
case as soon as we received the report, regardless of whether the patient
contracted the disease at home or abroad," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Responding to Yaung's remarks, then-DOH Minister Yeh Chin-chuan said that during
his tenure, the patient's symptoms were not clear enough to make a positive CJD
diagnosis.</P>
      <P>"Given the fact that his family declined to provide tissue for testing or allow
the patient to have advanced examinations, there was no way to confirm the case,
" Yeh said, adding that this was why he did not inform Yaung of the case during
the changeover of the post.</P>
      <P>On speculation that the case had not been revealed mainly because the DOH was
afraid the exposure would inspire opposition to the government's plan to end a
ban on U.S. beef imports, Yeh said the speculation is unfounded and that the
case had nothing to do with U.S. beef.</P>

      <P>A man who accidentally shredded NT$200,000 (US$6,600) thanked a government
forensic expert for saving his money Thursday after the Central Bank decided to
honor the notes.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his surname of Lin, inadvertently put 200 NT$1,000
notes into a shredder last month. Through a lawmaker, he requested help from
Ministry of Justice forensic experts.</P>
      <P>Liu Hui-fen, a 30-year government employee who trained herself as a "jigsaw
expert, " spent seven days, including four nights of overtime, piecing the notes
back together.</P>
      <P>Liu said it took patience and skill to complete the puzzle of the shredded
notes. As each note needs to be just 75 percent complete to be recognized by the
central bank, however, she did not finish the remaining 25 percent in order to
save time.</P>
      <P>Since 2006, Liu has been asked by the Central Bank to look into 247 cases of
damaged banknotes, involving a total of NT$7.57 million.</P>
      <P>She joined the government as a handwriting analyst and later passed internal
exams to become a forensic scientist. She is now the only "jigsaw expert" for
restoring bank notes at the ministry's Bureau of Investigation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu said Thursday that an anti-corruption agency
could be set up next April at the earliest after a draft organic law of the
agency passed an initial screening by a legislative committee that day.</P>
      <P>The Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee of the Legislative Yuan
passed the draft law proposed by the Ministry of Justice, but not without
expressions of concern that its functions could overlap with existing
organizations.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming,  caucus whip of the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party,
pointed out that currently, the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB)
and the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office are
already cracking down on corruption.</P>
      <P>In response, Tseng said the proposed agency would be used to prevent and act
against corruption, with the actual cracking down on corruption only a last
resort.</P>
      <P>According to the draft law, the agency will be in charge of the nation's anti-
corruption policy, the formulation, coordination and promotion of related
statutes, corruption prevention and related crime investigation, as well as the
supervision and assessment of the government's various ethics bodies.</P>
      <P>"The Investigation Bureau has to handle other cases in addition to cracking down
on corruption, " Tseng said, adding that if the MJIB and the proposed agency end
up probing the same case, the prosecutors will decide which will lead the
investigation.</P>
      <P>Tseng also said that if the draft law can clear the legislature during the
current session that closes at the end of the month, the agency can be launched
next April at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Calls for the establishment of an independent anti-corruption agency mounted
after the exposure of a high-profile bribery case implicating three senior
judges and a prosecutor earlier this year.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou demanded that the agency be set up as soon as possible to
improve the country's crackdown on corruption.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The police is the most corrupt agency in the country, according to the results
of a survey released Thursday by Transparency International (TI).</P>
      <P>The agency scored 3.9 points on a five-band scale, while the Legislative Yuan
was ranked as the second-most corrupt institution, with the score of 3.8, the
results show. The scale ranks a score of 1 as least corrupt and 5 as most
corrupt.</P>
      <P>The survey, part of a global poll on corruption, was conducted online between
June and July this year, polling more than 97,000 respondents aged over 15 from
86 countries and territories around the world for TI, the Berlin-based anti-
graft group.</P>
      <P>The perception of police corruption might be a result of the shooting in May of
Weng Chi-nan, a gang leader in central Taiwan's Taichung City who was shot and
killed in the presence of several police officers with whom he was drinking and
gambling, said Chen Chun -ming, executive director of the TI's Taiwan chapter.</P>
      <P>The political parties and the private sector both received the same scores of
3.5, followed by 3.3 points for the judiciary and 3.2 points for the media.</P>
      <P>Compared with the results of a similar survey released in 2006, corruption in
Taiwan has improved significantly, as the political parties and legislature both
received 4.5 points on that occasion, followed by the police, with 4.1, the
judiciary with 3.9, the private sector with 3.7 and the media with 3.3.</P>
      <P>In addition, some 37 percent of the Taiwanese people polled agreed that the
government has made some achievements in fighting corruption.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, political parties around the world achieved an average
score of 4.2 among the global respondents, making them considered the most
corrupt institutions worldwide.</P>
      <P>Of the three other "Asian Tigers", respondents in Hong Kong gave the highest
score of 3.6 to the private sector and the media in Singapore received 3 points,
while South Koreans named political parties and the legislature as their most

      <P>LPGA Player of the Year 2010, Yani Tseng, returned to Taiwan from Florida early
Friday to share with her friends the joy of winning the coveted golf title.</P>
      <P>The 21-year-old was awarded the trophy Dec. 5 at the end of the 2010 LPGA Tour
Championship at the Grand Cypress Golf Club in Orlando, which made her the first
golfer from Taiwan to ever clinch the prize.</P>
      <P>Looking stylishly casual in an orange-colored jacket, Tseng was all smiles when
she arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport.</P>
      <P>She told reporters that she felt lucky to be able to capture the LPGA Player of
the Year award and would like to share the glory with all her friends in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On her career goal for the coming year, Tseng said she will continue working
hard to pursue excellence in her sport.</P>
      <P>Asked if she had any advice for other Taiwanese professional golfers, Tseng said
tenacity is most important in the pursuit of career excellence.</P>
      <P>"Professional sports are highly competitive and uncontrollable. You must be
firmly and constantly committed to your goal when you find your direction, " she
said. "No one knows what the result will be until the game is over. I hope none
of our golfers will ever give up their career goals."</P>
      <P>Tseng performed well this year, winning three titles, two of which were majors.</P>
      <P>She said earlier this year that winning a career grand slam is her next goal. Of
the five LPGA titles won during her career, three have been majors -- the LPGA
Championship in 2008, the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April 2010 and the RICOH
Women's British Open in August 2010. The U.S. Women's Open is the only major she
has not yet won.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Cross-strait factors in elections</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/10/10  10:45:25
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite its achievements in smoothing relations with China, the ruling
Kuomintang won 1.5 million fewer votes in the Nov. 27 elections in the five
special municipalities than it did in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>This may be an indication that although the people recognize the peace and
economic benefits brought by the administration  of President Ma Ying-jeou, they
believe the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should play the
role of a buffer in cross-Taiwan Strait political ties.</P>
      <P>Probably realizing  this problem,  Mainland Affairs Council Minister Lai Shin-
yuan on Wednesday openly outlined "the seven core interests of the Taiwanese
people, " including the freedom to choose the future of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The next day, however, China's foreign affairs ministry posted on its website an
article by state councilor Dai Bingguo stating that Taiwan is China's inviolable
"core interest" and that China will never renounce the use of force. Dai's
statement was probably in anticipation of Ma's possible backtracking and the
DPP's possible return to power in 2012.</P>
      <P>To create a cross-strait policy that is convincing and profound, the Ma
administration  needs to perform  better  in terms of interpreting  "the
Republic of China,  " "the one-China based Constitution, " and "one China,
respective interpretations." He also needs to strike a balance in cross-strait

    <HEADLINE>Shares of AsusTek sharply higher on share buyback plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer Inc. were sharply higher in
Friday morning trade after the company announced a share buyback plan, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>Investors ignored the fact that the company posted a 6 percent decline in sales
for November  from October due to inventory adjustments, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>AsusTek rose 3.42 percent to NT$287.50 (US$9.52) , with 3.57 million shares
changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index was down 0.35 percent at
8,723.56.</P>
      <P>The company announced Thursday it will buy back 10 million shares at a price
ranging from NT$240 to NT$300 per share between Dec. 10, 2010 and Feb. 9, 2011.</P>
      <P>The number of buyback shares during that period will account for 1.59 percent of
the company's total outstanding shares and the maximum fund for the repurchase
will represent 3.11 percent of the company's liquid assets.</P>
      <P>"The buyback plan shows AsusTek's intention to support its share price," Concord
Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Judging from the buyback price range, I expect the stock may see support at
NT$240 and go higher to challenge the NT$300 mark in the near term," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said foreign institutional investors have turned optimistic about AsusTek's
earnings outlook as the growing global tablet market is expected to boost the
company's bottom line.</P>
      <P>The market has also embraced high hopes that the global PC market will recover
next year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The fall in November  sales was widely expected on high inventories, " Lin
said. "It needs some time for the market to digest the inventories, and I do not
expect AsusTek will see an immediate turnaround in terms of sales in December."</P>
      <P>After a spinoff of its manufacturing arm earlier this year, AsusTek has
concentrated its efforts on building its own brand in the global market, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>He said investors appeared to like the way AsusTek approached its operation
restructuring by letting go the manufacturing segment whose profit margin was
being squeezed by fierce global competition.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A bill to introduce a second-generation national health insurance system was
blocked by legislators Tuesday because of its many controversial aspects. On
Thursday, the Cabinet decided to scrap the plan and promote a so-called

the turn of events.  Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang may have succeeded in

details were well thought out or reasonable.</P>
      <P>The DOH must use its wisdom to clear up the doubts surrounding the reform and
set up a health insurance system that is truly acceptable to the majority of

      <P>The Cabinet should also seek to make the existing income tax system fairer

    <DATELINE>In a surprise twist,  the Department  of Health (DOH)
12/10/10  13:46:47
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>reportedly has agreed to abandon its long-held plan to calculate health
insurance premiums on the basis of overall household income, in order to win
legislative support for reform of the debt-laden national health insurance (NHI)
system.</P>
      <P>It was decided at a meeting late Thursday of DOH officials and leading members
of the ruling Kuomintang legislative caucus that premiums will be calculated
based on regular salaries of the insured, as is the case at present, but that
high earning individuals will be required to pay higher premiums under the
revised system, major local newspaper reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Speaking at the meeting chaired by Premier Wu Den-yih, KMT legislative whips
asked that the DOH scrap its plan to calculate health insurance premiums on the
basis of "presumed income" for individuals with no regular salary. The lawmakers
also requested that the premium rates for people in that category be lowered
further.</P>
      <P>It was also tentatively decided that service revenues of highly paid people such
as top entertainers, lawyers and accountants will be incorporated into their
regular salaries in the calculation of their health insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang promised that the DOH will
come up with a new version of the health premium reform plan that would
incorporate these suggestions.</P>
      <P>Some KMT lawmakers also suggested at the meeting that the stock transaction tax
rate be raised from the current 0.3 percent to 0.35 percent, a move that they
said would generate an additional NT$20 billion (US$655.74 million) in tax
revenues to help keep the cash-strapped national health insurance system afloat.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-teh, however, was quite unenthusiastic about the
proposal, saying it should be a last resort. Lee agreed only to assess the pros
and cons of the proposal, financial officials said. (Dec. 10, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Yang Li-huan said after the meeting that the DOH-proposed premium
system based on overall household income will be abandoned and that the new
system will be based on the current formula of calculating premiums on the basis
of regular salaries or wages of the insured.</P>
      <P>But she added that under the new system, year-end bonuses, service revenues,
capital gains and overseas earnings that are easy to assess with the use of
existing tax levy techniques should also be included.</P>
      <P>"Anyway, the common consensus reached at the meeting was that the new system
should not increase financial burden on salaried people, " Yang said. (Dec. 10,
2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Major civic watchdog bodies said the ruling party's plan to scrap the proposed
system of calculating health premiums based on total household income was
unacceptable.</P>
      <P>"Eight years have been spent drafting the new system. How can it be abandoned so
lightly? The ruling party's frivolous attitude in dealing with the serious
matter of reform is unacceptable," said Teng Hsi-hua, spokesman for the NHI
Civilian Surveillance Alliance.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung said late Thursday that the DOH has not yet decided to
give up its second-generation health insurance premium proposal and will
continue working to modify it to satisfy as many as people as possible. (Dec.
10, 2010).</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the government Friday to
include a "human rights clause" in the planned agreements between Taiwan and
China as an indication of Taiwan's concern for the universal issue.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP, democracy and human rights should be put on the agenda of
the cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges because they are Taiwan's most important
assets.</P>
      <P>"The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou must take concrete action to show
its support for China's democracy activists and show the world that Taiwan
stands firmly behind the pursuit of democracy and human rights, " said DPP
spokesman Lin Yu-chang at a news conference held to mark Human Rights Day.</P>
      <P>Lin urged Beijing to respond to the international community's call for the
release of 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo from prison and an end to
the house arrest of his wife Liu Xia.</P>
      <P>Also on Friday, DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei suggested that immigration
authorities refuse to admit Beijing Deputy Mayor Ji Lin, who is scheduled to
visit Taiwan Dec. 13, on grounds that he has persecuted Falun Gong followers.</P>
      <P>The proposal was made based on a resolution adopted by the Legislative  Yuan
Tuesday  asking authorities  to list Chinese government officials who violate
human rights as personas non grata, which means they will be refused entry to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response, Shih Chen-chia,  an official of the National Immigration Agency

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.39 percent Friday, dragged down by
construction shares on fears that the government would impose a new tax to curb
speculation in the property market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 35.01 points to 8,718.83, after moving between 8,684.05
and 8,744.67, on turnover of NT$143.34 billion (US$4.75 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.57 percent and moved to the day's low as investors
pocketed the gains posted in the previous session, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, after the index fell below the 8,700 point mark, bargain hunting
emerged to help the market to recoup some of its losses, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,848 stocks closed down, 1,438 finished up, and 308 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector suffered the heaviest selling, falling 3.0 percent.
Paper and pulp stocks fell 1.8 percent, plastics and chemical shares lost 1.1
percent, foodstuffs shed 0.9 percent and cement shares closed down 0.8 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector lost 0.6 percent and the textile sector fell 0.5 percent,
while machinery and electronics shares closed up 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The local media reported on Friday that the government is planning to introduce
an additional tax on sales of properties being sold for the second time within a
year to cap market speculation and prevent an asset bubble.</P>
      <P>"Although the report has not been confirmed, investors used it as an excuse to
lock in gains posted on Thursday, " Taiwan International Securities analyst
Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the construction sector, other old economy stocks also came under
pressure after being significantly boosted in previous days by the rising local
currency, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"After the market hit a 30-month high yesterday,  today's correction came as no
surprise," Chiang said. "It was quite technical in nature."</P>
      <P>Chiang said, however, that the downward pressure was not too strong, as many
investors appeared willing to hang on to their stocks because of expectations
that additional foreign funds would enter the local market to push share prices
higher.</P>
      <P>Among downward moving construction shares, Cathay Real Estate lost 4.90 percent
to NT$16.50 and Kuo Yang Construction fell 4.59 percent to NT$23.90.</P>
      <P>However, PC vendor AsusTek outperformed the broader market, closing  up 1.80
percent at NT$283.00  after a share buyback announcement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's political map is changing, with the green camp led by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party gradually eclipsing the ruling Kuomintang's blue
camp.</P>
      <P>The trend, evident in the recent municipal elections in which the green camp
overtook the blues in total vote count, is closely related to the shrinking of
Taiwan's middle class.</P>
      <P>The phenomenon has already emerged in Western countries, as they have been
encouraging economic activities that bring in capital gains on the assumption
that if it is good for the stock and property markets, it is good for the
economy.</P>
      <P>However, industrial reforms and innovation, which are required if real progress
is to be made, have been neglected.</P>
      <P>Booming stock and property trade has only served to widen the wealth gap in
advanced countries, and Taiwan is following suit.</P>
      <P>Compared to the soaring stock and property prices, slipping salaries have given
the middle class an increasing sense of being exploited and pushed toward
poverty.</P>
      <P>In the past, over 80 percent of Taiwan's people considered themselves middle
class, which helped the country achieve its democratic development in a stable
environment.</P>
      <P>Today, the wealthy's pursuit of luxury goods and mansions has created an
atmosphere of extravagance that makes even the richer section of the middle
class, defined as those with an annual income of NT$1 million (US$33,036) , feel
poorer and discontented with the situation.</P>
      <P>As democracy  theories point out that people's desire for aggressive change
intensifies without the middle class, and Taiwan has entered a phase that
requires overall structural reforms, the government must find a solution to
prevent the social unrest that has surfaced in Western countries.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on Japan Friday to pass and enact as soon as
possible a law that will protect collections of the National Palace Museum (NPM)
in Taipei from being seized by a third country if they are exhibited in Japan.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call during a meeting at the Presidential Office with Hatakenaka
Atsushi, visiting chairman of the Interchange Association of Japan.</P>
      <P>The organization serves as Japan's de facto embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes the widely acclaimed national treasures that are kept at the
NPM can be exhibited in Japan, since such a show would help boost the cultural
interaction between the two countries.</P>
      <P>At present, items in the NPM collections cannot be shipped to Japan for
exhibitions because the country has no law banning a third country from seizing
such items by claiming ownership of them. Beijing considers the artifacts in the
NPM to rightfully belong to China.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that various NPM artifacts have been exhibited in countries such as the
United States, France and Germany, all of which have laws protecting Taiwan's
ownership. These exhibitions have been very successful, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Atsushi to wield his political influence in prompting Japanese
lawmakers to pass a law guaranteeing the safety of NPM collections while they
are in Japan.</P>
      <P>Atsushi was visiting Taiwan for the 35th Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade Forum
that took place Dec. 9-10 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, he signed an agreement with his Taiwanese counterpart, East
Asian Relations Commission Chairman Peng Run-tsu, on cooperation in the
prevention and control of natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries will share data and
information on damage caused by earthquakes, typhoons and destructive
landslides; natural disaster prevention strategies; and experience in post-
disaster reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and Japan are located on the earthquake belt on the rim of the

      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.555 and moved to a low of NT$30.030 before

      <P>Despite a fall in the local bourse, buying in the New Taiwan dollar remained
strong during the session, with foreign banks and exporters the major buyers,
they said.</P>
      <P>These buyers were betting that the local currency will rise against the U.S.
dollar on hopes that a spillover effect of excessive liquidity will spread to
the Asian markets from the U.S., which is easing its monetary policy to boost
its economy, they added.</P>
      <P>The benchmark  weighted index closed down 0.39 percent at 8,718.83.</P>
      <P>A weaker U.S. dollar against other Asian currencies in the region added downward
pressure on the greenback in the local foreign exchange market, the dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The central bank again entered the trading floor to shore up the U.S. dollar and
push the value of the currency above NT$30.50, a level the market believes the

      <P>The deputy chairman and secretary-general of Taiwan's quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) will fly to Shanghai on Dec. 14 for preparatory talks
ahead of the sixth round of high-level negotiations between Taiwan and China,
the SEF said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian and his Chinese counterpart Zheng Lizhong, vice president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will
finalize the date, venue and agenda for the new round of talks between the heads
of the two organizations scheduled for late December in Taipei.</P>
      <P>They will also complete the draft of a cross-strait agreement on medical
cooperation that is expected to be sealed in the upcoming meeting between SEF
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>In addition, Kao and Zheng will discuss follow-up talks on a proposed investment
protection agreement that Taiwan hopes can be worked out soon, the SEF said.</P>
      <P>The proposed investment protection agreement,  which is of interest particularly
to Taiwan businessmen operating in China, was excluded from the agenda of the
sixth round of cross-strait talks after the two sides failed to reach consensus
on certain clauses.</P>
      <P>The exact date of the sixth Chiang-Chen meeting will be announced at the end of
the one-day preparatory talks in Shanghai, the SEF said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS were established to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of formal relations between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC November sales down 4.1 percent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, said Friday that its November sales fell 4.1 percent, ending an eight-
month upward streak in monthly revenue.</P>
      <P>Last month, TSMC posted NT$36.85 billion (US$1.22 billion) in sales, compared
with NT$38.43 billion recorded in October. The November figure represented a
21.5 percent increase from a year earlier, the company said.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, TSMC's sales totaled NT$384.67 billion, up
45.6 percent year-on-year, the company added.</P>
      <P>"The decline largely reflected a slowdown in the global personal computer
market," TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said. "TSMC started to feel the
effect of a slow season in the fourth quarter for the global foundry business."</P>
      <P>He said outsourcing from fabless IC designers is on the decline as these firms
are adjusting their inventories, adding that they will need some time to lower
the inventories.</P>
      <P>Shih said a rising New Taiwan dollar also put downward pressure on TSMC's
revenue.</P>
      <P>Since the end of August, the local currency has risen 4.6 percent against the
U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>However, TSMC is taking advantage of its relatively advanced production process
to offset the weakening global demand and has secured orders for higher-end
products, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, products on the advanced 40 nanometer production process
accounted for about 17 percent of the company's total sales.</P>
      <P>TSMC expects the ratio of the 40 nm production process to rise to 20 percent in
the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Shih said that while it is unlikely TSMC will see a sales turnaround in
December, the decline should be limited.</P>
      <P>"It is possible for the company to achieve its goal of generating NT$109 billion
in sales in the fourth quarter," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's appeal to sports court could be accepted: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan believes an appeal it has filed with the Court  of Arbitration  for Sport
(CAS)  related  to the disqualification of one of its taekwondo athletes at the
2010 Asian Games will be accepted by the court, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Steven S. K. Chen, vice minister of the Sports Affairs Council (SAC), said the
council had received a notice from the Lausanne-based tribunal asking it to
remit to the court a sum of money as an arbitration fee.</P>
      <P>"This action should serve as an indication that the international court is
determined to accept the case," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council filed the appeal via a law firm on Wednesday. It has
asked for arbitration in the case of Yang Shu-chun's controversial dismissal
from the women's under 49-kilogram division in the taekwondo competition at the
Asiad in Guangzhou, China on Nov. 17.</P>
      <P>The appeal was filed by Lee and Li Attorneys-at-Law on behalf of the council,
which feared it would be too late if Taiwan submitted the appeal after Dec. 18,
when the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) is scheduled to convene a disciplinary
committee meeting in Seoul to discuss Yang's case.</P>
      <P>"In the past two days, we have not received any information signaling that the
CAS would not take the case. Instead, it has asked us to remit an arbitration
fee to facilitate follow-up procedures, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan could withdraw the arbitration appeal if the WTF issues an acceptable
statement after its Dec. 18 meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan will proceed with the case in the international court if the WTF
makes any decision that would jeopardize Yang's rights, he added.</P>
      <P>WTF Secretary-General Yang Jin-suk said in Seoul Friday he was unaware of any
attempt to have the dispute brought to the CAS.</P>
      <P>Under most circumstances, a case can only be arbitrated by the CAS if both
parties to the dispute agree to do so. It is unclear if the WTF would accept
taking the case to the arbitration court.</P>
      <P>CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb told the Central News Agency in an e-mail on
Nov. 26 that the WTF did not seem to recognize the jurisdiction of the court in
disputes similar to incidents such as Yang Shu-chun's disqualification.</P>
      <P>Yang, her coaches Liu Ching-wen and Liu Tsung-ta, and Chinese Taipei Taekwondo
Association President Chen Chien-ping, will all travel to Seoul next week to
attend the WTF disciplinary committee meeting and present written testimony in
hopes of getting a fair solution to the dispute.</P>
      <P>Local media have speculated, however, that Yang could face a ban from the sport
for failing to leave the ring after she was disqualified.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old athlete, who was one Taiwan's hopefuls for a gold medal at the
Asiad, was disqualified during her opening bout of the tournament for allegedly
wearing extra sensors in her socks in an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match released later showed, however, that Yang was not
wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations by WTF and Asian
Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials of why Yang was disqualified have added to the
controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
but also vowed to take the case to the Court of Arbitration  for Sport if other
appeals failed to provide  a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>In response to public concerns that the Seoul meeting might result in a
disciplinary measures against Yang, SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said Thursday
that her agency had collected all the evidence related to the case -- favorable
or unfavorable -- and assessed all possible scenarios to protect Yang's
interests and rights.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Terry Gou, chairman of Hon Hai Group, which owns Taiwanese flat panel maker
Chimei Innolux Corp., protested strongly Friday against the European Commission
over huge fines slapped on the flat panel maker for alleged price-fixing.</P>
      <P>After meeting with Taipei-based European officials, Gou told reporters that
Chimei will wait until it receives formal notice of the fines before deciding
whether to file an appeal.</P>
      <P>The head of the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer</P>
      <P>urged the commission to explain how the commission came up with the amount of
the fine -- 300 million euros (US$397.76 million).</P>
      <P>The business tycoon also blasted the commission for not charging Samsung
Electronics, the world's largest flat panel maker, since it "blew the whistle"
to the European Commission on the alleged price-fixing.</P>
      <P>Gou said that he was not aware of any meetings between Samsung and Taiwanese
flat panel makers that resulted in the alleged price-fixing.</P>
      <P>However, he suggested that Samsung could have played a bigger role than the
Taiwanese makers in the case.</P>
      <P>In July last year, the European Commission -- the European Union's top decision-
maker -- leveled charges against Chimei, AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Chunghwa
Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp., along with LG Display of South
Korea, accusing them of price-fixing.</P>
      <P>The EU antitrust regulator accused the firms of violating EU law through a
conspiracy to engage in unfair price-fixing practices to hurt flat panel buyers
in the production of products such as computers, mobile phones, TVs, digital
watches and MP3 players.</P>
      <P>The European Commission issued its decision Wednesday against the five
manufacturers, which could face combined total fines to the tune of 649 million
euros.</P>
      <P>Of the five, Chimei -- which merged with Innolux Display Corp. to form Chimei
Innolux in March -- received the heaviest penalty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Inter-agency mechanism needed to combat wildlife crime: NGO</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An inter-agency government unit and a central database system should be
established in Taiwan to better combat wildlife crime, Mark Bowman, director of
field operations of the Freeland Foundation, said in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>The foundation, established in 2002 and based in Bangkok, is an international
organization dedicated to ending wildlife and human trafficking and protecting
natural habitats and vulnerable people.</P>
      <P>Bowman was invited by Taiwan's Green Consumers Foundation to conduct a four-day
evaluation and met with 12 government agencies to find out more about Taiwan's
current wildlife law enforcement network.</P>
      <P>Bowman said in a symposium held Friday that based on his short stay of only four
days, Taiwan is committed to eradicating wildlife crime, as the conviction rate
of the illegal wildlife trade is high, and that the officials he met with showed
professionalism and determination to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>"I'll give Taiwan an 8 out of 10 points on wildlife law enforcement, the highest
score I've ever given," he said.</P>
      <P>However, illegal shipments still occur in Taiwan, and Taiwan is reported by
international groups as a major node for the illegal wildlife trade, he
observed.</P>
      <P>To build a stronger mechanism to combat this type of crime, he suggested that
the government set up an inter-agency mechanism, so that the criminals involved
can be better monitored.</P>
      <P>Kuan Li-hao, an officer of the Council for Agriculture -- the main government
agency responsible for wildlife conservation -- welcomed Bowman's suggestion,
but said insufficient manpower is the reason why Taiwan has yet to set up an
inter-agency mechanism.</P>
      <P>He said despite the fact that Taiwan is barred from joining international
organizations due to China's objections, it has taken part in more than 200
international projects to help end the illegal wildlife trade.</P>
      <P>Jay Fang, chairman of the Green Consumers Foundation, said most wildlife crime
is related to organized crime groups, but in Taiwan, most of the criminals who
are prosecuted are individuals, leaving the ringleaders beyond the reach of the
law, which suggests that an update of related laws is needed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>500,000 more people to get public subsidies under new legislation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>More lower-income households will soon be eligible for government subsidies
after the Legislative Yuan on Friday passed amendments that change how Taiwan's
official poverty line will be defined and who can get access to public
assistance.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the Public Assistance Act, scheduled to take effect on July 1,
2011, should add 588,000 people to the number of households eligible for public
aid, said ruling Kuomintang Legislator Hou Tsai-feng after the passage of the
revisions.</P>
      <P>The bulk of those newly eligible to receive aid will be near poor households
with average income per household member no more than 1.5 times as high as the
poverty line.</P>
      <P>That group was previously  excluded from public assistance provisions, but the
amendments passed Friday incorporated them among those eligible for financial
aid.</P>
      <P>Other new recipients will receive assistance by falling under a higher poverty
line, or "minimum cost of living."</P>
      <P>At present, the minimum cost of living is defined as 60 percent of average per
capita consumption expenditures, but the new revisions change that to 60 percent
of median disposable income per capita.</P>
      <P>The minimum cost of living, which will vary from region to region, will be set
at NT$14,794 (US$493) in Taipei City, NT$11,146 in Kaohsiung City, NT$11,832 in
Xinbei City, NT$10,303 in Taichung City, NT$10,244 in Tainan City, and NT$10,244
in other cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>Households with levels of average income per household member lower than the
minimum cost of living can apply for public subsidies.</P>
      <P>The new formula raises the poverty line by roughly 5-10 percent, although the
minimum cost of living in Taipei City remained unchanged because of a provision
that caps any region's minimum cost of living at 70 percent of the country's
median disposable income per capita.</P>
      <P>Without that cap, Taipei City's new minimum cost of living would have risen to
NT$16,739.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Hou, members of low-income households who are 65 or
over, at least three-months pregnant, or physically or mentally  challenged,
are entitled  to receive  an additional three-months worth of subsidies per
year.</P>
      <P>The new formula ensures that assistance will be available to more disadvantaged
families, said Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Chen Chiech-ju welcomed the
passage of the amendments because households that would be recognized as poor or
near poor in other countries were finally being recognized as such in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that under the existing regulations, less than 1 percent of Taiwan's
population was eligible for government subsidies, much lower than those in
neighboring countries and areas such as South Korea and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The amendments will help Taiwan narrow that gap with other countries to some
extent, she added.</P>

      <P>Lawmakers from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) submitted a proposal Friday to have
northern Taipei City, Taipei County and Keelung City merged into a single
administrative district in a bid to upgrade Taiwan's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Hsieh Kuo-liang, one of the authors of the proposal, said the
merger of the three northern cities into a metropolis that would have a
population of over 7 million was originally part of President Ma Ying-jeou's
campaign platform in early 2008 but never materialized for a variety of reasons.</P>
      <P>Following the Nov. 27 five municipality elections, Taipei County will be
upgraded to a municipality and renamed Xinbei City Dec. 25 -- making it part of
a twin city with the capital, Taipei City, along with the much smaller
neighboring Keelung City, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He said that renowned metropolises elsewhere in the world, such as Tokyo and New
York, are all single administrative districts and that few "twin  cities"  have
been developed  into successful world-class metropolises.</P>
      <P>If Taipei City, Xinbei City and Keelung City were to be merged into one
administrative district, it would have a population of over 7 million,
constituting  nearly 30 percent of Taiwan's total population. Such a merger
would definitely make the northern area, to be known as the Taipei Metropolis,
into a world-class conurbation with high competitiveness, according to Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The merger proposal, titled "A Special Bill on the Merger of Taipei City, Xinbei
City and Keelung City, " was authored and submitted by Hsieh (Keelung City),
along with KMT legislators Justin Chou (Taipei City) , Huang Chih-hsiung (Xinbei
City) , Wu Yu-sheng (Xinbei City) and Kuo Su-chun (legislator-at-large).</P>
      <P>The proposal calls for the Executive Yuan to form a committee to push for the
merger, with the deputy premier as the convener and 19-23 people as members.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese dissident Wang Dan urged Taiwan's government and people Friday to pay
more attention to the development of human rights in China because the issue
will impact Taiwan's own security.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an international conference to commemorate Taiwan's human rights
development and International Human Rights Day, Wang, a visiting scholar at
National Tsing Hua University, said human rights is a universal issue that
should not be considered as merely domestic affairs of individual countries.</P>
      <P>"The human rights issue is not only a political issue but also an issue of
civilization. Whether or not China is a civilized country is related to Taiwan's
own security because of the proximity of the two places, " the 41-year-old said
during the International Conference on the Centennial of Human Rights in Taiwan:
Retrospect and Prospect.</P>
      <P>"An uncivilized neighbor is definitely not good news for the people of Taiwan, "
he said.</P>
      <P>Wang was among the core members of the 1989 student movement in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square that led to the Chinese government's bloody massacre of the
protesters. He was jailed from 1989-1993 before being allowed to go into exile
in the United States and has been advocating democracy and freedom for China
abroad ever since.</P>
      <P>The dissident-turned-scholar  urged Taiwan  to establish  a platform, especially
on the Internet, for dialogue between everyday people in Taiwan and China and
called for Taiwan's more experienced non-government organizations to help their
Chinese counterparts develop.</P>
      <P>He advised the government to invite more overseas Chinese students to visit
Taiwan and experience democracy and freedom first-hand, and added that Taiwan
should also make its position clear on every reported case of human rights
infringement in China, despite the warmer cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wang said he supports more liberalized cross-strait trade ties and President Ma
Ying-jeou's plan to allow more Chinese students to study in Taiwanese
universities.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, if Taiwan can help China develop into a more
civilized society with improved human rights, the efforts "will win Taiwanese
people goodwill and a favorable impression from the Chinese people."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Missouri Governor Jay Nixon acknowledged Friday that he canceled his trip to
Taiwan over concerns that it would impact his state's relations with China, U.S.
media reported.</P>
      <P>Nixon was scheduled to lead a trade mission from Dec. 10-16 to Taiwan and South
Korea. In Taiwan, he was expected to sign a letter of intent under which
Taiwanese businesses would commit to purchasing US$600 million of Missouri
products, including corn and soybeans, according to a Dec. 1 statement from
Nixon's office.</P>
      <P>Nixon was also scheduled to meet President Ma Ying-jeou and Foreign Minister
Timothy C.T. Yang during his planned stay, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The governor was cited by an AP report as saying Thursday U.S. time that the
trip was canceled because it could affect Missouri's efforts to make Lambert-St.
Louis International Airport a trade hub for Chinese goods.</P>
      <P>The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported Friday that Nixon was forced to cancel the
mission last week due to pressure from the Midwest China Hub Commission and the
Chinese consulate.</P>
      <P>Nixon described his dilemma at a Thursday press conference.</P>
      <P>"Leading a delegation of this magnitude, a foreign mission with a number of
factors coming into play...as we continue to assess those factors, I just
determined it wasn't an optimal time to do that, " Nixon said, according to a
St. Louis Public Radio transcript.</P>
      <P>The governor said he still planned to reschedule the visit and did not believe
that the cancellation had "killed the deal."</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman James Chang told the Central News
Agency on Friday that the governor's office expressed gratitude to Taiwan for
its assistance in arranging the visit and said the governor could not make the
trip due to "other business.".</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the governor's office did not mention anything about China
in notifying Taiwan that the trip had been canceled. Chang said the MOFA is
looking into the matter and has been trying to gather more information.</P>
      <P>Nixon's office said previously that Taiwanese businesses had expressed an
interest in purchasing an average of US$120 million in Missouri goods per year
over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Missouri exports to Taiwan totaled US$69.1 million in 2009, and initial
projections through the third quarter of 2010 indicated an increase of about 28
percent this year.</P>

      <P>The sources, from the East Asia Relations Commission, said Ayano Kosaka, the
great-granddaughter of Umeya Shokichi (1868-1934) , who forged close relations
with Sun and provided generous funding during the latter's uprising against the
Qing dynasty in the early 20th century, will mainly visit historic places

      <P>Chimei Innolux was fined 300 million euros (US$397.76 million) , the most of any
of the five companies, which also included AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Chunghwa
Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp from Taiwan and LG Display South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Gou's company is being disciplined for actions taken by Chi Mei Optoelectronics
Corp., which was not part of the Hon Hai Group before merging with Innolux
Display Corp. in March to form Chimei Innolux.</P>
      <P>Standing next to Chimei Innolux Chairman Frank Liao at the press conference on
Friday, Gou complained that the company had yet to receive any written
notification from Europe of its decision.</P>
      <P>"This goes against common legal practice, " he said. "This has compromised the
rights of (Chimei Innolux) shareholders."</P>
      <P>The head of the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer urged the
commission to explain how it figured its fines.</P>
      <P>Gou wondered how the company could be hit with the heaviest penalty when Chi Mei
Optoelectronics did not have the biggest output during the period.</P>
      <P>He suggested that in calculating the fines,  the European Commission seemed to
have also included the number of flat panels the company sold to Samsung
Electronics Inc. and LG, which Gou said would not be acceptable.</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Union failed to inform Chimei Innolux of possible
fines when it gave its nod to the merger of Chi Mei Optoelectronics and Innolux
Display, he complained.</P>
      <P>Gou also criticized the commission for not fining Samsung, the world's largest
flat panel maker. Samsung was not charged or disciplined  because  it blew the
whistle on the price-fixing arrangement to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The European Commission fined LG 215 million euros, AUO 117 million euros,
Chunghwa 9 million euros, and HannStar 8 million euros in the price-fixing case.</P>
      <P>Gou said he was not aware of any meetings between Samsung and Taiwanese  flat
panel  makers  that resulted  in the alleged price-fixing.</P>
      <P>But had there been such collusion, Gou believed Samsung could have played a
bigger role than the Taiwanese companies in the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New health insurance reform bill to be unveiled next week: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
12/10/10  22:08:54

    <TEXT>
      <P>No decision has been made on how national health insurance premiums should be
calculated in the future as the Department of Health (DOH) is still working on a
new version of the reform plan, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislative whip said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Major local newspapers reported Friday that the Executive Yuan and the KMT
legislative caucus decided late Thursday to backpedal on a proposed second-
generation health insurance reform plan, but Legislator Lin Yi-shih, who also
heads the KMT's Policy Coordination Committee, said the reports missed the mark.</P>
      <P>"What the media reports reflected were only our lawmakers' personal opinions and
will not necessarily be incorporated into the final version that the DOH is
still putting together," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus only pushed the DOH to be more inclusive and refer to
opinions expressed by various social sectors when revising the reform package,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Premier Wu Den-yih chaired a meeting of health and
finance officials and KMT lawmakers Thursday night to forge a consensus on the
national health insurance (NHI) reform plan.</P>
      <P>The meeting came after the DOH-drafted package of amendments to the National
Health Insurance Act that would have overhauled how the NHI system gets its
revenues failed to clear the legislative floor Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The reports said Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang had agreed to scrap the DOH's
widely trumpeted plan to calculate health insurance premiums on the basis of
overall household income in order to win legislative support for the reform of
the debt-laden NHI system.</P>
      <P>At the insistence of KMT legislators, it was decided at the meeting that health
premiums would still be calculated based on regular salaries of the insured, as
is the case at present, but that high earning individuals would be required to
pay higher premiums under the revised system, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the DOH is expected to come up with an improved amendment package next
week for discussion among KMT legislators.</P>
      <P>"Once we reach an internal consensus, we will begin consultations with the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>He added that the KMT would not set Dec. 14 as a deadline to pass the
legislation, countering speculation in local newspapers.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Liu Chien-kuo said that if the KMT administration indeed reversed
its NHI reform plan overnight, Premier Wu and Minister Yaung should step down to
assume political responsibility for the policy flip-flop.</P>
      <P>"The DOH has spent eight years working on the reform package. How could it
backpedal  on its own plan under pressure from KMT lawmakers," Liu said.</P>

      <P>Taipei County will earmark NT$120 million (US$3.93 million) to build the

      <P>It is expected to include many of her personal belongings and effects,

      <P>Control Yuan President  Wang Chien-shien  recently directed criticism at
undergraduates who work, saying that these students are "really stupid" for
wasting the gold period of their life on something that is "not cost-efficient."</P>
      <P>The remark drew a backlash from labor groups because he seemed unaware of the
suffering of common people and was unable to understand the financial
restrictions faced by children from poor families.</P>
      <P>Still, we think there is a bigger problem with his remark. His way of thinking
reflects a lack of imagination, understanding, tolerance and appreciation for
the differences between people.</P>
      <P>This is reminiscent of comments made earlier this year by neurology professor
Daisy Hung criticizing National Taiwan University students who ate and text-
messaged in class, and National Chi Nan University President Lee Chia-tung's
criticism a few months ago of elementary students who "waste their time" reading
comics.</P>
      <P>Wang, Hung and Lee are successful opinion leaders. But we should not forget that
in every society, there are people who are not as sensible and persevering as
they are and who occasionally want to relax.</P>
      <P>Wang's statement deserves more comment than those of Hung and Lee because Wang
is not a professor. As the head of the government branch monitoring the behavior
of civil servants, Wang should make better use of time doing his job instead of
criticizing undergraduates.</P>

      <P>The European Union recently slapped fines totaling 649 million euros (US$860
million) on four Taiwanese and one South Korean flat panel maker for acting as a
price-fixing cartel from 2001 to 2006. Samsung Electronics Co. of South Korea,
which blew the whistle on the arrangement, was not charged or disciplined.</P>
      <P>The lenient treatment of Samsung has diverted the focus on the case to the
company's whistle-blowing behavior. Sharing in the indignation of the flat panel
makers, Ministry of Economic Affairs officials vowed to get even with Samsung.</P>
      <P>But we must remind the government that the case had been under investigation for
four years. During this period, did the government look into the interaction
between Taiwanese and South Korean flat panel makers and seek countermeasures?
Is the government sure that the manufacturers did not engage in price fixing
practices?</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chimei Innolux given stiff fine for not cooperating with probe: EU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Dec.  11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chimei Innolux Corp. was given a heavy fine by the European Commission for
allegedly fixing the price of flat panels because it opted not to cooperate
with European authorities in its investigation into the case, a European Union
(EU) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux was one of five companies fined a total of 649 million euros by
the European Commission on Wednesday for operating a cartel that colluded on
flat panel prices between Oct. 5, 2001 and Feb. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Though the company, then known as Chi Mei Optoelectronics, had a lower market
share than South Korea rivals LG Display and Samsung Electronics during the
period, its 300 million euro fine was the highest among the companies involved
in the alleged conspiracy.</P>
      <P>LG Display was fined 215 million euros while Samsung, the world's biggest flat
panel maker, was not disciplined because it reported the price collusion
activities to European authorities.</P>
      <P>"Their fine is lower than that of Chimei Innolux because both Samsung
Electronics  and LG Display have cooperated  with the Commission investigation
under the Commission's Leniency Notice, " European Commission Competition Policy
spokeswoman Amelia Torres wrote in an e-mail to the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux also had this option but decided not to avail itself of it,
Torres said.</P>
      <P>"Chi Mei Optoelectronics had all possibilities to blow the whistle itself
between October 2001 when the cartel started until March 2006 when Samsung blew
the whistle. If it had done so, it would have received no fine," she said.</P>
      <P>Torres added that Chi Mei could have cooperated with the European Commission
after March 2006 to obtain a reduction of its fine, but "it has chosen not to do
so."</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux did not immediately respond to Torres comments.</P>
      <P>Terry Gou, the chairman of Chimei Innolux's parent company, Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co., strongly protested the fine on Friday, saying his company would
not pay money it should not have to pay and questioning why its fine was out of
proportion to its market share.</P>
      <P>Gou, who was drawn into the case after Hon Hai's Innolux Display Corp. formally
merged with Chi Mei Optoelectronics in March of this year, also complained that
the company had yet to receive formal notification of how the European
Commission calculated the fine.</P>
      <P>Torres acknowledged that the full text of the decision with all the reasoning
had yet to be sent, but she called it standard procedure and said it would be
forwarded to the company in the coming days.</P>
      <P>"The company's lawyers were informed one week before of the likely date of the
Commission decision, " Torres said. "The full text of the 140 pages long
decision will contain a full explanation on how the fines were calculated."</P>
      <P>Gou said Chimei Innolux would wait for the document before deciding whether to
appeal the case. Regardless of what the company decides, it will have three
months to respond.</P>
      <P>"Chimei Innolux has three months after the notification of the decision to
either pay the fine or, in case the company would appeal, to provide for a bank
guarantee or a provisional payment,"  Torres said.</P>
      <P>Gou also said Friday that he was not aware of any meetings between Samsung and
Taiwanese flat panel makers that resulted in price collusion.</P>
      <P>But Torres made it clear that the European Commission was accusing Chi Mei
Optoelectronics staff rather than Gou of having knowledge of the cartel meetings
and the price fixing that allegedly occurred.</P>
      <P>Aside from Chimei Innolux, three other Taiwanese manufacturers were fined in the
case. AU Optronics was fined 117 million euros, Chunghwa Picture Tubes was fined
9 million euros, and HannStar Display was fined 8 million euros.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Hon Hai head protests price-fixing fine</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/11/10  15:49:03
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Terry Gou, chairman of the Taiwan-based Hon Hai Group, the world's largest
contract electronics manufacturer, strongly protested on Friday a 300 million
euro (US$397 million) fine slapped on the company's flat panel manufacturing
subsidiary Chimei Innolux Corp. by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>"We will not easily pay the money that we should not have to pay in the first
place, " Gou said after a meeting with Taipei-based European trade officials.</P>
      <P>Gou paid the visit to the European Union representative office in Taiwan along
with Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiu and Chimei Innolux
Chairman Frank Liao, after the European Union's top decision maker fined five
manufacturers a total of 649 million euros on Wednesday for price collusion from
2001 to 2006.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chimei Innolux, AU Optronics Crop. (AUO), Chunghwa Picture Tubes
Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. from Taiwan, as well as LG Display from South
Korea were also fined.</P>
      <P>At a press conference  following the Friday meeting,  Gou questioned why Chimei
Innolux could be hit with the heaviest penalty when its output during the period
in question was not as big as that of some of the other companies.</P>
      <P>The European Commission fined LG Display 215 million euros, AUO 117 million
euros, Chunghwa 9 million euros and HannStar 8 million euros.</P>
      <P>Samsung, the world's largest flat panel maker, was not charged or disciplined
because  it blew the whistle on the price-fixing arrangement to the European
Commission.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Gou blasted Samsung of South Korea for being a "whistle blower" in the case and
accused it of masterminding the price-fixing operations.</P>
      <P>He questioned the fairness of the disciplinary action, when Samsung, whom he
described as a repeated price-fixing offender, was not punished in the case
because it turned itself in.</P>
      <P>"It is an economic war between Taiwan and South Korea, Gou said.</P>
      <P>"They have (Korean companies) used every means to kill us, but Taiwan cannot go
without a flat panel industry,  " he said, complaining that the government has
not only ignored the battle, but even stands in the way of local flat panel
producers' plans to invest in China.</P>
      <P>Gou criticized the government's restrictions on the island's panel manufacturing
industry, which he said has caused them to lose market share in China to South
Korean competitors.</P>
      <P>He said he understood that the technology needed to be kept in Taiwan, but the
rising trend of environmental protection and capital funding problems were
challenging local businesses.</P>
      <P>The industry must be located where markets exist to keep its competitiveness
sharp, Gou said, referring to the reluctance of the government to pass an
investment project proposed by AUO to build flat panel plants in China. (Dec.
11, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai leader issued a six-point statement Friday, in which he questioned
how the European Commission calculated its fine on Chimei Innolux, of which Gou
said he is the largest shareholder.</P>
      <P>Gou wondered why Chimei Innolux drew the biggest fine of the companies involved
even though it did not have the biggest market share during the period in
question.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the legality of the procedure involved in imposing the fine
because the company had yet to receive written notification from Europe of its
decision, and he complained of the lighter penalty imposed on South Korean
manufacturers even though they were the biggest players in the market.</P>
      <P>In response to the penalty on AUO, one of Taiwan's largest panel producers, AUO
Chairman K.Y. Lee said Friday that his company would do everything it could to
fight against the unreasonable treatment.</P>
      <P>The case has raised an outcry from local flat panel business, who claim it was
South Korean companies that convened the so-called cartel meetings to discuss
pricing issues.</P>
      <P>Now they have offered United States and European authorities data and
information produced in those meetings to burn their competitors, which local
manufacturers branded as a "mean" tactic. (Dec. 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Terry Gou, head of the Hon Hai Group, urged the government to fight together
with the industrial sector, for the country's economic interests.</P>
      <P>He also called for the government to accelerate procedures to allow panel
producers to establish a bigger presence in China. "Don't let them die here," he
said.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs unveiled a 10-year program on Friday to help
promote the development of the flat panel sector, including pushing for zero-
tariff treatment for Taiwanese panel exports to China. (Dec. 11, 2010).</P>

      <P>The number of suspected child abuse cases reported to authorities rose
dramatically in the first half of 2010 compared to a year earlier, indicating
increased awareness in society on the issue, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>A total of 13,130 cases were reported from January to June, 40.4 percent more
than during the same period in 2009, and 9,039 of those cases, an increase of
39.77 percent, were confirmed, according to MOI statistics.</P>
      <P>Those aged 6-11 accounted for 3,305, or 36.56 percent, of the victims, and those

      <P>Japanese runners Ryochi Sekiya and Mami Kudo were both determined to win the
2010 Soochow International 24-hour ultramarathon for good reason when the
competition started at 9 a.m. Saturday in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Kudo hoped that by the time the race ends on 9 a.m. Sunday, she will have
surpassed her own world record of 254.425 kilometers, set in the Taiwan event
last year, while Sekiya was aiming for his sixth men's title in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sekiya and Kudo were among 30 runners from around the world participating in the
unusual race, a competition organized by Soochow University (SCU) in which all
participants run as far as they can over the 24-hour period on the school's 200
meter track.</P>
      <P>Whoever runs the farthest is named the winner.</P>
      <P>Kudo, 46, won the race last year and set the women's 24-hour marathon world
record.  She will face a tough challenge from 39-year-old French rival Anne-
Celile Fontaine, who has a personal best of 243.644 km.</P>
      <P>With a personal  best of 274.884  km that outshines  his challengers, 43-year-

      <P>Despite a recent drop in Taiwan's unemployment rate, a high percentage of new
graduates have not found their first full-time jobs, according to the results of
a survey released Saturday by an online employment broker.</P>
      <P>The survey by the 1111 Job Bank found that 33.8 percent of those graduating from
university this past summer remained jobless six month after their graduation.</P>
      <P>The ratio was higher than the 23.5 percent recorded at the same time in 2009,
but lower than the 45 percent in 2008 -- when the global financial crisis
erupted.</P>
      <P>This indicates that this year's graduates have not benefited from the employment
promotion measures launched by the government in 2009, the broker said.</P>
      <P>Also, the average job-seeking period among new graduates reached 42 days this
year, longer than the average of 36 days in 2009 and 39 days in 2008.</P>
      <P>This may be because the new graduates have a lower sense of crisis following the
recovery of the economy and the employment market, the company said.</P>
      <P>Among those new graduates who have landed jobs, their starting salary averaged
NT$27,428, higher than the NT$24,358 in 2009 and NT$25,726 in 2008.</P>

      <P>"FIFA" and "filing taxes" were the two most searched phrases on Google Inc.'s
most searched query list in Taiwan this year, according to Google's Taiwan
branch.</P>
      <P>The "five special municipality elections, " which were held Nov. 27, "typhoon,"
and "Flora Expo," an ongoing event in Taipei, rounded out the top five.</P>
      <P>The bottom five in the top 10 were transgender model "Alicia Liu, " singer "Lin
Yu-chun, " Chinese beggar "Brother Sharp, " the "Asian Games, " and
controversial English teacher "Carrie Chen, " Google Taiwan said in a statement
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Of the top 10, only "FIFA" was searched for in English.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Google produced another list solely featuring the search queries of
smartphone users in Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>The new list reflected the growing popularity of smartphones in the country. In
contrast to the overall search, only two of the top 10 most popular search
queries from smartphones were in Chinese.</P>
      <P>"FIFA" placed second behind "HTC, " and was followed by "CNN, " "MLB (Major
League Baseball), " "Yahoo, " "Facebook," and "iPhone."</P>
      <P>The first Chinese-language query on the smartphone list -- "desktop wallpaper"
-- ranked eighth, ahead of "NBA" (National Basketball Association) , and the
other Chinese-language entry, "Girls' Generation, " a nine-member girl pop group
from South Korea.</P>
      <P>These results, Google Taiwan said, showed the effectiveness of online
advertising and users' interest in getting real-time scores from big sports
events.</P>
      <P>The top 10 brand search queries overall were "iPad, " "Google, " "iPhone,"
"Facebook," "Yahoo," "MSN, " "HTC, " "YouTube," "Tsann Kuen Enterprise Co. (a
local electronics retailer) " and "7-Eleven (Taiwan's largest convenience chain
store)."</P>
      <P>All but Tsann Kuen were entered in English.</P>
      <P>The top 10 movies searched by general users on Google in 2010 were "Inception, "
"Monga (the Taiwanese gangster movie) , " local climate change documentary
"Plus/minus 2 degrees C -- the Truth Formosa Must Face," "Kick-Ass, ""Skyline, "
"Aftershock, " "The Hurt Locker, ""Seven Days in Heaven, " "Alice in Wonderland"
and "Shutter Island."</P>
      <P>For smartphone users, the top 10 most searched films were "Iron Man 2, "
"Inception, " "Twilight, " "Monga, " "Toy Story 3, " "Ip Man 2, " "Skyline, "
"Alice in Wonderland, " "14 Blades" and "A-Team."</P>
      <P>Movie names on both lists were all entered in Chinese.</P>
      <P>Google found that the smartphone search keywords better matched Taiwan's top 10
movie list for the year than the general search queries did, as people often
search for information about movies just before they go see them at a theater.</P>
      <P>Only three movies in the general search list were among Taiwan's top 10 box
office successes, compared with eight movies on the smartphone search list,
according to Google Taiwan.</P>

fall of the Qing dynasty and encompassed mainland China until 1949.</P>
      <P>After losing a civil war to the Communists that year, Chiang Kai-shek and his
Kuomintang forces retreated to Taiwan where the ROC has continued to exist.</P>
      <P>Recordings of political leaders such as the country's founding father Sun Yat-
sen in 1924, late President Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo, and interviews
with prominent individuals in the fields of economics, education and the arts
are covered in the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Fan Hsiang-lin, RTI vice president, said the display even included a New Year's
talk by Chiang Ching-kuo, recorded on Oct. 20, 1987, that was never made public
because Chiang passed away on Jan. 13, 1988 before the arrival of the Lunar New
Year.</P>
      <P>The exhibition also covers recordings of Taiwan's famous singers, from the early
days to more recent years. The voices of Jan Hsiao-lin, Teresa Teng, Louise
Tsui, Hong Yi-fong, Kimbo Hu, and A-mei can be heard on the spot.</P>
      <P>Recordings of the distinct sounds of some of Taiwan's public transportation
systems -- announcements made in MRT stations, the sounds of Alishan's mountain
train, a ferry horn in Keelung harbor, and jet skis in Penghu -- are also
featured.</P>
      <P>Attending the opening ceremony, President Ma Ying-jeou said he was very moved by
Sun's talk, and he expressed the hope that the voices of history could be
preserved forever.</P>
      <P>Asked about the most unforgettable sounds in his life, Ma said he missed the
voices of street vendors in the old days.</P>
      <P>The sound exhibition will run through Mar. 13, 2011 in Taipei and then tour
Tainan, Taichung, Chiayi, and Yilan until Dec. 18, 2011.</P>

      <P>The government is gearing up for the arrival of the Republic of China's 100th
founding anniversary when the new year kicks in, as a preparatory committee has
planned diverse celebration activities across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first in a string of activities will kick off on Dec. 31 at Dajia  Riverbank
Park in Taipei  City,  where  a large-scale three-dimensional New Year's Eve
countdown will be held.</P>
      <P>The year-long celebration will come to a conclusion on Dec. 31, 2011, when 1
million cyclists start riding simultaneously in a clockwise direction from 10
points around the country, according to the committee, which held its third
meeting on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew, who heads the preparatory committee, said the year-
long celebration is aimed at making Taiwan more visible around the world,
cementing national unity and forging harmony in society.</P>
      <P>Siew proposed  that the four venues  of the 2010  Taipei International Flora
Exposition being held in Taipei until April 25, 2011 be preserved for one more
year to give Taiwan's people more of a chance to visit them.</P>
      <P>Prominent events will also be held throughout the year in other parts of Taiwan
to promote Taiwan's visibility in the international arena, the vice president
added.</P>
      <P>Reporting on the same occasion, Council for Cultural Affairs Minister Emile
Sheng said a peace ceremony will be held on Aug. 23 on the outlying Kinmen
Island to commemorate the 823 Artillery Bombardment that was launched by the
Chinese communists in 1958.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 10 National Day, an evening party will be organized in central Taiwan's
Taichung  City to mark the ROC's centennial anniversary.</P>
      <P>To give people a clearer picture of the scope of the centennial festivities,
Sheng said a virtual "Taiwan museum" has been set up on the Internet that
introduces the individual celebration activities.</P>
      <P>People interested in obtaining related information about the centennial
celebration can log on to the official website -- taiwanroc100.tw -- beginning

      <P>Raising the surcharge on cigarettes to generate revenue for the financially
ailing national health insurance (NHI) system, as some have proposed, could only
be done if the law is revised, a Department of Health official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>An amendment to the Tobacco Hazard Prevention Act would have to be proposed and
passed if the government wanted to adjust the tobacco health  and  welfare
surcharge  higher,  said  Chiou  Shu-ti, director-general of the Bureau of
Health Promotion under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The DOH doubled the tobacco health surcharge to NT$20 (US$0.66) per pack of
cigarettes last year by going through that process, she said.</P>
      <P>Chiou was responding to a suggestion made earlier in the day by Vice Premier
Sean Chen, who believed that increasing the tobacco surcharge would be the best
option to bridge the health insurance system's deficits if expanding premium
revenues did not fully cover them.</P>
      <P>Although the law stipulates that the surcharge can be reviewed every two years
and allows it to be raised further, Chiou said she believed another hike would
still not be enough to free the health insurance system from its financial woes.</P>
      <P>Raising the surcharge again would not necessarily mean that the NHI's revenue
would continue to grow, Chiou said, because the resulting higher prices of
cigarettes could reduce the smoking population and revenue base.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, the Bureau of National Health Insurance had an accumulated
deficit of approximately NT$53.3 billion as of the end of August.</P>
      <P>Most of the compulsory system's revenue comes from insurance premiums, but it
has also drawn funds from the tobacco surcharge, which raised NT$36 billion a
year after the surcharge hike took effect in June 2009, nearly double the NT$20
billion a year it raised previously.</P>
      <P>The NHI system received 70 percent of the revenue, or about NT$25 billion, this
year to help fund its operations.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will call a meeting next week to discuss
how to respond to heavy fines imposed by the European Union on four local flat
panel makers for alleged price fixing, the ministry said in a statement
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, announced on Wednesday fines
against LG Display of South Korea and four Taiwanese companies -- Chimei Innolux
Corp., AU Optronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display
Corp. -- totaling 649 million euros (US$857.85 million) for fixing flat panel
prices between Oct. 5, 2001 and Feb. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that the stiff penalties would have an adverse impact on the
development of the local display panel industry.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese companies have not yet received the formal EU decision
detailing the fine. The ministry said it has asked Taiwan's representative
office in the EU to get detailed information about the ruling.</P>
      <P>"We will also invite executives of the four companies and officials from
relevant government agencies to a brainstorming session next week to hammer out
response strategies, " the statement said.</P>
      <P>On complaints by Terry Gou, chairman of Chimei Innolux's parent company Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., that the government should not continue blocking local
panel makers from investing in China, the ministry said the government has
adopted regulations that allow high-tech companies, including those in the
display panel industry, to invest in China under two principles.</P>
      <P>The principles require applicants to preserve their technology lead over China
and to promise further investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To date, only AU Optronics (AUO) has filed an application with the ministry to
build a 7.5-generation flat panel factory in China, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Referring to Gou's complaints, Premier Wu Den-yih also said Saturday that the

      <P>Flat panel maker Au Optronics Corp.'s application to build a 7.5th-generation

official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fan Liang-tung, executive secretary of the Investment Commission under the

company's plan to invest US$3 billion to construct a new factory in Kunshan,
Jiangsu Province has passed critical screening of key technology involved in the
project.</P>
      <P>"The project is now pending screening of certain formality details, " Fan said,
adding that the Investment Commission will deal with the case soon.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, he said, the case can be approved before the end of
December.</P>
      <P>Fan's remarks came after local newspapers reported that the world's top two flat
panel makers -- Samsung Electronics and LG Display of South Korea -- will set up
advanced factories in China to further expand their market shares.</P>
      <P>Samsung reportedly will invest US$2.258 billion to build a 7.5th-generation flat
panel plant in Suzhou while LG will invest US$4 billion to construct a 8.5th-
generation production line in Guangzhou.</P>

      <P>An agricultural assistance project launched by a private Taiwanese group in
southern Vietnam in 2007 has begun to bear fruit, drawing praise from a former
prime minister of the Southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>A number of the fruits and vegetables being cultivated under the initiative,
including Taiwanese guavas, jujubes, bitter melon, eggplants and cucumbers, were
on display Saturday at a party in Cu Chi County northwest of Ho Chi Minh City
held to celebrate the project's progress.</P>
      <P>Former Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai, who was born and brought up in
Cu Chi, praised the Chinfon Group and Taiwanese agricultural specialists for
their invaluable contributions  to improving agricultural development in
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Phan, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2006, also expressed high
expectations for the Chinfon Project, hoping that it would not only be a model
in Cu Chi but also be expanded to the whole of Vietnam.</P>
      <P>The agricultural assistance project was started by Taiwan-based Chinfon Group --
one of Taiwan's largest motorbike manufacturers -- in Cu Chi in 2007 to help
local farmers improve their techniques, raise output and sharpen their marketing
skills.</P>
      <P>The Chinfon Group introduced the farmers association strategy that has been
successfully applied in Taiwan for decades to Cu Chi and sent Vietnamese "seed
farmers" -- many of them university graduates -- to Taiwan to pick up new skills
and knowledge.</P>
      <P>At the party, the Vietnamese government presented the prestigious Medal of
Agricultural Contribution to Chinfon Group Chairman Huang Shih-hui and Hu Chia-
chi, one of Taiwan's former representatives in Vietnam, for their efforts in
making the project possible and successful.</P>
      <P>Later, Huang signed a new agreement with Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development, committing to a second round of agricultural cooperation from
2011 to 2013.</P>

      <P>The first academy aimed at promoting Taiwanese culture will open in Los Angeles
next spring, Taiwan's office in the West Coast city said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kung Chung-cheng, director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
(TECO) in Los Angeles, said that preparations, including planning the courses
and hiring teachers for the academy, have largely been completed,</P>
      <P>The planned courses will cover calligraphy, glove puppetry, Taiwan's tea
culture, and language training.</P>
      <P>A crucial feature of the academy will be the teaching of traditional Chinese
characters, in contrast with the simplified version used in China and taught in
Confucius Institutes set up by China around the world to promote Chinese
language and culture.</P>
      <P>Hui Ban Giang, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office's Cultural
Division, said the Taiwan Academy will be easily differentiated from the Chinese
institutes because they will focus more on promoting culture and introduce
customs and cultural traits that are distinctive to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Language training will also be available to complement the academy's cultural
component, Giang said.</P>
      <P>The opening of these Taiwan academies around the world was one of the major
campaign pledges of President Ma Ying-jeou during the 2008 presidential
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President stresses fairness, quality, efficiency for NHI reform</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that a proposed second-generation health
insurance reform plan, which failed to get through the Legislative Yuan last
week, should emphasize the principles of fairness, quality and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The authorities involved should exchange opinions to fine-tune the technical
details of the national health insurance (NHI) reform plan -- mainly on how
health insurance premiums should be calculated -- based on those principles, Ma
said during a visit to the outlying island of Penghu.</P>
      <P>He said Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang has agreed to review the proposed NHI
reform plan, after a DOH-drafted package of amendments to the National Health
Insurance Act failed to clear the legislative floor Dec. 7.</P>
      <P>Yaung will again meet with legislative caucus members of the ruling Kuomintang
on Monday to inform the lawmakers how a new version of the amendment package
could be modified to forge the widest consensus possible on the issue, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The plan that failed to clear the legislative body would have calculated  health
insurance premiums on the basis of overall household income rather than
salaries, as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the modified version Yaung is considering will preserve
the household income formula, but Ma stressed that it was more important for the
plan to reflect the three principles he articulated rather than apply a specific
formula.</P>
      <P>In related news, the president reiterated the government's resolve to develop
the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) , located to the west of Kaohsiung in the Taiwan
Strait, into a low-carbon dioxide emissions island.</P>
      <P>He said the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development has
given a green light to the building of submarine cables between Penghu and
Taiwan proper, which will allow Penghu residents to sell the extra power
generated from wind turbines to Taiwan Power Company.</P>
      <P>On a complaint raised by Penghu County Councilor Yang Yao that the airfare
subsidy the central government gives to Penghu residents is relatively low, Ma
said Legislator Lin Ping-kun has submitted an amendment that would raise the
subsidy to about 30 percent of airfares.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Penghu residents currently get 20 percent of their airfares
subsidized, lower than the subsidies received by Matsu residents that can reach
up to 40 percent of the ticket's value.</P>
      <P>"All people concerned are still working to at least increase the subsidy to 30
percent," Ma told Penghu residents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Public hearing on health insurance reform may be held</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang will likely hold a public hearing on a hotly debated
national health insurance reform package after the Department of Health (DOH)
unveils a modified version of the plan on Monday, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The government's effort to push a health care overhaul has been fraught with
controversy, and on Dec. 7, the plan was rejected by legislators because of
concerns over its fairness and lack of details on how health insurance premiums
would be calculated.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang, who has pledged to step down if the reform
backfires, reportedly agreed to scrap his idea of calculating premiums based on
total household income, which he argued would have eased the Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) financial woes.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear, however, how a modified version of the plan would define
income on which premiums are calculated. At present, health insurance premiums
are calculated as a percentage of salary.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that no decision had been made on whether the government
would raise a health surcharge on tobacco products that was already doubled only
last year.</P>
      <P>"It's too early to tell but everything is under discussion," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has been tight-lipped about what it will present Monday,
reports have indicated that Yaung plans to expand the definition of "individual
salary" to include overtime, year-end bonuses, and other outside incentives as
part of overall income.</P>
      <P>The speculation has angered a health insurance watchdog group, which worried
that such a calculation method might end up hurting wage earners if employers
were unwilling to shoulder a larger share of the premiums.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, Wu met with related DOH officials in a bid to salvage the health
insurance system.</P>
      <P>"During the meeting, we made two preliminary decisions. The new health insurance
plan will follow the spirit of the proposed second-generation health plan. Also,
many agreed that the suggestion of using total household income as a basis for
calculating premiums could be difficult to execute," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu rejected reports that Yaung's original proposal had been officially nixed.</P>
      <P>He said that once Yaung has presented the modified version to KMT lawmakers, the
caucus would discuss the plan among themselves and then hold a public hearing to
get outside opinions on the plan before making a final decision.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lin Yi-shih also reiterated that no final plan has been decided,
saying that everything was still in the negotiating stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Key to Economic Cooperation Committee's success</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/12/10  17:23:45
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's almost three months since the historic Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China went into effect. Both parties have
agreed to set up a cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) as a
platform for further negotiations to make ECFA a success.</P>
      <P>To achieve its intended purposes, complementary measures would have to be taken
to empower the Economic Cooperation Committee with adequate support and
authority. With respect to this, the government needs to clearly define its
roles and status so it will operate effectively to achieve the ECFA targets.</P>
      <P>What needs to be "adjusted" in this regard is the role of the Mainland Affairs
Council, which deals with major policy issues towards China, but not the day-to-
day economic and investment exchanges -- what the ECFA seeks to promote.</P>
      <P>Because the real issues ECFA seeks to deal with through the Economic
Cooperation  Committee  tend  to be complicated  and professional, it is
questionable whether the MAC has the competency or energy to continue to play
its "leading" role here.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  probably as a result of the opposition from responsible government
ministries and agencies including the MAC, the Economic Cooperation Committee
has been excluded from participating in the negotiations with China over
intellectual property, medical cooperation or goods and services trade pacts
with China.</P>
      <P>And it is exactly these "substantive" pacts with China that would benefit both
sides of the Taiwan Strait in the spirit and letter of the ECFA. It is time
indeed that the government authorized the ECC to play its critical role to
realize ECFA goals. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 12, 2010)</P>

      <P>More than 50 percent of consumers around the globe, including in Taiwan, use
Internet-based television or video services every week, reflecting a growing
interest in on-demand content, a study by wireless network maker Ericsson AB has
found.</P>
      <P>People are spending up to 35 percent of their leisure time on watching various
types of content, the study found, with 93 percent of respondents still watching
TV every week and more than 70 percent using "time shifting" services, such as
streaming, downloading or watching recorded broadcasts.</P>
      <P>Over 50 percent of respondents said they wanted to connect their personal
computers to televisions to be able to watch online television content with
other programming.</P>
      <P>Regarding the preferred devices for watching TV, 37 percent of respondents
expressed interest in having a touch screen tablet connected to their
television, which would allow them to keep an eye on private communications,
such as reading e-mails or social networking, while watching TV.</P>
      <P>The study collected responses  from people in seven major countries with
advanced video application development -- the United States, England, Germany,
Spain, Sweden, China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The state-backed Institute for Information Industry (III), which helped Ericsson
conduct the study in Taiwan, said user preferences for television or video
services in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung differed.</P>
      <P>About 71 percent of respondents living in Taipei were interested in time
shifting services, while 51 percent of those in Taichung preferred to record TV
programs with a timer, and 73 percent of those in Kaohsiung were most interested
in having a list of favorite programming that could be accessed on demand.</P>
      <P>Despite the differing preferences, the study showed that all respondents were
generally willing to try new types of video services, said Benson Chen, a senior
analyst with III, in an e-mail.</P>
      <P>"All they want is to have more choices and higher quality TV services," Chen

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Sunday the government's determination to make
Taiwan a global Hakka cultural research and interaction center.</P>
      <P>President Ma made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2010 National
Hakka Conference in Taipei, showing off his Hakka language proficiency by
delivering his eight-minute speech entirely in the dialect.</P>
      <P>He received a big round of applause from the conference attendees -- nearly 500
representatives from Hakka communities around the country.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is glad that he promulgated the Hakka Basic Law in January, about 10
days after the Legislative Yuan passed it, to allow the administration to use
national resources to turn Taiwan into a global Hakka culture research and
interaction center.</P>
      <P>Under the basic law, Ma said, the administration has and will continue to
deliver his campaign platform to accelerate efforts to preserve Hakka culture
and language, and to help bolster the development of Hakka industries and
innovative businesses.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the conference, Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA) Minister Huang
Yu-cheng said after the Hakka Basic Law was put into effect on Jan. 27, the
Hakka affairs administration has been incorporated into the national public
servants examination.</P>
      <P>The CHA has also finalized opinions and suggestions to determine that Taiwan's
Hakka Day will be observed on Jan. 20 on the lunar calendar each year starting
from 2011, as part of the efforts to mark the Hakka spirit and culture, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Resolutions of the conference will be referred to the CHA to be used as future
reference, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the Hakka Basic Law, any townships, cities and communities in which Hakka
people account for over 33 percent of the population will be listed as key Hakka
culture development districts where the Hakka dialect will serve as a required
language at official events and in government agencies.</P>
      <P>A total of 61 townships, cities and communities around Taiwan are qualified to
serve as Hakka culture hubs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the law stipulates that the government should promote the
circulation of the Hakka language and proficiency certification in the dialect,
establish a Hakka language data bank and take measures to encourage  Hakka
academic research while encouraging local colleges and universities to open
departments and institutes focusing on Hakka affairs research.</P>
      <P>The law also demands the protection of Hakka media rights and assistance in the
establishment of Hakka-language broadcasting and television channels.</P>
      <P>According to CHA statistics released in 2008, Hakka people comprise over 25
percent of the country's population, meaning there are 5.88 million people in
Taiwan who identify themselves as Hakka people or as having Hakka blood.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's conspicuous absence from the Nobel Peace
Prize awarding ceremony on Friday has caught the attention of many people in
Taiwan as its government plans to invite as many previous award winners as
possible to join in a celebration of the 100th birthday of the Republic of China
(ROC) next year.</P>
      <P>According to Emile Sheng, minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs, a
highlight of the government's celebrations of the ROC's 100th anniversary will
be a peace ceremony at the offshore island of Kinmen on Aug. 23, to remember
Communist China's 1958 bombardment of the island aimed at staging an invasion of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sheng said at least one Nobel Peace Prize winner has agreed to attend the
ceremony during which a "bell of peace" will be tolled to remind people all over
the world of the importance of -- and Taiwan's strong wish for -- maintaining
peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of reports from Taiwanese newspapers on the topic.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Sheng insisted that he won't publish the names of the guests of honor until June
next year in order to avoid political interference that might spoil the holy
event at the Peace Plaza on Kuningtou, Kinmen, where a fierce battle between the
troops of the ROC and Communist China took place more than a half century ago.</P>
      <P>He said the word "peace" will be inscribed around the peace bell in 100
languages to demonstrate the ROC's strong will to work for peace not just across
the Taiwan Strait, but also around the globe.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The bell tolling activity will be held on the anniversary of the 1958 Communist
Chinese bombardment of Kinmen island and in attendance will be Nobel Peace Prize
laureates.</P>
      <P>The bell will be made from the cannons that have fallen on the battleground.
Marking the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ROC, the government hopes
the ceremony will bring at least 100 years of peace between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Who will be invited to the Kinmen bell tolling ceremony is something worth
watching now that the government has said it has sent out invitations to as many
previous winners as it can.</P>
      <P>Would the pro-China Ma Ying-jeou administration invite Liu Xiaobo and the Dalai
Lama, whom the Ma government has once obstructed from visiting Taiwan, in
disregard of China's angry reaction?</P>
      <P>As President Barack Obama was the 2009 winner of the prize, whether he would be
present for that occasion would be of great political significance in that it
would test the government's ability to score a diplomatic breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Indeed, many Nobel Peace Prize laureates have been invited to visit Taiwan and
their visits have all aroused great interest here. They include Mikhail
Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Lech Walesa and the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize committee has awarded 91
prizes to 121 individuals or groups, of whom 28 are still living. Among them and
also well known to Taiwanese are former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former South African President Nelson
Mandela and Burma's democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was recently
released from house arrest.</P>
      <P>Since, as Presidential Office officials have pointed out, Ma was the first Asian
leader to call on China to release Liu Xiaobo, it would be interesting to see if
he would "dare" invite Liu over to the 2011 Peace Bell ceremony on Kinmen, which
lies just opposite the Chinese mainland.</P>

      <P>Japanese runners on Sunday won the men's and women's titles at the 2010 Soochow
International Ultra-Marathon in Taiwan and successfully defended their titles in
the 24-hour race.</P>
      <P>Ryochi Sekiya, 43, ran a total of 268.1 kilometers in 24 hours to win the men's
division in the Taipei competition for the sixth time.</P>
      <P>Countrywoman Mami Kudo outran all of her competitors to win the women's division
with a distance of 239.3 kilometers, well short of her world record of 254.425
kilometers set last year.</P>
      <P>France's Anne-Celile Fontaine finished second.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Luo Wei-ming and 51-year-old Huang Yen-ling took third place in the
men's and women's divisions respectively with distances of 229.2 km and 204.4
km.</P>
      <P>Luo said the 24-hour ultramarathon, which went from 9 a.m. Saturday to 9 a.m.
Sunday, was particularly difficult because there were no breaks, and running
through the night interrupted the sleep cycle.</P>
      <P>Huang, who participated in the Taitung Super Triathon in October, said the
ultramarathon was more challenging than the triathon because runners were easily
bored circling the same track around the clock.</P>
      <P>The event, which took place on the 400-meter track at Soochow University's
Waishuanghsi campus, was held for the 10th time. Thirty runners from around the
world participated in the event.</P>
      <P>To track the runners' laps and distances run, Soochow University invested more
than NT$1 million (US$33,256) on a chip timing system to increase accuracy.</P>
      <P>Tied to the runners' legs, the chips automatically sent the data to the
computer, which could then be seen in real time on the official website.</P>
      <P>But the runners seemed to prefer an old-fashioned system, if for no other reason
than to keep them going. Even with the new technology, volunteers would still
flip numbered panels to inform runners how many laps they had completed as a
form of encouragement.</P>
      <P>"Runners can see the number on the panel when they finish a lap, with the
student volunteers cheering them on. Such interaction helps the runners keep
going and perform better, " said Kuo Fong-chou, deputy director of the Chinese
Taipei Road Running Association, who persuaded the school to purchase the chip
system.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health's proposed amendments to Taiwan's National Health
Insurance (NHI) Act, focusing on the so-called second generation premium system,
were lambasted by legislators for good reasons: the policy makers did not fully
understand the principles of fairness and efficacy.</P>
      <P>While the amendments seek to make the premium-payment scale fairer for all
citizens, the proposal for calculating the premium based on a household's total
income was seen as potentially leading to even greater unfairness. Little wonder
it has been roundly criticized, even by the ruling party's lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The government might have thought that it would be fair for higher income
earners to shoulder a proportionally greater share of the NHI's financial
burden. A more reasonable formula to look at this, according to academics, is to
design the premium paying scheme based on the total tax and fees paid to the
government so that the national income would be more evenly distributed among
all citizens after health insurance premiums have been collected.</P>
      <P>One way to achieve fairer income distribution is what the opposition party has
proposed, and the government is considering: collect NHI premium from people
paying stock and land transaction taxes. Such premium would go a long way to
filling in the financial shortages in the NHI program.</P>
      <P>Squeezing some money from stock and land transactions would not increase the
government's administrative cost. In contrast, the household  income method is
both complicated  and inefficient, increasing administrative cost to boot.</P>
      <P>The government should give some serious thought to why its proposal on second-
generation NHI reform has been regarded as both unfair and inefficient and make
necessary adjustments before putting forward a new set of amendments to the
legislature. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 12, 2010) enditem/cs nnnn</P>

      <P>Thirteen dogs have boarded a flight to the United States to find new homes
there, in the latest attempt to save some of Taiwan's many stray dogs, animal
rescue workers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The dogs were rescued from southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, where they were
found to have been abused or suffering from illnesses, rescue workers said. The
dogs were first taken by train from Kaohsiung to Taipei before boarding the
flight.</P>
      <P>There were sad stories behind every abused dog, said rescue worker Chang Ya-hui,
who led four volunteers of the non-profit Animal Rescue Team Taiwan, to
accompany the dogs on the train.</P>
      <P>For example, she said, Andrew, one of the dogs who will be sent to Seattle, was
covered with insect bites when he was found in Linyuan Township, while Irene,
another abused dog who lost her eye sight, had suffered from serious skin
diseases.</P>
      <P>The group of U.S.-bound dogs also included eight puppies that were abused by
foreign migrant workers and were later rescued from an oyster harbor, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>While an increasing number of Taiwanese people have become aware of the need to
help stray animals, the adoption rate is still low, putting pressure on animal
shelters with limited budgets to care for the dogs.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that by taking the dogs to shelters in the U.S., their chances of
being adopted will increase.</P>
      <P>Since 2004, the rescue team has carried out more than 200 such cases, flying a
total of 1,470 animals rescued in Taiwan to North America, by cooperating with
similar organizations in the U.S and Canada.</P>

      <P>School principals' efforts at preventing bullying on campus will become part of
their performance review, amid increasing cases of school violence in Taiwan,
the Ministry of Education said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under a proposed anti-bullying program, how effective schools are in preventing
bullying will be included in principals' evaluations, said Wang Fu-lin, director
of the ministry's Department of Military Training Education.</P>
      <P>If principals do not properly tackle bullying or report about the problems in
time, it could affect their ratings, as well as whether they can serve another
term, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang added that violence  on campus  often occurs due to insensitivity  or
indifference  on the  part  of the  school administration.</P>
      <P>Local governments will also be punished if they are not committed to taking
measures to deal with school violence, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The ministry is collecting information on bullying prevention programs in other
countries to come up with a specific project to tackle this problem, said Wang.</P>

      <P>The investment deal was originally scheduled to be signed by the heads of the
two organizations in charge of negotiations -- Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and President Chen Yunlin of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- in their next round of
meeting in Taiwan before the end of year.</P>
      <P>But the signing of the deal is set to be postponed due to differences in details
of the proposed pact, especially with regard to whether any international
arbitration  mechanism should be introduced in dispute settlement of the trade
pact, according to officials involved in the pre-meeting talks.</P>
      <P>"It would be good for the proposed pact to be shelved until terms acceptable to
both sides are worked out," the president said.</P>
      <P>President Ma would not comment on reports that Taiwan's demand for an
international arbitration mechanism is the key source of disagreement behind the
two sides, saying "the controversies go beyond that and need to be solved
gradually."</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the investment protection agreement will protect Taiwanese
investors in China. Investors have invested around US$100 billion in China over
the years, but due to tense relations in the past, the two sides have yet to
reach an agreement involving business dispute resolution and protection of
investors.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen have met five times and signed 14 cross-strait agreements since
President Ma was sworn into office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The agreements are mostly aimed at boosting cross-strait trade and economic
exchanges, with the most recent and important one being the Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement inked in June.</P>

      <P>The number of visitors to ICT Month, Taiwan's largest consumer electronics show,
hit a three-year high after the global financial crisis in 2008, the organizer
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The annual event tallied more than 850,000 visitors during the 9-day period, up
from last year's 800,000 and 770,000 in 2008, showing that people were more
willing to spend money on electronic products, said Kinki Kao, project manager
of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), in a telephone interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Tablet computers became the best seller in the fair, followed by digital
cameras, with an average growth of 30 percent compared to last year's show,
while sales of notebooks and LED monitors saw a 20 percent growth respectively,
the TCA said in an email statement.</P>
      <P>On the 2010 event's theme, "Embracing a Smart Life," the TCA said the products
at the fair no longer highlighted just enhanced efficiency  or  specifications,
but  rather  focused  on user friendliness.</P>
      <P>The tech fair, now in its 31st year, will later be held in central Taiwan's
Taichung City Dec. 17-22 and in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City Dec. 30-Jan. 4.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese book studies CNA, media coverage of Nanking Massacre</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese scholar has released a book about Chinese language media's coverage of
the Rape of Nanking in 1937, in which he revealed the news blackout imposed by
Japan at the time and Chinese media's, especially the Central News Agency's,
efforts to overcome reporting difficulties.</P>
      <P>The China News Service quoted Professor Jing Shenghong of Nanjing Normal
University as saying at a news conference on Sunday that it was extremely
difficult for the media to report about the massacre as the Japanese army had
prior to the systemic killings put in place a well-planned news blackout.</P>
      <P>The professor at the university's College of Social Development News Service
made the remarks while launching his book "Chinese News Media and the Rape of
Nanking during World War II" in Nanjing, China Sunday. Nanking is now spelled as
Nanjing.</P>
      <P>From September through December of 1937, Jing noted, Japan had demanded all
foreign diplomats, journalists and expatriates leave Nanking for Wuhan, Shanghai
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 13, when the Japanese troops broke through the city's defense and
entered the capital, it immediately cut off the city's communications with the
outside world and banned any entry into and exit from the city for more than a
month.</P>
      <P>It was during that time that Japanese troops carried out the atrocity,
butchering hundreds of thousands of unarmed Chinese in Nanking, an incident
historians have since called the Rape of Nanking because many women were gang
raped before being massacred.</P>
      <P>Jing pointed out that in 1938, all Western and Chinese media were prohibited
from visiting Nanking while those remaining in the city were all purged, "so
that for a long period of time not one single newspaper was able to publish
normally, not one single Chinese news worker could work normally, and not one
single Chinese media outside the city could acquire any news regarding Nanjing."</P>
      <P>Foreign missionaries are believed to have been the first to reveal news about
Japan's takeover of Nanking and the subsequent massacre in the city. The
missionaries had remained in the city at the time. After they told the outside
world what was happening, foreign media reported about it.</P>
      <P>A few days later, on Dec. 22, 1937, the Central News Agency (CNA), the biggest
news wire service of the Republic of China, became the first Chinese language
media to report about it, Jing said.</P>
      <P>He praised the CNA for surmounting difficulties to report about the incident.</P>
      <P>After the CNA broke the news, other Chinese media quickly caught up by quoting
those fleeing the city to tell their horrible stories inside the city.</P>
      <P>"The ensuing Chinese media reports about the Rape of Nanking were both emotional
and numerous -- far outnumbering those by the Western media," Jing said.</P>
      <P>Jing said the subject of the media's coverage of one of the bloodiest incidents
in China's history was worth in-depth research, according to the China News
Service.</P>
      <P>He said a look into how the media worked at that time could bridge a gap in the
study of the Rape of Nanking and is thus significant academically.</P>
      <P>It is not immediately clear, however, whether Jing was able to learn or reveal
in his book what other obstacles Chinese language media faced which kept them
from immediately reporting about the invasion of Nanking and the subsequent
massacre after foreign media had reported about it. enditem/cs nnnn</P>

      <P>The first academy aimed at promoting Taiwanese culture will open in Los Angeles
next spring, Taiwan's office in the West Coast city said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kung Chung-cheng, director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
(TECO) in Los Angeles, said that preparations, including planning the courses
and hiring teachers for the academy, have largely been completed,</P>
      <P>The planned courses will cover calligraphy, glove puppetry, Taiwan's tea
culture, and language training.</P>
      <P>A crucial feature of the academy will be the teaching of traditional Chinese
characters, in contrast with the simplified version used in China and taught in
Confucius Institutes set up by China around the world to promote Chinese
language and culture.</P>
      <P>Hui Ban Giang, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office's Cultural
Division, said the Taiwan Academy will be easily differentiated from the Chinese
institutes because they will focus more on promoting culture and introduce
customs and cultural traits that are distinctive to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Language training will also be available to complement the academy's cultural
component, Giang said.</P>
      <P>The opening of these Taiwan academies around the world was one of the major

    <HEADLINE>President stresses fairness, quality, efficiency for NHI reform</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that a proposed second-generation health
insurance reform plan, which failed to get through the Legislative Yuan last
week, should emphasize the principles of fairness, quality and efficiency.</P>
      <P>The authorities involved should exchange opinions to fine-tune the technical
details of the national health insurance (NHI) reform plan -- mainly on how
health insurance premiums should be calculated -- based on those principles, Ma
said during a visit to the outlying island of Penghu.</P>
      <P>He said Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang has agreed to review the proposed NHI
reform plan, after a DOH-drafted package of amendments to the National Health
Insurance Act failed to clear the legislative floor Dec. 7.</P>
      <P>Yaung will again meet with legislative caucus members of the ruling Kuomintang
on Monday to inform the lawmakers how a new version of the amendment package
could be modified to forge the widest consensus possible on the issue, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The plan that failed to clear the legislative body would have calculated  health
insurance premiums on the basis of overall household income rather than
salaries, as is the case at present.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear if the modified version Yaung is considering will preserve
the household income formula, but Ma stressed that it was more important for the
plan to reflect the three principles he articulated rather than apply a specific
formula.</P>
      <P>In related news, the president reiterated the government's resolve to develop
the Penghu Islands (Pescadores) , located to the west of Kaohsiung in the Taiwan
Strait, into a low-carbon dioxide emissions island.</P>
      <P>He said the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development has
given a green light to the building of submarine cables between Penghu and
Taiwan proper, which will allow Penghu residents to sell the extra power
generated from wind turbines to Taiwan Power Company.</P>
      <P>On a complaint raised by Penghu County Councilor Yang Yao that the airfare
subsidy the central government gives to Penghu residents is relatively low, Ma
said Legislator Lin Ping-kun has submitted an amendment that would raise the
subsidy to about 30 percent of airfares.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, Penghu residents currently get 20 percent of their airfares
subsidized, lower than the subsidies received by Matsu residents that can reach
up to 40 percent of the ticket's value.</P>
      <P>"All people concerned are still working to at least increase the subsidy to 30
percent," Ma told Penghu residents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Public hearing on health insurance reform may be held</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang will likely hold a public hearing on a hotly debated
national health insurance reform package after the Department of Health (DOH)
unveils a modified version of the plan on Monday, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The government's effort to push a health care overhaul has been fraught with
controversy, and on Dec. 7, the plan was rejected by legislators because of
concerns over its fairness and lack of details on how health insurance premiums
would be calculated.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang, who has pledged to step down if the reform
backfires, reportedly agreed to scrap his idea of calculating premiums based on
total household income, which he argued would have eased the Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) financial woes.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear, however, how a modified version of the plan would define
income on which premiums are calculated. At present, health insurance premiums
are calculated as a percentage of salary.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that no decision had been made on whether the government
would raise a health surcharge on tobacco products that was already doubled only
last year.</P>
      <P>"It's too early to tell but everything is under discussion," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has been tight-lipped about what it will present Monday,
reports have indicated that Yaung plans to expand the definition of "individual
salary" to include overtime, year-end bonuses, and other outside incentives as
part of overall income.</P>
      <P>The speculation has angered a health insurance watchdog group, which worried
that such a calculation method might end up hurting wage earners if employers
were unwilling to shoulder a larger share of the premiums.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, Wu met with related DOH officials in a bid to salvage the health
insurance system.</P>
      <P>"During the meeting, we made two preliminary decisions. The new health insurance
plan will follow the spirit of the proposed second-generation health plan. Also,
many agreed that the suggestion of using total household income as a basis for
calculating premiums could be difficult to execute," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu rejected reports that Yaung's original proposal had been officially nixed.</P>
      <P>He said that once Yaung has presented the modified version to KMT lawmakers, the
caucus would discuss the plan among themselves and then hold a public hearing to
get outside opinions on the plan before making a final decision.</P>
      <P>KMT caucus whip Lin Yi-shih also reiterated that no final plan has been decided,
saying that everything was still in the negotiating stage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Key to Economic Cooperation Committee's success</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/12/10  17:23:45
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's almost three months since the historic Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China went into effect. Both parties have
agreed to set up a cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) as a
platform for further negotiations to make ECFA a success.</P>
      <P>To achieve its intended purposes, complementary measures would have to be taken
to empower the Economic Cooperation Committee with adequate support and
authority. With respect to this, the government needs to clearly define its
roles and status so it will operate effectively to achieve the ECFA targets.</P>
      <P>What needs to be "adjusted" in this regard is the role of the Mainland Affairs
Council, which deals with major policy issues towards China, but not the day-to-
day economic and investment exchanges -- what the ECFA seeks to promote.</P>
      <P>Because the real issues ECFA seeks to deal with through the Economic
Cooperation  Committee  tend  to be complicated  and professional, it is
questionable whether the MAC has the competency or energy to continue to play
its "leading" role here.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  probably as a result of the opposition from responsible government
ministries and agencies including the MAC, the Economic Cooperation Committee
has been excluded from participating in the negotiations with China over
intellectual property, medical cooperation or goods and services trade pacts
with China.</P>
      <P>And it is exactly these "substantive" pacts with China that would benefit both
sides of the Taiwan Strait in the spirit and letter of the ECFA. It is time
indeed that the government authorized the ECC to play its critical role to
realize ECFA goals. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 12, 2010)</P>

      <P>More than 50 percent of consumers around the globe, including in Taiwan, use
Internet-based television or video services every week, reflecting a growing
interest in on-demand content, a study by wireless network maker Ericsson AB has
found.</P>
      <P>People are spending up to 35 percent of their leisure time on watching various
types of content, the study found, with 93 percent of respondents still watching
TV every week and more than 70 percent using "time shifting" services, such as
streaming, downloading or watching recorded broadcasts.</P>
      <P>Over 50 percent of respondents said they wanted to connect their personal
computers to televisions to be able to watch online television content with
other programming.</P>
      <P>Regarding the preferred devices for watching TV, 37 percent of respondents
expressed interest in having a touch screen tablet connected to their
television, which would allow them to keep an eye on private communications,
such as reading e-mails or social networking, while watching TV.</P>
      <P>The study collected responses  from people in seven major countries with
advanced video application development -- the United States, England, Germany,
Spain, Sweden, China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The state-backed Institute for Information Industry (III), which helped Ericsson
conduct the study in Taiwan, said user preferences for television or video
services in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung differed.</P>
      <P>About 71 percent of respondents living in Taipei were interested in time
shifting services, while 51 percent of those in Taichung preferred to record TV
programs with a timer, and 73 percent of those in Kaohsiung were most interested
in having a list of favorite programming that could be accessed on demand.</P>
      <P>Despite the differing preferences, the study showed that all respondents were
generally willing to try new types of video services, said Benson Chen, a senior
analyst with III, in an e-mail.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Sunday the government's determination to make
Taiwan a global Hakka cultural research and interaction center.</P>
      <P>President Ma made the remarks while addressing the opening of the 2010 National
Hakka Conference in Taipei, showing off his Hakka language proficiency by
delivering his eight-minute speech entirely in the dialect.</P>
      <P>He received a big round of applause from the conference attendees -- nearly 500
representatives from Hakka communities around the country.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is glad that he promulgated the Hakka Basic Law in January, about 10
days after the Legislative Yuan passed it, to allow the administration to use
national resources to turn Taiwan into a global Hakka culture research and
interaction center.</P>
      <P>Under the basic law, Ma said, the administration has and will continue to
deliver his campaign platform to accelerate efforts to preserve Hakka culture
and language, and to help bolster the development of Hakka industries and
innovative businesses.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the conference, Council for Hakka Affairs (CHA) Minister Huang
Yu-cheng said after the Hakka Basic Law was put into effect on Jan. 27, the
Hakka affairs administration has been incorporated into the national public
servants examination.</P>
      <P>The CHA has also finalized opinions and suggestions to determine that Taiwan's
Hakka Day will be observed on Jan. 20 on the lunar calendar each year starting
from 2011, as part of the efforts to mark the Hakka spirit and culture, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>Resolutions of the conference will be referred to the CHA to be used as future
reference, he added.</P>
      <P>Under the Hakka Basic Law, any townships, cities and communities in which Hakka
people account for over 33 percent of the population will be listed as key Hakka
culture development districts where the Hakka dialect will serve as a required
language at official events and in government agencies.</P>
      <P>A total of 61 townships, cities and communities around Taiwan are qualified to
serve as Hakka culture hubs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the law stipulates that the government should promote the
circulation of the Hakka language and proficiency certification in the dialect,
establish a Hakka language data bank and take measures to encourage  Hakka
academic research while encouraging local colleges and universities to open
departments and institutes focusing on Hakka affairs research.</P>
      <P>The law also demands the protection of Hakka media rights and assistance in the
establishment of Hakka-language broadcasting and television channels.</P>
      <P>According to CHA statistics released in 2008, Hakka people comprise over 25
percent of the country's population, meaning there are 5.88 million people in
Taiwan who identify themselves as Hakka people or as having Hakka blood.</P>

      <P>Leading Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo's conspicuous absence from the Nobel Peace
Prize awarding ceremony on Friday has caught the attention of many people in
Taiwan as its government plans to invite as many previous award winners as
possible to join in a celebration of the 100th birthday of the Republic of China
(ROC) next year.</P>
      <P>According to Emile Sheng, minister of the Council for Cultural Affairs, a
highlight of the government's celebrations of the ROC's 100th anniversary will
be a peace ceremony at the offshore island of Kinmen on Aug. 23, to remember
Communist China's 1958 bombardment of the island aimed at staging an invasion of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sheng said at least one Nobel Peace Prize winner has agreed to attend the
ceremony during which a "bell of peace" will be tolled to remind people all over
the world of the importance of -- and Taiwan's strong wish for -- maintaining
peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Following are excerpts of reports from Taiwanese newspapers on the topic.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Sheng insisted that he won't publish the names of the guests of honor until June
next year in order to avoid political interference that might spoil the holy
event at the Peace Plaza on Kuningtou, Kinmen, where a fierce battle between the
troops of the ROC and Communist China took place more than a half century ago.</P>
      <P>He said the word "peace" will be inscribed around the peace bell in 100
languages to demonstrate the ROC's strong will to work for peace not just across
the Taiwan Strait, but also around the globe.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The bell tolling activity will be held on the anniversary of the 1958 Communist
Chinese bombardment of Kinmen island and in attendance will be Nobel Peace Prize
laureates.</P>
      <P>The bell will be made from the cannons that have fallen on the battleground.
Marking the 100th anniversary of the founding of the ROC, the government hopes
the ceremony will bring at least 100 years of peace between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Who will be invited to the Kinmen bell tolling ceremony is something worth
watching now that the government has said it has sent out invitations to as many
previous winners as it can.</P>
      <P>Would the pro-China Ma Ying-jeou administration invite Liu Xiaobo and the Dalai
Lama, whom the Ma government has once obstructed from visiting Taiwan, in
disregard of China's angry reaction?</P>
      <P>As President Barack Obama was the 2009 winner of the prize, whether he would be
present for that occasion would be of great political significance in that it
would test the government's ability to score a diplomatic breakthrough.</P>
      <P>Indeed, many Nobel Peace Prize laureates have been invited to visit Taiwan and
their visits have all aroused great interest here. They include Mikhail
Gorbachev, Jimmy Carter, Lech Walesa and the Dalai Lama.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize committee has awarded 91
prizes to 121 individuals or groups, of whom 28 are still living. Among them and
also well known to Taiwanese are former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, former U.S.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former South African President Nelson
Mandela and Burma's democracy movement leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who was recently
released from house arrest.</P>
      <P>Since, as Presidential Office officials have pointed out, Ma was the first Asian
leader to call on China to release Liu Xiaobo, it would be interesting to see if
he would "dare" invite Liu over to the 2011 Peace Bell ceremony on Kinmen, which
lies just opposite the Chinese mainland.</P>

      <P>Japanese runners on Sunday won the men's and women's titles at the 2010 Soochow
International Ultra-Marathon in Taiwan and successfully defended their titles in
the 24-hour race.</P>
      <P>Ryochi Sekiya, 43, ran a total of 268.1 kilometers in 24 hours to win the men's
division in the Taipei competition for the sixth time.</P>
      <P>Countrywoman Mami Kudo outran all of her competitors to win the women's division
with a distance of 239.3 kilometers, well short of her world record of 254.425
kilometers set last year.</P>
      <P>France's Anne-Celile Fontaine finished second.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Luo Wei-ming and 51-year-old Huang Yen-ling took third place in the
men's and women's divisions respectively with distances of 229.2 km and 204.4
km.</P>
      <P>Luo said the 24-hour ultramarathon, which went from 9 a.m. Saturday to 9 a.m.
Sunday, was particularly difficult because there were no breaks, and running
through the night interrupted the sleep cycle.</P>
      <P>Huang, who participated in the Taitung Super Triathon in October, said the
ultramarathon was more challenging than the triathon because runners were easily
bored circling the same track around the clock.</P>
      <P>The event, which took place on the 400-meter track at Soochow University's
Waishuanghsi campus, was held for the 10th time. Thirty runners from around the
world participated in the event.</P>
      <P>To track the runners' laps and distances run, Soochow University invested more
than NT$1 million (US$33,256) on a chip timing system to increase accuracy.</P>
      <P>Tied to the runners' legs, the chips automatically sent the data to the
computer, which could then be seen in real time on the official website.</P>
      <P>But the runners seemed to prefer an old-fashioned system, if for no other reason
than to keep them going. Even with the new technology, volunteers would still
flip numbered panels to inform runners how many laps they had completed as a
form of encouragement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Health insurance must be fair and efficient</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/12/10  19:59:08
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health's proposed amendments to Taiwan's National Health
Insurance (NHI) Act, focusing on the so-called second generation premium system,
were lambasted by legislators for good reasons: the policy makers did not fully
understand the principles of fairness and efficacy.</P>
      <P>While the amendments seek to make the premium-payment scale fairer for all
citizens, the proposal for calculating the premium based on a household's total
income was seen as potentially leading to even greater unfairness. Little wonder
it has been roundly criticized, even by the ruling party's lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The government might have thought that it would be fair for higher income
earners to shoulder a proportionally greater share of the NHI's financial
burden. A more reasonable formula to look at this, according to academics, is to
design the premium paying scheme based on the total tax and fees paid to the
government so that the national income would be more evenly distributed among
all citizens after health insurance premiums have been collected.</P>
      <P>One way to achieve fairer income distribution is what the opposition party has
proposed, and the government is considering: collect NHI premium from people
paying stock and land transaction taxes. Such premium would go a long way to
filling in the financial shortages in the NHI program.</P>
      <P>Squeezing some money from stock and land transactions would not increase the
government's administrative cost. In contrast, the household  income method is
both complicated  and inefficient, increasing administrative cost to boot.</P>
      <P>The government should give some serious thought to why its proposal on second-
generation NHI reform has been regarded as both unfair and inefficient and make
necessary adjustments before putting forward a new set of amendments to the
legislature. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 12, 2010) enditem/cs nnnn</P>

      <P>Thirteen dogs have boarded a flight to the United States to find new homes
there, in the latest attempt to save some of Taiwan's many stray dogs, animal
rescue workers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The dogs were rescued from southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City, where they were
found to have been abused or suffering from illnesses, rescue workers said. The
dogs were first taken by train from Kaohsiung to Taipei before boarding the
flight.</P>
      <P>There were sad stories behind every abused dog, said rescue worker Chang Ya-hui,
who led four volunteers of the non-profit Animal Rescue Team Taiwan, to
accompany the dogs on the train.</P>
      <P>For example, she said, Andrew, one of the dogs who will be sent to Seattle, was
covered with insect bites when he was found in Linyuan Township, while Irene,
another abused dog who lost her eye sight, had suffered from serious skin
diseases.</P>
      <P>The group of U.S.-bound dogs also included eight puppies that were abused by
foreign migrant workers and were later rescued from an oyster harbor, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>While an increasing number of Taiwanese people have become aware of the need to
help stray animals, the adoption rate is still low, putting pressure on animal
shelters with limited budgets to care for the dogs.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that by taking the dogs to shelters in the U.S., their chances of
being adopted will increase.</P>
      <P>Since 2004, the rescue team has carried out more than 200 such cases, flying a
total of 1,470 animals rescued in Taiwan to North America, by cooperating with
similar organizations in the U.S and Canada.</P>

      <P>School principals' efforts at preventing bullying on campus will become part of
their performance review, amid increasing cases of school violence in Taiwan,
the Ministry of Education said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under a proposed anti-bullying program, how effective schools are in preventing
bullying will be included in principals' evaluations, said Wang Fu-lin, director
of the ministry's Department of Military Training Education.</P>
      <P>If principals do not properly tackle bullying or report about the problems in
time, it could affect their ratings, as well as whether they can serve another
term, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang added that violence  on campus  often occurs due to insensitivity  or
indifference  on the  part  of the  school administration.</P>
      <P>Local governments will also be punished if they are not committed to taking
measures to deal with school violence, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The ministry is collecting information on bullying prevention programs in other
countries to come up with a specific project to tackle this problem, said Wang.</P>
      <P>It, however, will not require mandatory separation of bullies from other
students, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The minister will preside over a conference next week to discuss the issue.</P>
      <P>In the first eight months of 2008, schools in Taiwan reported 4,314 cases of
bullying, according to the ministry's survey.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday that both Taiwan and China have agreed that
there is no hurry to sign a proposed investment protection agreement between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>"Since both sides have failed to come to terms with several parts of the
proposed agreement, it would be better for the pact to be signed later, "
President Ma told reporters while visiting the island of Penghu earlier in the
day.</P>
      <P>The investment deal was originally scheduled to be signed by the heads of the
two organizations in charge of negotiations -- Chairman Chiang Pin-kung of the
Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and President Chen Yunlin of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- in their next round of
meeting in Taiwan before the end of year.</P>
      <P>But the signing of the deal is set to be postponed due to differences in details
of the proposed pact, especially with regard to whether any international
arbitration  mechanism should be introduced in dispute settlement of the trade
pact, according to officials involved in the pre-meeting talks.</P>
      <P>"It would be good for the proposed pact to be shelved until terms acceptable to
both sides are worked out," the president said.</P>
      <P>President Ma would not comment on reports that Taiwan's demand for an
international arbitration mechanism is the key source of disagreement behind the
two sides, saying "the controversies go beyond that and need to be solved
gradually."</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes the investment protection agreement will protect Taiwanese
investors in China. Investors have invested around US$100 billion in China over
the years, but due to tense relations in the past, the two sides have yet to
reach an agreement involving business dispute resolution and protection of
investors.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen have met five times and signed 14 cross-strait agreements since
President Ma was sworn into office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The agreements are mostly aimed at boosting cross-strait trade and economic
exchanges, with the most recent and important one being the Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement inked in June.</P>

      <P>The number of visitors to ICT Month, Taiwan's largest consumer electronics show,
hit a three-year high after the global financial crisis in 2008, the organizer
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The annual event tallied more than 850,000 visitors during the 9-day period, up
from last year's 800,000 and 770,000 in 2008, showing that people were more
willing to spend money on electronic products, said Kinki Kao, project manager
of the Taipei Computer Association (TCA), in a telephone interview with the CNA.</P>
      <P>Tablet computers became the best seller in the fair, followed by digital
cameras, with an average growth of 30 percent compared to last year's show,
while sales of notebooks and LED monitors saw a 20 percent growth respectively,
the TCA said in an email statement.</P>
      <P>On the 2010 event's theme, "Embracing a Smart Life," the TCA said the products
at the fair no longer highlighted just enhanced efficiency  or  specifications,
but  rather  focused  on user friendliness.</P>
      <P>The tech fair, now in its 31st year, will later be held in central Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>Chinese book studies CNA, media coverage of Nanking Massacre</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
12/12/10  22:38:52
(By Jen Wen-yi and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese scholar has released a book about Chinese language media's coverage of
the Rape of Nanking in 1937, in which he revealed the news blackout imposed by
Japan at the time and Chinese media's, especially the Central News Agency's,
efforts to overcome reporting difficulties.</P>
      <P>The China News Service quoted Professor Jing Shenghong of Nanjing Normal
University as saying at a news conference on Sunday that it was extremely
difficult for the media to report about the massacre as the Japanese army had
prior to the systemic killings put in place a well-planned news blackout.</P>
      <P>The professor at the university's College of Social Development News Service
made the remarks while launching his book "Chinese News Media and the Rape of
Nanking during World War II" in Nanjing, China Sunday. Nanking is now spelled as
Nanjing.</P>
      <P>From September through December of 1937, Jing noted, Japan had demanded all
foreign diplomats, journalists and expatriates leave Nanking for Wuhan, Shanghai
and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 13, when the Japanese troops broke through the city's defense and
entered the capital, it immediately cut off the city's communications with the
outside world and banned any entry into and exit from the city for more than a
month.</P>
      <P>It was during that time that Japanese troops carried out the atrocity,
butchering hundreds of thousands of unarmed Chinese in Nanking, an incident
historians have since called the Rape of Nanking because many women were gang
raped before being massacred.</P>
      <P>Jing pointed out that in 1938, all Western and Chinese media were prohibited
from visiting Nanking while those remaining in the city were all purged, "so
that for a long period of time not one single newspaper was able to publish
normally, not one single Chinese news worker could work normally, and not one
single Chinese media outside the city could acquire any news regarding Nanjing."</P>
      <P>Foreign missionaries are believed to have been the first to reveal news about
Japan's takeover of Nanking and the subsequent massacre in the city. The
missionaries had remained in the city at the time. After they told the outside
world what was happening, foreign media reported about it.</P>
      <P>A few days later, on Dec. 22, 1937, the Central News Agency (CNA), the biggest
news wire service of the Republic of China, became the first Chinese language
media to report about it, Jing said.</P>
      <P>He praised the CNA for surmounting difficulties to report about the incident.</P>
      <P>After the CNA broke the news, other Chinese media quickly caught up by quoting
those fleeing the city to tell their horrible stories inside the city.</P>
      <P>"The ensuing Chinese media reports about the Rape of Nanking were both emotional
and numerous -- far outnumbering those by the Western media," Jing said.</P>
      <P>Jing said the subject of the media's coverage of one of the bloodiest incidents
in China's history was worth in-depth research, according to the China News
Service.</P>
      <P>He said a look into how the media worked at that time could bridge a gap in the
study of the Rape of Nanking and is thus significant academically.</P>
      <P>It is not immediately clear, however, whether Jing was able to learn or reveal
in his book what other obstacles Chinese language media faced which kept them
from immediately reporting about the invasion of Nanking and the subsequent
massacre after foreign media had reported about it. enditem/cs nnnn</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If in governing you depend upon laws and maintain
order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you can also make the people keep
away from wrongdoing, but they will lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If,
on the other hand, in government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain
order by encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense of
shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Fallacy in 'N minus 1' policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/13/10  11:32:41
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outspoken electronics business tycoon Terry Gou recently blasted the government
for what he called its passivism in dealing with the development of the flat
panel industry, saying such an attitude could stifle local makers in the sector.</P>
      <P>Gou was referring to a government regulation that forbids Taiwanese  companies
from setting up factories in China using technologies more advanced than those
employed at home.</P>
      <P>The provision, commonly known as the "N minus 1 principle" in the industrial
community, stipulates that Taiwan-funded plants in China must technologically be
at least one generation behind their parent firms.</P>
      <P>This regulation applies to all high-tech industries, with the aim of maintaining
Taiwan's technological edge. However, the policy should not have been
implemented across the board.</P>
      <P>At a time when the U.S. chip giant Intel Corp. has opened a foundry in China
using highly advanced nanometer technology, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (TSMC) still has only lower level production lines there.</P>
      <P>The "N minus 1" principle has hindered TSMC's expansion in the vast Chinese
market. The company has so far managed to maintain its leading position in the
global contract chip realm mainly because of its superb operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's display panel makers, however, do not have such an edge. The two
largest Taiwanese makers in the field -- Chimei Innolux and AU Optronics (AUO)
-- are lagging behind their South Korean rivals, such as Samsung and LG Display,
in terms of global market share.</P>
      <P>As China has emerged  as the world's largest  market for medium-size flat
panels, Samsung has stepped up its efforts to gain dominance there. The
company's efforts have been boosted by China's recent approval of its
application to set up a 8.5th-generation plant in the country.</P>
      <P>In line with Taiwan's "N minus 1" principle, AUO has submitted a plan to the
government to build a 7.5th-generation flat panel plant in China. Although the
government is expected to approve the investment plan soon, how can AUO compete
with its Korean rival which is using a higher level of technology?</P>
      <P>We share Gou's view that the government should give high-tech firms a freer hand
in planning their overseas or China-bound investments to maintain their niches
in the highly competitive business world. If the "N minus 1" principle is not
scrapped, many industries may not experience the "golden decade" that the
government has promised. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 13, 2010).</P>

      <P>Personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer Inc. said Monday it sold more than
10,000 notebook computers at ICT Month, Taiwan's largest consumer electronics
fair, generating over NT$100 million (US$3.32 million) in sales.</P>
      <P>This keeps AsusTek in top place in terms of notebook sales for the eighth
consecutive year at the high-tech trade exhibition, the company said.</P>
      <P>The nine-day Taipei leg of ICT Month, which ended Sunday, attracted more than
850,000 visitors, up from 800,000 recorded in 2009 and 770,000 in 2008.</P>
      <P>According to AsusTek, its selling rate for its newly unveiled U series and A42
of models was close to one unit every 30 seconds at the exhibition.</P>
      <P>The company said it also sold about 200 units of its 1215 notebook series and
more than 200 units of its Eee Note netbooks in the nine days of the trade show.</P>
      <P>The tech fair, now in its 31st year, will move to Taichung City in central
Taiwan Dec. 17-22 and to Kaohsiung City in southern Taiwan Dec. 30-Jan. 4.</P>
      <P>AsusTek said it has scheduled a meeting in Taiwan for Tuesday and Wednesday for
its global sales managers to review the company's 2010 sales records and set new
goals for 2011.</P>
      <P>Company Chairman Jonney Shih is expected to preside at the meeting, it said.</P>
      <P>AsusTek said sales in Eastern Europe for 2011 are expected to grow 30-40 percent
from 2010, and its sales in China are also expected to grow steadily.</P>
      <P>The company said it aims to move up one notch next year to become the fourth
largest notebook seller in the world.</P>
      <P>AsusTek's sales outlook for the first quarter of next year is optimistic,
according to a recent report released by U.S. tech giant Intel.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan food festival in Brussels last week attracted Belgian parliamentarians
and hundreds of officials from the headquarters of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The festival, the first of its kind in the Belgian capital where the EU
headquarters is located, opened on Dec. 8 with a grand feast prepared by six
award-winning chefs from the Taiwan Formosa Chefs Association.</P>
      <P>The association was fresh from its success at an international culinary
competition in Singapore at which it won 11 gold medals, three silver and seven
bronze.</P>
      <P>More than 220 European officials attended the opening-day feast, which was
presented like a state banquet and featured gourmet dishes with a distinct
Taiwanese flair.</P>
      <P>In the following three days, the event also attracted more than 330 other
dignitatries, including politicians, prominent educators and medical doctors, as
well as Taiwanese living in Belgium.</P>
      <P>It was organized by the Taiwan government to say thanks to the Belgian
parliament for its support for Taiwan over the past year, according to the
Taipei Representative Office in the European Union and Belgium.</P>
      <P>Representative Lin Yung-lo said this support helped Taiwan to acquire EU visa-
free preferential treatment that will take effect early next year.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan food festival will move next to Berlin, Germany as part of Taiwan's
efforts to showcase its cuisine and cement its ties with its European friends.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.20 percent Monday after profit taking emerged to
erode early gains led by the high-tech sector, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 17.76 points to 8,736.59, after moving between 8,736.54
and 8,764.51, on turnover of NT$126.63 billion (US$4.20 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.37 percent and extended the gains to the day's high as
buying was ignited by high hopes that the government will soon allow flat panel
maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) to build a 7.5th-generation plant in China, the
dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, as the index moved closer to the nearest resistance at 8,800 points,
investors tended to pocket their recent gains to compromise the upside, they
said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,318 stocks closed up and 1,820 were down, with 405 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector scored the highest gains, finishing up 0.7 percent.
Construction shares rose 0.6 percent, while foodstuffs, textiles, plastics and
chemicals, and machinery and electronics stocks all ended up 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 0.1 percent but cement shares fell 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"The flat panel sector has consolidated for the long term and investors just
seized the upbeat mood about AUO's China investment proposal to pick up
bargains, " Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>AUO is seeking approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to spend US$3
billion to build a flat panel plant in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>Last week, the ministry said AUO is expected to obtain approval soon since the
project has passed critical screening of the key technology involved in the
investment.</P>
      <P>AUO rose 2.99 percent to close at NT$31.00, while rival Chimei Innolux rose 0.52
percent to end the day at NT$38.95.</P>
      <P>Huang said that as foreign institutional investors kept moving funds into the
local bourse to boost their high-tech holdings, it is expected that the
bellwether electronics sector will serve as a driver to push the market even
higher.</P>
      <P>"But, ahead of the 8,800-8,850 point range, the market might face some pressure
to limit the gains," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, Chung Hwa Pulp added 3.16 percent to finish at
NT$16.30 and Prince Housing gained 1.86 percent to close at NT$24.70.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Anti-bullying legislation in the works</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/13/10  15:58:00
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Education Minister Wu Tsai-shun said Sunday his ministry will study the
feasibility of introducing legislation to more effectively prevent bullying on
school campuses.</P>
      <P>Wu's announcement came in the wake of a string of bullying incidents reported in
schools across Taiwan. In some cases, the brutality employed gave rise to great
concern in local society.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Ministry of Education (MOE) began to implement a new program last
week that requires school authorities to pay more attention to reports of
bullying.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a 2008 survey conducted in Taipei City, 3,378
students claimed they had been beaten or blackmailed on school campuses.
However, the MOE data showed that only 24 such cases were reported to the
ministry that year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Wu said his ministry convened a meeting of representatives from 25 cities and
counties around the country last Thursday, during which a campus bullying
prevention program was introduced with immediate effect.</P>
      <P>Under the program, school authorities are required to call a meeting whenever
they receive a complaint of bullying and seek to determine the facts.
Furthermore, professional experts from outside the school should be invited to
participate in the evaluation meeting, the new plan specifies.</P>
      <P>Once it is determined that the reported incident constitutes bullying, the
victims and perpetrators should be referred to a specially established panel
within the school for counselling, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>In the past, schools tended to deal with such cases by giving the bullies a
demerit.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MOE has also set up a hotline 0800-200885 for reports of campus
bullying.</P>
      <P>"We will ask the city and county governments, as well as the schools, to install
similar hot lines, " Wu said, adding that school efforts in this regard will be
included in the annual review of school administrations and campus management.</P>
      <P>School principals who cover up incidents of bullying will be given a lower
performance rating, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has a Juvenile Delinquency Act, there is no law that deals
exclusively with bullying in schools.</P>
      <P>"After studying the measures adopted in 15 major countries around the world,
including the United States and Canada, the MOE has decided to draft a bill on
the prevention of bullying on school campuses," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Many lawmakers from across the political spectrum have voiced support for the
proposed bill that would pave the way for for more effective measures against
violence in schools, Wu said. (Dec. 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Wang Fu-lin, director of the MOE's Department of Military Training Education,
said the apathy and insensitivity of school administrators toward the problem of
bullying is the main reason why the number of incidents have continued to rise.</P>
      <P>Under the MOE's new disciplinary program, the effectiveness of schools' efforts
to prevent bullying will be included in the principals' performance evaluations.</P>
      <P>If principals do not tackle the problem or report incidents in time, it could
affect their ratings and their retention for another term, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Local governments will also be punished if they do not take steps to deal with
violence in schools, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-shien, project director of the MOE's campus safety enhancement program,
said it would require a special law to make it mandatory for bullies to be
separated from other students.</P>
      <P>However, some education experts have voiced opposition to the mandatory
separation proposal. They said education is a "project of hope" that requires
schools to help students realize their life dreams.</P>
      <P>Mandatory separation  would be contrary to the purpose of education, and bullies
are the first students that should receive help within the school system, the
experts said.</P>
      <P>School administrators and faculties should instead put more into helping school
bullies, the experts said. (Dec. 13, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUO China project approval by year-end: Economics Ministry</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  13  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang confirmed Monday that the
government is expected to give the green light to a China investment project by
flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>"As the project will involve a large amount of investment, the ministry might
call a special meeting to review the project before issuing its approval, " Shih
told lawmakers in a legislative interpellation session.</P>
      <P>AUO has submitted an application with the MOEA and has since March been seeking
regulatory approval to build a 7.5th-generation flat panel plant in Kunshan, in
China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>To assure the government that the company will maintain its technological lead
over its Chinese facility and its long-term commitment to Taiwan, AUO also plans
to invest NT$400 billion (US$13.28 billion) in building two 11th-generation flat
panel plants and solar energy facilities in the Central Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>Late last week, the Investment Commission under the MOEA said the project had
passed critical screening of the key technology involved in the investment.</P>
      <P>The project is pending the screening of various additional formalities before
final approval is issued by the commission.</P>
      <P>Shih said that as AUO has promised it will invest NT$400 billion in central
Taiwan -- a massive investment that is expected to create thousands of jobs --
its China project is unlikely to lead to job losses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In February, the government relaxed the rules governing high-tech investment in
China by allowing flat panel makers to build up to three 6th-generation or above
plants there.</P>
      <P>However, applicants must assure the authorities that they can maintain a
technological lead over any facilities they open in China and they must promise
to continue to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since AUO is operating an 8.5th-generation flat panel plant in Taiwan, its
application to set up a 7.5th-generation plant met with the government's
requirements, Shih said.</P>
      <P>While the government allows flat panel makers to open production facilities in
China,  Shih said,  the government has proposed strategies to expand the local
TFT LCD sector over the next 10 years.</P>
      <P>Shih said the government remains optimistic about the outlook for the local TFT-
LCD business and will not stop its efforts to further develop the sector.</P>
      <P>WitsView, a Taiwan-based high-tech research institute, said there is no rush for
local flat panel makers to relocate their investments in China at the moment, as
the global flat panel sector is still suffering from a production glut.</P>
      <P>However, China investments will no doubt help local makers to correctly feel the
pulse of the growing Chinese market in the long run, according to WitsView.</P>

      <P>The automobile industries in Taiwan and China have formed a special task force
targeting the development of automotive electronics and new energy forms as part
of their efforts to enter the global market.</P>
      <P>The formation of the cross-Taiwan Strait vehicle industrial working group was
aimed at intensifying exchanges in the industry, the academic sector and the
research and development for automotive electronics and new energy vehicles,
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs' Department of Industrial Technology said
in a statement Sunday.</P>
      <P>The establishment came at the Dec. 10-11 Cross-Strait Automobile Industrial
Cooperation Convention, which was attended by more than 300 experts on policies,
technologies and research and development in the industry.</P>
      <P>The convention featured discussions on new energy technologies and telematics --
which apply information  and communications technology to vehicles for improved
safety.</P>
      <P>"Through more collaboration in industrial technology, the two sides will be able
to enter the world market by jointly focusing on technology  upgrading,
innovation  and branding,  complementary relationships and proper division of
labor, as well as co-marketing to boost product value, " said Lin Chuan-neng,
deputy director of the department, at the event.</P>
      <P>The two sides have promised to help Chinese companies invest in Taiwan and to
help Taiwan's auto parts companies become part of the supply chain in China.</P>
      <P>Last year marked the first time the two sides had held such an event for the
automobile industry.</P>
      <P>A letter of intent signed at the last year's event paved the way for the
establishment of four working groups between Taiwan's Automotive  Research and
Testing Center (ARTC)  and the China Automotive Technology and Research Center
in September this year.</P>
      <P>The working  groups  focus on cooperation  in regulations, standardizations and
testing for regular vehicles and for electric vehicles.</P>

      <P>Dealers said the value of the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar was
boosted by further inflows of foreign funds during almost the whole of the
trading session.</P>
      <P>A rising local bourse lent additional support to the New Taiwan dollar to push
the currency to the day's high before the central bank stepped in to cap the
appreciation, they said.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 0.20 percent at 8,736.59 as foreign
institutional investors kept moving funds into Taiwan, picking up bargains in
the bellwether electronics sector.</P>
      <P>Buying in the New Taiwan dollar largely came from foreign banks that were
betting on further appreciation of the local currency amid a spillover effect
from excessive liquidity in the U.S. market, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Christmas holiday season, more and more foreign traders
have retreated from the trading floor, which has pushed down trading volume,
they said.</P>

      <P>Workers in Taiwan do not get extra time off for national holidays if they fall
on weekends, but a Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker is hoping to change in legislation
that would turn administrative guidelines on holidays into a formal statute.</P>
      <P>"It would deprive people of the right to take vacation" if under the new statute
people were not given days off to make up for the holidays missed, Legislator Wu
Yu-sheng said at a hearing of the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary, Organic Laws and
Statutes Committee.</P>
      <P>Wu's view, however, was not shared by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), which
said the existing system for civil servants was necessary to avoid creating too
big a gap between public and private sector vacation time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's civil servants currently have weekends (Saturday and Sunday) and
national holidays off.</P>
      <P>But existing guidelines stipulate that if a national holiday (except for the
Chinese New Year break) falls on a weekend, it will not be made up. Most
companies in Taiwan follow this formula.</P>
      <P>The MOI included  this stipulation  in its draft bill on "commemorative days and
holidays, " but Wu and other lawmakers have raised objections to the measure.</P>
      <P>Urging the government and companies to stop "taking advantage of the people, "
Wu argued that making up a weekend holiday on a Friday or Monday and creating a
long weekend would also be good for the local economy.</P>
      <P>MOI Vice Minister Lin Tsyr-ling countered, however, that adding more days off
for civil servants would only widen the gap in the number of holidays taken
between workers in the public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>There will be 115 vacation days next year, including weekends, Lin said, and if
people wanted more, the government also needed to consider if such a demand
would jeopardize the country's industrial and commercial development.</P>
      <P>MOI surveys indicate that most people in the country support the idea of
maintaining the current practice, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official on Monday accused South Korea's Samsung Corp. of having acted
"unethically" by snitching on Taiwanese  firms  during  a  European  Commission
anti-trust investigation.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang made the remark in response to a
legislator's question on the European Commission's probe into an alleged price-
fixing scheme involving several Asian flat panel manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Shih said Samsung's offer to the European investigators to turn "tainted
witness" in exchange for immunity was an unethical act.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwanese companies and another South Korean enterprise were implicated
and fined heavily last Wednesday  by the European Commission.</P>
      <P>A total fine of 649 million euros (US$857.85 million) was imposed on LG Display
of South Korea and Chimei Innolux Corp., AU Optronics Corp., Chunghwa Picture
Tubes Ltd. and HannStar Display Corp. of Taiwan for fixing flat panel prices
between Oct. 5, 2001 and Feb. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>The fine on the four Taiwanese firms amounted to 433.92 million euro (NT$17.3
billion).</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Lee Ching-hua of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) who raised
the question, Samsung and LG of South Korea were the the two companies most
likely to manipulate flat panel prices.</P>
      <P>"Have you ever watched a Korean TV drama titled 'Sangdo' or 'The Commercial
Ethics'?" he asked Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih agreed that Samsung's action of turning informant was not in accord with
its own commercial ethics.</P>
      <P>"This should not have been done," he said.</P>
      <P>However, for the time being, Taiwan will not impose any special restrictions on
imports from South Korea, he said.</P>
      <P>The minister reiterated  the government's  support for the Taiwanese
manufacturers and its willingness to help them deal with the new rules of
competition in the world market.</P>
      <P>The four Taiwanese firms have not yet received official notice of the EU
decision, Shih said, adding that the government will try to help the companies
to handle the fallout as soon as they make such a request.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that the government has drafted a 10-year plan for developing
Taiwan's display panel industry, whose global market share is equal to its South
Korean counterpart.</P>
      <P>"We will invite executives of the four companies and officials from relevant
government agencies to a brainstorming session next week to hammer out some
response strategies, " the Ministry of Economics Affairs said in a statement

    <HEADLINE>No mad cow disease in Taiwan: health minister</HEADLINE>

12/13/10  18:48:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health minister Yaung Chih-liang reiterated Monday that the government did not
try to conceal the case of a Taiwanese man who died in May from what is
suspected to have been mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has come under fire since last Thursday when it
was revealed that the 36-year-old Taiwanese man had died from what appeared to
have been Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).</P>
      <P>CJD is a fatal degenerative  brain disease linked to the consumption of infected
tissues from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known
as mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from legislators, Yaung said that Taiwan is a BSE-free
country and has been vigilant in guarding against the disease, despite the
recent fatality.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has no cases of mad cow disease so how can we conceal something that
doesn't exist," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Yaung, the man lived in Manchester, England from 1978 to 1997
during the peak of the mad cow disease outbreak in the UK. The man reportedly
displayed symptoms such as hypersomania and memory loss and was reported to the
DOH on March 2009 as a suspected case of CJD.</P>
      <P>The man died in May of this year and his body was immediately cremated.</P>
      <P>An autopsy was not conducted to determine the cause of death because the family
of the deceased refused to give consent, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>When asked by legislators why the government did not force the autopsy issue,
Yaung said even if CDJ was the cause of death, it was not a communicable disease
easily transmitted between people through contact.</P>
      <P>It is virtually impossible to conclude that the man indeed died of CJD, he said.</P>
      <P>Yaung's responses elicited strong criticism from Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmakers who insisted that the DOH had deliberately concealed the facts
of the case to avoid upending a government decision to lift the ban on U.S.
beef.</P>
      <P>Last October, Taiwan reopened its market to U.S. bone-in beef from cattle under
30 months of age. The decision encountered strong opposition from the DPP and
consumer groups, which expressed worry that the government was exposing the
public to a serious health risk.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tien Chiu-chin said although the suspected CJD death occurred
before Yaung was health minister, the DOH should have kept a record of it.</P>
      <P>"It is hard to fathom why such an important case would go unnoticed by the DOH
and the Bureau of National Health Insurance, " she said. "If the case had been
publicized earlier, the government would have had more bargaining power in the
face of U.S. pressure to lift the beef ban."</P>
      <P>But Yaung said the man most likely fell ill after the consumption of beef in the
UK and therefore the case had nothing to do with U.S. beef.</P>
      <P>Taiwan does not import any beef products from the UK, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"We can't control what our people eat when they are in another country. But I
can say this was an isolated incident and not a pandemic," he said.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Li-wen supported Yaung's arguments, saying that
although the case was overblown by the media, there has not been much public
reaction.</P>
      <P>"If we were to do a survey on the sale of U.S. beef in Taiwan before and after
the news (of the man's death) broke, I am quite certain we won't see much of a
difference," she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese tennis pro Lu Yen-hsun's surprise victory over former world No. 1 Andy
Roddick at Wimbledon in late June was chosen as the Biggest Upset of the Year of
2010 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lu became the first Asian man since Japan's Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995
to reach the quarterfinals of a grand slam tournament after defeating Roddick,
4-6, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 6-7 (5), 9-7 in four hours and 36 minutes, qualifying the
match as the biggest upset of the year.</P>
      <P>Lu entered the match ranked 82nd in the world and had done little in the run-up
to the tournament to suggest he would challenge Roddick, a finalist at Wimbledon
the previous year who was picked by some to win the grasscourt event in 2010.</P>
      <P>Lu had also lost all three of his previous meetings with Roddick.</P>
      <P>"(But) in an inspired performance from the then-26-year-old, though, Lu struck
83 winners and broke Roddick's serve for the only time in the match in the final
game to seal the dramatic victory, which he dedicated to his father who passed
away in 2000, " the ATP's website said.</P>
      <P>The ATP selected Australian Lleyton Hewitt's victory over Swiss Roger Federer in
the Halle Final 3-6, 7-6 (4) , 6-4, as the second biggest upset of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Shares of China-based pneumatic firm rally on TWSE debut</HEADLINE>

      <P>Shares of AirTac International Group, a China-based pneumatic product maker,
staged a rally on the first trading day of its primary listing on the main board
of the Taiwan Stock Exchange Monday amid optimism toward its earnings outlook in
the fast-growing China market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>AirTac closed at NT$138.00 (US$4.58) , up 56.8 percent from its listing price of
NT$88.00, with 8.66 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted
index rose 0.20 percent to 8,736.59.</P>
      <P>"The market expects the company to enjoy about 20 percent growth in its bottom
line thanks to strong demand in the huge China market," Grand Cathay Securities
analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>AirTac, which was set up in 1988, runs production facilities in China that churn
out a wide range of pneumatic products, including pneumatic control components
and actuators.</P>
      <P>Its products, sold under the AirTac brand, are used in the production of
automation equipment for the electronics, electrical, auto, transport, food and
mechanical sectors, the company said.</P>
      <P>China accounts for almost of 90 percent of AirTac's total revenue, the company
added.</P>
      <P>"As China is going to launch its 12th five-year economic development plan next
year, which will boost its auto industry, I expect demand from auto makers for
pneumatic products to rise significantly," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"The company has great potential for growth," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, AirTac ranks as the second-largest pneumatic product maker in
China, commanding a market share of more than 20 percent.</P>
      <P>In the first three quarters of this year, AirTac posted an earnings per share
(EPS) of NT$6.7 after registering an EPS of NT$7.1 for the whole of 2009.</P>
      <P>"The market has a consensus that AirTac will generate an EPS of no less than
NT$9.0 for 2010 rising to NT$11 for 2011, " said Hsu.</P>
      <P>Hsu said based on the fundamentals, the listing price of NT$88 was relatively
low, so it was no surprise that the stock shot up as soon as the market opened,
with momentum maintained until the end of the session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese urged to learn more about Liu Xiaobo</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn, Dec. 12 (CNA)
12/13/10  19:34:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>The author of a biography on Liu Xiaobo urged people in Taiwan on Sunday to find
out more about the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner and his extensive connections
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The biography, written by exiled Chinese writer Bei Ling in 47 days, was
published in Germany on the eve of the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony last
Friday.</P>
      <P>Munich-based publisher Riva Verlag, with the encouragement of European Union
authorities, printed 15,000 copies of the biography in its first run.</P>
      <P>Although Liu has authored about a dozen books, few of them can be found in
bookstores in Western countries, Bei said.</P>
      <P>Part of the biography, he said, highlights Liu's connection with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It includes many of Liu's articles written soon after the 1989 Tiananmen
Incident that were carried by the Taipei-based China Times newspaper and also
tells the story of Yu Chi-chung, the late founder of the daily, giving Liu
US$60,000 to help him publish his memoir titled "Monologue: Survivors of
Doomsday."</P>
      <P>Several of Liu's works related to ideology, including his most recent work --
"Sinking of Big Country: Memorandum to China" -- have also been published in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has served as the most important publishing base for Liu," Bei said.</P>
      <P>Liu was sentenced to 11 years in jail in late 2009 -- one of the harshest ever
for any Chinese dissident -- on charges of "inciting subversion of state power,
" a vague and unique term that China uses to prosecute critics of the state.</P>
      <P>Liu was arrested in December 2009 on the eve of the release of "Charter 08, " a
blueprint Liu co-authored with about 300 people from across all spectrums of
Chinese society.</P>
      <P>The document called for an end to the Communist Party of China's dominance of
the government, military and courts, protection of freedom of speech and
religious beliefs, and the implementation of constitutional democracy in China</P>
      <P>In interviews with the Central News Agency before the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Liu
said he was very interested in Taiwan's democratic development and felt it could
serve as "an enlightenment or a model" for China.</P>
      <P>"I'm very curious about what the younger generation of Taiwan has been thinking
and doing, as this would be a key indicator of the direction in which Taiwan
will move," he said at the time.</P>
      <P>Bei praised President Ma Ying-jeou's call on the day of the Nobel award ceremony
for Liu's early release.</P>
      <P>Both Liu, who is being held in a prison in Liaoling Province, and his wife, Liu
Xia, were barred from attending the award ceremony held in Oslo, Norway, and the
chair where the Nobel Prize winner would normally sit was left empty.</P>
      <P>Bei said the "empty seat" signaled the big gap between the " real China and
universal values" and would produce "unlimited" influence in the home country of
the Nobel laureate, whether he is behind bars or in exile in a foreign country.</P>
      <P>Bei, who now lives in Germany, said he planned some additions to the biography
that will lengthen it to 200,000 words, and will have it republished in Taiwan
with a new title -- "Liu Xiaobo: A Side Profile" -- next year.</P>

      <P>Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., a Taiwan-based subsidiary owned by American
International Group (AIG) , declined Monday to confirm the total number of
companies involved in bidding to buy the firm after an anonymous buyer was
reported to have offered a bid.</P>
      <P>According to a report in the Monday edition of the Economic Daily News, the
government-funded buyer directly filed a bid of about NT$91.7 billion (US$3
billion) with AIG's headquarters in the United States early this month.</P>
      <P>Market sources said the new buyer is likely to be either Taiwan Financial
Holding Co. or First Financial Holding Co., according to the newspaper. However,
both companies categorically denied being involved.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan's spokeswoman, Amanda Chou, told CNA on the sidelines of a charity
activity that she could not confirm the total number of companies that have
submitted bids due to confidentiality agreements signed between AIG and the
potential buyers.</P>
      <P>"We have heard many rumors about potential buyers, but we have to stay neutral
to make the bid fair to all contenders," Chou said.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 3, two of Taiwan's major financial service providers, Cathay Financial
Holding Co. and Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., said in a statement to the
Taiwan Stock Exchange that they had decided to bid for AIG's 97.57-percent stake
in Nan Shan.</P>
      <P>Fubon Financial Holding Co.,  the country's  second-largest financial services
provider that is widely expected to make a similar move, said it had also
tendered a bid.</P>
      <P>Ruenchen Investment Holding Co., a new joint venture created by Ruentex
Industries Ltd., Ruentex Development Co. and Pou Chen Corp. for the bid, also
said in a stock exchange statement that it had joined the bidding process.</P>
      <P>Local news reports said that Primus Financial Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm
that tendered the winning bid for Nan Shan in an earlier attempted sale in 2009
but was rejected in October this year by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC), would submit its bid again.</P>
      <P>Established in 1963, Nan Shan has a net worth of NT$140.3 billion (US$4.63
billion) , accounting for over 30 percent of the local life insurance market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More steps to be taken to stem campus bullying: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>Local governments might see their grants cut if they fail to more actively
address campus bullying in schools in their districts, a Ministry of Education
(MOE) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>"This is one of the measures being considered amid increasing instances of
school violence in our country, " said Wang Fu-lin, director of the MOE's
Department of Military Training Education.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ministry has set up a hotline to accept reports of campus
bullying, Wang said that city and local governments will be required to follow
suit.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reduce and eventually eliminate bullying in schools, Wang said,
Minister of Education Wu Ching-chi will convene a brainstorming meeting later
this week to hammer out more effective action plans.</P>
      <P>Education department heads in 25 cities and counties around the country, as well
as officials from the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Agency and other
relevant government organs, will be invited to the meeting, he went on.</P>
      <P>The meeting will come in the wake of a string of bullying incidents reported in
schools around Taiwan in recent months. In some cases, the extent of the
brutality employed has given rise to great concern in local society.</P>
      <P>Wang said apathy and insensitivity on the part of school administrators toward
the problem of bullying is the main reason why the number of incidents has
continued to rise.</P>
      <P>Citing the findings of an MOE investigation, Wang said that an estimated 2
percent of junior high school students have been bullied.</P>
      <P>Based on this ratio, he went on, more than 10,000 of the country's  950,000
junior high students have fallen victim to bullying.</P>
      <P>"We have received, however, only a few score of bullying cases through our
campus safety reporting channels," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The ministry is now considering implementing a new program that will require
school authorities to call an evaluation meeting whenever they receive a
complaint of bullying and seek to determine the facts, Wang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, education professionals from outside the school should be invited
to participate in the evaluation meeting, the new plan specifies.</P>
      <P>Once it is determined that the reported incident constitutes bullying, the
victim and perpetrator should be referred to a specially established panel
within the school for counselling, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>If school principals do not tackle the problem or report such incidents in a
timely manner, it could affect their ratings and whether they are retained in
their posts, Wang said.</P>
      <P>On media reports that some lawmakers have proposed that a special law be enacted
to make it mandatory for serious bullies to be separated from other students,
Wang said feasibility studies should be carried out before such a move can be
contemplated.</P>
      <P>Many education experts, however, have voiced opposition to the mandatory
separation proposal. They said education is a "project of hope" that requires
schools to help students realize their life dreams.</P>
      <P>Mandatory separation  would be contrary to the purpose of education, and bullies
are the first students that should receive help within the school system,
according to the experts.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Monday sought foreign  allies'  support  for  Taiwan's
bids  for meaningful participation in activities held by United Nations
organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  hopes it can take part in events  hosted by the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) and in meetings on the U.N. Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCCC), Ma said.</P>
      <P>He said participating in international activities helps maintain and promote
"the welfare and the safety of the Taiwanese people" and allows Taiwan to stay
abreast of world trends.</P>
      <P>Ma addressed Taiwan's bids for access to the ICAO and UNFCCC during a meeting at
the Presidential Office with visiting U.N. representatives of Palau, Tuvalu,
Belize and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Those nations are among the 23 countries that maintain diplomatic ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the ICAO bid, Ma said Taiwan has some of the busiest air traffic in
East Asia and that the country should have closer contact with the international
civil aviation regulatory body, as such links would facilitate the development
of Taiwan's air industry and its efforts to promote aviation safety.</P>
      <P>In terms of the UNFCCC, Ma said that in the face of the trend of extreme weather
that has made Taiwan the victim of some of the most frequent natural disasters
in the world, the country would very much like to have UNFCCC links.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled Monday that former first lady Wu Shu-jen should
serve a total of 17 1/2 years in jail after being convicted on corruption
charges in two separate cases.</P>
      <P>The high court also decided that Wu should be fined a total of NT$154 million
(US$5.13 million) for her offenses, which took place while her husband, Chen
Shui-bian, was serving as president.</P>
      <P>Wu's prison term and fines were identical to those handed down by the high court
earlier this month against the former president, who was convicted on the same
charges as his wife.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court was deciding whether three separate sentences handed down
against Wu by Taiwan's Supreme Court on Nov. 11 totaling 19 years and seven
months should be served concurrently or consecutively.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court sentenced the former first lady to 11 years in prison for
taking bribes in exchange for arranging a favorable land deal for a businessman.</P>
      <P>She was also given an eight-year sentence for accepting payments from a
businesswoman to help her secure the chairmanship of Taipei 101 owned by the
Taipei Financial  Center Corporation  and a seven-month sentence on a money
laundering conviction in connection to the case.</P>
      <P>After reviewing the cases, the high court panel of judges combined the three
sentences into a 17 1/2-year jail term.</P>

      <P>Global shipments of all-in-one computers (AIO PCs) will grow at a moderate pace
in the coming years as they command a growing share of the overall personal
computer market, market tracker Digitimes Research said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Shipments of AIO PCs, which combine monitor and PC components in a single unit,
will reach an estimated 10.5 million units this year and 14 million units in
2011, according to a report released by Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>The market researcher projected the penetration rate of AIOs in the personal
computer market to grow from this year's 8 percent to 10 percent in 2011, 13
percent in 2012 and 16 percent in 2013.</P>
      <P>"AIO PCs are welcomed by mature markets such as Japan, the United States and
Europe, because consumers in these countries prefer PC models that look more
advanced, " Joanne Chien, senior analyst and director of Digitimes Research,
said in a telephone interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>But PC brands apart from Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) have not yet been
very active in developing AIOs, which may lead to stiff competition among
Taiwan-based manufacturers for contract orders, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Pegatron Technology Corp.,  a manufacturing arm of Asustek Computer Inc. that
was spun off earlier this year, is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries
of the growing market, the report said.</P>
      <P>It will ship an estimated 2.6 million AIOs in 2011 to gain an 18 percent share
of the 2011 contract AIO market, trailing only Quanta Computer Inc., the report
said.</P>
      <P>"The split will help Pegatron  devote itself  to contract manufacturing, and
more than 40 percent of Pegatron's orders next year will come from HP," Chien
said.</P>
      <P>TPV-Inventec, a joint venture founded in 2009 by Hong Kong's TPV Technology Ltd.
and Taiwan's Inventec Corp., will also increase its shipments from 900,000 units
in 2010 to 1.8 million units next year, making the company the third largest AIO
contractor in the coming year.</P>
      <P>HP and Levono will account for about 50 percent and 25 percent respectively of
TPV-Inventec's AIO orders in 2011, enabling the company to double its AIO
shipments, Chien added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese delegation will depart for Seoul Friday to attend a meeting of the
World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) disciplinary committee on an Asian Games
disqualification dispute involving one of Taiwan's top competitors.</P>
      <P>Among the delegation  members  is Yang Shu-chun,  who was disqualified from the
women's under 49-kilogram division in the taekwondo competition at the Asiad in
Guangzhou, China on Nov. 17 for allegedly wearing extra sensors in her socks in
an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Yang will be accompanied by Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA)
President Chen Chien-ping and her two coaches, Liu Ching-wen and Liu Tsung-ta,
CTTA Secretary-General Ho Feng-yen said Monday.</P>
      <P>"They will attend a WTF disciplinary committee meeting scheduled for Dec. 18 and
present written testimony in hopes of getting a fair solution to the dispute, "
Ho said, adding that the delegation will return to Taipei that same day.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old athlete, who was one Taiwan's top hopes for a gold medal at the
Asiad, was disqualified during her opening bout for using the extra sensors,
according to taekwondo officials.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match released later showed, however, that Yang was not
wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations by WTF and Asian
Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials of why Yang was disqualified have added to the
controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
but also vowed to take the case to the Court of Arbitration  for Sport if other
appeals failed to provide  a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) commissioned the law firm Lee and Li Attorneys-
at-Law to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Dec. 8
for Yang's controversial dismissal.</P>
      <P>SAC Vice Minister Steven S. K. Chen said last Friday that Taiwan could withdraw
the arbitration appeal if the WTF issues an acceptable statement after its Dec.
18 meeting.</P>
      <P>Major South Korean newspapers have prominently covered the disqualification row,
which they said has stalked anti-Korean sentiment among ordinary Taiwanese

      <P>Taiwan-based petrochemical giant Formosa Plastics Group categorically denied
Monday that the seven members in its core leadership have signed a secret deal
to retire by 2015.</P>
      <P>Media reports to that effect were groundless and fabricated by individual
reporters, the group said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The group's leadership succession recently became a hot issue in Taiwan
following three major fires affecting workplace safety in its factories in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A media report said Monday that the seven members of the group's "administrative
center" or core leadership signed a secret deal agreeing to hand their executive
power over to a new generation of managers before 2015.</P>
      <P>It said the so-called "seven-member core leadership" was composed of the
chairpersons of the group's four major corporations, four members of the Wang
family (two of whom also head two of the four major companies) and the general
manager of the Group Administration Office.</P>
      <P>All of the seven were appointed by Wang Yung-ching and Wang Yung-tsai, founders
of the group.</P>
      <P>Currently the four Wang family members are Sandy Wang, Susan Wang, Wilfred Wang
and Wang Wen-yuan. The latter two serve as the chairmen of Formosa Petrochemical
Corp. and Formosa Chemical and Fiber Corp., respectively.</P>
      <P>The other three are Nan Ya Plastics Corp. Chairman Wu Chin-jen, Formosa Plastics
Corp. Chairman Lee Chih-tsuen, and Yang Chao-lin, the head of the Group
Administration Office.</P>
      <P>The group said the chairpersons of the four major corporations were all elected
by their respective  board of directors and supervisors who were voted into
office by the shareholders.</P>
      <P>If there were any changes  of board  chairpersons,  their replacements  would
automatically  join the seven-member  core leadership, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Wang Yung-tsai did not have a high level of respect for
senior staff members, who had worked under the two founders, until the recent
safety incidents.</P>
      <P>The statement said that after Wang Yung-ching passed away, some senior staff
members did try to retire, but Wang Yung-tsai did all he could to retain them as
their services were critical to the group.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the safety incidents, they no longer indicated an intention to
retire as they all wanted to work harder together for the growth and development
of the Formosa Plastics Group, the statement said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Monday that capital
gains will be included in the formula to calculate premiums under a modified
proposal to reform the debt-ridden national health insurance system.</P>
      <P>Yaung was reporting to the Executive Yuan and the legislative caucus of the
ruling Kuomintang on his modified premium proposal after apparently scrapping a
long-held plan to calculate health insurance premiums on the basis of overall
household income last week.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the modified proposal would preserve the merits of the existing
system but would move toward taking care of families and including capital gains
to broaden the income base on which premiums are figured.</P>
      <P>At present, health insurance premiums are calculated based on an individual's
basic monthly salary and wages, with all other forms of unearned income and fees
excluded.</P>
      <P>According to participants at the meeting, several legislators asked Yaung to not
only to broaden the system's revenue base but also work actively to plug losses
from medical waste and estimate how much money could be saved each year.</P>
      <P>The participants said the capital gains initially targeted would be those that
are easily identified and of significant amounts.</P>
      <P>Service income and fees earned by professionals such as lawyers, which are
currently not classified as salary and are therefore not subject to premium
calculations, could be included in the new plan.</P>
      <P>But overtime payments or year-end bonuses earned by laborers could be excluded,
reflecting the DOH's effort to prevent putting too much of the revenue burden on
low-income earners.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's military rejected on Monday a proposal to allow one of its defense
installations on Kinmen to be used as a venue for a running race during next
year's Republic of China centennial celebration.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen  County government  suggested  transforming  the world-class Central
Tunnel that runs through Mt. Taiwu, the highest mountain on the former frontline
island, into a temporary sports venue.</P>
      <P>The venue would showcase Kinmen's transition from a military outpost to tourist
destination, said Kinmen County Education Bureau Director Lee Tzai-hang.</P>
      <P>He also said it would symbolize Kinmen's emergence from the shadow of war into
the light of peace.</P>
      <P>But Kinmen Defense Command officer Wu Fu-kuo said the tunnel, part of an
underground tunnel network, was still a key military installation that was not
open to the public.</P>
      <P>The underground tunnels played a key role in Kinmen's resistance against
Communist China's extensive shelling of the island in 1958.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled Monday that former first lady Wu Shu-jen should
serve a total of 17 1/2 years in jail after being convicted on corruption
charges in two separate cases.</P>
      <P>The high court also decided that Wu should be fined a total of NT$154 million
(US$5.13 million) for her offenses, which took place while her husband, Chen
Shui-bian, was serving as president.</P>
      <P>Wu's prison term and fines were identical to those handed down by the high court
earlier this month against the former president, who was convicted on the same
charges as his wife.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court was deciding whether three separate sentences handed down
against Wu by Taiwan's Supreme Court on Nov. 11 totaling 19 years and seven
months should be served concurrently or consecutively.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court sentenced the former first lady to 11 years in prison for
taking bribes in exchange for arranging a favorable land deal for a businessman.</P>
      <P>She was also given an eight-year sentence for accepting payments from a
businesswoman to help her secure the chairmanship of Taipei 101 owned by the
Taipei Financial  Center Corporation  and a seven-month sentence on a money
laundering conviction in connection to the case.</P>
      <P>After reviewing the cases, the high court panel of judges combined the three
sentences into a 17 1/2-year jail term.</P>
      <P>Despite the ruling, a high court spokesman said it had yet to be determined
whether the frail Wu, who uses a wheelchair, will actually serve time in jail.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office will refer Wu's medical records to the
Ministry of Justice and the Taichung Prison's Pei Teh Hospital to be reviewed
before deciding whether she is jailed.</P>
      <P>If it is determined  that Wu's health allows  her to be incarcerated, she would
mostly likely end up at the Taichung Prison hospital, the high court spokesman
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Moderate growth seen for all-in-one PC shipments: analyst</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Global shipments of all-in-one computers (AIO PCs) will grow at a moderate pace
in the coming years as they command a growing share of the overall personal
computer market, market tracker Digitimes Research said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Shipments of AIO PCs, which combine monitor and PC components in a single unit,
will reach an estimated 10.5 million units this year and 14 million units in
2011, according to a report released by Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>The market researcher projected the penetration rate of AIOs in the personal
computer market to grow from this year's 8 percent to 10 percent in 2011, 13
percent in 2012 and 16 percent in 2013.</P>
      <P>"AIO PCs are welcomed by mature markets such as Japan, the United States and
Europe, because consumers in these countries prefer PC models that look more
advanced, " Joanne Chien, senior analyst and director of Digitimes Research,
said in a telephone interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>But PC brands apart from Lenovo and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) have not yet been
very active in developing AIOs, which may lead to stiff competition among
Taiwan-based manufacturers for contract orders, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Pegatron Technology Corp.,  a manufacturing arm of Asustek Computer Inc. that
was spun off earlier this year, is expected to be one of the main beneficiaries
of the growing market, the report said.</P>
      <P>It will ship an estimated 2.6 million AIOs in 2011 to gain an 18 percent share
of the 2011 contract AIO market, trailing only Quanta Computer Inc., the report
said.</P>
      <P>"The split will help Pegatron  devote itself  to contract manufacturing, and
more than 40 percent of Pegatron's orders next year will come from HP," Chien
said.</P>
      <P>TPV-Inventec, a joint venture founded in 2009 by Hong Kong's TPV Technology Ltd.
and Taiwan's Inventec Corp., will also increase its shipments from 900,000 units
in 2010 to 1.8 million units next year, making the company the third largest AIO
contractor in the coming year.</P>
      <P>HP and Levono will account for about 50 percent and 25 percent respectively of
TPV-Inventec's AIO orders in 2011, enabling the company to double its AIO
shipments, Chien added.</P>

      <P>A Taiwanese delegation will depart for Seoul Friday to attend a meeting of the
World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) disciplinary committee on an Asian Games
disqualification dispute involving one of Taiwan's top competitors.</P>
      <P>Among the delegation  members  is Yang Shu-chun,  who was disqualified from the
women's under 49-kilogram division in the taekwondo competition at the Asiad in
Guangzhou, China on Nov. 17 for allegedly wearing extra sensors in her socks in
an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Yang will be accompanied by Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA)
President Chen Chien-ping and her two coaches, Liu Ching-wen and Liu Tsung-ta,
CTTA Secretary-General Ho Feng-yen said Monday.</P>
      <P>"They will attend a WTF disciplinary committee meeting scheduled for Dec. 18 and
present written testimony in hopes of getting a fair solution to the dispute, "
Ho said, adding that the delegation will return to Taipei that same day.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old athlete, who was one Taiwan's top hopes for a gold medal at the
Asiad, was disqualified during her opening bout for using the extra sensors,
according to taekwondo officials.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match released later showed, however, that Yang was not
wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations by WTF and Asian
Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials of why Yang was disqualified have added to the
controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
but also vowed to take the case to the Court of Arbitration  for Sport if other
appeals failed to provide  a satisfactory outcome.</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) commissioned the law firm Lee and Li Attorneys-
at-Law to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Dec. 8
for Yang's controversial dismissal.</P>
      <P>SAC Vice Minister Steven S. K. Chen said last Friday that Taiwan could withdraw
the arbitration appeal if the WTF issues an acceptable statement after its Dec.
18 meeting.</P>
      <P>Major South Korean newspapers have prominently covered the disqualification row,
which they said has stalked anti-Korean sentiment among ordinary Taiwanese
people.</P>
      <P>The sentiment was exacerbated by reports over the weekend that Korean
electronics company Samsung provided evidence in the European Union's price-
fixing probe against four Taiwanese display panel makers that led to stiff fines
against them.</P>
      <P>Samsung, the world's largest flat panel maker, was also allegedly part of the

      <P>Shin Kong Commercial Bank, a wholly-owned unit of Shin Kong Financial Holding
Co., said Tuesday it plans to open a full-service branch in Hong Kong in six
months.</P>
      <P>The bank said it was granted a license for the branch by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority on Dec. 10 after submitting an application in November 2009 to enter
the territory.</P>
      <P>The bank is now gearing up for preparation of the establishment of the Hong Kong
branch, including deciding where it will be located, it said.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong branch will become the bank's first overseas outlet. It currently
has a total of 105 branches all over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the bank, having a presence in Hong Kong is expected to boost the
bank's international visibility, because the territory has long been a regional
financial hub.</P>
      <P>By taking advantage of its geographic proximity to China, the Hong Kong branch
is also expected to help the bank continue to serve Taiwanese customers that
have established business ties with the mainland, the bank said.</P>
      <P>In the initial phase of its Hong Kong operations, the branch is expected to
provide deposit, remittance, U.S. dollar settlement, import-export and
receivables financing, syndicated loan, and trust services, the bank said.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong branch is also expected to seek approval from Hong Kong
authorities to provide Chinese yuan, wealth management and Internet banking
services in the near future.</P>

      <P>China Postal Airlines has obtained official permission to launch direct cargo
flights to Taiwan, with the first run set for Dec. 21 from Fuzhou to Taoyuan,
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Beijing-headquartered carrier is also planning to operate the Nanjing-
Taoyuan route, according to Taiwan's Chunghwa Post Co., which will consign some
of the company's cross-Taiwan Strait mail to the airline.</P>
      <P>China Postal Airlines was established in 1996 and currently owns 17 Boeing 737
all-cargo aircraft. It is the first Chinese carrier dedicated to express mail
and cargo transport services.</P>
      <P>The company is one of the five Chinese carriers designated by Beijing to operate
cross-strait cargo services.</P>
      <P>The other four are Air China Cargo, China Cargo Airlines, China Southern

      <P>Appointees would have to step down, for example, if there were clear evidence

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Health insurance plan may target capital gains</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Department  of Health (DOH)
12/14/10  15:37:24
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister Yaung Chih-liang revealed Monday that the merits of the existing
national health insurance (NHI) system will be preserved, but that capital gains
will be included in the formula used to calculate premiums.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of capital gains in the base of income on which premiums are
figured was just one of the proposed changes to amendments to the National
Health Insurance Act that failed to pass the Legislative Yuan last week.</P>
      <P>The setback in the legislature forced the DOH to change course and shelve its
second-generation  reform plan that would have collected premiums based on
overall household income rather than monthly salary and wages, as is the case at
present.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Cabinet  officials  discussed  the premium  issue with the legislative caucus of
the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) on Monday. Those who attended the meeting revealed
that Yaung set revenue source priorities for the health insurance system.</P>
      <P>Capital gains were at the top of the list, and if they were unable to adequately
narrow the system's financial shortfalls, the stock transaction tax would be the
next target, said officials attending Monday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Raising the tobacco surcharge and including year-end bonuses and overtime
payments in the income base for calculating premiums would be the last options,
they said.</P>
      <P>No final decision was made during the meeting on a proposal to increase the
stock transaction  tax to boost health insurance revenues, according to Ministry
of Finance (MOF) officials.</P>
      <P>"It is better for the health system not to rely on external aid," one finance
official said. (Dec. 14, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The Monday meeting was convened by Vice Premier Sean Chen and attended by
Finance Minister Lee Sush-der, DOH Minister Yaung and KMT lawmakers specializing
in financial and taxation issues.</P>
      <P>They were all focused on the problem of finding money for the health insurance
system.</P>
      <P>Lee was said to have presented data and information suggesting to the DOH
detailing where potential revenue sources existed. People at the meeting
described it as a puzzle of financial resources given to participants to see
which pieces were usable. (Dec. 14, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Both the MOF and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) opposed the idea of
raising the stock transaction tax as part of efforts to collect revenues for the
debt-ridden NHI system.</P>
      <P>The MOF said the NHI system is a kind of insurance policy that should be viewed
separately from the tax system. FSC officials contended that raising the tax
would increase investment costs in the stock market.</P>
      <P>"Everybody knows what the impact would be," on official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently does not tax capital gains on stock transactions but does
charge a 0.3 percent transaction tax on transaction turnover. The government
earned NT$105.9 billion income from the tax in 2009. (Dec. 14, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Tuesday after concerns over the
country's global competitiveness amid a rising New Taiwan dollar eroded early
gains on follow-through buying, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 3.84 points or 0.04 percent to end at 8,740.43, after
moving between 8,717.53 and 8,789.25, on turnover of NT$145.89 billion (US$4.86
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.40 percent and moved to the day's high on ample
liquidity, but sentiment turned sour as investors witnessed the New Taiwan
dollar extend its gains and breach the NT$30.00 level against the U.S. dollar to
hit a high of about 12 years during the trading session, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,738 stocks closed up and 2,630 were down, with 330 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector scored the highest gains, closing up 1.5 percent.
Construction stocks rose 0.9 percent, foodstuffs added 0.6 percent, and plastics
and chemical shares gained 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>However, cement stocks fell 1.0 percent and financial shares lost 0.7 percent,
while the machinery and electronics, and paper and pulp sectors both closed down
0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"As the index moved closer to the nearest resistance level at around 8,800
points, investors were pocketing their recent gains, " Horizon Securities
analyst Benson Huang said.</P>
      <P>"In particular after the New Taiwan dollar extended strength against the U.S.
dollar, fears that a rising local currency would hurt Taiwan's exports prompted
investors to sell," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said selling focused on the bellwether electronics sector, which serves as
the backbone of Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>However, as the index fell to about 8,700 points, bargain hunters became active
to lend some support to the market, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"After a recent strong showing, the market needs some time to consolidate before
another take-off to challenge the 8,800-8,900 point range or even higher," he
said.</P>
      <P>Among the high-tech stocks, PC vendor AsusTek shed 2.11 percent to close at
NT$278.50, United Microelectronics Corp. lost 0.93 percent to end the day at
NT$16.05  and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 0.58 percent to finish
at NT$69.00.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>is reportedly set to promote legislation that would heavily tax sales of non
self-use properties within the first year of ownership, the transfer of pre-sale
housing units, and the consumption of luxury items, in a bid to narrow the
widening gap between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>These sales taxes, however, are indirect in nature and are seldom used to
redistribute wealth. If the MOF is serious about resolving the problem, it
should not ignore the reforms needed to facilitate the taxing of capital gains.</P>
      <P>It appears that the proposed taxes would be more effective at cooling property
speculation than closing the wealth divide. Taxing sales of properties within
the first year of ownership, for example, would mean that any sale taking place
during this period would be subject to a heavy tax, irrespective of whether the
sale resulted in a profit or a loss. The tax would not be applicable, however,
to highly profitable transactions that occurred beyond the one-year limit.</P>
      <P>In addition, for the taxes to produce their desired effect, the government must
have the ability to get accurate real estate transaction prices. With the
government failing to make any progress in this area, there is reason for
skepticism over whether the proposed tax hikes can achieve their goals.</P>
      <P>Although President Ma Ying-jeou has vowed to promote tax reform to narrow the
country's wealth gap, the MOF must not mistake anti-speculation measures for an
effective weapon against the wealth gap. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 14, 2010)</P>

      <P>A second seminar on Taiwan-Indonesia collaboration opened in the Indonesian
capital of Jakarta Tuesday to further explore bilateral ties on a wide front
ranging from free trade agreements (FTAs) to challenges facing the media and
technology sectors.</P>
      <P>Andrew Hsia, representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Jakarta,
said countries in Southeast Asia now have greater imperative to step up ties
with Taiwan after the country clinched an economic cooperation framework
agreement with China in June.</P>
      <P>As cross-Taiwan Strait trade and tourism continues to grow based on improved
bilateral relations since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, many
Southeast Asian countries now want to follow suit, because of the simple
question: "If China can do it, why can't we?" said Hsia.</P>
      <P>At a time when these countries are seeking to forge FTAs with other countries,
Taiwan must not allow this opportunity to slip though its fingers, said, Samuel
C.Y. Ku, a professor at the Institute of China and Asia-Pacific Studies at
National Sun Yat-sen University, who is one of the 15-member delegation from
Taiwan attending the seminar.</P>
      <P>The seminar is being hosted by the Indonesian news magazine Tempo, and Edy Putra
Irawady, Indonesia's deputy economic minister for trade and industry, attended
the opening event.</P>
      <P>Much of Taiwan's investment in Indonesia is in metals, minerals and energy, but
in the future, Taiwan should also become interested in Indonesia's manufacturing
and electronics products, Edy said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC) , the world's top two contract chip makers, said Tuesday they will
consider taking into account a rising Taiwan dollar when setting prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's currency sustained its recent momentum and breached the NT$30 to the
U.S. dollar barrier to set a 12-year high in trading on Tuesday, leading to
concerns that Taiwan's exporters could see their turnover and margins fall.</P>
      <P>The two companies acknowledged that the appreciating Taiwan dollar had an impact
on their sales and earnings.</P>
      <P>UMC Chief Financial Officer Liu Chi-tung told the Central News Agency that the
company would consider negotiating  new sales contracts with buyers that had
factored in foreign exchange rate fluctuations.</P>
      <P>Liu said his company had taken measures to hedge foreign exchange risks, but he
admitted it was hard to accurately forecast exchange rate movements.</P>
      <P>TSMC said it would continue to adopt measures to hedge currency risks and
incorporate foreign exchange factors into its financial plan before opening
discussions  with customers  on new sales agreements.</P>
      <P>As for existing sales contracts, TSMC said it would bear the foreign exchange
risks on its own and would not renegotiate pricing with its customers.</P>
      <P>In November, TSMC and UMC saw their sales fall 4.1 percent and 2.43 percent from
October, respectively, on a stronger Taiwan dollar and weakening global demand
for PCs.</P>
      <P>UMC said that for every 1 percent the local currency appreciated against the
greenback, its quarterly sales could be expected to fall by the same 1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Acer Inc., the world's second largest PC vendor, said it had a
mechanism ready to hedge foreign exchange risks, which was limiting the impact
of a rising Taiwan dollar on the company.</P>
      <P>Acer said the local currency's strength reflected a spillover effect from
excessive liquidity from the United States, which is pumping massive funds into
the market in a bid to boost its economy.</P>
      <P>The PC vendor said it believes Taiwan's central bank will continue its efforts
to prevent rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and protect the island's
exports.</P>
      <P>The company said the central bank could be expected to continue to boost the
value of the U.S. dollar to around NT$30.60 against the New Taiwan dollar at the
close of trading sessions, even if the greenback fell below NT$30 during the
day.</P>

      <P>A growing number of people in Taiwan over the age of 50 are using the Internet,
according to an annual survey, released Tuesday, on the country's digital
divide.</P>
      <P>The survey by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
(RDEC) found that among people in the 50 to 60 age bracket, Internet usage was
47.5 percent, a 10 percent jump from last year.</P>
      <P>In the 60 to 64 age group, the rate of increase was about the same, from 22.3
percent last year to 33.1 percent this year, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>In the under-40 age group, the rate of Internet usage was 91 percent, the poll
found.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 80 percent of households have access to the Internet
and the wired population has grown by about 800,000 to 14.46 million in 2010.</P>
      <P>Ho Chuan-te, an official with the RDEC, said the increase in Internet usage
could be attributed to the government's efforts in recent years to narrow the
digital divide by expanding Internet access.</P>
      <P>Since last March, the RDEC has installed an additional 100 wireless Internet
hotspots in rural areas in Yilan, Nantou and Yunlin, Ho said at a press
conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it has introduced a program at 12 public libraries under which
citizens can borrow laptop computers, free of charge, for up to one month, he
said.</P>
      <P>This year, the RDEC increased the number of laptops for loan from 300 to 865 and
expanded the program to another 16 libraries in eight remote areas across
Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The RDEC continues to offer free computer lessons for senior citizens and
immigrants, he said.</P>
      <P>The rate of Internet connection in Taipei County, Taipei City, Taoyuan County,
Hsinchu City, and Taichung City is higher than 85 percent, with Taipei County
ranked as the country's most digitalized city, he noted.</P>
      <P>However, the rate of Internet connection in many parts of central, eastern, and
southern Taiwan and in the outlying islands is still below 75 percent, which
means there is plenty of room for improvement, he added.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out by telephone between July and August, among 16,008
people countrywide. It had a margin of error of 0.8 percentage points.</P>

technology to shrink the size of traditional flash memory is anticipated to
reach a bottleneck by 2013.</P>
      <P>Flash memory started with 90 nm process technology in 2004, which evolved to 32
nm this year and will shrink further to 22 nm in 2011, Ho said, adding that
development is expected to stop there.</P>
      <P>His research team, however, has successfully shrunk the size of the RRAM to 9
nm, while greatly reducing the power consumption by changing the chemical
composition of the tungsten-oxide layer.</P>
      <P>Despite using only a tiny amount of power, the new RRAM can store 500 gigabytes
of data on a one-square-centimeter chip, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The new technology will allow all kinds of data-processing electronic products
to be reduced in size, he added.</P>
      <P>Ho predicted that once mass production of the new RRAM begins, it will help
promote Taiwan's global memory output from the present less-than 1 percent to 10
percent.</P>

      <P>A lottery winner has donated NT$120 million (US$ 4 million) to charity groups
around the country, the Taiwan Lottery Co. said at a presentation ceremony in
Taitung County, eastern Taiwan, Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The NT$1.12 billion first prize was drawn in September and was the biggest
lottery prize ever to a single winner in Taiwan. The winner was a housewife in
her 30s from Taitung, said Taiwan Lottery Chairman Steve Hsueh.</P>
      <P>Charity groups in Taitung alone will receive donations totalling more than NT$30
million, he said.</P>
      <P>One of the charities, Star Home which houses mentally challenged children, said
that the NT$20 million donation it received was its largest in recent years.</P>
      <P>Around NT$55 million was given to the Chinatrust  Charity Foundation, which is
affiliated with the Chinatrust Commercial Bank that operates the Taiwan Lottery,
Hsueh said.</P>
      <P>In addition, a red envelope containing NT$1.5 million was presented to the owner
of the shop where the winning ticket was purchased. Taiwan Lottery, which made
the presentation on behalf of the winner, said the woman had been spending
around NT$1,000 per week for the last three years in lottery tickets.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that more than 56,000 underprivileged children and families in
Taiwan will benefit from the donor's generosity, according to Hsueh.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Tuesday, dropping NT$0.15 to
close at NT$30.450.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$814 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at the day's high of NT$30.600 and moved to a low of
NT$29.890 before rebounding.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the New Taiwan dollar was boosted by further inflows of foreign
funds and that at one point it breached the NT$30.00 level during the trade to
hit a 12-year high against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>They said the strength of the local currency reflected a strong rebound by the
local economy from a global financial meltdown in 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>Strong domestic fundamentals, coupled with the spillover effect of the high
liquidity in the United States market, have promoted many foreign investors to
move funds into Taiwan, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>Foreign banks remained on the buy side to raise their New Taiwan dollar
positions, betting that further appreciation of the local unit is inevitable
amid ample liquidity, dealers said.</P>
      <P>In late trade, Taiwan's central bank again stepped in to boost the value of the
U.S. dollar to above NT$30.00 in a bid to reduce the impact of the New Taiwan
dollar appreciation and protect Taiwan's exports, dealers said.</P>
      <P>As foreign funds keep flowing into the local market, the central bank's efforts
are unlikely to reverse the trend of a rising New Taiwan dollar but are expected
to slow down the pace of the appreciation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>They said the closing level of the New Taiwan dollar is expected to move closer
to NT$30.00 in the short term.</P>

      <P>Cheng Loong Corp., one of Taiwan's largest paper manufacturers, was awarded a
carbon labeling accreditation certificate by the government Tuesday in
recognition of its efforts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions throughout its
manufacturing process and supply chain.</P>
      <P>The certificate was presented by Stephen Shu-hung Shen, minister of the Cabinet-

Loong's production and distribution of a paper towel series made of recycled
paper.</P>
      <P>The certificate was the first of its kind to be awarded by the EPA to any
household paper product in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the recognition, Cheng Loong President Tsai Tong-ho said his
company will continue striving to use resources efficiently and contribute to
society with the goal of reducing the firm's CO2 emissions by 5 percent in three
years.</P>
      <P>According  to Tsai,  Cheng Loong followed carbon footprint verification norms of
the British Standards Institution (BSI) to produce and distribute the recycled
paper towels.</P>
      <P>The company tried to lower CO2 emissions throughout the entire production and
distribution process, involving raw material sourcing, towel manufacturing,
transport and waste disposal, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The EPA awarded the carbon labeling accreditation certificate to Cheng Loong

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the people Tuesday to take action instead of
just talking about his idea of "protecting the environment to save the country."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks after cutting the ribbon to open a green forum and expo in
the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung along with Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu
and American Institute in Taiwan's Taipei Office Director William Stanton.</P>
      <P>He said climate change has created such real-life situations as severe draughts
at one extreme to severe flooding  caused by torrential rainstorms at the other.</P>
      <P>It has become a reality that dry weather has become even drier and that
intensified downpours have been bringing even greater amounts of rain, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol, he advised the people to
cut the country's carbon dioxide emissions and save energy in order not to be
condemned or punished by the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen for her part said the president's visit to Kaohsiung's green industries
shows that he attaches great importance to the local government's green energy
projects.</P>
      <P>The city government has made good use of the sunshine in southern Taiwan to
develop green industries over the past few years, hoping to build Kaohsiung into
a "green city," said the mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma, Chen and Stanton also acted as "green energy ambassadors" by riding bicycles
that use clean energy to power their headlights, symbolizing that the city is
entering a new era of green energy and industry.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is among the developed nations of the world that rank their health and
well-being the lowest, according to a report by the Philips Center for Health
and Well-being.</P>
      <P>In the report, which analyzed the responses of more than 31,000 people in 23
countries, only 24 percent of the people in Taiwan had a positive view of their
well-being and state of health, compared to the global average of 62 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the report, financial concerns are key stress factors for
Taiwanese, as they are constantly worried about whether they have enough money
to pay bills and save for the future.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwanese have the second highest level of stress among the 23
countries surveyed, the survey found.</P>
      <P>According to the report, 94 percent of the Taiwanese respondents said they were
under much pressure.</P>
      <P>The report found that such stress has led to sleep deprivation, with about 50
percent of the Taiwanese respondents saying they lack sleep, the highest rate
among all the countries.</P>
      <P>People need to achieve a balance between work and other aspects of life in order

      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved a government proposal Tuesday to cover foreign
currency deposits and interest income under its deposit guarantee program, a
move that is expected to stabilize the local currency's exchange rate.</P>
      <P>Under the amendments to the Deposit Insurance Statute that cleared the
legislative floor that day, foreign currency deposits and interest generated
therefrom will be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>According to the government, this will serve as an incentive for people not to
move their foreign currency deposits into New Taiwan dollar savings accounts,
thus preventing the local currency from dramatic fluctuations on the foreign
exchange market.</P>
      <P>The amendments  do not apply to foreigners,  institutional investors, government
agencies or banking institutions that have foreign currency deposits in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An exclusion provision is included in the amended statute that stipulates that
it aims to protect non-professional depositors only, not institutional investors
or government agencies that deposit their foreign currency assets in the
international business departments of local banks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to assure the public of the safety of their bank deposits, the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), the Ministry of Finance and the central
bank have jointly announced that from Jan. 1, 2011, the amount of guaranteed
bank deposits will be set at NT$3 million (US$33,467).</P>
      <P>The announcement  came as a 2008 financial crisis measure protecting the full
amounts of people's bank savings is going to expire at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan said the government will be able to
ensure the safety of people's deposits in private banks despite the expiration
of the 2008 measure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not like the United States, where private banks can manage such huge
sums of money that it is beyond the government's ability to guarantee the safety
of individual citizens' deposits, Tsai said.</P>

      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park marked its 30th anniversary Tuesday, with the park's
administration Director-General Randy Yen vowing to maintain its role as a
bellwether of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Yen, who worked in companies at the high-tech park for 19 years, said the
"second energy crisis" in the 1970s paved the way for the establishment of the
science park in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu area, which helped Taiwan's economy
take off in the 1980s ahead of many neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>The park has not only contributed greatly to the nation's technological
development, but has also boosted the local economy and helped Hsinchu achieve
the lowest jobless rate and the highest per-capita income among similar areas in
Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, 110 of the companies located in the compound have a combined annual
revenue of NT$2.2 trillion (US$73.33 billion) , accounting for 20 percent of the
total in Taiwan's manufacturing sector.</P>
      <P>Based on the existing scale of the park and its semiconductor and optoelectronic
clusters, it is poised to evolve into a nanotechnology hub and will continue to
lead Taiwan's economic development, he said.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Yen said his administration remains committed to
improving the investment climate in the park and encouraging  more businesses
to open shop there as means of contributing to the country.</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science Park is Taiwan's  first science  park established in 1980 to
introduce and upgrade the high-tech industries of the country as well as to
drive its economic developments. There are three science parks in northern,
central and southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will set up a database to help local
restaurants and cafes seeking to expand overseas to better understand
regulations and consumers' habits in China, the United States and Europe, an
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We plan to establish a database to help local food companies search for
information, for example, about U.S. laws and regulations and consumer behavior,
" Yeh Yun-lung, director-general of the MOEA's Department of Commerce told CNA
at an event featuring popular Taiwanese snacks and award-winning cuisine.</P>
      <P>The department will kick off the plan next year, with China the first country
featured, he said.</P>
      <P>"China shares a similar language and cultural backgrounds with us. It is also
the first place outside Taiwan where we can easily see success," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>His remarks came amid a growing number of Taiwanese restaurants and cafes --
including cafe and bakery chain 85JC-- that have been extending their presence
in China and elsewhere in recent years.</P>
      <P>After creating the China database, the government will apply the model to Europe
and the United States, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he cited the lack of management professionals as one of the other
major hurdles facing local restaurants and cafes when they are increasing the
number of outlets in other countries.</P>
      <P>At the event, Chang Kuo-rong, chairman of the board of the Taipei Bakery
Association, said Taiwan has a big pool of specialized bakers due to the
competitive local market.</P>
      <P>However, he also noted that the country now suffers from a shortage of
management specialists for overseas operations and urged the department to
allocate funds in this regard as part of the database plan.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Cabinet approved a plan to add 3,500 food and beverage
outlets at home and abroad and to create 10,000 jobs between 2010 and 2013.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to boost the number of international brands to 50 and
encourage the private sector to invest a total of NT$2 billion (US$67 million)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of influenza A(H1N1) infections in Taiwan has been rising over the
past few weeks, but the situation is not expected to escalate into a full-
fledged outbreak, according to health experts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Director-General of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Lin Ting said
Tuesday that 43 percent of the flu cases reported in the past three months were
caused by the A(H1N1) virus, 33 percent by the A/H3 virus and 23 percent by the
influenza B virus.</P>
      <P>The ratios have changed, he noted, saying that in the past, 80 percent of flu
infections in the country were caused by the A/H3 virus.</P>
      <P>The CDC thinks the shift is not a big problem, but is worried that pre-school
children could be hit by the current wave of H1N1 as only less than half of them
have been inoculated against the virus since a national H1N1 vaccination program
was launched in October, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, when asked about the increase in the number of H1N1 cases,
pediatrician Chen Chih-jung at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital said he does
not expect a major outbreak of H1N1 infections this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the countries hit by the H1N1 flu virus in 2009. More than 800
people in Taiwan were hospitalized with H1N1 symptoms last year and 35 of them
died.</P>
      <P>Since then, about one third of the population has acquired immunity to the H1N1
flu virus, either through vaccination or infection, Chen said.</P>

million, and for repeat offenses to a maximum prison term of five years and a
fine of up to NT$2.4 million, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>At present, the maximum fine for the brokering of illegal workers is NT$500,000,
and repeat offenders within a five year period could be sentenced to one year in
jail and a fine of up to NT$600,000.</P>
      <P>As to other measures targeting the more than 1,000 registered labor brokers in
the country, brokers could have their license revoked if it is found that there
is an excessively high runaway rate among the workers they bring in, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He added that the government believes brokers must take major responsibility for
the problem of runaways because brokers are the main suppliers of foreign labor.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics show that there are around 34,000 runaway foreign workers in
Taiwan. The issue has drawn much attention in the wake of the Sept. 6 deaths of
six runaway foreign workers, who were illegally employed at a construction site
on the No. 6 Freeway.</P>

      <P>An estimated 45,000 low-income families will benefit from a government program
to subsidize house rentals, the Ministry of the Interior said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said its integrated housing subsidy program is being expanded to
increase the number of families eligible for rental subsidies. Some NT$1.95
billion (US$65.26 million) has been budgeted for the 45,000 families for one
year, it noted.</P>
      <P>Families whose applications for rental subsidy are approved will receive a
maximum of NT$3,600 (US$120) per month for up to 12 months.</P>
      <P>The program is also aimed at helping to ease the burden of those who have bought
housing over the past two years by subsidizing their mortgage interest
repayments. Only first-time owners are eligible for such subsidies.</P>
      <P>If they have to borrow money to renovate older houses or apartments,  subsidies
for those interest repayments  are also available, said the ministry.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the housing subsidy program is part of the
government's social housing policy that seeks to help the economically or
socially disadvantaged improve their living conditions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Commercial notebook market to grow slightly next year: researchers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The commercial notebook market will experience slight growth in 2011, although
demand for consumer notebooks is slowing due to emerging interest in tablet
computers and e-readers, market researchers said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ryan Lee, a researcher with the Topology Research Institute, told CNA in a
telephone interview that the commercial notebook market will grow slightly from
35 percent of the total notebook market this year to 37 percent in 2011.</P>
      <P>The growth of the commercial market is not expected to surge because most firms
still have greater demand for desktop computers than for notebooks, which are
mostly used by sales departments, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The commercial notebook market will post a higher growth than the consumer
notebook market next year because companies have raised their budgets for
computer purchases, said Dickie Chang, a senior analyst with global market
tracker International Data Corp., in a telephone interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>"Corporations need more time than ordinary consumers to plan for their budgets
for buying computers, and they have finally decided to expand their hardware
equipment after a period of observation that has lasted since 2009," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, consumers will be less likely to spend money on notebooks now that
they have other options such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, leading to a
slowdown in demand for consumer notebooks, he noted.</P>
      <P>However, Asustek Computer Inc. is reported to be shipping an estimated 20
million notebooks in 2011, representing growth of 18 percent from this year's 17
million units, according to the Tuesday edition of Apple Daily, a local
newspaper.</P>
      <P>The company also expects  total revenue of NT$380 billion (US$12.73 billion) in
2011, up 18.8 percent from an estimated NT$320 billion in 2010, as it plans to
sell more tablets and e-readers during the same period, the paper said.</P>
      <P>Regarding netbook inventories, Chang added, PC vendors like Asustek will have to
make efforts in product segmentation, as it plans to launch new tablets early
next year.</P>
      <P>The software integration of the devices and relationships with retailers will
also be important issues for Asustek if the company wants its new products to
generate more revenue, he said.</P>

      <P>Car sales in Taiwan in the first 10 days of December rose 17.3 percent from a
year earlier to 7,439 units on rising demand as the local economy staged a
strong rebound, a car dealer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Hotai Motor Co., the Taiwanese distributor for Japanese car maker
Toyota Motor Corp., Taiwan's auto sales between Jan.1 and Dec. 10 rose 17.7
percent year on year to 304,246 units, surpassing the 294,000 units recorded for
the entire 2009.</P>
      <P>A market consensus showed the growing domestic economy, coupled with the effects
of the auto industry's peak season in the fourth quarter, is expected to boost
sales for 2010 to 325,000 units, up about 10 percent from 2009.</P>
      <P>Previously, Hotai Motor had forecast sales of 300,000 units for 2010.</P>
      <P>In November, the government revised Taiwan's 2010 economic growth to 9.98
percent, from a previous estimate of 8.24 percent, to reflect a strong rebound
in the first three quarters of the year on a recovery in private consumption and
private investments as well as a strong rebound in exports.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, the island's gross domestic product rose
12 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Yulon Motor Group Chief Executive Office Kenneth Yen said he
was optimistic about the outlook of the local auto market for 2011 and forecast
that car sales will range between 320,000 units and 350,000 units.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a rising New Taiwan dollar is expected to cut production costs for
local auto makers as key imported car components have become cheaper, market
observers said.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar extended its strength against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday
and at one point breached the NT$30.00 mark to hit a 12-year high during the
trading session before the central bank intervened to slow down the pace of
appreciation.</P>
      <P>Due to the central bank's presence, the U.S. dollar closed at NT$30.045,
recovering from a low of NT$29.890 Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Market observers said the New Taiwan dollar is expected to gain strength, which
will continue to lower auto makers' production costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou acknowledged Tuesday the recent passage of amendments
that push Taiwan's official poverty line higher and help narrow the gap between
the country's rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular meeting of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Ma, who doubles as
party chairman, said the amendments are a milestone in Taiwan's social welfare
system, as it increase the number of beneficiaries to some 3.7 percent of the
country's population, according to KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>"The increased  number of people allowed access to public assistance is
conducive to narrowing the wealth gap," Ma said.</P>
      <P>More lower-income households will soon be eligible for government subsidies
after the Legislative Yuan passed the amendments Dec. 10 that change how
Taiwan's official poverty line is defined and who can have access to public
assistance.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the Public Assistance Act, scheduled to take effect July 1,
2011, should add 590,000 people to the number of households eligible for
government assistance, Ma said during the meeting, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The bulk of those newly eligible to receive aid will be near poor households
with average income per household member no more than 1.5 times as high as the
poverty line.</P>
      <P>That group was previously  excluded from public assistance provisions, but the
new amendments incorporated them among those eligible for financial aid.</P>
      <P>Other new recipients will receive assistance by falling under the higher poverty
line, or "minimum cost of living."</P>
      <P>At present, the minimum cost of living is defined as 60 percent of the average
per capita consumption expenditure, but the new revisions change that to 60
percent of the median disposable income per capita.</P>
      <P>The minimum cost of living, which varies from region to region, will be set at
NT$14,794 (US$493) in Taipei City, NT$11,146 in Kaohsiung City, NT$11,832 in
Xinbei City, NT$10,303 in Taichung City, NT$10,244 in Tainan City, and NT$10,244
in other cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>Households with levels of average income per household member lower than the
minimum cost of living can apply for public subsidies.</P>
      <P>The new formula raises the poverty line by roughly 5 percent-10 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, fewer than 1 percent of Taiwan's population is
eligible for government assistance, much lower than the percentage in
neighboring countries and areas such as South Korea and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on controversy over the proposed second-generation health insurance
reform plan, which failed to pass the legislature last week, the president said
Department of Health officials will continue to communicate with lawmakers until
a new version of the amendment package can be modified to forge the widest
consensus possible on the issue, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The authorities involved should exchange opinions to fine-tune the technical
details of the national health insurance (NHI) reform plan -- mainly on how
health insurance premiums should be calculated -- based on the principles of
fairness, quality and efficiency, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president said the second-generation NHI system is of extraordinary
significance to Taiwan society, adding that the NHI system, which covers 99.6
percent of the population compared to 85 percent in the United States, is
globally recognized.</P>
      <P>"Why don't we take these controversy as an opportunity to better exchange
opinions?" Ma was quoted as asking.</P>

      <P>The Wushantou Reservoir Scenic Area has become a hot tourist spot, with an
increasing number of Japanese visitor arrivals, the Siraya National Scenic
Administration in southern Taiwan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The number of Japanese visitors as of November had reached 4,000, achieving the
whole-year record of 4,000 in 2009, the administration said, adding that more
than 120,000 people in Taiwan and from around the world had visited the scenic
area so far this year.</P>
      <P>Yoichi Hatta, the Japanese engineer who built the reservoir in 1930 and who
enjoyed widespread fame in Taiwan and Japan, could be the major pull for the
Japanese, said Huang Ling-ying, a spokeswoman for the Chianan Irrigation
Association.</P>
      <P>In addition, the fact that Wushantou is recognized as a civil engineering
heritage by the Japan Society of Civil Engineering might also help increase the
area's popularity among travelers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>When the Japanese visitors arrive, they usually arrange in-depth tours with an
interpreter and visit the Hatta Memorial Museum and related cultural sites in
the area, she went on.</P>
      <P>"They are impressed by Hatta's achievements and by how Taiwanese people remember
him", Huang added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has filed an application to have Wushantou Reservoir listed as a world-
class heritage and the foreign language guide services and visitor facilities
will be improved to help with the bid and make it into an international

      <P>An online clothing store, dubbed Taiwan's Uniqlo, is enjoying a booming business
that can rival the success of those retailers with 200 stores on the streets.</P>
      <P>In four years, lativ, founded by Chang Wei-chiang, has seen its revenue grow
from NT$10 million (US$331,510) to an estimated NT$1.5 billion this year.</P>
      <P>"Many people have said that I imitated Uniqlo, but actually I learned from Jimmy
Lai, whose books I have all read two or three times, " said Chang,  who has a
vocational school degree in electronics.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes that Lai, a media mogul who first made his name in Hong
Kong, succeeded by choosing the right mass market and focusing on doing simple
things well.</P>
      <P>When Chang decided to go into business, his target was the market of affordable
quality clothing. He noticed that most of the online clothing stores were
selling trendy, fancy and cheap clothes that were of poor quality, he said.  He
set about learning the basics of the clothing business, studying fabrics,
patterns and cut. He also visited textile factories in northern Taiwan,
sometimes spending a whole day there just observing.</P>
      <P>Although  lativ  demands  high  quality  from its contract manufacturers, the
local industry now runs at full capacity almost all year long to supply the
online company. Previously, the contract manufacturers would close during the
low season.</P>
      <P>Putting most of its spending into maintaining quality, lativ is able to offer
affordable prices by keeping its production lines simple, which lowers the cost
of large production orders.</P>
      <P>In addition, the retailer saves 60 percent in costs because its distribution is
done online, which means there are no rent or utility expenses as in a brick-
and-mortar shop.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  Chang has a unique inventory system that he designed, using his
past experience in writing computer programs, which makes the processing of
orders more efficient.</P>
      <P>The retailer's adherence to quality has gained trust among its customers, which
is crucial for an online business. Eighty percent of lativ's 250,000 members are
repeat buyers.</P>
      <P>In one year, the brand managed to sell 600,000 polo shirts at a price of NT$168
each.</P>
      <P>Sunny Huang, executive director of New Wide Group, a Uniqlo supplier, said lativ
has achieved a lot.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, the brand's next challenge will be to deal with the limited
scale of business in Taiwan and shortfalls in supply that make it difficult to
meet market demand.</P>
      <P>With persistence and simple product designs, Chang has created a successful
clothing brand in Taiwan. But in moving forward, he will have to overcome the
challenges of the market.</P>

percent year on year to 304,246 units, surpassing the 294,000 units recorded for
the entire 2009.</P>
      <P>A market consensus showed the growing domestic economy, coupled with the effects
of the auto industry's peak season in the fourth quarter, is expected to boost
sales for 2010 to 325,000 units, up about 10 percent from 2009.</P>
      <P>Previously, Hotai Motor had forecast sales of 300,000 units for 2010.</P>
      <P>In November, the government revised Taiwan's 2010 economic growth to 9.98
percent, from a previous estimate of 8.24 percent, to reflect a strong rebound
in the first three quarters of the year on a recovery in private consumption and
private investments as well as a strong rebound in exports.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, the island's gross domestic product rose
12 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Yulon Motor Group Chief Executive Office Kenneth Yen said he
was optimistic about the outlook of the local auto market for 2011 and forecast
that car sales will range between 320,000 units and 350,000 units.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a rising New Taiwan dollar is expected to cut production costs for
local auto makers as key imported car components have become cheaper, market
observers said.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar extended its strength against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday
and at one point breached the NT$30.00 mark to hit a 12-year high during the
trading session before the central bank intervened to slow down the pace of
appreciation.</P>
      <P>Due to the central bank's presence, the U.S. dollar closed at NT$30.045,
recovering from a low of NT$29.890 Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Market observers said the New Taiwan dollar is expected to gain strength, which
will continue to lower auto makers' production costs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Higher poverty line helps narrow wealth gap: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
12/14/10  22:25:26
(By Lee Shu-hua and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou acknowledged Tuesday the recent passage of amendments
that push Taiwan's official poverty line higher and help narrow the gap between
the country's rich and poor.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular meeting of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), Ma, who doubles as
party chairman, said the amendments are a milestone in Taiwan's social welfare
system, as it increase the number of beneficiaries to some 3.7 percent of the
country's population, according to KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin.</P>
      <P>"The increased  number of people allowed access to public assistance is
conducive to narrowing the wealth gap," Ma said.</P>
      <P>More lower-income households will soon be eligible for government subsidies
after the Legislative Yuan passed the amendments Dec. 10 that change how
Taiwan's official poverty line is defined and who can have access to public
assistance.</P>
      <P>The amendments to the Public Assistance Act, scheduled to take effect July 1,
2011, should add 590,000 people to the number of households eligible for
government assistance, Ma said during the meeting, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The bulk of those newly eligible to receive aid will be near poor households
with average income per household member no more than 1.5 times as high as the
poverty line.</P>
      <P>That group was previously  excluded from public assistance provisions, but the
new amendments incorporated them among those eligible for financial aid.</P>
      <P>Other new recipients will receive assistance by falling under the higher poverty
line, or "minimum cost of living."</P>
      <P>At present, the minimum cost of living is defined as 60 percent of the average
per capita consumption expenditure, but the new revisions change that to 60
percent of the median disposable income per capita.</P>
      <P>The minimum cost of living, which varies from region to region, will be set at
NT$14,794 (US$493) in Taipei City, NT$11,146 in Kaohsiung City, NT$11,832 in
Xinbei City, NT$10,303 in Taichung City, NT$10,244 in Tainan City, and NT$10,244
in other cities and counties around the country.</P>
      <P>Households with levels of average income per household member lower than the
minimum cost of living can apply for public subsidies.</P>
      <P>The new formula raises the poverty line by roughly 5 percent-10 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations, fewer than 1 percent of Taiwan's population is
eligible for government assistance, much lower than the percentage in
neighboring countries and areas such as South Korea and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on controversy over the proposed second-generation health insurance
reform plan, which failed to pass the legislature last week, the president said
Department of Health officials will continue to communicate with lawmakers until
a new version of the amendment package can be modified to forge the widest
consensus possible on the issue, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The authorities involved should exchange opinions to fine-tune the technical
details of the national health insurance (NHI) reform plan -- mainly on how
health insurance premiums should be calculated -- based on the principles of
fairness, quality and efficiency, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president said the second-generation NHI system is of extraordinary
significance to Taiwan society, adding that the NHI system, which covers 99.6
percent of the population compared to 85 percent in the United States, is
globally recognized.</P>
      <P>"Why don't we take these controversy as an opportunity to better exchange
opinions?" Ma was quoted as asking.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Wushantou Reservoir Scenic Area has become a hot tourist spot, with an
increasing number of Japanese visitor arrivals, the Siraya National Scenic
Administration in southern Taiwan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The number of Japanese visitors as of November had reached 4,000, achieving the
whole-year record of 4,000 in 2009, the administration said, adding that more
than 120,000 people in Taiwan and from around the world had visited the scenic
area so far this year.</P>
      <P>Yoichi Hatta, the Japanese engineer who built the reservoir in 1930 and who
enjoyed widespread fame in Taiwan and Japan, could be the major pull for the
Japanese, said Huang Ling-ying, a spokeswoman for the Chianan Irrigation
Association.</P>
      <P>In addition, the fact that Wushantou is recognized as a civil engineering
heritage by the Japan Society of Civil Engineering might also help increase the
area's popularity among travelers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>When the Japanese visitors arrive, they usually arrange in-depth tours with an
interpreter and visit the Hatta Memorial Museum and related cultural sites in
the area, she went on.</P>
      <P>"They are impressed by Hatta's achievements and by how Taiwanese people remember
him", Huang added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has filed an application to have Wushantou Reservoir listed as a world-
class heritage and the foreign language guide services and visitor facilities
will be improved to help with the bid and make it into an international

    <TEXT>
      <P>An online clothing store, dubbed Taiwan's Uniqlo, is enjoying a booming business
that can rival the success of those retailers with 200 stores on the streets.</P>
      <P>In four years, lativ, founded by Chang Wei-chiang, has seen its revenue grow
from NT$10 million (US$331,510) to an estimated NT$1.5 billion this year.</P>
      <P>"Many people have said that I imitated Uniqlo, but actually I learned from Jimmy
Lai, whose books I have all read two or three times, " said Chang,  who has a
vocational school degree in electronics.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes that Lai, a media mogul who first made his name in Hong
Kong, succeeded by choosing the right mass market and focusing on doing simple
things well.</P>
      <P>When Chang decided to go into business, his target was the market of affordable
quality clothing. He noticed that most of the online clothing stores were
selling trendy, fancy and cheap clothes that were of poor quality, he said.  He
set about learning the basics of the clothing business, studying fabrics,
patterns and cut. He also visited textile factories in northern Taiwan,
sometimes spending a whole day there just observing.</P>
      <P>Although  lativ  demands  high  quality  from its contract manufacturers, the
local industry now runs at full capacity almost all year long to supply the
online company. Previously, the contract manufacturers would close during the
low season.</P>
      <P>Putting most of its spending into maintaining quality, lativ is able to offer
affordable prices by keeping its production lines simple, which lowers the cost
of large production orders.</P>
      <P>In addition, the retailer saves 60 percent in costs because its distribution is
done online, which means there are no rent or utility expenses as in a brick-
and-mortar shop.</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  Chang has a unique inventory system that he designed, using his
past experience in writing computer programs, which makes the processing of
orders more efficient.</P>
      <P>The retailer's adherence to quality has gained trust among its customers, which
is crucial for an online business. Eighty percent of lativ's 250,000 members are
repeat buyers.</P>
      <P>In one year, the brand managed to sell 600,000 polo shirts at a price of NT$168
each.</P>
      <P>Sunny Huang, executive director of New Wide Group, a Uniqlo supplier, said lativ
has achieved a lot.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, the brand's next challenge will be to deal with the limited
scale of business in Taiwan and shortfalls in supply that make it difficult to
meet market demand.</P>
      <P>With persistence and simple product designs, Chang has created a successful
clothing brand in Taiwan. But in moving forward, he will have to overcome the
challenges of the market.</P>

      <P>A great-granddaughter of a Japanese close friend of Sun Yat-sen, the Republic of
China's founding father, said Tuesday that she plans to shoot a film next year
in memory of the friendship between her great-grandfather and Sun.</P>
      <P>Her great-grandfather, Umeya Shokichi (1868-1934), forged close relations with
Sun and provided generous funding during the latter's uprising against the Qing
dynasty in the early 20th century.</P>
      <P>Ayano Kosaka, who arrived in Taiwan Dec. 12 for a four-day visit, noted that
next year marks the centennial of the ROC and said it would be a good time to
shoot a film to mark the close relationship between the two men.</P>
      <P>Kosaka, who is visiting Taiwan to see at first hand the country's historic sites
related to Sun, made the remarks during a meeting with ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General King Pu-tsun at the party's headquarters.</P>
      <P>For his part, King said it would be "significant" if she shoots the film, adding
that Taiwan's Council for Cultural Affairs will also make a movie to depict
Sun's life and that both sides could exchange ideas on the projects.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Kosaka visited the KMT Party Records Archives. She is also
scheduled to visit the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall and the National Palace Museum
Wednesday before returning to Japan.</P>
      <P>King called on Kosaka when he visited Japan in September, during which he was

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Time to change election subsidy rules</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/15/10  10:42:21
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is estimated that the Central Election Commission will pay out more than
NT$500 million (US$16.42 million) in election subsidies -- based on arate of
NT$30 per vote -- to candidates in the Nov. 27 special municipality elections.</P>
      <P>The recipients will use the money in different ways after deducting prepaid
expenses. Some will donate the balance to charity or set up a fund, but most
candidates may simply keep the windfall in their own pocket.</P>
      <P>The subsidy was originally intended to help individuals with limited finances
have a fair chance to participate in elections. The concept, however, appears
unrealistic now that a bipartisan model of politics has emerged in Taiwan, and
the Political Donations Act allows every candidate a fair chance to raise funds
through normal means.</P>
      <P>An adjustment must be made to the simple formula used to calculate the payable
subsidy. As prominent candidates in large elections, such as a presidential
race, tend to receive huge political contributions, they should obtain lower
levels of subsidies to prevent "the wealthy from getting even wealthier."</P>
      <P>Different  subsidy  standards  should be set for different elections. And
political parties should also require their candidates to contribute any
subsidies left after deducting expenses to a party fund to make the politicians
understand that they did not "earn" the money by themselves. (Editorial abstract

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Foolish to delay AUO China project</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/15/10  12:50:51
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the signing of the Economic Cooperation  Framework Agreement  and
friendly  interaction  with  China  under  the administration of President Ma
Ying-jeou, the hostile tone of cross-Taiwan Strait economic ties has not changed
much. This is illustrated by the slow screening of flat panel maker AU Optronics
Corp.'s (AUO's) plan to invest in China.</P>
      <P>In screening the project, which has been under review now for a year, the
authorities must understand the coopetitive relationship between the upstream
and downstream sections of the flat panel industry.</P>
      <P>South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan are the four major players in the industry.
Although Taiwan's AUO and Chimei Innolux Corp. are both large manufacturers,
they are obviously inferior to their South Korean counterparts when it comes to
vertical integration.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a subsidy program promoted by China to encourage consumer electronics
purchases by rural residents, Taiwan's flat panel makers received many orders
from Chinese consumer electronics manufacturers. Samsung was not chosen as a
cooperation partner because  the Korean  flat panel maker also produces
consumer electronics and was thus a competitor to Chinese manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Based on this reasoning, China has welcomed the AUO investment project with open
arms and is looking forward to cooperation with Taiwan. Such a good opportunity,
however, has been delayed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a year, a
situation made worse by the stupid requirement that Taiwan-funded plants in
China must be at least one generation behind their parent firms technologically.</P>
      <P>In the context of industrial competition, Taiwan's enemy is not necessarily
China,  but is most likely South Korea.  The Ma administration must come to its
senses and not be fooled by those incompetent economics officials any longer.

    <HEADLINE>India trade fair reflects MediaTek's diversification goal: analyst</HEADLINE>

      <P>The presence of integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. at a mobile
communication applications exhibition in India reflects the company's effort to
diversify its customer base and offset the impact of escalating price
competition in China, an analyst said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MediaTek announced Tuesday it had joined forces with the CMAI Association of
India to hold a two-day India-China Sourcing Mobile Fair 2010, which will run
through Thursday.</P>
      <P>The company said it was displaying its latest communication technology and
innovative smartphones, as well as its 3G and multimedia solutions, at the trade
show.</P>
      <P>Co-organizing the event showed MediaTek's "strong commitment to the India market
and "its leading position gained through continuous efforts to deliver the best
service and wireless platform solutions to local customers," the company said.</P>
      <P>The move into India could help the chip designer balance the low margins
plaguing its sales to China, which is currently MediaTek's biggest market, an
analyst said.</P>
      <P>"India is a fast growing market for the global cell phone business. As MediaTek
is faced with fierce competition in China, diversification of its customer base
is one of the solutions to the problem," Grand Cathay Securities analyst Julian
Wang said.</P>
      <P>"India is one of the most important emerging markets because of its huge
population. MediaTek cannot afford to ignore it, " Wang added.</P>
      <P>According to industry market researcher Gartner Inc., India was likely to post
the most rapid growth of mobile phone users in the world in 2010, with the
number expected to hit 660 million by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Wang said a price war in China dragged down MediaTek's gross margin in the third
quarter, and it could further deteriorate in the final three months of the year.</P>
      <P>In the July-September period, MediaTek's gross margin stood at 52.22 percent,
down 2.81 percentage points from the second quarter, and Wang said the figure
might fall below 50 percent in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>"The company has no choice but to find ways to ease the downward pressure on the
gross margin," Wang said.</P>
      <P>At the trade fair, MediaTek is showcasing a series of handsets based on its
latest single chip -- the MT6253 -- and an Android platform customized for the
India market with a wide range of applications, including online games such as
Acorn Mafia, Mini Map and Navigation.</P>
      <P>The CMAI Association of India is a group that promotes the Indian IT and telecom
sector.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Motech Industries, Inc., a Taiwan-based solar cell maker, said Wednesday it has
been accepted as a member by the European Photovoltaic Industry Association
(EPIA) , becoming the first Taiwanese solar company to join the group.</P>
      <P>According to Motech, the EPIA is the world's largest industry association
devoted to the development of the solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity market.</P>
      <P>Its main priority is to assist its members in developing their businesses in the
European Union and promoting exports in other markets.</P>
      <P>"We are taking this opportunity to gain a greater understanding and increase our
involvement in the policies that have and will continue to shape this market, "
said Motech CEO P.H. Chang in a statement.</P>
      <P>"In addition, our membership in the EPIA assures our worldwide partners of our
continued presence in the market," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Motech's admission into the association follows its establishment of a
representative office in Europe at the beginning of this year to provide better
service and support to its customers there.</P>
      <P>Motech said the opening of the office demonstrated its intention to pay closer
attention to its global customers, and the company credited the move with
helping it gain admission into the EPIA.</P>
      <P>The company has seen its fortunes improve this year, posting NT$2.80 billion
(US$93.70 million) in net profit in the first nine months, compared with a net
loss of NT$387 million recorded during the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker,
currently holds about a 20 percent stake in Motech as part of its efforts to
diversify into the renewable energy sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Electronics makers reeling as NT$ rising</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/15/10  14:52:39
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar hit a 13-year high of NT$29.89 against the U.S. dollar during
trading on the local foreign exchange market Tuesday, but made gains later to
close at NT$30.45, a nearly 0.5 percent rise from the previous day's close of
NT$30.6.</P>
      <P>Although the greenback's value remained above NT$30 in interbank trading, it
fell below that benchmark level in transactions between banks and individual
customers. At the Bank of Taiwan, regular clients were buying the U.S. dollar at
NT$29.98 Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the Taiwan dollar has drawn complaints from local export-
oriented  industries,  electronics  contractors  in particular.</P>
      <P>Major notebook contractors, such as Quanta, Compal and Pegatron, said their
gross margin for the fourth quarter of this year will drop further below 4
percent because of the local currency's continuing rise.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Citing Reuters quotes, local electronics makers said the Korean won has
appreciated only about 2.13 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year,
far less than the 7.07 percent surge in the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>If the Taiwan dollar were to continue strengthening against the U.S. dollar,
local downstream electronics companies could lose their edge in the highly
competitive field.</P>
      <P>Because of cutthroat competition and currency appreciation, local electronics
contract makers saw their gross margins fall below 4 percent in the third
quarter for the first time, and those margins would be further eroded by the
ongoing appreciation of the local currency.</P>
      <P>A Pegatron spokesman said the Taiwan dollar's rise had lowered the company's
gross margin by 0.7-0.8 percentage points in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>In comparison, upstream vendors were more optimistic about their ability to
absorb currency fluctuations.  Executives of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., United Microelectronic Corp. and the ASE Group said the currency's
appreciation would only have a limited impact on their sales and margins because
it would also help lower the costs of production equipment and raw materials.
(Dec. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar surged to NT$29.89 against the U.S. dollar at one point
Tuesday, the highest level it had ever attained since Perng Fai-nan took the
helm at the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in February 1998.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the central bank's intervention late in the trading session, the
Taiwan dollar closed at NT$30.45 against the greenback, which still marked a
28-month high.</P>
      <P>The public reacted calmly to the currency's  appreciation, however, with no
local banks reporting a rush to unload the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Senior bankers  said that because  the greenback's  recent roller-coaster slide
could severely hurt rash dealers, many potential investors have adopted a wait-
and-see attitude.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the Taiwan dollar faces strong appreciation pressure amid
continued money inflows driven in part by the U.S. government's quantitative
easing policy, the bankers said the local currency's surge past the NT$30 level
would be a long-term trend. (Dec. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Banking sources said the recent surge in the Taiwan dollar's value was mainly
fueled by speculative trading by George Soros' Quantum Fund.</P>
      <P>In the past, the sources said, hot money destined to speculate on the Taiwan
dollar came primarily from the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>But recently, the speculative inflows were coming mostly from Hong Kong, where
Soros set up a branch office last month, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Soros reportedly lost a lot of money speculating on the Taiwan dollar in 1997,
and the sources said he was out for revenge this time around.</P>
      <P>Central bank officials would not confirm the report, but they also did not rule
out the possibility. They added that the central bank would keep a close watch
on the direction of hot money flows and take timely action to avoid having the
Taiwan dollar's exchange rate determined by the "Wall Street" gang. (Dec. 15,
2010).</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office rejected Wednesday a media report suggesting that a
sister of Vice President Vincent Siew might be involved in an espionage scandal
that broke last month.</P>
      <P>According  to office  spokesman  Lo Chih-chiang,  the vice president's sister,
Hsiao Ya-wen, is a retired elementary school teacher who leads a simple life.</P>
      <P>However, Siew will advise his relatives to pay attention to their behavior and
avoid situations that could spark controversy, Lo said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest edition of Next magazine issued that day, Lo Chi-cheng,
a military intelligence officer who was detained last month for allegedly acting
as a double agent for China, told prosecutors that he knew Hsiao Ya-wen and had
had work-related contact with her.</P>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense spokesman Yu Sy-tue dismissed the report as
unfactual.</P>
      <P>Although Lo Chi-cheng and Hsiao Ya-wen do indeed know each other, they did not
have any work-related contact, according to Yu.</P>
      <P>He said his ministry is considering taking legal action against the tabloid for
publishing the report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsiao Ya-wen issued a written statement saying that she only met Lo
several times on social occasions. Hsiao said she was unclear about the details
of the scandal in which Lo is implicated and that she was not involved in the
case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan eyeing U.S. visa-free entry in 2011: representative</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
12/15/10  15:20:17
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is seeking to be considered eligible for visa-free entry to the United
States for its citizens in 2011, Taiwan's representative to the U.S. said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The signing of three agreements on the exchange of information on stolen or
counterfeit passports; the exchange of information on terrorists; and
collaboration on combating crime will be crucial for Taiwan to be placed on the
visa-waiver program (VWP) roadmap, " Jason Yuan said during a session of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>With the extensive personnel flow between Taiwan and the U.S., the inclusion in
the VWP became a priority after Taiwan was granted visa-free privileges for the
Schengen Area of Europe last month.</P>
      <P>There are three key factors in terms of Taiwan's VWP inclusion -- visa refusal
rates, cases of overstay and a passport application and issuance procedure that
requires travelers to apply in person, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's U.S. visa refusal rate for fiscal 2010 was 2.2 percent, much lower than
the minimum requirement of 3 percent, and few cases of Taiwanese overstays were
recorded, Yuan said, adding that new procedures will be tested in Taiwan
requiring visa applicants to complete their passport applications in person,
starting March 1, 2011.</P>
      <P>The signing of the three agreements will also improve Taiwan's chances of
satisfying the three factors, according to U.S. recommendations in a meeting
between the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Taiwan's Office of Homeland
Security under the Executive Yuan, which took place recently in Washington, Yuan
said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the legislative committee meeting, Deputy Foreign Minister Shen
Lyu-hsun reaffirmed that Taiwan intends to be a candidacy country of the VWP in
2011.</P>
      <P>The visa-waiver drive, under which 96 countries or regions in the world now
grant Taiwan visa exemptions,  is part of Taiwan's commemoration of next year's
100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan shares close up 0.18 percent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.18 percent Wednesday after seesaw fluctuations
between buying in old economy stocks and selling in the bellwether electronics
sector, which has been haunted by a rising New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 16.28 points to the day's high of 8,756.71, off a low of
8,698.41, on turnover of NT$136.89 billion (US$4.58 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.17 percent and kept moving in a narrow range as concerns
that a stronger New Taiwan dollar would hurt Taiwan's exports continued weighing
on the export-oriented high-tech sector, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, the New Taiwan dollar appreciation cut both ways, as buying in non
high-tech stocks was ignited by hopes that the value of their domestic assets
would go up, riding the rising local currency, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,585 stocks closed up and 2,683 were down with 344 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector scored the highest gains, ending up 1.9
percent. Construction stocks rose 1.1 percent, cement and textile stocks each
gained 0.7 percent and the paper and pulp sector closed up 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 0.4 percent, while foodstuffs closed unchanged and the
machinery and electronics sector fell 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>While many investors remained concerned about Taiwan's global competitiveness
amid an appreciating New Taiwan dollar, many others held out hope that a rising
local unit would attract more foreign funds, Ta Chan Securities analyst Robin Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said investors were willing to park their funds to old economy stocks that
have been serving as safe havens.</P>
      <P>"We have seen technical support after the index fell below 8,700 points," he
said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that with many foreign institutional investors on the sidelines for the
upcoming Christmas holiday, the market drifted without direction throughout the
trading session.</P>
      <P>"The market is expected to continue to move in a range ahead of the nearest
technical resistance at around 8,800 points in the near term," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, Kindom Construction added 3.35 percent to close at
NT$33.90, Nan Ya Plastics rose 2.13 percent to finish at NT$71.90 and Formosa
Plastics gained 1.91 percent to end the day at NT$96.00.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and Singapore will begin formal negotiations on a free trade agreement
early next year after completing feasibility studies, representatives of both
governments announced in a joint press release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>If a deal were reached, it would be titled "Agreement between Singapore and the
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic
Partnership, " or ASTEP, the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore and the
Singapore Trade Office in Taipei said in the statement.</P>
      <P>"Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu" is Taiwan's
official name at the World Trade Organization, of which Singapore is also a
member.</P>
      <P>The decision to launch formal negotiations came after both sides completed
feasibility  studies and concluded that an economic cooperation agreement would
offer significant mutual benefits, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Delegations from both sides met for the first time in Singapore from Dec. 9-10,
according to the statement, but it did not specify when formal talks would
begin.</P>
      <P>The statement left open the possibility that priority areas could be accorded
expedited treatment in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>The much-anticipated deal is seen as a stepping stone for Taiwan to seek more
free trade agreements (FTAs) with major trading partners after signing an
Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China in June to liberalize
bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>Prior to signing the ECFA, which so far has provided for tariff reductions or
exemptions on only a limited basket of goods, Taiwan had only concluded four
FTAs with five of its diplomatic allies in Latin America that accounted for less
than 0.2 percent of Taiwan's total external trade.</P>
      <P>A trade deal with Singapore would be significant because it is Taiwan's fifth
largest export market and one of its top 10 trading partners, with bilateral
trade reaching US$13.4 billion in 2009.</P>
      <P>Singapore became the first country to express interest in signing an FTA with
Taiwan following the signing of the ECFA. The two countries first issued a joint
press release on Aug. 5 saying they were exploring the feasibility of signing an
economic cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has had trouble signing free trade deals with non-allied countries in the
past because of China's obstruction. But the government has argued that after
the signing of the ECFA, other countries would be more open to negotiating trade
pacts with Taiwan.</P>

Taiwan through contracted travel agencies or airline companies, Liu went on.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan section will also be set up on the online travel agency website
Travelocity, he continued, adding that any foreign passport holders who make
reservations at designated hotels via the site between January and May 2011 will
enjoy "book one night, get one free" rates.</P>
      <P>In light of the success of a "Taiwan Day" activity promoted earlier this year
through a partnership with the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, the bureau is
planning to launch a similar program in cooperation with the U.S. National
Football League next year to further boost Taiwan's visibility in North America,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan censured the Ministry of Justice Wednesday for failing to
punish a prosecutor for misconduct in accordance with a request by the watchdog
body.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan in 2002 asked the ministry to deal with a matter of Prosecutor
Hou Kuan-jen abusing his power by suing the head of the Tai Ji Men Qigong
Academy for fraud and tax-evasion.</P>
      <P>According to the Control Yuan, Hou violated the Code of Criminal Procedure by
illegally searching Hong Shih-ho's property, freezing his assets and prosecuting
him in 1997.</P>
      <P>Hong was accused by a group of his former students of taking money from them by
claiming to be a god and possessing miraculous powers, and Hou, who was working
at the Taipei District Prosecutors Office at that time, indicted Hong based on
the allegations of the students.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry however, did not punish Hou for misconduct but  instead
assigned  another  prosecutor  to carry  out an "administrative investigation"
into Hou's actions. The investigation concluded that Hou was not guilty of any
wrongdoing in Hong's case.</P>
      <P>In 2007, more than 10 years after the lawsuit was filed, the Supreme Court
acquitted Hong of all the charges brought against him by Hou.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan said that the Justice Ministry's reluctance to punish the
prosecutor has substantially "undermined" the credibility of the country's
judiciary.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The air quality in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City has shown a marked
improvement, with the ratio of Pollution Standard Index (PSI) decreasing to a
record low of 3.76 percent as of November, the city's Environmental Protection
Bureau said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The average PSI of the city in 2009 was 4.9 percent -- meaning that the PSI
exceeded 100, a standard for unacceptable air quality, on only 4.9 percent of
the days in the year.</P>
      <P>The figure is in stark contrast to highest PSI since records began -- 12.48
percent in 1994.</P>
      <P>The improvement is a result of a series of air pollution control measures that
have helped reduce carbon emissions, said Lee Mu-sheng, director-general of the
bureau.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the city government has encouraged citizens to use public
transport and has conducted thorough inspections to prevent factories, the
city's harbor and construction sites from emitting heavy pollutants.</P>
      <P>In addition, a subsidy program to promote eco-friendly electronic vehicles was
implemented as part of these efforts, Lee added.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Bureau uses the PSI to measure major pollutants,
including sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead and ozone, as
an indicator of air quality.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu Science Park officials said Wednesday that flat panel maker AU Optronics
Corp. (AUO) has received the 2010 Science Park R&amp;D Accomplishment Award
because of the great number of patents it has been granted.</P>
      <P>It is the eighth consecutive year AUO has been awarded the prize by the science
park, the officials said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, AUO had been granted more than 7,400 patents
worldwide,  while the flat panel maker is seeking an additional 15,000 patents
for which applications have already been submitted, according to the company.</P>
      <P>In 2009, AUO filed the largest number of patent applications of any local
optoelectronics firms, the flat panel maker cited the Intellectual Property
Office as saying.</P>
      <P>In addition to the efforts to obtain patents, the annual awards also evaluated
the amount of funds a company assigns to research and development,  as well as
the amount of manpower  devoted  to technological R&amp;D, the park officials
said.</P>
      <P>Realtek Semiconductor  Corp.,  Elan Microelectronics  Corp., Microelectronics
Technology Inc. and ISSC Technologies Corp. were also awarded, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that same day, sources from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said the Investment Commission under the MOEA is expected to approve a US$3
billion China investment proposal from AUO by Friday.</P>
      <P>AUO has submitted an application with the MOEA and has since March been seeking
regulatory approval to build a 7.5th-generation flat panel plant in Kunshan, in
China's Jiangsu Province.</P>
      <P>The investment project has passed critical screening of the key technology
involved in the investment, but is pending the screening of various additional
formalities before final approval is issued by the commission.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that as the
project will involve a large amount of investment, the ministry might call a
special review meeting before issuing its approval.</P>
      <P>To assure the government that the company will maintain its technological lead
over its Chinese facility and its long-term commitment to Taiwan, AUO also plans
to invest NT$400 billion (US$13.39 billion) in building two 11th-generation flat
panel plants, as well as solar energy facilities in the Central Taiwan Science
Park.</P>

      <P>More than 40 Taiwanese firms made their debut appearance at an international
industrial machinery fair in Cambodia Wednesday in an effort to expand trade and
economic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The group of 44 companies, led by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA), attended the Cambodia Machine Tech 2010 in the Cambodian capital of
Phnom Penh, the first time Taiwan has been represented in five years.</P>
      <P>Cambodia is an emerging market, particularly in consumer product development,
said Yeh Chi-ling, head of the TAITRA exhibition department.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is increasing demand in Cambodia for various products,
including food- and produce-wrapping facilities, plastics and rubber, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>Yeh said she expects Taiwan's exhibits of machinery, components, information and
communications technology and consumer products will find their way into the
Cambodian market.</P>
      <P>The two sides' trade value was more than US$372 million in 2009, compared with

      <P>Taiwan has urged the United States not to put Taiwan's interests at risk in its
engagements with China, Taiwan's foreign ministry said Wednesday, ahead of a
visit to the U.S. in January by Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>"We have advised the U.S. not to jeopardize Taiwan's interests" in its dealings
with China, Deputy Foreign Minister Shen Lyu-shun said in a meeting of the
legislature's foreign and national defense committee.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also requested an immediate briefing after Hu's visit to the U.S. and
has asked to be informed ahead of time of important U.S.-China meetings in the
future, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Legislators expressed disappointment over a joint statement issued last November
by the U.S. and China during U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the two countries underscored "the importance of the Taiwan
issue in U.S.-China  relations."  China further emphasized that "the Taiwan
issue concerns China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, " and expressed
the hope that the U.S. would "honor its relevant commitments and appreciate and
support the Chinese side's position on this issue."</P>
      <P>Referring to three communiques that the U.S. and China signed in 1972, 1979 and
1982 and which helped to normalize U.S.-China relations, Shen said a fourth
communique was unlikely.</P>
      <P>"But another joint statement is possible," he said.</P>
      <P>Shen and Jason Yuan, Taiwan's representative to the U.S., both said that
currently Taiwan-U.S. relations are "the best in 60 years," as described by
former U.S. Ambassador to China Winston Lord.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's diplomats now have greater access to the U.S. executive and legislative
branches as well as to important figures in the White House, Shen said. This can
be attributed to President Ma Ying-jeou's "surprise-free" approach, which has
won praise in Washington and has helped to stabilize bilateral relations, he
added.</P>
      <P>Yuan said the U.S. has briefed Taiwan on a scheduled visit to China by a
delegation led by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg. In meetings
scheduled for Dec. 14-17, the delegation is expected to discuss with China the
North Korea issue and Hu's state visit to the U.S. in January, he said.</P>
      <P>The delegation includes Jeffrey Bader, National Security Council senior director
for Asian affairs, and Kurt Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East
Asian and Pacific affairs, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Yuan, who returned to Taiwan to report to the legislature, said that he was
hopeful that next round of U.S.-Taiwan talks under the Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) would take place before the Lunar New Year next
February.</P>
      <P>A visit to Taiwan by former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is also in
the works, Yuan said.</P>

      <P>A woman residing near the Taipei International Flora Expo received two free
flight tickets Wednesday after a lucky draw determined that she was officially
the 2 millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>Chang-Liu Tsai-lien, 60, also received a certificate allowing her to visit five
of the expo's most popular exhibition halls -- the Pavilion of Dreams, the
Pavilion of Regimen, the Taipei Story House, Expo Theater and Celebrity's House
-- without having to wait in line.</P>
      <P>The flight tickets, provided by EVA Airways, allow the winner and her companion
to travel to any of the Asian destinations the carrier serves.</P>
      <P>The 2 millionth visitor was recorded at around 10 a.m. that day, but the Taipei
International Flora Expo Operational Headquarters could not immediately identify
who the visitor was because the exposition has many entrances and ticket sale
counters.</P>
      <P>The headquarters awarded vouchers to the 1,999,500th visitor and the 999
visitors who followed, from among whom the 2 millionth visitor was chosen in the
lucky draw presided over by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>Chang-Liu said she and her husband have toured the expo almost every day since
its opening because it is only a 10-minute walk from their home.</P>
      <P>"Both of us have bought season tickets for the event and we like every exhibit
on display," she said.</P>
      <P>Four other visitors were also chosen in the lucky draw, each of whom was given a
season ticket for the expo as second prize. Five more visitors were chosen as
third prize-winners, each of whom received a collection of Flora Expo souvenirs.</P>
      <P>The operational headquarters said the arrival of the 2 millionth visitor came
earlier than expected.</P>
      <P>The organizers had originally projected that a total of 8 million people will
visit the fair during its run from Nov. 6 through April 25, 2011. It took 22
days for the visitor number to reach 1 million -- on Nov. 27 -- and only a
further 18 days to tally the 2 millionth visitor.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that the number of visitors is increasing at an ever
faster pace, " a spokesman for the headquarters said, adding that the daily
visitor number has hit an average of 50,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MRT, Chinese visitors drive up Taipei land prices</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Average land prices in Taipei City's 12 districts have gone up 12.08 percent
from a year ago, thanks in large part to the expected completion of several new
mass rapid transit (MRT) lines and increasing tourist visits from China,
officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Land released the 2011 "officially assessed" land
prices for the city's 12 districts that same day, pointing out that the average
12.08 percent year-on-year increase was the largest in nearly 10 years and the
first double-digit growth since 2005.</P>
      <P>The city's Zhongzheng District saw the biggest yearly increase of 12.59 percent,
followed by Xinyi District at 12.57 percent and Daan District at 12.51 percent,
with Wenshan District trailing at 10.76 percent.</P>
      <P>The department's director, Huang Jung-feng, said real estate prices in the city
started to fly in March 2010 and continued to rise in spite of central bank
measures in June to dampen the market.</P>
      <P>Other factors contributing to the soaring land prices include the record-setting
high bids for public land, more and more visits by Chinese tourists, and the
gradual completion of the MRT system -- the Xinzhuang, Songshang and Xinyi lines
are scheduled to be launched in the coming years, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to the latest government figures, the most expensive real estate in
Taipei is in the Shin Kong Life Tower near Taipei Main Station, at NT$3.64
million (US$122,200) per ping (one ping equals 3.3 square meters).</P>
      <P>Shin Kong Life Tower has thus become the most expensive property in Taiwan --
the 13th year it has held that title. The vicinity enjoys the privileges of
being a traffic hub combining railway, high speed rail and MRT services.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, though, it might not keep that honor for long. Taipei 101
Building in the east of the city is fast catching up. Now valued at NT$3.35
million (US$112,500) per ping, second only to the Shin Kong Life Tower, real
estate agents say Taipei 101 might become Taiwan's "king of land" -- as local
media like to call it -- by 2016.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the most expensive land in Taichung City, central Taiwan, is
worth an official price of NT$660,000 per ping. It is owned by the Shin Kong
Mitsukoshi Department Store, according to Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi.</P>
      <P>The government releases its officially assessed land prices not for the sake of
collecting more taxes but rather for the sake of narrowing the gap between
officially announced prices and market prices, Hsiao said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is ready to sign a medical cooperation agreement with China, which is
expected to benefit the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, in the latest
round of bilateral negotiations next week, Taiwanese officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With preparatory talks having been completed, the heads of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) should have no problem  signing  the deal in their sixth
round of bilateral negotiations scheduled to be held Dec. 20-22 in Taipei
between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The agreement will be the 15th and one of the the most wide-ranging agreements
between the two sides since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, Lai
Shin-yuan, minister of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said in a joint press
conference held by the MAC and the Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>Prevention of epidemics, management of research and development of medical
products, management and research of traditional Chinese medicine, and first aid
and emergency medical treatment, will be included in the agreement, according to
the DOH.</P>
      <P>Among them, prevention of epidemics and management of traditional Chinese
medicine are considered the most urgent items, said Deputy Health Minister Hsiao
Mei-ling.</P>
      <P>With a platform for information-sharing and a mechanism for pandemic
notification established, Taiwan's health authorities will be better able to
deal with severe epidemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases such as Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome and H1N1 influenza, according to Chang Feng-yee,
director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control.</P>
      <P>The DOH said China has agreed to a "five noes" principle that stated Taiwan will
not allow Chinese medical professionals to take local licensing exams; that
Taiwan will not allow Chinese medical professionals to practice here; that
Taiwan will not allow Chinese investment in building and running local
hospitals; that Taiwan's national health insurance program will not pay for
medical bills incurred by its citizens in Chinese medical facilities; and that
the agreement will not contain any provisions regarding joint efforts to educate
and cultivate medical professionals.</P>
      <P>However, not everything went smoothly in the negotiations, as both sides
confirmed that an investment protection agreement will not be signed as planned
due to disagreement  over trade dispute settlement measures and human safety
protection.</P>
      <P>In addition to the signing ceremony, Chen is scheduled to visit the Taipei
International Flora Expo, but he will not meet with President Ma, MAC Deputy
Chairman Liu Te-hsun told reporters.</P>

      <P>IBM said Wednesday that the staff at its Taiwan-based research center is
creative in terms of product ideas, as evidenced by the fact that most of the
company's widely used x86 servers were designed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The team in Taiwan is very aggressive in terms of exploring ideas, in terms of
how we develop the product, in terms of the ideas around the product. They bring
a different perspective from the team in the U.S., " Chris Verne, director of
IBM Taiwan System and Technology Laboratory (TSTL), told CNA in an exclusive
interview.</P>
      <P>Verne said he was impressed by the willingness of the Taiwan team to work in a
different discipline and the way the team pulled together to tackle different
types of situations  or schedule challenges.</P>
      <P>The staff at TSTL is now 10 times bigger than it was when the laboratory was
established in 2006, he said.</P>
      <P>Regarding IBM's system business, there are only two countries -- the U.S. and
Taiwan -- that have x86-based product development centers providing end to end
project management, including marketing, product design, manufacturing and
sales, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Verne, the TSTL is responsible for 65 percent of IBM's designs for
its x86-based servers.</P>
      <P>"We think Taiwan is well positioned within this industry for technology
leadership, thought leadership and skills leadership, " he said. "That's how we
tie the global competitiveness at this point to what we are doing here in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Asia Pacific server shipments grew 13.4 percent year-on-year in the third
quarter of 2010, while revenue expanded 25.7 percent year- on-year, according to
the global technology research and advisory firm Gartner.</P>
      <P>IBM led the Asia Pacific server market based on revenue of US$928.4 million and
a 43.1 percent market share in the third quarter this year, an increase of 3
percent from the same period in 2009, the research firm said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, investment in mainframes helped to drive robust revenue growth in the
Asia Pacific during the third quarter of 2010 along with continued strength in
the x86 segment,  which has consistently grown in double digits for four
consecutive quarters, Gartner said.</P>
      <P>"One of the things that make Taiwan very attractive is that Taiwan is sort of
the door to China, and Taiwan has established an ecosystem in the industry which
is supported by the government, " Verne said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the company's plans regarding the China market, Verne said that IBM
has already built a laboratory in Shanghai, and the two teams in Taiwan and
China will work more closely to expand the business in China.</P>

      <P>Talks will begin early next year between Taiwan and Singapore on an economic
partnership agreement that both countries have determined will bring "positive
and conspicuous" benefits, Taiwan's representative in that Southeast Asian
country said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the CNA, Vanessa Shih said both parties have
completed their respective feasibility studies on signing such an agreement and
have concluded that it would offer significant mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>However, she admitted that such an agreement could negatively affect some
sectors of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>"Our negotiators will make sure the negative effects will be minimized and
benefits maximized, as they work hard to expand business opportunities for
Taiwan," she stressed.</P>
      <P>Many industries in the two countries are complementary, sharing an industrial
chain relationship marked by up-stream and down-stream cooperation that
eventually will create a win-win situation for both sides, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Less than two months after Taiwan signed a historic Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China,  Taiwan and Singapore jointly announced
on Aug. 5 they were interested in negotiating a similar deal.</P>
      <P>Following that announcement, delegations from the Singapore Trade Office (STO)
in Taipei and the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in Singapore met for the
first time in Singapore December 9-10.</P>
      <P>Formal negotiations under the title "Agreement between Singapore and the
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic
Partnership" (ASTEP) are scheduled to begin early next year, the two offices
said in a joint press release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that priority areas may be accorded expedited treatment in the
negotiations, the joint statement added.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang welcomed the latest development,
saying ASTEP is a good name, as partnership has become a trend.</P>
      <P>Calling the economic partnership agreement a kind of free trade agreement, the
minister said ASTEP also means "An important STEP" for Taiwan, which is seeking
to forge more regional economic cooperation pacts in an effort to integrate into
the regional economy.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and Singapore are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) .
Two-way trade between them in 2009 totaled US$13.4 billion, as Singapore was
Taiwan's 6th largest trading partner after China, Japan, the United States, Hong
Kong and Korea.</P>
      <P>Singapore is also the sixth largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in
Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.</P>

      <P>More monitoring and communication devices will be installed along the Suhua
Highway to make road condition information and rescue facilities more easily
available to drivers, the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 21 emergency telephones will be set up along the coastal highway
where cell phone signals are weak,  while 35 closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs)
and three content management systems (CMS) will be installed to display real
time road conditions on billboards, the DGH said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DGH will construct another five open tunnels at points along
the 118 km highway and will extend the tunnel at the 112.8 km mark from 30
meters to 100 meters, the DGH said.</P>
      <P>These tunnels could serve as temporary shelters in case of sudden rock falls,
said Liao Wu-chang, deputy director of the DGH's fourth maintenance office. The
emergency response system is expected to be completed by April 2011, he said.</P>
      <P>In late October, 26 people were killed by a mudslide on the Suhua Highway as
northeastern Taiwan was being battered by heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>The DGH said its warning system did not work efficiently at that time since it
failed to assess the high volume of rainfall in time to issue an alert.</P>
      <P>However, the accident has prompted the DGH to improve its communication

      <P>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has agreed to hear Taiwan's appeal
against the disqualification of a Taiwanese taekwondo athlete in the recent
Asian Games, the Sports Affairs Council (SAC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the CAS might issue a ruling within three months
of its decision to hear the appeal, which was filed on Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>Yang Shu-chun, 25, was disqualified in her opening match in the Asiad women's
under 49-kg division on Nov. 17 in Guangzhou, China. She was accused of wearing
two extra electronic sensors in her socks to increase her chances of scoring. At
the time, Yang was leading in the bout 9-0 and was seen as one of Taiwan's top
contenders for a gold medal at the games.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the bout, which was released later, showed that Yang had
removed the two sensors before going into the competition area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sports council and taekwondo bodies subsequently lodged complaints with
the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) and the Olympic Council of Asia, and said
it would seek CAS arbitration if the WTF failed to settle the matter fairly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the WTF's disciplinary committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in
Seoul on Dec. 18. to discuss the issue. Yang, her coaches Liu Ching-wen and Liu

      <P>Two pilots were killed Wednesday when an Air Force Academy T-34 Mentor trainer

      <P>In the latest accident, the 49-year-old flight instructor, Niu Peng-yu, and Air

Liouguei Township, Kaohsiung County, Air Force officials said.</P>
      <P>The plane took off from the academy in the county's Gangshan Township at 1:08
p.m., but disappeared from radar at 2:02 p.m., the officials said.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the two pilots have been recovered, but the cause of the crash was

      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang, who is familiar with defense affairs,

      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Wednesday turned down a request by prosecutors to seize
the family assets of former President Chen Shui-bian, who is in prison on
conviction of bribery.</P>
      <P>The court said that some of the assets itemized were already on a list submitted
earlier by prosecutors for seizure.</P>
      <P>Chen is serving two jail sentences after being convicted of accepting bribes in
connection with a land deal and a personnel appointment. He is facing other
charges.</P>
      <P>The special prosecutors team, which successfully indicted the former president
and his wife Wu Shu-jen, had asked the court for permission to seize land,
houses, term deposits and stocks in Taiwan owned by the couple and their
immediate family members.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said seizure of the family's assets was part of the legal
obligations linked to the conviction of the couple.</P>
      <P>However, a High Court collegial panel ruled that the sum of more than NT$600
million in overseas bank deposits that has already been confiscated by
prosecutors is sufficient to pay back Chen's illegal gains and there is
therefore no need to seize his assets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the panel said, some of the Chen family assets that the prosecutors were
seeking to confiscate had already been listed in an earlier request in
connection with a financial reform kickback case, which is still being handled

    <TEXT>
      <P>IBM said Wednesday that the staff at its Taiwan-based research center is
creative in terms of product ideas, as evidenced by the fact that most of the
company's widely used x86 servers were designed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The team in Taiwan is very aggressive in terms of exploring ideas, in terms of
how we develop the product, in terms of the ideas around the product. They bring
a different perspective from the team in the U.S., " Chris Verne, director of
IBM Taiwan System and Technology Laboratory (TSTL), told CNA in an exclusive
interview.</P>
      <P>Verne said he was impressed by the willingness of the Taiwan team to work in a
different discipline and the way the team pulled together to tackle different
types of situations  or schedule challenges.</P>
      <P>The staff at TSTL is now 10 times bigger than it was when the laboratory was
established in 2006, he said.</P>
      <P>Regarding IBM's system business, there are only two countries -- the U.S. and
Taiwan -- that have x86-based product development centers providing end to end
project management, including marketing, product design, manufacturing and
sales, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Verne, the TSTL is responsible for 65 percent of IBM's designs for
its x86-based servers.</P>
      <P>"We think Taiwan is well positioned within this industry for technology
leadership, thought leadership and skills leadership, " he said. "That's how we
tie the global competitiveness at this point to what we are doing here in
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Asia Pacific server shipments grew 13.4 percent year-on-year in the third
quarter of 2010, while revenue expanded 25.7 percent year- on-year, according to
the global technology research and advisory firm Gartner.</P>
      <P>IBM led the Asia Pacific server market based on revenue of US$928.4 million and
a 43.1 percent market share in the third quarter this year, an increase of 3
percent from the same period in 2009, the research firm said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, investment in mainframes helped to drive robust revenue growth in the
Asia Pacific during the third quarter of 2010 along with continued strength in
the x86 segment,  which has consistently grown in double digits for four
consecutive quarters, Gartner said.</P>
      <P>"One of the things that make Taiwan very attractive is that Taiwan is sort of
the door to China, and Taiwan has established an ecosystem in the industry which
is supported by the government, " Verne said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the company's plans regarding the China market, Verne said that IBM
has already built a laboratory in Shanghai, and the two teams in Taiwan and
China will work more closely to expand the business in China.</P>

      <P>Talks will begin early next year between Taiwan and Singapore on an economic
partnership agreement that both countries have determined will bring "positive
and conspicuous" benefits, Taiwan's representative in that Southeast Asian
country said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In a telephone interview with the CNA, Vanessa Shih said both parties have
completed their respective feasibility studies on signing such an agreement and
have concluded that it would offer significant mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>However, she admitted that such an agreement could negatively affect some
sectors of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>"Our negotiators will make sure the negative effects will be minimized and
benefits maximized, as they work hard to expand business opportunities for
Taiwan," she stressed.</P>
      <P>Many industries in the two countries are complementary, sharing an industrial
chain relationship marked by up-stream and down-stream cooperation that
eventually will create a win-win situation for both sides, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Less than two months after Taiwan signed a historic Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China,  Taiwan and Singapore jointly announced
on Aug. 5 they were interested in negotiating a similar deal.</P>
      <P>Following that announcement, delegations from the Singapore Trade Office (STO)
in Taipei and the Taipei Representative Office (TRO) in Singapore met for the
first time in Singapore December 9-10.</P>
      <P>Formal negotiations under the title "Agreement between Singapore and the
Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu on Economic
Partnership" (ASTEP) are scheduled to begin early next year, the two offices
said in a joint press release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed that priority areas may be accorded expedited treatment in the
negotiations, the joint statement added.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang welcomed the latest development,
saying ASTEP is a good name, as partnership has become a trend.</P>
      <P>Calling the economic partnership agreement a kind of free trade agreement, the
minister said ASTEP also means "An important STEP" for Taiwan, which is seeking
to forge more regional economic cooperation pacts in an effort to integrate into
the regional economy.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and Singapore are members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) .
Two-way trade between them in 2009 totaled US$13.4 billion, as Singapore was
Taiwan's 6th largest trading partner after China, Japan, the United States, Hong
Kong and Korea.</P>
      <P>Singapore is also the sixth largest source of foreign direct investment (FDI) in
Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said.</P>

      <P>However, a High Court collegial panel ruled that the sum of more than NT$600
million in overseas bank deposits that has already been confiscated by
prosecutors is sufficient to pay back Chen's illegal gains and there is
therefore no need to seize his assets in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, the panel said, some of the Chen family assets that the prosecutors were
seeking to confiscate had already been listed in an earlier request in
connection with a financial reform kickback case, which is still being handled
by the court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: The 'big mouth' clause</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/16/10  11:59:06
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to a so-called "big mouth clause" included in the draft Political
Appointee Act, which was cleared by a legislative committee this week,
appointees could be forced to resign if they used language so flawed that it
damaged the government's image or affected the government's policy-making
process.</P>
      <P>Of course, no one doubts that there is a need to improve the language skills of
our political appointees. But the problem is, who will determine whether a
politician has a "big mouth"? Also, is it really a good idea to restrict
government officials from saying what they think?</P>
      <P>For years, Taiwan has been promoting freedom of speech. Now, this clause could
restrict the speech of political appointees and also give the public the
impression that the government is back-pedalling on its commitment to democracy.</P>
      <P>Certainly,  political  appointees  who  are  reticent  and uncommunicative  no
longer meet modern requirements.  In fact, officials who speak improperly should
step down voluntarily and not wait for the law to push them out. Instead of
introducing a legal clause, would it not be a better idea to give them some time
to step down? (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 16, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has approved Academia Historica Director Lin Man-houng's
resignation due to a controversial online poll regarding the most influential
figures in the country's history, the Presidential Office said late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin, an expert in the history of Taiwan and the Chinese Qing Dynasty, tendered
her resignation to assume political responsibility for the controversy caused by
the "influential figures" poll, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang
said.</P>
      <P>After accepting Lin's resignation, Ma simultaneously appointed Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General Liu Pao-kuei to serve as acting head of the
history institution, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The president will look for a suitable replacement to fill the vacancy left by
Lin, he added.</P>
      <P>The history institution, under the direct jurisdiction of the Presidential
Office, last week terminated an Internet poll to select the 100 most influential
figures in the history of the Republic of China after the campaign drew the ire
of lawmakers and military officials.</P>
      <P>The poll was designed as part of celebrations of the ROC's 100th founding
anniversary in 2011. The inclusion of some highly controversial figures in the
institute-selected candidates list, however, made it a target of criticism.</P>
      <P>Most controversial was the inclusion of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping -- two late
leaders of the Communist Party of China, which defeated Taiwan's current ruling
Kuomintang in a bloody civil war in China and forced the KMT-led ROC government
to retreat to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>In addition to shutting down the official website carrying the survey, a senior
official at Academia Historica was also demoted over the incident, which
reportedly earned the institution a rebuke from President Ma.</P>
      <P>Lin, 59, was a research fellow at Academia Sinica's Institute of Modern History
before taking the helm at Academia Historica in 2008. She was the history
institution's first female head since its inception in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>EVA Airways, one of Taiwan's leading international carriers, said Thursday that
it will take a 16 percent stake in Shanghai-based China Cargo Airlines.</P>
      <P>Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Concord Pacific Ltd, EVA Air plans to invest
328 million Chinese yuan (NT$1.47 billion) in the Chinese air cargo company, the
Taiwanese carrier said.</P>
      <P>EVA Air said that the investment is part of restructuring efforts made by China
Cargo, which is expected to merge with its Chinese counterpart, Shanghai
Airlines Cargo International Co. Ltd.</P>
      <P>Earlier, EVA Air had taken a 25 percent stake in Shanghai Airlines Cargo by
investing 166 million Chinese yuan, but because of the restructuring, EVA Air
has withdrawn from Shanghai Airlines Cargo and, instead, opted to invest in
China Cargo.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Airlines Cargo was set up in 2006 and EVA Air is one of its founding
shareholders.</P>
      <P>EVA Air said that China Cargo is one of the large-sized air cargo companies on
the mainland and also had a strong global operations network. It is also
expected to expand operations further, EVA Air added.</P>
      <P>In addition, China Cargo is among the seven carriers from China and Taiwan which
have been allowed to engage in air cargo operations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese company said that it has high hopes for China Cargo's potential
for growth.</P>
      <P>China Cargo, which was set up in 1998, operates two hubs -- one in Shanghai
Hongqiao International Airport and another at Shanghai Pudong International
Airport. It owns a fleet of 13 aircraft.</P>
      <P>China Eastern Airlines,  one of China's largest  carriers, currently owns 70

      <P>Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei recently reminded the mayors-elect of the
soon-to-be-established special municipalities of Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung
to prepare for possible disorder in the municipalities' first year of existence.</P>
      <P>Speaking from experience, Chou said, the problems that might emerge include
personnel organization, budget planning and team adaptation. Taipei County,
which became a quasi-special municipality in 2007, has been preparing for more
than three years for its official upgrade to a special municipality on Dec. 25,
when it will be renamed Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>The other three municipalities will become effective on the same date through
mergers of the existing Taichung City with Taichung County, Tainan City with
Tainan County, and Kaohsiung City with Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>It is foreseeable that after the mayors-elect assume office on Dec. 25, all
sorts of problems linked to resource distribution between the central and local
governments will erupt.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung,  personnel expenses are expected to soar when
the pay grades for their employees rise. It will require major reform to
integrate existing county and city staff. There is also the question of who will
mediate the disputes that could arise in the process of the integration.</P>
      <P>Prior to the inauguration of the mayors-elect, President Ma Ying-jeou and
Premier Wu Den-yih should display leadership and look into the local government
needs. Even if those needs cannot be met because of limited resources, Ma and Wu
should use their powers of persuasion to gain understanding among the local
government chiefs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EU signs bill on Taiwan's visa-waiver privilege</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese travelers will be able to visit the Schengen Area of Europe visa-free
from mid-January next year as the European Union (EU) has formally signed a bill
to that effect.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a statement late Wednesday that
European Parliament Speaker Jerzy Buzek and Belgian Secretary of State for EU
Affairs Oliver Chastel signed the bill on Taiwan's inclusion in the EU visa-
waiver program in Strasbourg, France earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The signing in the European Parliament was considered a formality that marked
yet another step toward Taiwan's goal of acquiring wider visa exemption
privilege for its passport holders, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Following the signing, the bill will be translated into 23 official EU languages
for publication in the EU Official Journal and will formally take effect 20 days
after its publication, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>The visa waiver means that ROC (Taiwan) passport holders will be able to enter
35 European countries visa-free and stay for up to 90 days within a six-month
period.</P>
      <P>The exemption  will apply to 25 Schengen  Area countries, comprising 22 EU
member states and three non-EU states -- Norway, Iceland and Switzerland -- and
three non-Schengen EU member states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It also includes seven smaller European countries and territories -- the
Vatican, Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that if all goes well, the visa-waiver bill will come into effect
in mid-January, but that the exact date will depend on when it is published in
the EU journal.</P>
      <P>Once the bill takes effect, Taiwan will become the sixth Asian country to
acquire EU visa-waiver privilege, the MOFA statement said.</P>
      <P>The visa exemption drive took off in July when the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, put forth a concrete bill to include Taiwan in the visa-waiver
program.</P>
      <P>The proposal then went through a 15-step process and cleared its last hurdle on
Nov. 25 when the Council of the European Union passed it unanimously without
debate.</P>
      <P>The EU inclusion brings the number of countries and territories offering
Taiwanese citizens visa exemptions to 96, with 75 granting Taiwan passport
holders visa-waiver privileges and 21 others allowing travelers to obtain visas
at their ports of entry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer Inc. said Thursday that it has set a
goal of shipping 20 million notebook computers in 2011, up from the estimated 17
million units shipped in 2010.</P>
      <P>The 20 million units will include 14 million notebook computers, demand for
which is expected to rise by about 30 percent from a year ago, and about 6
million netbook computers, demand for which is expected to remain similar to
2010, AsusTek said.</P>
      <P>The forecasts were made at the company's two-day meeting of global sales
managers, which concluded Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, company Chairman Jonney Shih reviewed 2010's operations and set
new goals for 2011.</P>
      <P>In addition to notebook shipments,  AsusTek predicted that shipments of its
servers for 2011 will grow by 5 percent over 2010 figures.</P>
      <P>AsusTek is also gearing up to penetrate the expanding global tablet computer
market; in addition, it plans to claim a double-digit stake in the non-Apple
tablet computer market in 2011.</P>
      <P>According to a recent research report, shipments of non-Apple tablet computers
globally are expected to range between 10 million and 15 million units next year
and AsusTek's shipments are likely hit no less than 1 million units.</P>
      <P>AsusTek also intends to launch a premium 12-inch tablet computer model, running
on the Windows 7 operating system, in the first quarter of 2011.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, AsusTek said that sales in Eastern Europe for 2011 were
expected to grow 30-40 percent from 2010; sales in China were also forecast to
rise steadily.</P>
      <P>With the help of increasing sales, the company said that it hoped to move up one
spot next year and become the fourth-largest notebook seller in the world.</P>
      <P>AsusTek posted NT$12.47 billion (US$417 million) in net profit for the first
nine months of this year. Its earnings per share (EPS) of NT$19.88 was better
than market expectations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.29 percent Thursday amid ample liquidity as
investors parked their funds to safe havens such as property stocks, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 25.49 points to 8,782.20, after moving between 8,767.44
and 8,797.98, on turnover of NT$123.38 billion (US$4.13 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.16 percent and moved to the day's high as investors
expected a rising New Taiwan dollar to boost the value of assets owned by
property developers, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, bargain hunters picked up bellwether semiconductor shares on their
relatively low valuations, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,343 stocks closed up and 1,819 were down, with 395 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector posted the highest gains, ending up 1.7 percent. Paper
and pulp stocks rose 0.6 percent, and machinery and electronics shares gained
0.4 percent, while the cement, textile and financial sectors closed up 0.2
percent.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff stocks fell 0.5 percent and the plastics and chemical sector closed
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said that although the room for further
increases is limited ahead of the nearest resistance point at around the
8,800-8,900-point range, a medium- and long-term uptrend remained intact as the
market is flush with high liquidity.</P>
      <P>"Foreign institutional investors remained on the buying side, hunting bargains,"
Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"While some profit-taking emerged during the trade, the market still held itself
well above 8,700 points at the close," Hsu added.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, as the results of the Nov. 27 municipal elections -- in which
the ruling Kuomintang maintained its status quo -- promoted investors to buy,
the property sector has scored significant recent gains.</P>
      <P>"As the buying was further escalated by the appreciation of the New Taiwan
dollar, I am afraid that the property sector will encounter a technical pullback
in the short term," he said.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, New Asia Construction rose 6.71 percent to close at
NT$15.10, while Cathay Real Estate gained 2.08 percent to end the day at
NT$17.15.</P>
      <P>Among the integrated circuit stocks, Advanced Semiconductor Engineering rose
3.32 percent to finish at NT$34.20 and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
added 1.71 percent to a close of NT$71.20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Defense Ministry apologizes for flight incidents</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang apologized Thursday for a string of
flight mishaps involving military planes in recent years.</P>
      <P>"We should apologize for the occurrence  of flight safety problems, " Chao said
at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Defense Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>His apology came a day after an Air Force Academy T-34C trainer plane crashed in
southern Taiwan during a routine training mission, killing a flight instructor
and a cadet.</P>
      <P>It was the second crash this year involving a T-34C trainer plane. In January, a
trainer of the same type went down during a training flight in southern Taiwan,
also killing the two people on board.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the session, opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang said that since the U.S.-built T-34Cs were introduced in Taiwan in
1985, eight of the rudimentary trainer planes have crashed, leaving 14 dead and
three injured.</P>
      <P>In just the past three years, Tsai went on, flight mishaps in the military have
left 10 servicemen dead, three missing and two injured.</P>
      <P>"Should the Defense Ministry not apologize  for all these tragedies?" Tsai asked
Chao.</P>
      <P>In response, Chao said the ministry feels deep regret and sincerely apologizes
for the incidents.</P>
      <P>He further said the military attaches great importance to flight safety and has
conducted in-depth probes and reviews of each of the crashes.</P>
      <P>"In the wake of the latest incident, we will redouble our efforts in flight
safety control, including reinforcing risk management and intensifying
monitoring and supervision," Chao said.</P>
      <P>On the causes of the eight T-34C-related accidents, the first four were caused
by human error, while the fifth was caused by engine problems and the sixth was
the result of a bird strike.</P>
      <P>"The cause of the seventh, which occurred early this year, is still being
investigated and we have not yet found the reason, " Chao said.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang said that with a T-34C attrition rate
of 19 percent, the military should approach the U.S. maker for assistance in
determining the cause of the crashes.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's T-34C fleet is only midway through its operating lifespan, Lin said,
its relatively high attrition rate deserves careful study.</P>
      <P>Chao said the military has formed a special task force to investigate the cause
of Wednesday's crash and will conduct an overall review of flight safety
measures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to Lin's concern about the safety of the AT-3 advanced
jet trainer planes that have been in commission for 28 years, Chao said the
aircraft for higher-level flight skill training has been structurally reinforced
and can be safely used until 2017.</P>
      <P>He also said the Air Force  has begun collecting  market information in
preparation for the procurement of a new generation of trainer planes.</P>
      <P>Chao said the military will offer the best possible compensation for the two
pilots killed in Wednesday's crash -- 49-year-old flight instructor Niu Peng-yu

      <P>Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) on Thursday raised its
forecast for Taiwan's economic growth for 2010 from 8.91 percent to 9.64
percent.</P>
      <P>It forecast that private-sector investment in 2010 will jump by 31.55 percent
from the 2009 level, reaching a 45-year high. In addition, private-sector
consumption will increase 3.36 percent year-on-year, while outbound and inbound
shipments will rise by 24.71 percent and 28.33 percent, respectively, CIER said.</P>
      <P>CIER also predicted that Taiwan's economy will grow by a more moderate rate of
4.55 percent in 2011 and that private-sector consumption and investment next
year will increase by 2.21 percent and 2.45 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Imports and exports will expand by 2.51 percent and 6.26 percent, said CIER, a

      <P>The U.S. dollar rose against the New Taiwan dollar Thursday, gaining NT$0.045 to
close at NT$30.545.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$794 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.550 and moved between NT$29.815 and NT$30.560
before the close.</P>
      <P>Dealers said foreign institutional investors continued moving funds into the
local bourse to further boost the value of the New Taiwan dollar during most of
the trading session.</P>
      <P>While most of the other currencies in the region weakened against the U.S.
dollar, the New Taiwan dollar maintained its strength to rise above the NT$30.00
level again before the central bank intervened, they said.</P>
      <P>Exporters joined foreign banks during the session to lower their U.S. dollar
positions on hopes that ample liquidity would push the New Taiwan dollar even
higher, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>In addition to further inflows of foreign funds, the momentum of the local
currency reflected a strong rebound of Taiwan's economy after the government
raised its forecast for the country's 2010 economic growth to 9.98 percent from
an earlier estimate of 8.24 percent, they said.</P>
      <P>In late trade, the central bank jumped into trading again to shore up the U.S.
dollar and lift its value above the NT$30.00 level against the New Taiwan
dollar, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>In the short term, the central bank is expected to keep intervening to prevent
the U.S. dollar from falling below NT$30.00 in a bid to protect Taiwan's
exports, they said.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (SFC) issued five guidelines Thursday that
American International Group (AIG) must follow when it holds a second round of
bidding to sell its Taiwan-based subsidiary, Nan Shan Life Insurance Co.</P>
      <P>FSC Chairman Chen Yuh-chang said the successful buyer of Nan Shan Life must
promise to protect the rights and benefits of the policy holders of the issuer
and its employees, and must abide by Taiwan law when raising funds for the
acquisition.</P>
      <P>Chen said the buyer then must show its ability to run an insurance company and
must live up to its commitment to operate Nan Shan Life in the long term.</P>
      <P>The buyer must also have the ability to raise funds in the future, as necessary,
to run Nan Shan Life.</P>
      <P>Nan Shan Life will be up for sale in a second round of bidding after the
government in August rejected AIG's proposed sale of the unit to a Hong Kong
financial consortium.</P>
      <P>The authorities cited concerns over the Hong Kong consortium's long-term
commitment to run Nan Shan Life and the bidder's long-term financial capacity.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong group, comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic
Holdings, beat out Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. in the bid to buy Nan Shan
Life for US$2.15 billion last year after a U.S. government bailout of the
financially troubled AIG.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial and Cathay Financial Holding Co. as well as Ruenchen
Investment Holding Co., a new joint venture created by Ruentex Industries Ltd.,
Ruentex Development Co. and Pou Chen Corp., have expressed interest in bidding
to acquire Nan Shan Life.</P>
      <P>Local media have also reported that Fubon Financial Holding Co. is a potential
bidder, although the company refused to comment on the matter.</P>
      <P>However, as Cathay Financial shoulders a higher debt-asset ratio, Chinatrust
Financial is more likely to become the successful buyer, according to the Merril
Lynch brokerage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The shooting incident last month involving the son of a former vice president
was not self-orchestrated but the motive remains unclear, the Banciao District
Prosecutors Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for the prosecutors office, Chen Cheng-fen, said at a press
conference that investigators have gathered a huge volume of evidence that
includes the footage from surveillance cameras near the scene and at two media
outlets, the suspect's phone records, and recent bank transactions by nine
people.</P>
      <P>"The possibility that the shooting incident may have been orchestrated by the
victim himself has been completely eliminated, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen was reporting  on the progress of the investigation, following recent
complaints that it was moving too slow.</P>
      <P>Sean Lien, the son of a former vice president, was shot in the face in Taipei
County at a campaign rally on the eve of the municipality elections that were
held on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is seen as a rising star in the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), was on the
stage at the rally getting ready to make a campaign pitch for a KMT city
councilor candidate.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-wei, an alleged gangster nicknamed "Horse Face," was arrested on the
spot. He has failed one of two lie detector tests administered by investigators,
according to the prosecutors office.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation confirmed that Lin shot Lien in the face at a close-
range, Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, "we are still trying to determine the gunman's motive and where he
obtained the weapon," she said.</P>
      <P>Investigators have also confirmed that the bullet which struck Lien in the left
cheek and exited near his right temple area was the same one that killed a
bystander surnamed Huang, the spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>"We can confirm that there was one gun, one bullet, one death, and one injury,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>She declined to say whether investigators thought the gunman was hired by a
crime ring.</P>
      <P>On the night of the shooting, Lien was rushed to National Taiwan University
Hospital where he had emergency surgery. He was discharged 10 days later.</P>
      <P>Some political commentators and members of the public have raised doubts about
the authenticity of Lien's injuries, saying his quick recovery was
"unfathomable."</P>
      <P>However, the speculations were strongly rebutted by Lien, as well as his
attending physician who went on record to vouch for the authenticity of Lien's
injuries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Screening of parole applications by sex offenders to be tightened</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu pledged Thursday to tighten the screening of
parole applications by sex offenders after his ministry was held accountable for
a serial sex offender who was caught repeating the same offense shortly after
his second release.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) will carefully assess parole
applicants' risk of recidivism before making a decision on whether to approve
their applications.</P>
      <P>In addition, those who are put back in jail for committing the same type of
crime after being released on parole will not be granted parole again, Tseng
said.</P>
      <P>He said the MOJ is also prepared to require that sex offenders be subject to
electronic monitoring around the clock, instead of during night time only as is
the case at present.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice, the Taipei Prison, and the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office were censured a day earlier by the Control Yuan, the country's top
government watchdog, over the latest release of Ting Ta-lun Aug. 21, 2009.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan discovered that the MOJ did not assess Ting's risk of
recidivism before granting him parole, while the Taipei Prison only determined
after Ting's release that the man was "at higher-medium  risk" of repeat
offenses.  The Taipei  District Prosecutors Office, meanwhile, did not issue an
order to put him under electronic monitoring until November 2009.</P>
      <P>Ting, 32, first committed rape in 1995 when he was 17 and was sentenced to five
years in jail. He was released on parole in 2000.</P>
      <P>He was jailed again in 2002 after being convicted of another rape and sentenced
to 10 years behind bars.</P>
      <P>He sexually assaulted a woman Sept. 7, 2009, just 17 days after his second
release, and committed another sex offense in November of that year. Although he
was wearing a night-time electronic tag at the time of the second offense, the
offense took place during the day, when he was not being monitored.</P>
      <P>Ting was sentenced to nine years by the Taipei District Court in July 2010 for
his two latest offenses, reduced to seven years Thursday upon appeal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New Taiwan dollar may rise to NT$29.70 next year: think tank</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Polaris Research Institute said Thursday the average value of the New Taiwan
dollar is expected to rise next year to NT$29.70 against the U.S. dollar from
the estimated NT$31.60 in 2010, largely on further inflows of foreign funds.</P>
      <P>The local currency, along with those in the other Asian economies that have
rebounded strongly from the recent global financial meltdown, is expected to
face pressure to extend its upward momentum, the institute said.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, president of the think tank, said that with the United States
easing its monetary policy to boost its economy, more foreign funds are expected
to enter the Asian markets, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Riding the wave of ample funds, the local currency is likely to become volatile,
Liang said. However, the central bank will most likely try to maintain the value
of the New Taiwan dollar at a "certain level" to stabilize the local financial
market, he said.</P>
      <P>In the past three trading sessions, the U.S. dollar fell below the NT$30.00
level against the New Taiwan dollar before the central bank intervened late in
the trade to boost the U.S. dollar above the NT$30.00 mark at the close.</P>
      <P>Market observers said that the central bank can tolerate NT$30.00 in the short
term, but high liquidity is expected to push the closing of the U.S. dollar
below that level.</P>
      <P>Compared with other Asian currencies, the New Taiwan dollar's appreciation has
been relatively limited because of the central bank's intervention and there is
room for further rise, according to Liang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the research institute has raised its forecast for Taiwan's 2010
economic growth from 8.52 percent to 10.05 percent, mainly on strong exports.</P>
      <P>However, the economic growth in 2011 will be moderate compared to the previous
year, the think tank said, predicting a 4.62 percent rise in the gross domestic
product (GDP) next year.</P>
      <P>In November, the government also raised its forecast for Taiwan's 2010 economic
growth to 9.98 percent from 8.24 percent.</P>
      <P>It said growth in 2011 will be slower, with a 4.51 percent increase in GDP.</P>

      <P>An experimental new road-based driving test will be introduced by a driving
school in northern Taiwan next year in an effort to test local drivers' ability
to use the roads in the proper manner, a transport official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Prospective drivers will need to take a road test on real roads in addition to a
track at a test center from next July in the Northern Region Training Institute,
said Wu Meng-fen, director of the Directorate General of Highways.</P>
      <P>Testing on real roads will allow learner drivers to gain real-life experience,
said Wu, adding that it can also boost new drivers' confidence.</P>
      <P>In an agreement between the Directorate General of Highways and insurance firms,
drivers on real roads with a learner's license will be fully insured against
accidents, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The new road test will be implemented in other regions of the country if the
trial proves successful, said Wu, who added that private driving schools will be

      <P>Justice Minister Tseng Yung-fu said Thursday that the government will definitely
carry out executions of death row convicts once all their legal avenues have
been exhausted.</P>
      <P>"We will carry out the executions if no requirements for retrials, extraordinary
appeals, or Constitutional interpretations are involved, " Tseng said while
fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic
Laws and Statutes Committee.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the ruling Kuomintang said executions of death row
inmates should begin right after the Lunar New Year holiday at the latest, to
convince the public that the government has no plans to stop executions.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry executed four death row convicts April 30, the first
executions since 2005. Since then, none of the country's 44 death row inmates
have been executed.</P>
      <P>The lack of executions since 2005 drew attention earlier this year when then
Minister of Justice Wang Ching-feng insisted on promoting the abolition of
capital punishment and refused to sign death warrants.</P>
      <P>Wang was forced to resign March 11 following an outcry from victims of violent
crime and their families.</P>
      <P>Tseng, however, said he is not sure "when and where the next executions will
take place."</P>
      <P>Wu also demanded that death row inmates and criminal felons should not be
included on any list for sentence commutations.</P>
      <P>As the Republic  of China  will celebrate  its centennial anniversary next year,
there have been calls for penalty reductions as part of the celebrations.</P>
      <P>Tseng said his ministry "has not received any instruction from President Ma
Ying-jeou for such a sentence commutation program, " and he added that it would
take four to five months for his ministry to work out coping measures should the
president decide to issue such a directive.</P>
      <P>Sentence reduction or amnesty falls under the jurisdiction of the president

    <TEXT>
      <P>The internationally renowned director Simon</P>
      <P>McBurney of the British theater company Complicite will present "Shun-kin" in
Taipei this weekend, a work he says presents a moral ambiguity and allows for
audience participation.</P>
      <P>"Shun-kin" is the story of a servant's masochistic love for his beautiful blind
mistress, who is a music teacher. It was inspired by two classic texts by 19th
century Japanese writer Jun'ichiro Tanizaki -- "A Portrait of Shunkin" and "In
Praise of Shadows."</P>
      <P>According to the storyline, Sasuke is so devoted to his mistress Shun-kin that
he would do anything to share her world.</P>
      <P>He takes his devotion so far as to blind himself, claiming that the loss of his
sight is the happiest moment in his life.</P>
      <P>"One of the very interesting things aboutShun-kinis that it presents a moral
ambiguity -- what is right and what is wrong -- because it places the audience
in a state in which they have to participate and say what they think about it, "
McBurney said at a press conference Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The director said he first attempted the play 10 years ago, but realized that
the texts were too complicated and he did not really understand what was going
on. Instead, in 2003, he created a theatrical adaptation of Haruki Murakami's
"The Elephant Vanishes, " which is a portrayal of modern Japanese society.</P>
      <P>He said he is always interested in the question of "who we are, " and that the
long process of making Shun-kin was also a personal journey of trying to learn
about Japan and what constitutes Japanese thoughts and language.</P>
      <P>Artists can look at the stories in different cultures from different points of
view, he said.</P>
      <P>"The danger in this world is that we think there is only one point of view that
is right," he said.</P>
      <P>"Shun-kin" is an international collaboration between McBurney, Japanese actors
from Tokyo's Setagaya Public Theatre, and the Barbican, London.</P>
      <P>The play will be presented in Japanese, with English subtitles, from Friday to
Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Complicite, under McBurney's leadership, has won more than 50 international
awards since it was established in 1983.</P>

      <P>Two prominent business executives -- Uni-President Enterprises Corp. General
Manager Alex Lo and Yahoo Asia Managing Director Rose Tsou -- have been invited
to co-host a flag-raising ceremony at the Presidential Office plaza on New
Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Council for Cultural Affairs Minister Emile Sheng said at a news conference
Wednesday that the surprise arrangement underscores the government's
determination to celebrate the country's 100th founding anniversary next year
with creativity.</P>
      <P>In addition, famous indigenous composer Lee Tai-hsiang has been invited to
provide a special arrangement of the National Anthem to further highlight the
uniqueness of the flag-raising ceremony on the first day of the Republic of
China's centennial year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The marvelous  team-up of Lo and Tsou to host the first flag-raising ceremony at
the Presidential Office square on the first day of the new year will be the
first surprise in the celebrations of the ROC's centennial  founding
anniversary,  said Sheng,  who concurrently heads the ROC (Taiwan) Centenary
Foundation.</P>
      <P>In an effort to inspire all ROC citizens to commemorate the country's 100th
founding anniversary with jubilance, Sheng said, both the Presidential Office
and the foundation have "racked their brains" to design interesting and
meaningful programs.</P>
      <P>Tsou, who played the female lead in various theater shows while studying at
National Taiwan University, is no stranger to hosting public events. The
upcoming New Year's Day flag-raising ceremony, however, will be the first of its
kind she has ever emceed, Sheng said.</P>
      <P>As for Lo, Sheng went on, it came as some surprise that Lo accepted the
invitation without hesitation. "Lo tends to keep a low profile and at first, we
were afraid he might be reluctant to step into the limelight," he said.</P>
      <P>Lo said he regards the offer as a great honor. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I treasure it greatly, " he said. (Dec. 16, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Lee, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, presented his newly completed musical
score to Vice President Vincent Siew at the Presidential Office Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A feeble Lee told Siew that he endured great physical pain while trying to
inject new life into the National Anthem. "I worked my heart out. Every note
required great effort, " he recalled.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the new orchestration makes the National Anthem sound more
lively and theatrical.</P>
      <P>More than 200 musicians selected from private and public music ensembles and
orchestras will play the piece at the New Year's Day flag-raising ceremony, said
Sheng.</P>
      <P>He added that the year-long celebration is aimed at making Taiwan more visible
around the world, cementing national unity and forging harmony in society. (Dec.

      <P>Sightseers on Yushan, known as Jade Mountain, also reported a snowfall that

      <P>However, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said that what the sightseers observed

      <P>This year's show, which will last for 288 seconds and will use more than 30,000
fireworks costing over NT$60 million (US$2.01 million) is being touted as the
"longest, biggest and most expensive" of the last six years, said Michael Liu,
the building's spokesman.</P>
      <P>As the nation celebrates its 100th founding anniversary next year, the show will
focus on that theme. Exactly 100 extra seconds will be added to the duration of
the show, compared with the standard 188 seconds in previous shows, Liu said.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time the organizers have collaborated with international
groups such as Grucci, a New York-based pyrotechnic company with over 150 years
of experience in firework shows and the pyrotechnician Tsai Kuo-chiang, who is
the main creative force behind the show.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that spectators are in for a great show. By using high-quality
fireworks, we have reduced the likelihood of smoke clouds to the minimum, " Liu
said, adding that the show will take place as scheduled unless there is
torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Six other New Year's Eve fireworks displays will take place around the country.</P>
      <P>Besides the one at Taipei 101, the capital will also have two other shows to
ring in the new year, including one sponsored by the Council of Cultural Affairs
to be held at Dajia Riverside Park and another one at the Miramar shopping
center in the Neihu District.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, in addition to a show at the Taichung Stadium, Janfusun Fancy
World amusement park in Yunlin County will also light up the sky with 15,000
fireworks in 11 minutes and will turn its Ferris wheel into the world's biggest
"smiley face."</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, the newest entertainment landmark -- E-da World in Kaohsiung
County -- is preparing to wow spectators with 50,000 fireworks, while Dream Mall
in Kaohsiung City will also hold its annual display after a massive New Year's
Eve count-down party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic policy planner indicates shift to local demand</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
12/16/10  20:42:53
(By C.W. Hsieh and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's top economic policy planner unveiled a blueprint Thursday
indicating a shift to the local demand-driven market in its pursuit of
sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>Reporting to a 2011 economic and investment seminar sponsored by the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CIER) , Christina Liu, minister of the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said China and the whole
of Asia should be viewed as Taiwan's local demand market at a time when Asia is
rapidly emerging from the 2008 economic crisis.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Taiwan's periodic per-capita income has reached an average
monthly historic high of NT$44,453 (US$1,455) this year, and the country should
further explore the local market to make it and the export sector the dual
engines of its economic expansion.</P>
      <P>Export-oriented Taiwan should shift its attention to China and the rest of Asia
from the U.S. and European markets, which are still affected by the global
financial crisis, as part of its efforts to maintain economic development,
particularly since Taiwan clinched the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
(ECFA) with China in June.</P>
      <P>Liu reported that the CEPD will launch a program next year to balance
development in various regions and pave the way for Taiwan's progress in the
coming decade.</P>
      <P>Under the program, she said, the CEPD will suggest "three businesses suitable
for each area's development" and make it possible for potential foreign
companies to have at least three locations to choose from when deciding to
invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For instance, she said, Hualien and Taitung counties in eastern Taiwan will be
ideal for promoting the green energy industry and biotechnology. Greater
investment in that part of Taiwan will help create jobs and increase the income
of people living there, she explained.</P>
      <P>From January next year, the CEPD will also organize large investment seminars in
cities and counties around Taiwan, and will send trade promotion missions to
Japan and India to lure investment and seek business opportunities, she added.</P>
      <P>"The regional development plan will be high on the CEPD's agenda for the coming
two years, under which each special area, to be formed by three cities and
counties, such as Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Miaoli or Taipei, Xinbei and Keelung,
will be made into venues available for investment from three to five select
industries," she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Google Inc. said Thursday that its newly launched Chrome operating system will
not be affected by a predicted decline in netbook shipments next year, due to
the openness of the platform.</P>
      <P>The search giant said Chrome OS, which originates from the web-based Chrome
browser, provides users with a faster and easier access to the Internet on all
kinds of devices, including notebooks, netbooks and tablets.</P>
      <P>"People will feel the same experience no matter what kind of device they are
using, which is why Google offers open sources of the system to OEM and ODM
vendors, " John Liu, Google corporate vice president of greater China
operations, told reports on the sidelines of a celebration of the 10-year
anniversary of the launch of the company's AdWords, a targeted advertising
system.</P>
      <P>Chrome OS, Liu added, stands for a vision that Google will meet consumer demand,
although the development of the system still has a long way to go.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Google unveiled a Chrome-based prototype computer, the
"CR-48, " used in a beta testing program in a move to attract about 120 million
active users of the Chrome browser.</P>
      <P>The all-black device, with a 12.1-inch screen and 3G connectivity similar to
netbooks, does not bear a brand logo, as part of Google's efforts to strengthen
ties with manufacturers.</P>
      <P>"Our manufacturing partners and consumers will be free to select the devices
they prefer, " Google Taiwan's head of communications, Caroline Hsu, said on the
same occasion.</P>
      <P>She said consumer demand in different situations will also increase the growth
of different devices running Chrome OS.</P>
      <P>However, local reports said a day earlier that Asustek Computer Inc. will see
zero growth for its netbook EeePC family for the first time next year, shipping
about 6 million units -- similar to this year's figure.</P>
      <P>Acer Inc. Chairman J.T. Wang also forecast Dec. 8 that global shipments of
netbooks will slide to 30-40 million units in 2011, dropping from this year's 20
percent to 25 percent share of the personal computer market to around 15 percent
to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, global shipments of tablet computers are expected to reach 12.28
million units before the end of this year, making them exceed netbooks to become
the third-largest mobile device category in the final quarter of 2010 and for
all of 2011, said market tracker Digitimes Research.</P>
      <P>Media tablet capabilities are expected to become more PC-like in the coming
years, luring consumers away from PCs and displacing a significant volume of PC
shipments, especially netbooks, according to a recent statement by global
research firm Gartner.</P>

      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait publishing association has been set up in Taipei with the

Thursday.</P>
      <P>Richard Huang, vice director-general of the newly established Cross-Taiwan

organization's main mission is to reinvigorate Taiwan's publishing sector by
promoting the sale of Taiwanese books in China and introducing books published

      <P>"Books printed in traditional Chinese characters are considered imported goods
and they have an appeal for the younger generation in China," he said.</P>
      <P>Although China forbids the establishment of foreign publishing houses on its

confidence that increasing spending power of Chinese consumers will mark a new

      <P>Working with Chinese publishers and companies, he went on, the association will

      <P>Two more people in Taiwan have died of influenza, the Department of Health (DOH)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Two women, one 58 and the other 38, died in the past week, about seven days
after falling ill with symptoms that included coughs and fever, said Lin Ting,
Deputy Director-General of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The younger woman tested positive for the A/H3 flu virus, while the virus strain
in the other infection has not yet been determined, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The deaths could have occurred as a result of other existing diseases, Lin
added. The two women were not in the priority groups to receive free flu
vaccines and they had not been inoculated, he said. The priority groups include
people over 65, patients in care homes, and children aged six months to 10
years.</P>
      <P>Further tests are needed to determine whether the women had developed bacterial
infections after they contracted the flu virus, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As of July, a total of 34 people in Taiwan had died of influenza this year, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Over the last three months, the A (H1N1) virus has replaced the A/H3 strain as
the most common cause of flu infections in the country, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He said Tuesday that 43 percent of the flu cases reported in the last three
months were caused by the H1N1 virus, 33 percent by the A/H3 virus and 23
percent by the influenza B virus.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that the elderly and children are the most vulnerable to H1N1
and that seriously ill patients and people with existing diseases are more
likely to develop severe cases of H1N1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Arbitration court verifying jurisdiction on taekwondo case</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said Thursday that it has officially
registered Taiwan's appeal against the disqualification of one of its taekwondo
athletes in the recent Asian Games.</P>
      <P>The court in Lausanne, Switzerland further said it has initiated an arbitration
procedure to verify that its jurisdiction  is established on the appeal jointly
filed by Yang Shu-chun and Taiwan's Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC).</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, was disqualified from her opening bout in the women's under 49-kg
division in the taekwondo event of the Asiad in Guangzhou, China Nov. 17 for
allegedly wearing extra sensors in her socks in an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match released later appeared to show, however, that Yang
was not wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations from
World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) and Asian Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials for
why Yang was disqualified added to the controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
. Yang and the SAC also filed an appeal with the CAS Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb said in a written reply to Central News
Agency inquiries that the appeal has been transmitted to the three organizations
involved in the arbitration procedure -- the WTF, the OCA and the Guangzhou
Asian Games Organizing Committee.</P>
      <P>The three parties "will have the opportunity to express their positions in a
written submission at a later stage," Reeb said.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, he added, the CAS must ascertain that it has jurisdiction to
render a final ruling.</P>
      <P>Although SAC Vice Minister Steven S.K. Chen said earlier this month that the
appeal does not require the consent of the other parties involved in the
dispute, Reeb said the CAS jurisdiction must be established by written agreement
from all the parties involved in the process.</P>
      <P>"In the present case, it will be also one of the CAS duties to verify that its
jurisdiction is established," Reeb said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwanese delegation will depart for Seoul Friday to attend a WTF
disciplinary committee on the disqualification dispute scheduled for Saturday.</P>
      <P>The delegation  members will include Yang,  Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association
(CTTA) President Chen Chien-ping and Yang's two coaches, Liu Ching-wen and Liu
Tsung-ta.</P>
      <P>They will present written testimony at the WTF disciplinary committee meeting in
the hope of getting a solution to the dispute that they feel is fair, said a
CTTA official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls for speedy amendments to health-care bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Thursday for the early passage of amendments to
the national health-care program bill now that the ruling party's legislative
and executive branches have almost reached consensus on the hot issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the leaders of the five yuans, or branches of government, at the
Presidential Office, Ma expressed hope that Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
will talk soon with the opposition parties over a package deal acceptable to a
majority of the people.</P>
      <P>At issue is the premium rate for the national health insurance system, which is
facing a financial crunch.</P>
      <P>The latest near-consensus among the ruling party's power groups, including its
legislative caucus and the Executive Yuan, is to collect 5.17 percent, or
slightly less, of an individual's salary, up from the previous rate of 4.55
percent, to strengthen the program's finances.</P>
      <P>Caucus leader Lin Tsang-min said the caucus and the Executive Yuan have agreed
to the 5.17 percent rate, "although the exact number needs to be further
confirmed" -- meaning that it could be set a bit lower.</P>
      <P>In fact, from April 1, the system has already been collecting 5.17 percent of an
individual's salary to keep the system running.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the ruling camp proposed another source of finances for the program
-- to collect 2 percent of stock dividends, deposit interest, professional
income and "high bonuses" as a supplement for the program's financial resources.</P>
      <P>By "high bonuses" Lin meant the total bonus a wage earner gets in a year that is
four times as much as or higher than his monthly salary.</P>
      <P>However, a NT$1 million limit might be set on this "single bonus" provision,
meaning that those who get a bonus exceeding NT$1 million would need to
contribute a maximum of an additional NT$20,000 to the program, he noted.</P>
      <P>No consensus was reached on drawing more resources from capital gains or stock
exchange taxes, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that under the latest
proposal, well-paid entertainers, lawyers, real estate agents or those with
high-interest incomes will have to pay more into the program.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Yaung said, the salaried class, whose main income comes from
wages or salaries, might get a minor reprieve because the premium rate might be
set a bit lower than 5.17 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin said KMT legislators have talked to the caucus members of other political
parties in the hope of securing their support.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus itself was slated to hold a meeting the following day to finalize
the amendment proposal before talking with the opposition parties, in the hope
that it will pass the legislative floor that same day.</P>

      <P>Under Article 11 of the agreement, the committee will conduct necessary
consultations to achieve the goals of the ECFA and will supervise and assess the
implementation of the agreement, among other things, Liu said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, "the committee will not be able to make any decisions after

      <P>It will operate under the framework of the Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF)

Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that after consultations have taken place, the matter will be turned
over to the SEF and ARATS for discussion and signing and then sent to the
Legislative Yuan for review, in line with the Statute Governing Relations
Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, censured the Executive
Yuan and the National Palace Museum (NPM) Thursday for irregularities over the
years.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan faulted the Executive Yuan for not clearly defining the role of
the NPM during its many structural reform plans over the years.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan also found that the intervention of political factors have
resulted in frequent changes of the NPM chief, which it said has also led to low
staff morale, and that the competitive edge of the NPM has failed to be
upgraded.</P>
      <P>As of June 2010, the NPM had 679,855 items in its collection, but from 1989
until now, there has been no overall inventory taken. Although from 2001, the
NPM has conducted only irregular checks, involving several thousand items every
year, this has been "hardly enough," according to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The NPM should work out a complete overall inventory and publish the results,
along with reports on the condition of the items, the Control Yuan said.</P>
      <P>It also took to task what it described as the rash decision in 2001, when the
now-opposition Democratic Progressive Party was in power, to build a southern
branch of the NPM in Chiayi, resulting in contract disputes, a waste of
taxpayers' money and loss of faith of Chiayi people in the government -- after a
decade, construction of the museum is still incomplete.</P>

      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait publishing association has been set up in Taipei with the
aim of finding cooperation opportunities  and boosting cross-strait  publishing
exchanges,  the association's management announced at a launch ceremony
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Richard Huang, vice director-general of the newly established Cross-Taiwan
Strait Publication and Distribution Association, told CNA that the
organization's main mission is to reinvigorate Taiwan's publishing sector by
promoting the sale of Taiwanese books in China and introducing books published
in China to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Books printed in traditional Chinese characters are considered imported goods
and they have an appeal for the younger generation in China," he said.</P>
      <P>Although China forbids the establishment of foreign publishing houses on its
soil, the related laws have been loosened in recent years and Huang expressed
confidence that increasing spending power of Chinese consumers will mark a new
era for Taiwan's publishing industry.</P>
      <P>Working with Chinese publishers and companies, he went on, the association will
establish a promotion center in Hebei Province and another in Tianjin City next
month to market books that have been published in Taiwan over the last two
years.</P>
      <P>The association currently has more than 300 members from the local print and
digital publishers, according to Huang.</P>

      <P>Two more people in Taiwan have died of influenza, the Department of Health (DOH)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Two women, one 58 and the other 38, died in the past week, about seven days
after falling ill with symptoms that included coughs and fever, said Lin Ting,
Deputy Director-General of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The younger woman tested positive for the A/H3 flu virus, while the virus strain
in the other infection has not yet been determined, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The deaths could have occurred as a result of other existing diseases, Lin
added. The two women were not in the priority groups to receive free flu
vaccines and they had not been inoculated, he said. The priority groups include
people over 65, patients in care homes, and children aged six months to 10
years.</P>
      <P>Further tests are needed to determine whether the women had developed bacterial
infections after they contracted the flu virus, Lin said.</P>
      <P>As of July, a total of 34 people in Taiwan had died of influenza this year, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Over the last three months, the A (H1N1) virus has replaced the A/H3 strain as
the most common cause of flu infections in the country, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He said Tuesday that 43 percent of the flu cases reported in the last three
months were caused by the H1N1 virus, 33 percent by the A/H3 virus and 23
percent by the influenza B virus.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that the elderly and children are the most vulnerable to H1N1
and that seriously ill patients and people with existing diseases are more
likely to develop severe cases of H1N1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Arbitration court verifying jurisdiction on taekwondo case</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said Thursday that it has officially
registered Taiwan's appeal against the disqualification of one of its taekwondo
athletes in the recent Asian Games.</P>
      <P>The court in Lausanne, Switzerland further said it has initiated an arbitration
procedure to verify that its jurisdiction  is established on the appeal jointly
filed by Yang Shu-chun and Taiwan's Cabinet-level Sports Affairs Council (SAC).</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, was disqualified from her opening bout in the women's under 49-kg
division in the taekwondo event of the Asiad in Guangzhou, China Nov. 17 for
allegedly wearing extra sensors in her socks in an attempt to score more points.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match released later appeared to show, however, that Yang
was not wearing the sensors during the bout. Inconsistent explanations from
World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) and Asian Taekwondo Union (ATU) officials for
why Yang was disqualified added to the controversy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan filed a protest over the decision with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA)
. Yang and the SAC also filed an appeal with the CAS Dec. 8.</P>
      <P>CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb said in a written reply to Central News
Agency inquiries that the appeal has been transmitted to the three organizations
involved in the arbitration procedure -- the WTF, the OCA and the Guangzhou
Asian Games Organizing Committee.</P>
      <P>The three parties "will have the opportunity to express their positions in a
written submission at a later stage," Reeb said.</P>
      <P>As a general rule, he added, the CAS must ascertain that it has jurisdiction to
render a final ruling.</P>
      <P>Although SAC Vice Minister Steven S.K. Chen said earlier this month that the
appeal does not require the consent of the other parties involved in the
dispute, Reeb said the CAS jurisdiction must be established by written agreement
from all the parties involved in the process.</P>
      <P>"In the present case, it will be also one of the CAS duties to verify that its
jurisdiction is established," Reeb said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwanese delegation will depart for Seoul Friday to attend a WTF
disciplinary committee on the disqualification dispute scheduled for Saturday.</P>
      <P>The delegation  members will include Yang,  Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association
(CTTA) President Chen Chien-ping and Yang's two coaches, Liu Ching-wen and Liu
Tsung-ta.</P>
      <P>They will present written testimony at the WTF disciplinary committee meeting in
the hope of getting a solution to the dispute that they feel is fair, said a
CTTA official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President calls for speedy amendments to health-care bill</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called Thursday for the early passage of amendments to
the national health-care program bill now that the ruling party's legislative
and executive branches have almost reached consensus on the hot issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the leaders of the five yuans, or branches of government, at the
Presidential Office, Ma expressed hope that Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
will talk soon with the opposition parties over a package deal acceptable to a
majority of the people.</P>
      <P>At issue is the premium rate for the national health insurance system, which is
facing a financial crunch.</P>
      <P>The latest near-consensus among the ruling party's power groups, including its
legislative caucus and the Executive Yuan, is to collect 5.17 percent, or
slightly less, of an individual's salary, up from the previous rate of 4.55
percent, to strengthen the program's finances.</P>
      <P>Caucus leader Lin Tsang-min said the caucus and the Executive Yuan have agreed
to the 5.17 percent rate, "although the exact number needs to be further
confirmed" -- meaning that it could be set a bit lower.</P>
      <P>In fact, from April 1, the system has already been collecting 5.17 percent of an
individual's salary to keep the system running.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the ruling camp proposed another source of finances for the program
-- to collect 2 percent of stock dividends, deposit interest, professional
income and "high bonuses" as a supplement for the program's financial resources.</P>
      <P>By "high bonuses" Lin meant the total bonus a wage earner gets in a year that is
four times as much as or higher than his monthly salary.</P>
      <P>However, a NT$1 million limit might be set on this "single bonus" provision,
meaning that those who get a bonus exceeding NT$1 million would need to
contribute a maximum of an additional NT$20,000 to the program, he noted.</P>
      <P>No consensus was reached on drawing more resources from capital gains or stock
exchange taxes, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang said that under the latest
proposal, well-paid entertainers, lawyers, real estate agents or those with
high-interest incomes will have to pay more into the program.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Yaung said, the salaried class, whose main income comes from
wages or salaries, might get a minor reprieve because the premium rate might be
set a bit lower than 5.17 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin said KMT legislators have talked to the caucus members of other political
parties in the hope of securing their support.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus itself was slated to hold a meeting the following day to finalize
the amendment proposal before talking with the opposition parties, in the hope
that it will pass the legislative floor that same day.</P>

      <P>A proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation  committee will be subject
to supervision  by the Legislative Yuan, an official in charge of China policy
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the committee will be
established according to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
that went into effect in September.</P>
      <P>Under Article 11 of the agreement, the committee will conduct necessary
consultations to achieve the goals of the ECFA and will supervise and assess the
implementation of the agreement, among other things, Liu said.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, "the committee will not be able to make any decisions after
consultations."</P>
      <P>It will operate under the framework of the Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF)
on the Taipei side and the Beijing -based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , Liu said.</P>
      <P>He noted that after consultations have taken place, the matter will be turned
over to the SEF and ARATS for discussion and signing and then sent to the
Legislative Yuan for review, in line with the Statute Governing Relations
Between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks in a rebuttal of allegations by the opposition Democratic

      <P>The Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, censured the Executive
Yuan and the National Palace Museum (NPM) Thursday for irregularities over the
years.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan faulted the Executive Yuan for not clearly defining the role of
the NPM during its many structural reform plans over the years.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan also found that the intervention of political factors have
resulted in frequent changes of the NPM chief, which it said has also led to low
staff morale, and that the competitive edge of the NPM has failed to be
upgraded.</P>
      <P>As of June 2010, the NPM had 679,855 items in its collection, but from 1989
until now, there has been no overall inventory taken. Although from 2001, the
NPM has conducted only irregular checks, involving several thousand items every
year, this has been "hardly enough," according to the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>The NPM should work out a complete overall inventory and publish the results,
along with reports on the condition of the items, the Control Yuan said.</P>
      <P>It also took to task what it described as the rash decision in 2001, when the
now-opposition Democratic Progressive Party was in power, to build a southern
branch of the NPM in Chiayi, resulting in contract disputes, a waste of
taxpayers' money and loss of faith of Chiayi people in the government -- after a
decade, construction of the museum is still incomplete.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Health insurance as a welfare program</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/17/10  12:05:39
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although efforts by Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang to push through a bill
introducing a second-generation national health insurance system were thwarted
by legislators last week, Yaung, nevertheless, should be applauded for sparking
widespread debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Had he not made that attempt, the current health insurance system, with its
several flaws, would not have been so closely scrutinized.</P>
      <P>The program, which calculates premiums based on salaries, is, by its very
nature, a kind of social insurance system under which high-income earners
subsidize low-income earners. The biggest problem with the existing system is
that it spares those at the tip of the wealth pyramid, who generate huge
fortunes from capital gains, while burdening the salaried class with premiums.
The second-generation insurance system hopes to remedy that by allowing the
calculation of premiums to be based on total household income.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are several principles that we could follow while trying to fix
the system. First, in order to maintain health insurance as a social welfare
program, a "basic premium" should be collected from every person insured.</P>
      <P>Second, in line with the spirit of mutual benefit, the rich should pay a
"supplementary premium" based on their total income, which should include stock
dividends, interests, service revenues, bonuses and prizes.</P>
      <P>Third, as asset ownership is an important reference point to define whether an
individual is rich or poor, the weight of "basic premium" should be adjusted
according to the total worth of assets, including real estate and securities,
owned by the insured. This will ensure that people who own numerous properties
or shares worth tens of millions of New Taiwan dollars are not considered poor
just because they do not receive salaries. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 17, 2010)</P>

pitched for the Nationals in a Major League Baseball (MLB) game, only appearing
in two instructional league games in October.</P>
      <P>Wang was not offered a contract by the Nationals before the deadline of Dec. 3
and therefore became a free agent.</P>
      <P>According to an MLB report published early Friday, Wang had indicated to his
agent that he wanted to stay with the Nationals because of the way it treated
him while recovering from surgery to his right shoulder.</P>
      <P>Although Wang will receive only half the guaranteed salary of his previous
contract, he can secure up to US$4 million in incentives next season.</P>
      <P>Wang will be paid US$250,000 if he stays on the 25-man roster for more than 30
days, a further US$250,000 if he stays for 30 more days, and an additional
US$250,000 if he stays for another 30 days after that, according to the
contract.</P>
      <P>The incentives will be based on how many games in which Wang appears as a
starting pitcher. He will earn an extra US$100,000 between 10-19 games,
US$150,000 between 20-21 games, US$200,000 for his 22nd starting job and
US$300,000 for between 23 and 27 games.</P>
      <P>Wang will receive as much as US$600,000 if he wins any MLB award, including
US$200,000 for the Comeback Player of the Year award.</P>
      <P>Wang won more games than any other big league pitcher (38) between 2006 and
2007, but his injuries have limited him to just 27 appearances over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>In 2009, when he earned US$5 million with the Yankees, Wang was 1-6 with an
atrocious 9.64 ERA before being shut down for the season because of his
shoulder.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Historica Director Lin Man-houng resigned Wednesday over a
controversial online poll to select the 100 most influential figures in the
history of the Republic of China, designed as part of the celebrations of the
ROC's 100th founding anniversary in 2011.</P>
      <P>It would be meaningful if this incident could help us establish a correct
historical perspective on the ROC and consolidate consensus on the national
identity.</P>
      <P>As the institution responsible for compiling the country's historical data,
Academia Historica needs to judge historical facts and define the country's
status in history. Holding an online poll is not a serious method of doing this.</P>
      <P>The survey sparked controversy mainly because the late Chinese communist leader
Deng Xiaoping was polled in the top spot in the military category.  But Deng's
historical  status lies in his contributions to the reform and openness of the
People's Republic of China, which is unrelated to the ROC. Although he fought in
the Battle of Da Bie Shan against the Kuomintang during the civil war in China,
Deng was not even on the list of the top 10 Chinese communist military leaders.</P>
      <P>Lin's resignation deserves our approval. We hope her successor will learn a
lesson from the incident. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 17, 2010)</P>

Trust (WWT) to support its wild bird conservation program in the Russian Far
East.</P>
      <P>The donation was presented Thursday by Lee Hsian-chang, an official of the
Taipei Representative Office in the United Kingdom, to Baz Hughes of the WWT on
behalf of Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Hughes expressed thanks for the long-term contributions from Taiwan that began
in 2006 as support for the conservation of scaly sided mergansers, an endangered
species that live on wetlands in Russia's Far East.</P>
      <P>The donations have enabled the WWT to continue regular checks and monitoring of
the bird's population, as well as relevant research.</P>
      <P>Due to the work of the organization, the merganser population has increased to

      <P>The population of scaly sided mergansers in the Russian Far East dropped to
4,500 at one point due to fishing and logging activities that damaged the bird's

      <P>The Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport Corporation (TIA) vowed Friday to
implement an efficient management model and improve service quality during a
lighting ceremony for a giant Christmas tree in the Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>In an effort to emerge from the shadows of a series of negative reports over the
past year, the TIA's executive team will adopt a "revolutionary method" to save
its image, said TIA President Samuel Perng-liang Lin.</P>
      <P>In latest evaluations conducted by Airport Council International, the airport
ranked 41st in terms of service quality in 2010, a fall from 27th place in 2009.</P>
      <P>"We are going to highlight cultural perspectives at the airport, introduce  a
new  business  model  and  practice  organization consolidation," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The lighting of the Christmas tree, Lin said, is part of a TIA campaign to
connect Taiwan to the world.</P>
      <P>"We want to celebrate the holiday season with every traveler, domestic or
international, " Lin said. "By sending out the message of 'it's time to go
home,' we want people to know that we care,"  he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said the airport will also hold activities on Taiwanese holidays to
introduce the country to foreign travelers.</P>
      <P>In terms of the new business model, the airport will open lounges selling the
same meals as those served in business class so that people can enjoy a "luxury
sky kitchen" on the ground, he said.</P>
      <P>"The airport must create a customer-friendly environment and respond to customer
needs in a timely manner," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the field of service quality improvement, Lin went on, a program that teaches
staff to multi-task is expected to be launched by next June so they can become
familiar with the overall operation of the country's main gateway and act
quickly in case of emergency.</P>
      <P>The airport has drawn widespread criticism since June, when a jetway collapsed
at the airport's Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>In early July, staffers of the airport's central control room were caught
partying with alcohol while on duty. Repeated toilet leaks and power blackouts
have only compounded the facility's woes.</P>
      <P>As a result, the airport, which had been run as a government agency since it
opened in 1979, formally began corporate-style operations in November, a move
aimed at enhancing the facility's efficiency.</P>

      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan is scheduled to arrive in Taipei next Monday
for a new round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart, during which a
bilateral medical cooperation pact will be signed, officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will be greeted by Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , when he arrives at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport, according to the itinerary released by the SEF.</P>
      <P>Chen's itinerary and the meeting agenda were unveiled at a news conference
jointly hosted by the SEF, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council and the
Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>The focus of his itinerary will be talks with SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung the
following day. It will be their sixth formal meeting since 2008 dealing with
major issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 21, Chiang and Chen will sign a medical and health-care cooperation
agreement, the 15th accord they will have signed since their first meeting in
2008 following the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>The two top negotiators will also brief the media on the negotiating situation
in terms of a cross-Taiwan Strait investment protection accord that was
originally scheduled to be signed along with the medical accord at the sixth
meeting.</P>
      <P>However, the signing of the investment pact will be deferred to a later date
because some details remain to be settled, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Chiang and Chen will also exchange views on the agenda for
their next round of talks, expected to take place in the first half of next
year, as well as review the enforcement of the previously signed 14 agreements
that have paved the way for direct cross-strait air and shipping links and
closer commercial exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chiang will probably come up with proposals to resolve issues regarding
insufficient numbers of flights to certain popular Chinese destinations and the
exorbitant prices on some flight routes, as well as passenger and cargo transit
flights, SEF sources said.</P>
      <P>Chen, meanwhile, is likely to put forward a proposal that the two sides sign a
cultural cooperation agreement, the sources said.</P>
      <P>During his stay, he is also scheduled to meet with Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, Taiwan's top China policy planner.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure on Dec. 22, Chen and his entourage will tour the Taipei
International Flora Expo, SEF officials said.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official  intermediary  bodies authorized to handle
cross-strait talks in the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will include a book section for the first time next year in trade fairs
it organizes in China to promote books printed in traditional Chinese
characters, a Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The book section, arranged by the Cross-Taiwan Strait Publication and
Distribution Association in Taipei, will showcase books in traditional Chinese
that were published in Taiwan within the previous two years, said Hou Wen-chin,
the deputy director of TAITRA's market development department.</P>
      <P>TAITRA will organize at least five trade shows in the Chinese cities of
Shenyang, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Nanjing and Wuhan next year. Each fair is expected
to have 1,000-2,000 booths displaying Taiwanese goods.</P>
      <P>Promoting Taiwan-published books in China's market has been difficult because
local publishers often attend shows independently, but Hou said the TAITRA fairs
will provide a unique platform that will increase contacts between the
publishers and Chinese readers.</P>
      <P>The association will join the effort, Hou said, because it is more familiar with
regulations governing selling Taiwanese books in China and can select suitable
publishers and books for the fairs.</P>
      <P>The association currently has more than 300 members in the local print and
digital publishing sectors, according to Richard Huang, vice director-general of

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, said Friday that it has fired an employee of its subsidiary in North
America who was arrested the previous day in the United States for alleged
insider trading.</P>
      <P>TSMC said it will provide necessary assistance to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, which is conducting an investigation into the insider trading
allegations.</P>
      <P>Along with four others, Manosha Karunatilaka, a former technical account manager
of TSMC North America, is accused of selling business secrets when he worked as
a consultant to Primary Global Research, an expert networking company.</P>
      <P>TSMC said that as Karunatilaka's conduct has violated the company's internal
rules related to business secret protection, TSMC North America fired him when
he was arrested Dec. 16.</P>
      <P>The five men -- a sales manager at Primary Global and four consultants of the
company -- were charged with wire fraud and conspiracy to provide confidential
information to Primary Global Research customers between 2008 and early 2010,
according to  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.</P>
      <P>An expert networking company hires analysts to provide investors with insightful
information, and the charges reveal the relationships among Primary Global
Research, its technology analysts and the investors who pay for the information.</P>
      <P>According to the FBI, the more-than US$400,000 Primary Global Research paid its
consultants in this case, who only participated in phone conversations with

      <P>Taiwanese flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) received government approval
Friday for a months-long application to set up its first plant in China, a move
that is expected to help the company follow in the recent footsteps of its South
Korean rivals.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that AUO
can proceed with a plan to build a US$3 billion 7.5th-generation flat panel
plant in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province, Vice Economics Minister Hwang
Jung-chiou told a press briefing.</P>
      <P>AUO submitted the application in March, but did not receive the official
approval until Friday after it had met several government conditions aimed at
minimizing any negative impact of such Chinese investment projects on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For example, AUO pledged to invest NT$400 billion (US$13.4 billion) in building
two 11th-generation flat panel plants and solar energy facilities in the Central
Taiwan Science Park by 2022.</P>
      <P>The flat panel maker will also make additional investments totaling NT$150
billion in other parts of Taiwan, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Since AUO is already operating an 8.5th-generation flat panel plant in Taiwan,
its application to set up a 7.5th-generation plant met with the government's
requirement that high-tech companies investing in China must maintain a
technological lead at home over their Chinese facilities, the official noted.</P>
      <P>AUO has also promised to hire 5,000 employees in Taiwan over the next 10 years,
as further assurance to the government that it will not slash its local
workforce because of the new Chinese investment.</P>

      <P>China is now awash with cash, and Taiwan will become one of the main
destinations for its excess capital, a local securities analyst predicted
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu Zong-yao, managing director of Lu Chang Equity Research, said at a forum on
2011's investment outlook sponsored by the Economic Daily News (EDN) that based
on his decades-long research on the local capital market, he believed Taiwan
would become one of China's important investment destinations.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Financial Supervisory Commission,  seven
China-based  qualified domestic institutional investors (QDII) have invested a
total of US$163.7 million in the local stock market.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Addressing the EDN seminar, Lu said there were reports that the recent
appreciation of the Taiwan dollar may have been fueled by speculation from
George Soros' Quantum Fund.</P>
      <P>"I don't think so, " Lu said, suggesting it was more likely related to
expectations of capital inflows from China.</P>
      <P>According to his study, Lu said China will encourage overseas investment now
that it has abundant capital, and Taiwan is a likely target given the ever
closer trade and economic ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan meeting about the possible impact of
capital inflows from China on the Taiwan dollar's value, Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) Chairman Chen Yu-chang said there were no abnormalities in
local currency transactions in recent days.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Chinese QDIIs are allowed to invest up to US$500
million in Taiwanese securities, with the maximum for any single QDII capped at
US$80 million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank, the FSC, and the Mainland Affairs Council reportedly have
reached a consensus to raise the maximum a single QDII can invest in local
stocks to US$100 million and also allow QDIIs to invest in TDRs (Taiwan
depositary receipts) and shares of foreign companies that have their primary
listings in Taiwan. (Dec. 17, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs officials said Thursday that the government may
allow well-known Chinese home appliance makers to buy stakes in local flat panel
companies under certain restrictions, such as not permitting the Chinese
investors to acquire more than half of a local company's shares.</P>
      <P>The proposal is aimed at consolidating Taiwanese panel makers' position in the
vast Chinese market, which has emerged as the world's biggest consumer of flat
panel products.</P>
      <P>In the face of strong competition from Japan and South Korea, the officials
said, Taiwanese makers must sharpen their competitive edges through cooperation
with their Chinese counterparts, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Chinese flat panel makers, however, will still be barred from investing in the
local flat panel sector, the officials said, because of lingering questions over
the size of the stakes that they should be allowed to acquire.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan opened its door for Chinese investment in June 2009, 93 Chinese
investment projects with a combined investment commitment of US$127 million have
been approved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei's smart transportation system bridging barriers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/17/10  18:26:28</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On a hot summer day 13 years ago, Huang Chun-nan hoped to take his son to the
Taipei Zoo by bus. For most city residents it would have been a straightforward
task, but for Huang, who has been a wheelchair user since childhood, the outing
turned into a nightmare.</P>
      <P>He was hoping to catch one of only two small No. 277 wheelchair buses that ran
each day to get to his destination, and when he saw the bus approaching, he put
his son on his lap to get ready to get on.</P>
      <P>"But apparently the bus didn't see us and rushed past. I pushed my wheelchair
really hard to try to catch it, because it was our only hope to get to the zoo,"
Huang recalled.</P>
      <P>"But we failed, and I was so disappointed and frustrated by the incident that it
still lingers in my mind today, " a distraught Huang said. "I didn't want my son
to suffer from my disability, because he deserved to have a happy childhood like
other children."</P>
      <P>The incident left Huang scarred, but for him and many others in Taiwan who have
fought similar obstacles, their constant struggles may soon be a thing of the
past, especially in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The city's government is gradually building a more barrier-free transportation
system with "smart" features that has not only greatly improved the quality of
life for people with disabilities but also shortened the distance between
people.</P>
      <P>One of its most important initiatives launched in 2001 has been the introduction
of low-floor buses, equipped with ramps and extra space inside to accommodate
wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>A total of 600 of these buses will be in service in Taipei by the end of 2010,
and that number will rise to 1,000, or one-quarter of all buses running in the
city, by the end of next year, said Jeffrey Liu, an engineer with the Taipei
City Department of Transportation (TCDOT).</P>
      <P>More importantly to many wheelchair users, 26 city bus routes will exclusively
operate low-floor buses by the end of 2010, providing a degree of predictability
that has never existed before.</P>
      <P>"We've gotten a lot of positive feedback, " Liu said. "The Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) decided to provide another NT$170
million (US$5.6 million) in November to rehabilitate 100 older low-floor buses."</P>
      <P>Huang said the buses have provided welcome relief. No longer feeling rushed when
a bus driver pulls over, he said he has made friends with many people during his
travels because everyone wants to offer help.</P>
      <P>"I remember one time when a man volunteered to help me with the driver and all
of a sudden the kids from Nangang Vocational High School on the bus began
clapping for us," Huang recalled.</P>
      <P>The city also has a fleet  of wheelchair  vans providing door-to-door service
for 32,000 passengers a month that has grown to 152 vehicles today from 130 at
the beginning of 2010.</P>
      <P>Pao Wei-yao, who has driven a wheelchair van for eight years, said he has been
inspired by the passion for life shown by some of his passengers. "A regular
customer of mine who suffers from cerebral palsy always brings me an extra
breakfast and reminds me to watch my health and eat on time," Pao said.</P>
      <P>The city also has a fleet of 3,000 taxis dedicated to serving senior citizens
and the physically and mentally challenged that has handled 680,000 passenger-
trips since the program was launched in 2009.</P>
      <P>Aside from its emphasis on barrier-free vehicles, the city has introduced what
it calls an "advanced traveler information system (ATIS) , featuring "smart"
technologies such as GIS (geographic information system) ,  which has been
installed throughout the transportation network.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-wen, who is visually challenged, said his world has been made better by
the GIS-assisted audible system on city buses.</P>
      <P>"Back when there was no automatic announcement saying where the bus was as it
moved, I had to count off each stop silently to figure out when to get off," Lu
said.</P>
      <P>To alert visually impaired travelers waiting at a stop that their bus is
arriving, 193 buses have been equipped with speaker systems broadcasting
drivers' announcements that they're pulling in.</P>
      <P>Similar smart devices have also been extended  to regular crosswalks in the
city, with audible signaling systems emitting sounds that tell the visually
impaired whether it is safe to cross the street or not.</P>
      <P>The magic of ATIS, according to the city's Liu, is that people with disabilities
are now able to decide on and control their journey.</P>
      <P>"Everyone can check the whereabouts of our buses online, anywhere at anytime, "
Liu said. "Taking a bus no longer means endless waiting, major doubts, or trying
one's luck."</P>
      <P>The website is www.taipeibus.taipei.gov.tw, which can be more easily accessed by
entering "5284" when using Internet search engines. The number sounds like "I
love bus" in Chinese.</P>
      <P>Despite the technological advances and vehicle upgrades, TCDOT division chief Su
Fu-chih said an emotional component is also needed to make the city's
transportation system more accessible to people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>He said that with an increase in vehicles and facilities that are barrier-free,
people have to learn to be sensitive to others' feelings.</P>
      <P>"Whether people can tolerate those using different forms of transportation and
traveling differently from us determines if a city is great," Su said.</P>
      <P>Huang believed that Taipei City residents have risen to the challenge, and he
said the transportation network's continuing emphasis on accessibility has
connected him to others in a way that has brought down some of the social
barriers he and other people with disabilities have faced.</P>
      <P>"I've gotten to know people whom I never would have had the chance to know, and
I believe it's the same for them," Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Improved cross-strait ties create win-win-win situation: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that improved relations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait is advantageous not only to Taiwan and China but also to
the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the United States has played an important role in the nearly
100-year history of the Republic of China and has provided various forms of
support to the country, ranging from economic aid to promoting Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic ties over the past 31 years, Taiwan and the
United States have continued to maintain close interaction in the political,
economic and cultural areas, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"With cross-strait ties gradually improving, the government needs to allow its
American friends to understand Taiwan's policy and to persuade the U.S. side
that the new development is a win-win-win situation, " Ma said while addressing
the opening of an art exhibition titled "American Footsteps in Taiwan" organized
by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>Speaking of the U.S. role in the fate of the ROC and Taiwan, the president said
that had the United States not entered World War II following Japan's attack on
Pearl Harbor, the ROC would have had to fight a very hard battle against the
Japanese, which was invading China at that time.</P>
      <P>After the ROC government was forced to retreat to Taiwan after losing a civil
war with the Chinese communists, the United States also protected Taiwan against
attack by the communists by sending the U.S. Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait
in 1950, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Referring to the theme of the exhibition, William Stanton, director of the AIT's
Taipei Office, said that "every step taken leaves a trace."</P>
      <P>Although the United States did provide assistance to Taiwan between 1950 and
1980, it is the hard work of the Taiwanese people that has been the most
important driving force behind Taiwan's democratization and its economic
achievements, said Stanton.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being held until Jan. 24 at the National Central Library in
Taipei. Items on display include 180 photos and 68 artifacts and oral history
videos.</P>
      <P>Patricia Linder, the 84-year-old widow of James Linder, who was the last
commander of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Command, also took part in the opening
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Linder said she could not believe she was back in Taiwan after being away for 30
years. She said she is proud of Taiwan's democratic development, which she
described as history collectively made by all the Taiwanese people.</P>

blind, also broke Asian records in the men's 100m freestyle-S13 and 200m medley-
SM13 on Dec. 13 and 14.</P>
      <P>S13 is one of three designations, along with S11 and S12, for swimmers with a

      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait trade fair opened at the Taipei World Trade Center Friday,
in which Taiwan's premium agricultural  products bearing the CAS (certified
agricultural standards) label were introduced to traders from China.</P>
      <P>The Chinese buyers were expected to place a total of US$2.5 million-worth of
orders on the first day of the two-day event, which was organized by Taiwan's
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) to promote the country's quality-
certified agricultural products, COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said.</P>
      <P>After the trade fair, follow-up orders worth many times that amount are expected
to be placed, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Wang Cheng-yi, chairman of Taipei-based Laurel Enterprises Corp., a frozen food
producer with production lines in both Taiwan and China, said at the show he
anticipates that CAS products will create NT$700 million to NT$800 million-worth
of trade opportunities in China in the first year of going on sale there,
expanding to NT$1 billion or higher in the following year.</P>
      <P>More than 400 representatives  and personnel in charge of procurement from
agricultural and food businesses from Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang,
Hunan and Shandong visited the trade fair on the opening day to see the
offerings from 126 Taiwanese traders and producers of CAS products, according to
the COA.</P>
      <P>Chen noted in the opening ceremony that Taiwan applied in 2008 to register the
CAS trademark in China. The application was approved in August this year so that
Taiwan will acquire the trademark licence Jan. 20, the minister noted.</P>
      <P>After that, CAS will serve as the flagship brand of Taiwanese premium
agricultural products in the Chinese market, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The COA established the CAS label and certification protocol in 1989 by adopting
international standards in the production management and quality control of
agricultural goods to ensure food safety and improve the competitiveness of the
country's agricultural products.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the CAS label, the products must meet four criteria: The raw
materials must be from Taiwan; the production processes must be in accordance
with approved hygiene and safety standards; the products must be in compliance
with established quality specifications; and the packages and product labels
must conform with accepted rules.</P>
      <P>At present, CAS-labeled agricultural products are classified in 15 categories
ranging from meat to rice, processed fresh fruit and vegetables and aquatic
products, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The number of certified CAS producers has reached 330, with 6,388 items carrying
the label and the total annual output of the companies involved has amounted to
NT$45 billion (US$1.5 billion), Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets said Friday it issued a "buy" recommendation on The
Ambassador Hotel, Ltd. on a "positive" view about Taiwan's tourism sector due to
an increase in Chinese visitors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After initiating coverage of the hotel company, which has three properties in
Taiwan, CLSA said it has set a 12-month target price of NT$56 (US$1.88) on the
stock.</P>
      <P>The hotel company's shares closed up 2.97 percent at NT$48.50 on Taiwan's stock
exchange Friday.</P>
      <P>"We expect to see further breakthroughs in 2011, given the expected opening
toward Chinese visitors not traveling in tour groups and higher daily visa
quotas for Chinese tour groups," CLSA said in a research note.</P>
      <P>"The new policies could take place before the 2011 Chinese New Year holidays,"
it added.</P>
      <P>Currently, only Chinese traveling in tour groups are allowed to visit Taiwan,
but Taipei and Beijing are discussing easing regulatory restrictions to permit
independent Chinese travelers to come.</P>
      <P>CLSA said it expects talks on the issue to conclude ahead of the upcoming Lunar
New Year holiday, which falls in February 2011.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador Hotel is expected to post compound average growth rates for sales
of 9.8 percent between 2011 and 2015 and 4.5 percent from 2016 and 2020, the
brokerage said.</P>
      <P>That compound average growth rate during the 2011-2020 period will be
substantially higher than the 0.9 percent rise seen from 2006 to 2010, it said.</P>
      <P>In terms of operating profit, the hotel is expected to post a compound average
growth rate of 25.4 percent from 2011-2015, compared with a fall of 8.1 percent
registered between 2006 and 2010, it added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) finalized its national health insurance (NHI) reform
package Friday in its bid to help keep the debt-ridden program afloat.</P>
      <P>Under the latest reform package, the NHI premium rate will be slightly less than
the current 5.17 percent of an individual's salary, according to Department of
Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang.</P>
      <P>But the package also calls for a new source of premium revenues that had
previously gone untapped. The program will collect 2 percent of stock dividends,
interest income, professional income and "high bonuses" as a "supplemental
premium" to strengthen the system's finances.</P>
      <P>"High bonuses" are defined as total bonuses that are at least four times higher
than an individual's monthly salary.</P>
      <P>Yaung presented the latest NHI package at a KMT legislative caucus meeting that
was also attended by KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung and Vice Premier Sean
Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers were said to generally agree with the latest package forged
after close consultations between the executive and legislative branches.</P>
      <P>Though the draft proposal set the maximum premium on monthly salaries at 6
percent -- higher than under the existing system -- Yaung said the actual
premium rate should end up below 5 percent once the DOH completes more detailed
calculations of potential revenues.</P>
      <P>The 2 percent rate used to calculate supplemental premiums will be adjusted from
the second year the new plan is in effect, according to the plan.</P>
      <P>The final two-track premium system was a compromise after Yaung's plan to
calculate NHI premiums based on household income failed to receive the
endorsement of KMT lawmakers when it was sent to the legislature for final
review earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Yaung said after the meeting that his previous proposal was more ideal but would
have encountered difficulties when put into practice. He added that the latest
package was "the most ideal version that was feasible and acceptable."</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, director of the KMT Central Policy Committee, said the KMT would
send the latest version to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's
legislative caucus for its reference later in the day.</P>
      <P>Lin expressed the hope that the legislature would discuss the latest NHI reform
package as soon as next Tuesday.</P>

      <P>The Rainbow Warrior, the celebrated flagship of the Greenpeace environmental
protection group, will arrive in Taiwan on the first port call of its "Ocean
Defenders Tour of East Asia" Jan. 2.</P>
      <P>The ship is expected to visit various harbors and outlying islands around Taiwan
over the course of the month, including Keelung, Suao, Green Island, Kenting,
Kaohsiung and the island of Xiao Liuqiu before heading off Jan. 30 for Hong Kong
and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The visits are designed to continue spreading the Greenpeace message of the need
for marine reserves to protect species facing extinction, Kao Yu-fen, oceans
campaigner of Greenpeace in Taipei, said at a press conference in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the Rainbow Warrior has visited Taiwan,  Kao noted.
During its visit,  Greenpeace will invite government officials, civic groups and
the public to visit the ship, and campaigners will conduct related research on
the ecosystem of Taiwan, especially its coral reefs and green turtle population.</P>
      <P>The planned visit will coincide with the 40th anniversary of the founding of
Greenpeace, an independent international organization dedicated to using non-
violent and creative confrontations to expose environmental problems and force
solutions, according to Greenpeace website.</P>
      <P>Kao told reporters that while Greenpeace has been more focused on Europe and the
United States during the last decades, in the coming years it will turn its
attention to Africa and Asia, because Asia in particular is a region that faces
challenging environmental problems.</P>
      <P>"Illegal fishing is still being carried out by Taiwanese longline vessels;
Taiwan should stop depleting endangered species such as tuna," she said.</P>
      <P>The ship that will visit Taiwan is actually the Rainbow Warrior II. The original
vessel was attacked and sunk in 1985 by agents of the French government in an
attempt to foil protests against French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.
The vessel will be retired after its East Asia voyage ends in March.</P>

      <P>Electronic invoices will soon be available at bricks-and-mortar stores on a
trial basis for the first time in Taiwan, as part of government plans to
gradually replace paper bills with e-invoicing by 2012, the Ministry of Finance
said Friday.</P>
      <P>People who shop at 27 designated 7-Eleven and Hi-Life convenience stores or at
the Pxmart supermarket with smart cards or store membership cards from Saturday
will have their purchase information and invoice numbers automatically
transferred to a database operated by the Financial Data Center under the
ministry, said Finance Minister Lee Sush-der at a ceremony to launch the
project.</P>
      <P>Other  devices  with  built-in  chips  or  radio-frequency identification (RFID)
such as watches and cellphones will also be used for e-invoicing in later stages
of the project, Lee added.</P>
      <P>About 11.5 billion invoices are printed every year, according to statistics. If
8 billion paper bills can be substituted by electronic invoices per year, 80,000
trees could be saved, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to conserve resources, the ministry has decided to push for
overall e-invoicing to make shopping more convenient and eco-friendly.</P>
      <P>The reform is estimated to reduce the invoice process cost by NT$7.4 billion
(US$248 million) between 2010 and 2013. The reduction is forecast to reach as
much as NT$120 billion once the whole country is using paperless invoices, Lee
added.</P>
      <P>Two further stages of the e-invoicing trial will take place at more shops and
retailers next March and June, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>Currently,  online  shops,  TV  shopping  channels,  and business-to-business
firms have taken advantage of electronic billing since the ministry set up an

      <P>Taiwan-grown fresh fruit drew the attention of a number of Chinese buyers at a

Taiwan's  premium agricultural products.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese fruits are considered high-end quality items in my city," said Zhang
Xiangfeng from Jinan in Shandong Province.</P>
      <P>Zhang, a member of the Shandong Province Federation of Industry and Commerce,
praised the quality of Taiwan-grown fruits at the first cross-Taiwan Strait
trade fair featuring CAS-labeled agricultural products of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two-day event was organized by Taiwan's Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture

      <P>Zhang, who runs an agricultural development company in Jinan, said an increasing

high quality.</P>
      <P>Though China has its own food safety certification system, Zhang was more
confident in Taiwan's system and food products from the island.</P>
      <P>Dai Chengcai, head of the Bureau of Agriculture of Longyan in Fujian Province,
said after sampling Taiwan-grown bell fruit, guava and custard apple that he
felt the high-quality bell fruit had considerable potential in his market.</P>
      <P>Dai said Taiwan-grown bell fruits, also called wax apples, were available in
Fujian at a price of 50 yuan per kilogram, but if Taiwan exported the CAS-
certified bell fruit he sampled at the show, the price could exceed 80 yuan per
kilo.</P>

anniversary of its establishment Dec. 20, has been successfully transformed into
a hub for cultural and creative industries, a Taipei city government official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Johnson Chiu, chief executive officer of the Taipei Culture Foundation, said at
a press conference that the Red House has seen positive changes since the
foundation took over the operation of the octagonal brick building three years
ago.</P>
      <P>From its completion in 1908, the Red House, located in the bustling Ximending
area, has stood through the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese occupation, and the
influence of Shanghai and Western culture  and fashion trends.  It gradually
lost its cultural significance following the urban development of Taipei in the
eastern part of the city in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>"Ximending has been a trendsetter in Taipei since 1900, and we have always tried
to find ways to make the Red House connect with the area's development," Chiu
said.</P>
      <P>The last three years saw the Red House turned into a venue for designers to show
their creative power, he went on, as the first floor is now occupied by 16
boutiques operated by young Taiwanese designers selling their wares, while the
plaza outside the building is a cluster of more than 60 creative booths every
weekend.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the plaza, also has several gay bars, which Chiu described as a symbol
that Taipei is an advanced city.</P>
      <P>"Shop owners in Ximending have told me that about 40 percent of their income now
comes from tourists rather than locals, meaning that the district is likely to
be a major attraction for the capital in the near future," he concluded.</P>
      <P>The Red House will celebrate its 102nd birthday by screening several video clips
made by local artists from Friday to Jan. 30.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AU Optronics permitted to invest in China (UPDATE)</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwanese flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) received government approval
Friday to set up its first plant in China, a move expected to help the company
compete with its South Korean rivals in China's market.</P>
      <P>The Investment Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that AUO
can proceed with a plan to build a US$3 billion 7.5-generation flat panel plant
in Kunshan, in China's Jiangsu Province, Vice Economics Minister Hwang Jung-
chiou said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese plant is scheduled to enter mass production in 2012 as part of the
company's efforts to cash in on growing Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>The approval came weeks after Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Display Co., the
world's two largest flat panel makers, were allowed to establish a
7.5-generation and 8.5-generation flat panel plants in China, respectively.</P>
      <P>"In a highly competitive international market, Taiwanese panel suppliers now
have only very limited time to create the early-mover competitive advantages in
mainland China, " AUO said in a statement after learning of the approval.</P>
      <P>"We must work much harder to catch up," it added.</P>
      <P>AUO urged the government to "consider adopting a more lenient industry policy
implemented by Taiwan's competitor countries and lifting the current restriction
on fab generation and M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) investments."</P>
      <P>The appeal was aimed at providing Taiwanese manufacturers with more flexibility
for their global business strategies and raise the local panel industry's global
competitiveness, the company said.</P>
      <P>AUO submitted its investment application in March but did not receive official
approval  until Friday after it met several government conditions aimed at
minimizing any negative impact of the investment project in China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AUO pledged, for example to invest NT$400 billion (US$13.4 billion) to build two
11th-generation flat panel plants and solar energy facilities in the Central
Taiwan Science Park by 2022.</P>
      <P>The flat panel maker will also make additional investments totaling NT$150
billion in other parts of Taiwan, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Since AUO is already operating an 8.5-generation flat panel plant in Taiwan, its
application to set up a 7.5-generation plant met with the government's
requirement that high-tech companies investing in China must maintain a
technological lead at home over their Chinese facilities, the official noted.</P>
      <P>AUO has also promised to hire 5,000 employees in Taiwan over the next 10 years,
as further assurance to the government that it would not slash its local
workforce because of the new Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>Chimei Innolux Corp., another Taipei-based flat panel maker, reportedly will
submit an application to set up a plant in China, but company spokesman Eddie
Chen said the plan was still in the pipeline and had no specific timetable.</P>
      <P>In February, the government relaxed the rules governing high-tech investment in
China by allowing flat panel makers to build up to three 6th-generation or above
plants there.</P>
      <P>Applicants must assure the authorities, however, that they can maintain a
technological edge in Taiwan over any facilities they open in China and must
promise to continue to invest at home.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA)  President Chen Chien-ping and
Yang's two coaches, Liu Ching-wen and Liu Tsung-ta, accompanied her on the two-

      <P>Yang was disqualified in her first match in the Asian Games women's under 49

requests from officials to leave, unwilling to accept what happened.</P>
      <P>Replays of the match showed that Yang had removed the two sensors before her

and said she would adopt a "business as usual" attitude at Saturday's meeting,
called by the World Taekwondo Federation's disciplinary committee.</P>
      <P>Chen said that at the request of the WTF, the CTTA had submitted three written
statements from him, Yang, and Liu Tsung-ta, offering detailed evidence to
protect the rights and interests of the athlete and coaches.</P>

      <P>A Facebook page set up to encourage Taiwan residents to look for mistakes in
bilingual signs in public areas has attracted more than 1,100 fans, the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications said Friday.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,168 netizens now follow the page where people can upload photos of
mistakes or improper usage of English in local signs and provide corrections to
win free gifts, ranging from a Wii to an iPod.</P>
      <P>The campaign, launched in September, was an attempt to correct English mistakes
on signs seen in facilities or areas under the ministry's jurisdiction,
including railway stations, airports, and national scenic areas.</P>
      <P>The ministry gave a few examples of some bad English that probably drew a few
laughs before being corrected.</P>
      <P>A vendor at the Sinying service plaza, for instance, translated "lemon Aiyu
jelly" directly from the Chinese to "the lemon loves the jade."</P>
      <P>In another case, "watch out for snakes" was mistakenly written as "watch out for
snacks" in the Siraya National Scenic Area in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Other errors included misspellings such as "mussum" for museum and "champing"
for camping, according to the social-networking page.</P>

      <P>A Taipei District Court judge was indicted Friday for negligence after it was
found that he failed to keep the identity of an informant confidential.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Prosecutors Office indicted Judge Chou Chan-chun, along with court
clerk Liu Li-ying, for negligence in allowing secrets to be leaked and asked
that both be put on probation.</P>
      <P>Chou is a relatively well-known judge whose name again was in the news after
serving as the lead judge in a trial of former President Chen Shui-bian, who was
charged with taking bribes related to two major mergers of financial
institutions during his term in office and laundering the money.</P>
      <P>Chou acquitted Chen in the case based on what was seen by some as a
controversial argument.</P>
      <P>According to Friday's indictment, Chou failed to seal information on an
informant who tipped off the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) that Lu Chun-hua
was growing marijuana in 2008.</P>
      <P>When the CGA asked for a search warrant from the Taipei District Court, Chou did
not seal the informant's identity after reviewing all of documents related to

do not know -- that is understanding."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwanese baseball pitcher Kuo Hong-chih of the Los Angeles Dodgers failed to
win the 2010 Setup man of the Year Saturday in the annual Major League Baseball
(MLB) This Year in Baseball (TYIB) awards.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old, who won the award in 2008, ranked third with 20 percent ballots
casted behind Joaquin Benoit of Tampa Bay Rays, who is now with the Detroit
Tigers, and Mike Adams of the San Diego Padres, who finished with 21 percent.</P>
      <P>Benoit, who had a 1.34 ERA (earned run average) , garnered 49 percent of the
ballots to win the award, which recognizes the best setup pitcher -- a relief
pitcher who usually pitches in the seventh and eighth inning before the closer,
while Adams finished second with 21 percent.</P>
      <P>The award is one of 19 categories in the annual TYIB awards, which were
calculated based equally on votes by fans at MLB.com, media, front-office
personnel and retired players.</P>
      <P>Kuo finished the 2010 season with three wins, two losses and 12 saves in 56
appearances, his best performance since making his MLB debut with the Dodgers in
2005, and became the first Taiwanese player to earn a spot in the MLB mid-season
All-Star Game.</P>
      <P>The left-hander, who had four surgeries on his elbow, also broke the Dodgers
franchise record of the lowest ERA, finishing the season with an ERA of 1.20. He
struck out 73 while yielding only 29 hits and 18 walks in 60 innings.</P>
      <P>Aside from his record-setting ERA, he also limited opposing hitters to a .139
batting average during the season. Meanwhile, his WHIP (walks and hits per
inning pitched) was an astounding 0.78. Anything below 1 is considered
outstanding.</P>
      <P>The TYIB Awards, which are also known as the GIBBY (The Greatness in Baseball
Yearly) awards honor the 2010 season's top Player, Starter, Rookie, Closer,
Setup Man, Defensive Player, Manager, Executive,  Breakout Player,  X-Factor,

      <P>The Ministry of Education is planning to promote a "school bullying prevention
law" that would require that the bullies be isolated. The idea has come in the
wake of a recent string of shocking bullying incidents, including beating up,
taking naked photos of, and gang-raping schoolmates, with the violent acts
videoed and posted online by the bullies.</P>
      <P>School culture usually reflects social culture. These bullying behaviors are
duplicates of some of the current problems in the Taiwanese society.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly, many schools were unaware of the bullying problem or never dealt
with it. In fact, such deviant behavior can be corrected with proper guidence
provided by teachers. The real problem is: when the teenagers need to be
advised, school and parents just stand idly by.</P>
      <P>There is a need to develop a sense of justice and encourage active participation
among teachers and students in order to prevent the bullying problem from
further worsening. This is definitely more urgent than enacting a law or setting
up a bullying hotline.</P>

      <P>Official statistics show that the number of Taiwan workers who earn less than
NT$20,000 per month -- roughly the same as the minimum wage -- has now reached
1.38 million. This is an increase of 240,000 compared with the period before the
global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, if the 600,000 people working without pay in family business are
included, the number will be almost 2 million.</P>
      <P>These figures tell us that the working poor problem is worsening as the wealth
gap continues to widen in the country, and that the high economic growth is
benefiting only a tiny minority.</P>
      <P>The government should be held accountable  for failing to institute an equitable
tax system. The progressive rates adopted for income tax, gift tax, inheritance
tax and land value-added tax were originally meant to balance the distribution
of wealth. However, the system has been damaged by various tax reductions and
exemptions introduced under the pretext of promoting investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a task force set up by the Cabinet to address the problem of wealth
inequality has not put forward any substantive resolutions in the four months it
has been in operation. This is not because our policy makers do not have a clue,
but because they are too timid to make critical decisions.</P>
      <P>We hope our government officials will think more about the plight of these 2
million workers and their families and make a move soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- AU Optronics gains approval to operate in China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>A leading flat panel maker, AU Optronics Corp. (AUO)
12/18/10  15:33:25
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>, was granted approval by the Taiwan government Friday to set up its first plant
in China.</P>
      <P>This means that AUO will now be able to commence work on a US$3 billion plant in
Kunshan, Jiangsu Province, eastern China, to manufacture 7.5th generation flat
panels.</P>
      <P>However, the approval for AUO to set up business in China came several weeks
after the world's two largest flat panel makers, Samsung Electronics  and LG
Display of South Korea,  obtained permission from Beijing to establish 7.5G and
8.5G flat panel factories in China, respectively.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>For the first time, the Taiwan government gave approval for a large flat panel
manufacturer to invest in China. Chimei Innolux Corp., another Taipei-based flat
panel producer, is next in line.</P>
      <P>With AUO scheduled to begin mass production in Kunshan in 2012, a full-blown
flat panel war could erupt by then in the Chinese market between Taiwan and
South Korean companies.</P>
      <P>Expressing delight and relief at the approval, AUO urged the government Friday
to also lift the current restrictions on fab generation and M&amp;A (merger and
acquisition) investments in order to give Taiwanese manufacturers  more
flexibility in their global business strategies.</P>
      <P>AUO said that in the face of strong competition from foreign businesses,
Taiwanese panel makers have limited time to develop a competitive edge in China.
(Dec. 18, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>It took the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) nine months to complete its
review of AUO's China investment plan. The ministry did not want to approve the
project unless the company made a commitment to deliver on its promise to invest
NT$400 billion (US$13.4 billion) in two 11th-generation flat panel plants and
solar energy facilities in the Central Taiwan Science Park by 2022.</P>
      <P>The MOEA wanted AUO to prove "its love for Taiwan" before investing in China.
However, AUO has lost time in the race against its South Korean competitors.</P>
      <P>In addition, domestic businesses are worried that Taiwanese flat panel makers in
China, which is the world's largest market for that product, would not be able
to compete with South Korean companies in the fab generation and production
process. (Dec. 18, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Addressing rumors that AUO would merge with an optoelectronics company
affiliated with the Kunshan City government, Vice Economics Minister Hwang Jung-
chiou said that the MOEA has determined that no Chinese capital will be used in
the establishment of AUO's plant in Kunshan.</P>
      <P>It was because of this issue that the MOEA took as long as it did to approve the
project.</P>
      <P>Another reason was that the government was also concerned that AUO would not
keep its promise to invest NT$400 billion in the Central Taiwan Science Park.

      <P>Taiwan is prepared to discuss a cultural agreement with China and hopes that the
issue can be put on the agenda for cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations next year, a
visiting Taiwanese official said in Los Angeles Friday.</P>
      <P>Similar to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in June, the
cultural pact will provide a framework for further negotiations on detailed
issues, according to Minister without Portfolio Ovid Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said "chances are high" that the planned agreement will be included on the
agenda of the semi-annual meeting between the chief negotiators of the two sides
next year.</P>
      <P>The agreement is expected to address problems that have emerged in cross-strait
cultural exchanges, such as copyright violations, patent protection  and the
establishment  of independent  film production companies, he said.</P>
      <P>The idea of a cross-strait cultural agreement was first raised by China's

      <P>The decisions reached at a meeting of the World Taekwondo Federation's (WTF)
disciplinary committee over the controversial disqualification of a Taiwanese
athlete at the recent 2010 Asian Games will be known Dec. 20 at the earliest, a
WTF official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The disciplinary committee has no authority to publicize the decision, which has
to be approved by the WTF President Choue Chung-won, WTF Secretary-General Yang
Jin-suk told the CNA before the start of the meeting.</P>
      <P>In turn, the WTF will directly inform the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association
(CTTA) of the outcome, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The athlete Yang Shu-chun, her coaches Liu Tsung-da and Liu Ching-wen, and CTTA
President Chen Chien-ping traveled to Seoul Friday for the meeting that was held
Saturday afternoon.</P>
      <P>At the building where the meeting was being held, the group was greeted by two
Taiwanese exchange students waving the ROC flag in a gesture of moral support.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the meeting was conducted in a cordial atmosphere and none of
the three attending committee members were from South Korea.</P>
      <P>He said Friday before the group's departure from Taiwan that the Sport Affairs
Council (SAC) and CTTA had agreed on a common position, which was that the
rights of the athletes, coaches, and association should be retained and they
should not be banned from competition.</P>
      <P>Yang was disqualified by officials of the Asian Taekwondo Union (ATU) during her
opening bout in the Asian Games women's under 49 kg division on Nov. 17, on
grounds that she was wearing two extra electronic sensors in her socks. At the
time, she was leading 9-0 in the match.</P>
      <P>Video footage of the match later showed that Yang had removed the two sensors
before the start of the bout. The ATU's accusation of Yang cheating sparked
outrage across Taiwan, and drove the SAC to lodge a protest with the Olympic
Council of Asia and to file an appeal with the international Court of
Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Huge demand forecast for elderly friendly home environment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's rapid advancement toward becoming an aging society will create a huge
demand not just for medical care, but also for a safe home environment for the
elderly, according to a real estate agency.</P>
      <P>"The concept of creating  an elderly friendly  residential environment is still
in its infancy in Taiwan, " said Bright Lee, a spokesman for Evertrust Rehouse
Co., in a statement issued Friday.</P>
      <P>However, as the society ages, public awareness of this issue will rise and home
facilities for the elderly, from bathroom to balcony, will be seen as essential,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the market demand for such facilities is likely to grow very
fast," he added.</P>
      <P>The over-65 population in Taiwan is more than 2.3 million, or nearly 11 percent
of the total population, according to figures for 2010 compiled by the Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>In 20 years, the number of people in that age group will surge to 5.73 million,
or 24 percent of the country's 23 million population, the CEPD has forecast.</P>
      <P>Lee said the steep rise in the number of elderly people in the country, coupled
with the disabled population that now stands at 1 million, will drive demand for
facilities geared toward creating a more convenient home environment for that
demographic.</P>
      <P>A recent survey conducted by the real estate agency found that 60 percent of
people would prefer to live at home on their own when they grow old, while 15.33
percent would choose a nursing home or an assisted living complex.</P>
      <P>That will translate into a market of 4 million people requiring special
residential facilities in 20 years, the agency forecast.</P>
      <P>The value of this market will amount to NT$3 trillion (US$100 billion) if each
household spends NT$850,000 on renovations, Lee estimated.</P>
      <P>The NT$850,000 figure was drawn from a recent experimental project by the Taipei
City government to convert a small apartment into a home specially designed for
the elderly or disabled.</P>
      <P>The city government plans to expand the project soon to 50 apartments in public
housing complexes, at a total cost of NT$50 million.</P>

      <P>The Tainan District Prosecutors Office rejected Saturday an allegation by Tainan
County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih that it was discriminating against politicians in

allegedly soliciting NT$100 million in bribes from a construction company that
planned to bid for work in the Southern Taiwan Science Park development project.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors raided Su's residence Friday and questioned him for hours before

      <P>The magistrate reacted with a strong protest, saying that the judiciary was
targeting green politicians while sparing those from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>He also accused the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou of persecuting
green politicians to boost Ma's chances of re-election in 2012.</P>
      <P>In response,  the prosecutors  office released a statement Saturday, saying that
it is concerned with whether there are irregularities and finding supporting
evidence, rather than with the political affiliation of those involved.</P>
      <P>The office said that the truth will either be black or white, rather than green
or blue, and it urged Su not to overreact.</P>

      <P>Taiwan ranked ninth among 40 economies that have improved their ease of payment
in the past year, according to an annual study released Saturday that measured
the ease of paying taxes in 183 economies around the world.</P>
      <P>Steve Go, head of the tax and legal services department of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Taiwan, attributed the result to the government's
efforts to slash the Corporate Income Tax to 17 percent from 20 percent, and to
streamline tax reporting procedures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China were the only two Asian economies on the list of the 10 most
improved countries in terms of ease of paying taxes, Go noted.</P>
      <P>Tunisia topped the list, according to the Paying Taxes 2011 report.</P>
      <P>The report, which was jointly compiled by PwC, the World Bank and the
International Finance Cooperation (IFC) , measures the ease of paying taxes by
assessing the administrative burden for companies to comply with tax
regulations, and by calculating companies' total tax liability as a percentage
of pre-tax profits.</P>
      <P>"Taxes on company profits have fallen each year as governments around the world
have reduced their corporate tax rates in an effort to encourage business
investment and stimulate growth, " said Susan Symons of PwC UK.</P>
      <P>The 2011 report concluded that nearly 60 percent of the world's economies have
made significant business regulatory changes to make it easier to pay taxes,
despite the impact of the global financial crisis and the sluggish economic
recovery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overall ranking for ease of paying taxes stood at 87th, ahead of Japan
at 112th and China at 114th.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan lagged far behind Hong Kong and Singapore, which ranked third
and fourth, respectively.</P>

      <P>Two units of a Taiwan Academy will be inaugurated in Los Angeles and Houston
next spring to present the country's culture to the American people, Minister
Without Porfolio Ovid Tzeng said Friday.</P>
      <P>The units in the two U.S. cities are the first two that Taiwan will set up
overseas, and their opening will coincide with the start of the Republic of
China's centennial celebrations in January 2011, said Tzeng.</P>
      <P>Through a digital collection of resources at the academy, the government will
show Taiwan's vigor, beauty and diversity to the U.S. people and allow them to
really "see" Taiwan, said Tzeng, who arrived here earlier in the day to promote
Taiwan's 100th anniversary celebrations.</P>
      <P>In response to a question on whether the Taiwan Academy was set up to counter
the influence of China's Confucius Institute abroad, Tzeng said the two
establishments have different purposes.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Academy will focus mainly on spreading Taiwan's culture overseas,
while the Confucius Institute aims at teaching Mandarin to non-Chinese people,
he said.</P>
      <P>Touching on a possible controversy over the traditional Chinese characters used
in Taiwan and the simplified Chinese characters adopted by China, Tzeng said it
is essential to learn traditional characters in order to grasp the essence of
Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>The use of traditional characters is an indispensable tool to pass on the
culture to younger generations, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars had mixed feelings about the development of human rights and democracy
in China Saturday but agreed that Taiwan could serve as a good example and
should do more for its neighbor across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Various signs showed that some high level officials within the Communist Party
of China (CCP) were ready for the introduction of judicial and human rights
reforms, but it all came down to the top leader and the implementation of the
law, said Jerome Cohen, Co-director of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute of the New
York University School of Law.</P>
      <P>Cohen, a respected law professor who had spent decades observing Taiwan and
China, made the comments in a symposium on China's human rights development,
organized by Taipei Bar Association, Lei Chen Human Rights Foundation and Hong
Kong-based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group.</P>
      <P>The Chinese leaders always said they supported human rights, but the human
rights  they  supported  were  ones with  "Chinese characteristics, " which were
different from the Western standards, Cohen said.</P>
      <P>"I always advised them that Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have all overcome the
odds (when promoting human rights)," he said, adding "History is not an excuse
for violating human rights."</P>
      <P>A self-proclaimed optimist, Cohen said he could not afford to be too optimistic
about China's future human rights development before China's political system
changes because "within the CCP, it's very hard to tell the real thinking and
mindset of the Chinese leader before he seizes the complete power."</P>
      <P>Cohen, who met President Ma Ying-jeou -- his student at Harvard University in
the 1970s -- yesterday,  also said "the Taiwan government should not avoid
talking with China about human rights issues".</P>
      <P>Taiwan should demand protection of Taiwanese businessmen in China since now the
cross-strait negotiations have touched upon the human safety issues, he said,
referring to the recently stalled talks of a bilateral investment protection
agreement.</P>
      <P>Hsu Szu-chien, a researcher at Academia Sinica, urged Taiwan's non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to partner with their Chinese counterparts in offering
assistance and sharing experiences.</P>
      <P>Hsu also called on authorities on both sides of the strait to launch a human
rights dialogue, saying that the move would be helpful to China's grassroot
human rights and democracy movement.</P>
      <P>"It seems to me that the power of a rising China grows stronger every day. But
at the same time, its moral position keeps falling back, " Hsu said, because it
can no longer persuade its people with the same excuses and the people of China
no longer believe everything the government says.</P>
      <P>"What will happen to China in the future? I don't know, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"I see the potential and momentum right there. What Taiwan can do is to help the
Chinese society to be ready for the moment when opportunities come, " he said.</P>

      <P>Two solo exhibitions that are now being held in Taiwan, featuring the paintings
and video installation art of Chinese artists Yang Na and Mu Lei, give visitors
an insight into how China's younger generation sees itself, the Museum of
Contemporary Art (MOCA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yang and Mu, both under the age of 30, are known for their distinguishing styles
in contemporary Chinese art, MOCA Director Shih Jui-cheng said in Taipei
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yang's paintings often portray a character called "Nana," who has a pair of big
enchanting eyes, the nose of a dog, full lips and perfect make-up, shih said.</P>
      <P>"Nana" is the embodiment of an aesthetic image reflected among the younger
generations in Asia, Yang explained.</P>
      <P>In Asia, including China, girls, women and even young men, are constantly trying
to make their eyes look bigger and their face prettier -- a monotone that is
contrary to natural beauty, she said.</P>
      <P>Yang said she painted a dog's nose on Nana because many young girls,
particularly in China, can "acutely smell" how to get what they want by acting
cute and using their beautiful looks.</P>
      <P>She said for people in China who were born in the 1980s and 1990s and grew up
during the country's rapid economic expansion, life is relatively comfortable.
As an artist, Yang said, she would like to portray the characteristics of the
people of her time.</P>
      <P>"It would be pretentious to say that the younger artists in China still live in
agony in order to create," she said.</P>
      <P>Mu, on the other hand, said that as a contemporary artist, innovation always
comes first.</P>
      <P>While painting is a good way to express one's thoughts and show one's
techniques, he said, he has now extended his creativity to video installation
and animation.</P>
      <P>In the exhibition hall where his work is on display, visitors are invited to sit
on four toilet seats while their images are projected onto a screen along with
pictures of helicopters and bombs.</P>
      <P>"Sitting on the toilet in front of others satisfies our secret desire to become
the objects of a voyeur's peeking," he said.</P>
      <P>The two solo exhibitions will be held at MOCA until Jan. 23, 2011.</P>

      <P>The first probable human case of mad cow disease in Taiwan was listed
posthumously Saturday, following the death in May of a man who had symptoms of
the fatal brain-wasting illness.</P>
      <P>The listing was made after officials and experts on a Department of Health (DOH)
panel on Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) held a meeting to determine whether the
man had died from the disease as result of eating infected beef.</P>
      <P>"We believe it is very likely that the man who died in May this year contracted
the disease during his stay in the United Kingdom, " the DOH said in a press
statement. "We cannot rule out the possibility that he ate infected beef during
that time."</P>
      <P>Scientists believe that many years after eating cattle infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) , commonly known as mad cow disease, humans can
develop symptoms of new variant CJD (vCJD) , also known as human mad cow
disease.</P>
      <P>The 36-year-old man had lived in the U.K. between 1989 and 1997, when mad cow
disease was at its peak in that country. He began to show vCJD symptoms,
including memory loss and hypersomnia, in 2008. Doctors reported the case to the
DOH's Centers for Disease Control in March 2009.</P>
      <P>As his family refused to give doctors permission to perform an autopsy, the DOH
said, it could not list the patient as a confirmed case of vCJD. His body has
since been cremated.</P>
      <P>Though the cause of death could not be determined by means of an autopsy, it was
an extremely likely case of vCJD, based on the man's symptoms, travel history
and the results of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalograms, the DOH
said.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's CJD advisory panel, it was unlikely that the patient
contracted the disease in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"His death could be counted as an imported case of vCJD and unlikely to pose any
threat to Taiwan's disease control network," the DOH statement said.</P>
      <P>Citing its tracking records, the DOH said the man had donated blood to two
patients 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>"Neither of them has contracted the disease," the statement said, adding that
precautionary measures had been taken to prevent any spread of the disease
during the time the man was hospitalized in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the World Health Organization, CJD is a fatal human degenerative
condition characterized by progressive brain dysfunction and is categorized into
four forms -- sporadic, familial, iatrogenic and variant.</P>
      <P>The UK Department of Health has said vCJD differs from CJD in that the former is
more likely to strike younger people.</P>
      <P>Since 1997 when the DOH set up a CJD reporting and monitoring system, 436
suspected CJD or vCJD have been reported in Taiwan, DOH figures show. Of that
number, 246 were listed as possible or extremely possible cases of sporadic or
familial forms of CJD, five were confirmed as traditional forms of CJD and one
was listed as probable vCJD, according to the DOH tallies.</P>
      <P>The others were ruled out as possible cases of CJD.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Tackling campus bullying professionally</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/19/10  15:04:10
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Building a professional support and monitoring network with the participation of
parents, school authorities, social workers and the police is the only way to
tackle campus bullying.</P>
      <P>Dr. Dan Olweus, a pioneer researcher on issues associated with bullying, defined
the problem as a school child being exposed to the negative behaviors of his or
her peers repeatedly and over time.</P>
      <P>Most often, bullying involves a single victim and several perpetrators.
Therefore, parents should not only worry about their children being victims but
also perpetrators of school violence.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has been considering a "school bullying
prevention law" that would mandate isolation of school bullies. The idea was
raised in the wake of a recent string of shocking incidents such as students
being beaten up, forced to take nude photos, and gang-raped. The violent acts
were even posted online by the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>According to an MOE survey of 100,000 junior high school students around the
country, 3.23 percent have been beaten by their peers and 1.3 percent have been
victims of extortion. Verbal violence and cyber bullying excluded, some 50,000
junior high students in Taiwan have been victims of bullying, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, only a few cases had been reported via campus safety channels,
probably because many schools were unaware of the bullying problem or had never
dealt with it.</P>
      <P>Just like domestic violence, campus bullying is a public issue that requires the
effort of all related sectors of society to address the problem. Taiwan society
should not leave the resolution of such incidents up to the victims and
perpetrators. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 19, 2010)</P>

      <P>The Changhua County government has decided to extend its child birth subsidy for
another year as the policy has proved effective in boosting the birth rate in

      <P>Married Changhua residents and single women over the age of 20 are eligible to
apply for the subsidy, once one of the baby's parents has household registration
in the county and has lived there for more than a year. It is required that the
newborn be registered in Changhua as well. The subsidy, which will continue in
2011, is NT$10, 000 (US$335) per newborn.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A team in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) is eyeing Taiwanese pitcher Pan
Wei-lun, as he is now free to join professional baseball teams abroad after
playing professionally at home for over six years, according to a South Korean
media report.</P>
      <P>KBO East  team  SK has contacted  Pan's  team in Taiwan, Uni-President Lions, to
inquire about the right-hander's contract, it was reported in Sports Chosun.</P>
      <P>Pan has been playing with Uni-President Lions, one of the teams in Taiwan's
Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , for eight years.</P>
      <P>SK is highly interested in recruiting Pan, but if the cost of trading him is too
high, it could prove an obstacle, according to the reporter surnamed Park.</P>
      <P>Although  the transfer fee would be about NT$15.3 million (US$510,000), there is
a good chance he would be traded to SK, as the team had not yet renewed the
contracts of its two foreign players, Ken Kadokura and Gary Glover, Park said.</P>
      <P>The deadline for SK to renew the two contracts is Dec. 31, Park said.</P>
      <P>According to CPBL regulations, SK would have to pay Uni-President Lions a
transfer fee of 2.5 times of Pan's current annual salary of NT$6.12 million and
start Pan at an annual salary of 1.5 times his most recent pay with Uni-
President Lions.</P>
      <P>According to Park,  an SK official in charge of business operations visited
Taiwan last week and told the Korean media upon return that "there is room for
Uni-President Lions to lower the transfer fee."</P>
      <P>However, Uni-President Lions' President Chen Cheng-nan said that speculations on
a lower transfer fee were groundless and the club would follow CPBL regulations
on Pan's release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President recalls being labeled 'Red Guard' along with Lee Huan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday when he worked under then Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary General Lee Huan, both of them were branded as "Red Guards" because
they were trying to push for major political reforms.</P>
      <P>At a memorial for Lee, who died on Dec. 2 at the age of 93, Ma reflected on the
days when the late KMT leader and government official was his boss.</P>
      <P>Their main duties at the time were to prepare for the lifting of the martial
law, to allow for the formation of political parties, and to replace a whole
generation of National Assembly members, Ma recalled.</P>
      <P>Because the last task would affect many senior politicians, Ma said, he and Lee
were criticized and labeled "Red Guards." The name was drawn from the forces
unleashed by Mao Zedong of China to purge his political enemies during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</P>
      <P>Ma praised Lee as having contributed greatly to the process of retiring senior
members of the National Assembly, amending the Constitution and pushing through
other political reforms.</P>
      <P>Acting on a directive by then President Chiang Ching-kuo, Lee also worked to
cultivate in particular Taiwan-born political talent, which was a major
achievement that helped "build energy" for further development, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to illustrate Lee 's important role in helping to achieve the
Republic of China's transition to democracy," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president issued a special citation in honor of Lee, which was accepted by
Lee Ching -chung, Lee's eldest son.</P>
      <P>Lee was born in Hubei province, the Republic of China, on Sept. 24, 1917. In
addition to his KMT party posts, he served as education minister and premier
before retiring.</P>
      <P>Honoring his wishes for no altars, public mourning, condolence committees,
obituaries or funeral services, his children held a "non-funeral service"
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although it was an informal gathering, it was attended by a number of prominent
politicians, including Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Examination Yuan
President John Kuan, KMT Honorary Chairmen Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung and New
Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he hopes Taiwan will take the lead in the
promotion of Chinese culture and the use of traditional Chinese characters amid
a worldwide trend of learning Mandarin.</P>
      <P>The president said he is committed to the preservation of traditional Chinese
characters and expects Taiwan to play a leading role in this regard.</P>
      <P>"I have always wanted to make school campuses more international and make Taiwan
a global educational center in East Asia, " the president said at an Annual
Conference of Teaching Chinese as a Second Language in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese characters are the essence of the culture and should be
preserved and passed down to future generations, he said.</P>
      <P>However,  currently  only 40 million people worldwide  use traditional
characters, while 1.3 billion use simplified Chinese, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that China, which officially uses simplified Chinese, should push for
reading ability in traditional Chinese even if it maintains simplified
characters for writing.</P>
      <P>The president also asked the Ministry of Education to encourage more
universities to establish institutions or departments to train Chinese teachers.</P>
      <P>About 450 people, including Chinese teaching professionals and students,
attended the conference at Fujen Catholic University.</P>

      <P>Academic department mergers at tertiary institutions in Taiwan will be
unavoidable as the number of high school graduates continues to decline due to a
steadily falling birth rate in the country, an educator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The merger trend is likely to escalate in about four to six years time,
according to Victor W. Liu, chairman of the non-profit Higher Education
Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Department mergers are expected to peak between 2015 and 2017 when Taiwanese
children who were born in 1998 will be entering college," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The number of babies born in 1998 was 60,000 fewer than the previous year, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>In addition  to poor  academic  performance  and lack  of accreditation,
Taiwan's low birth rate has been a major contributing factor to the low
enrollment rate at colleges and universities, he said.</P>
      <P>However, commercialization and globalization could help Taiwan's tertiary
institutions to survive, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, further opening to international and Chinese  students
could help academic  departments  to remain operational, he said.</P>

      <P>An Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) that Taiwan and China have been planning
is expected to be formed soon, with a vice minister from each side acting as co-
convener, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials, who asked not to be named, said the announcement will be made at
the meeting between the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), which will be held Monday to
Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Kuo-hsin Liang and China's
Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei are expected to jointly head the
committee.</P>
      <P>It will be formed in accordance with the Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) that was signed by the chiefs of the SEF and ARATS in
Chongqing, China in June.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait ECC will be composed of seven panels that will deal
respectively with commodities trade, service trade, financial services,
intellectual property rights, economic cooperation, dispute settlement, and
investment, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The panels will be headed by government bureau or department executives. For
instance, on the Taiwan side, the commodity trade panel will be headed by Bureau
of Foreign Trade Director-General Bill Cho,  while  the IPR  panel  will  be led
by Wang  Mei-hua, director-general of the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Intellectual Property Office, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The heads of the panels will be called "conveners," while the ECC leaders will
act as "general conveners" under the framework of the SEF and ARATS, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The deputy heads of the SEF and ARATS will be named chairpersons of the ECC, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his ARATS counterpart Chen Yunlin will meet for
a sixth round of formal talks Monday. An advance team, led by ARATS Vice
President Zheng Lizhong, arrived in Taiwan Sunday to prepare for the Chiang-Chen
talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to sign a medical and health cooperation agreement
and announce the formation of the ECC. The agreement will be the 15th signed
between the two sides since 2008, when cross-strait  relations saw marked
improvement  after the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou on May 20.</P>
      <P>With the approach of Jan.1, 2011 when an "early harvest" list of products will
begin enjoying preferential tariffs under the ECFA, the ECC is seen as necessary
to facilitate working-level talks on the implementation,  interpretation and
coordination of ECFA-related business.</P>
      <P>Also, the ECC panels are expected to do the follow-up work on commodity trade,
services trade, dispute settlement and investment protection, which means the
two sides would want the committee to be in place before the end of 2010.</P>

    <DATELINE>12/19/10  20:15:07
(Dec.19, 2010)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tommy Yen-po Chen, an ultra marathon runner from Taiwan, placed second in a
100-kilometer ultra marathon race in the South Pole Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen finished in a time of 15:15:58, becoming the first Asian to ever complete
the grueling race.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Chen, 24, fighting the freezing cold, frostbite and a sprained ankle, made
history in the ultra marathon just three days after completing a 42-km marathon
in the South Pole.</P>
      <P>"I just want the whole world to know how brave Taiwan is," he said.</P>
      <P>The Antarctic Ice Marathon presented a truly formidable and genuine Antarctic
challenge, with underfoot conditions comprising snow and ice throughout, an
average wind chill temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the possibility
of strong Katabatic winds -- winds that blows down a slope because of gravity.</P>
      <P>The climax of the marathon, the Antarctic 100-km ultra race, is reserved for
only the toughest of endurance athletes.</P>
      <P>Six athletes -- five men and one woman -- started the race, but one dropped out
halfway through. Brazilian Bernardo Fonseca, 33, finished first in a time of 12:
41: 52, while the only female, 24-year-old Clare Apps of the United Kingdom,
finished in third place in a time of 18:58:19.</P>
      <P>Chen has won marathons in Japan and Canada and finished third in the 600 km
Polar Challenge in 2008. He placed fourth in the 2009 Himalayan 160-km Stage
Race and third in the 2010 North Pole Marathon.</P>
      <P>He has set an Asian record of running the North and South Pole marathon within
nine months of each other, and has become the first Taiwanese to carry the
Republic of China's flag in the North and South Poles.</P>
      <P>Chen's mentor, Pan Jui-keng, recalled that Chen was the only one that could
withstand the rigors of helping to prepare Kevin Lin, another legendary
Taiwanese athlete, for a polar ultra marathon.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Antarctic Ice Marathon was first held in 2005. All the runners in the annual
event this year were required to train on the precarious terrain for at least
five days to acclimatize.</P>
      <P>Having completed races in the North and South poles as well in the Himalayan
region, Chen will head for Australia next March to take part in a 45-km run
through the Blue Mountains.</P>
      <P>Chen's parents usually worry about him whenever he is competing, but they know
they cannot keep him at home.</P>
      <P>Chen's father, Chen Pin, is a senior chiropractor. He is finding that his son's
reputation is quickly catching up with his.</P>
      <P>Chen's mother Lee Wan-ni said her son was raised by his grandmother in Yunlin,
south-central Taiwan, where he lived until five years ago. He developed a love
for nature and outdoor activities, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"He used to cry a lot when he was a child, but his personality changed after he
started training for marathons. He has become more adventurous and more
independent," she said. (Dec. 19, 2010)</P>

      <P>The only operational forest railway in Taiwan celebrated its 99th anniversary
Sunday with the resumption of service on a segment of line that was damaged
during a typhoon last year.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Forestry Area Administration hosted a party to mark the 99th
anniversary of the Alishan Forest Railway, which began service on Dec. 25, 1912.</P>
      <P>Railway enthusiasts and visitors flocked to Beimen Station, one of the stations
along the main line of the unique narrow-gauge railway, in Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Service on the section between Beimen and Jhuci Township in Chiayi County has
resumed, while the Zhushan and Divine Tree lines in the Alishan area have re-
opened, said Hu Sing-Hwa, deputy minister of the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The 71.4 km railway and three of its branch lines were badly damaged by Typhoon
Morakot last August. The other line has been closed since a devastating
earthquake in 1999.</P>
      <P>The forest administration hopes to extend service to Fenchihu, one of the 15
stops on the route, by next March, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The railway was constructed initially to transport wood from the mountains but
is now used for recreational purposes, carrying passengers to the popular
Alishan resort.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hope remains for a democratic China: Chinese dissident</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite China's impressive economic boom in recent years, most people in the
communist country are still yearning for democracy because no amount of wealth
can satisfy people's hunger for basic freedom, said Chinese social activist and
dissident Wang Dan on Sunday during a lecture in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wang, a leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square student freedom movement, said
while there are no visible indications that China is becoming democratic, he
still has high hopes for its eventual democratization because the younger
generation is becoming more aware of equality and human rights.</P>
      <P>"I am optimistic about the future of China," Wang told a group of young social
activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong. "Much of what we see in China now is
nothing but a facade because the entire social structure  is based  on lies
since  that is the only way a post-authoritarian regime like China can sustain
itself."</P>
      <P>The fact that China has a huge exodus of talent each year means that many
overseas Chinese understand that an economically advanced China without the
protections of basic freedom and human dignity is simply not enough, he said.</P>
      <P>"If you can sit down and really talk with a Chinese student, he will most likely
tell you that he wants democracy," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang was an initiator of the 1989 student protest in Beijing that was squelched
by the Chinese army in a bloody crackdown. He was imprisoned and arrested
several times for leading various democratic movements in China before his
eventual exile to the U.S. in 1998.</P>
      <P>He obtained a doctorate degree from Harvard University and now teaches Chinese
history at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>He told the audience Sunday that to be a social activist, one cannot be afraid
of loneliness or failure.</P>
      <P>"We can never predict the exact direction of the society, therefore, much of
what we do as activists might not prevail as we would wish, but we must be
prepared for failures, he said. "Knowing that you might not succeed should never
prevent you from trying."</P>
      <P>Wang also urged the young social activists to maintain a tight network with
other like-minded groups "so that when the time comes, you will be able to move
at a quick and synchronized pace."</P>

      <P>An exiled Chinese dissident urged Taiwan's leading opposition party Sunday to
pay more attention to the views of academics in the formulation of its China
policy and to have greater engagement with China's civic society..</P>
      <P>"The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should listen more closely to the
opinions in academic circles instead of only those in its inner circle," said
Wang Dan, who was one of the student leaders in the 1989 Tiananmen Square
protest.</P>
      <P>The DPP would have a better chance of winning  the 2012 presidential election if
it developed a sound policy to maintain cross-Taiwan Strait ties, said Wang, who
is currently a visiting assistant professor at Taiwan's National Tsing Hua
University.</P>
      <P>Wang said people in academic circles often come up with good ideas that can be
valuable to policy makers in both the DPP and ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Wang and former DPP Legislator Luo Wen-jia will jointly set up the cross-strait
democracy and culture offices in both Taipei and New York primarily to push for
the establishment of a platform to facilitate private sector dialogue between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>In response to a reporter's question on whether the office will advise DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to visit China, Wang said that is an issue the DPP
itself should assess.</P>
      <P>However,  he said, "it's better to initiate some kind of engagement than to have
none."</P>
      <P>If Tsai decided to visit China, one of the issues would be whom she should meet
there, he said.</P>
      <P>It would be somewhat narrow-minded if she met only with Chinese officials or
ranking members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) , he said.</P>
      <P>"Tsai should meet with people in China's civic society, " he suggested.</P>
      <P>Luo said the DPP should seek closer engagement with China, particularly beyond
the Chinese government and the CPC.</P>
      <P>Luo said the cross-strait private-sector dialogue platform that the offices are
aiming to set up will be completely different from a DPP think-tank and it will
not be influenced by elections or people in high office.</P>
      <P>One of its tasks will be to change the DPP's anti-China image -- the perception
that the party has a closed-door policy toward China and refuses to engage with
Beijing, Luo said.</P>
      <P>It will also seek to lead the DPP toward closer engagements with China's civic
society as means of better understanding the Chinese people and propagating the
DPP's ideals, he added.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he hopes there will be many more Sun Yun-
suans in government, who will dedicate themselves to serving the people well.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a Sun Yun-suan Foundation ceremony at which two
outstanding public functionaries were each awarded NT$1 million and plaque in
recognition of their outstanding contributions.</P>
      <P>This is the 15th year the foundation has honored outstanding public
functionaries in the spirit of the former premier who many said missed the
chance to become president or vice president of the Republic of China due to a
stroke. Sun passed away in 2006 at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>Calling the award winners "Little Sun Yun-suans, " Ma said they are clean,
competent and amicable officials who can help speed up the progress of the
country.</P>
      <P>Noting that some of the previous  41 winners have become ministers, Ma said the
award is not merely an incentive but an indicator that the winners have great
prospects.</P>
      <P>Public authority in the hands of government officials is a double-edged sword
that can cut both ways -- it can promote national development, but it can also
hurt the people, the president said.</P>
      <P>Reiterating his favorite quote that power corrupts, Ma said an official could
make a decision that he or she would regret for the rest of his/her life and
that an inadvertent decision could cause the nation's institutions to collapse
and could deeply disappoint the people.</P>
      <P>This year's awards went to a railway engineering department executive and a
local hospital deputy manager.</P>
      <P>Wu Sheng-yuan, director of the Department of Southern Taiwan Engineering
Projects under the Ministry of Communications  and Transportation, has been in
charge of many projects in Taipei and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Wu has worked for more than 20 years on a Taiwan Railway project in Sungshan,
Taipei and a major project to integrate railway, high-speed rail, mass rapid
transit systems and a highway system into a transportation hub.</P>
      <P>The other winner, Deputy Director Lee Hsin-min of the Yuli Hospital in Hualien
County,  earned the prize because of his dedication to improving health care for
mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>The hospital, under his management, has treated 2,555 mentally ill patients from
25 counties and cities around the island, and has helped other medical
institutions to handle emergency cases involving such patients.</P>

      <P>For the first time in Taiwan, an exhibition that featured specially designed

      <P>On display are hundreds of devices that can be used at home to help the disabled
manage their daily lives more independently, according to the real estate agency
Evertrust Rehouse Co., that organized the event.</P>
      <P>One of the inventions, a hoist, enables wheelchair users to get up and down
stairs by themselves. Another one is a computer controller with an eyeball
detector that allows the disabled to select items on the screen simply by
staring at them.</P>
      <P>"If the disabled can take care of themselves independently, they will feel more
confident and more valuable, " said Sleeve Yu, a disabled woman who was invited
to speak at the event.</P>
      <P>Yu was a travel agency employee and a part-time model before she was diagnosed
with a mysterious disease in 1998 that rendered her unable to walk. She said she
spent a year and a half crying at home but finally came to realize the
importance of learning to deal with her disability.</P>
      <P>Yu said she was pleased to see that many people were willing to come forward
with creative ideas like those on display at the fair, which would make life
more convenient for the disabled.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes it is just a small and simple idea, but it is what we most need," she
added.</P>
      <P>The fair is being held December 16-19 at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September there were 1.07 million disabled people in Taiwan,

      <P>A six-year-old boy started to cry in mid-way through a marathon race in Taipei
Sunday, telling reporters at the finishing line that "it was no fun, because it
was too far."</P>
      <P>The child, surnamed Wu, caught media attention as he ran with adult runners all
around him.</P>
      <P>As he passed the mid-way point, he suddenly cried out loud because of pain in
his knees. However, he stayed on course to finish the 42.195-km run, winning big

      <P>Though he said it was "no fun," he nodded his head in response to a media

      <P>The boy's brilliant performance drew mixed comments from experts, with a

would affect his physical development.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-cheng, secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Track and Field
Association, said though the boy's tough will is laudable, "from my professional
point of view, I think 15 years of age would be a better time to start marathon
run."</P>
      <P>Chen Heng-hua, secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association
which sponsored the Fubon Marathon Run 2010, agreed that marathon was not good
for six-year-olds.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not encourage kids to run for the prize money. Wu, who loves
to run just for fun, has actually passed the 9-km and 21-km tests before joining
the 42-km race, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min, chief executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation,
urged parents to get a grasp of their kids' physical limits and watch out for
possible sports injuries.</P>
      <P>"If a child shows pains or feels unwell during a long run, parents should not
allow him to finish the whole race; rather, he should be given enough time to
take a break," Wang said.</P>
      <P>As usual, the championships of the Taipei marathon race went to foreign runners.
Kenya's Yusuf Chango Chebii Songoka clocked 2:14: 04 to win the top prize in
men's division and the top woman runner was Yeshi Esayias Tesemma of Ethiopia,
who finished the race with 2:30:37, 32 seconds more than her own record last
year.</P>
      <P>Tesemma thus missed a chance to win NT$1.5 million in "record breaking prize"
and settled for the NT$1 million champion award.</P>
      <P>The best local runners are Wu Wen-chien, whose 2:26:00 record won him the 8th
place, which gave him NT$30,000 plus NT$200,000 as "Taiwan champion;" and Hsu
Yu-fang, who was also placed the 8th, in women's division, with 2:54:32.</P>
      <P>A whopping 31,000 people registered to join the race, including 1500 foreigners
from 47 countries. If the participants of the 3-km amateur run are counted, a
total of 110,000 people joined in Sunday's round the city run. enditem nnnn</P>

      <P>The Changhua County government has decided to extend its child birth subsidy for
another year as the policy has proved effective in boosting the birth rate in
the county.</P>
      <P>Married Changhua residents and single women over the age of 20 are eligible to
apply for the subsidy, once one of the baby's parents has household registration
in the county and has lived there for more than a year. It is required that the
newborn be registered in Changhua as well. The subsidy, which will continue in
2011, is NT$10, 000 (US$335) per newborn.</P>
      <P>The number of newborns in the county increased by 99 year-on-year after the
government extended the subsidies from low-income families to all residents in
2009, statistics showed.</P>

      <P>A team in the Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) is eyeing Taiwanese pitcher Pan
Wei-lun, as he is now free to join professional baseball teams abroad after
playing professionally at home for over six years, according to a South Korean
media report.</P>
      <P>KBO East  team  SK has contacted  Pan's  team in Taiwan, Uni-President Lions, to
inquire about the right-hander's contract, it was reported in Sports Chosun.</P>
      <P>Pan has been playing with Uni-President Lions, one of the teams in Taiwan's
Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , for eight years.</P>
      <P>SK is highly interested in recruiting Pan, but if the cost of trading him is too
high, it could prove an obstacle, according to the reporter surnamed Park.</P>
      <P>Although  the transfer fee would be about NT$15.3 million (US$510,000), there is
a good chance he would be traded to SK, as the team had not yet renewed the
contracts of its two foreign players, Ken Kadokura and Gary Glover, Park said.</P>
      <P>The deadline for SK to renew the two contracts is Dec. 31, Park said.</P>
      <P>According to CPBL regulations, SK would have to pay Uni-President Lions a
transfer fee of 2.5 times of Pan's current annual salary of NT$6.12 million and
start Pan at an annual salary of 1.5 times his most recent pay with Uni-
President Lions.</P>
      <P>According to Park,  an SK official in charge of business operations visited
Taiwan last week and told the Korean media upon return that "there is room for
Uni-President Lions to lower the transfer fee."</P>
      <P>However, Uni-President Lions' President Chen Cheng-nan said that speculations on
a lower transfer fee were groundless and the club would follow CPBL regulations
on Pan's release.</P>
      <P>Pan, 28, who has been with Uni-President Lions from 2003-2010, has been playing
international games since he turned 14. He is currently the highest-paid local
player in Taiwan, but has never joined a foreign team before.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday when he worked under then Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary General Lee Huan, both of them were branded as "Red Guards" because
they were trying to push for major political reforms.</P>
      <P>At a memorial for Lee, who died on Dec. 2 at the age of 93, Ma reflected on the
days when the late KMT leader and government official was his boss.</P>
      <P>Their main duties at the time were to prepare for the lifting of the martial
law, to allow for the formation of political parties, and to replace a whole
generation of National Assembly members, Ma recalled.</P>
      <P>Because the last task would affect many senior politicians, Ma said, he and Lee
were criticized and labeled "Red Guards." The name was drawn from the forces
unleashed by Mao Zedong of China to purge his political enemies during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</P>
      <P>Ma praised Lee as having contributed greatly to the process of retiring senior
members of the National Assembly, amending the Constitution and pushing through
other political reforms.</P>
      <P>Acting on a directive by then President Chiang Ching-kuo, Lee also worked to
cultivate in particular Taiwan-born political talent, which was a major
achievement that helped "build energy" for further development, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"It is necessary to illustrate Lee 's important role in helping to achieve the
Republic of China's transition to democracy," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president issued a special citation in honor of Lee, which was accepted by
Lee Ching -chung, Lee's eldest son.</P>
      <P>Lee was born in Hubei province, the Republic of China, on Sept. 24, 1917. In
addition to his KMT party posts, he served as education minister and premier
before retiring.</P>
      <P>Honoring his wishes for no altars, public mourning, condolence committees,
obituaries or funeral services, his children held a "non-funeral service"
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although it was an informal gathering, it was attended by a number of prominent
politicians, including Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng, Examination Yuan
President John Kuan, KMT Honorary Chairmen Lien Chan and Wu Po-hsiung and New
Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he hopes Taiwan will take the lead in the
promotion of Chinese culture and the use of traditional Chinese characters amid
a worldwide trend of learning Mandarin.</P>
      <P>The president said he is committed to the preservation of traditional Chinese
characters and expects Taiwan to play a leading role in this regard.</P>
      <P>"I have always wanted to make school campuses more international and make Taiwan
a global educational center in East Asia, " the president said at an Annual
Conference of Teaching Chinese as a Second Language in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Traditional Chinese characters are the essence of the culture and should be
preserved and passed down to future generations, he said.</P>
      <P>However,  currently  only 40 million people worldwide  use traditional
characters, while 1.3 billion use simplified Chinese, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that China, which officially uses simplified Chinese, should push for
reading ability in traditional Chinese even if it maintains simplified
characters for writing.</P>
      <P>The president also asked the Ministry of Education to encourage more
universities to establish institutions or departments to train Chinese teachers.</P>
      <P>About 450 people, including Chinese teaching professionals and students,

      <P>Academic department mergers at tertiary institutions in Taiwan will be
unavoidable as the number of high school graduates continues to decline due to a
steadily falling birth rate in the country, an educator said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The merger trend is likely to escalate in about four to six years time,
according to Victor W. Liu, chairman of the non-profit Higher Education
Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Department mergers are expected to peak between 2015 and 2017 when Taiwanese
children who were born in 1998 will be entering college," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The number of babies born in 1998 was 60,000 fewer than the previous year, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>In addition  to poor  academic  performance  and lack  of accreditation,
Taiwan's low birth rate has been a major contributing factor to the low
enrollment rate at colleges and universities, he said.</P>
      <P>However, commercialization and globalization could help Taiwan's tertiary
institutions to survive, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, further opening to international and Chinese  students
could help academic  departments  to remain operational, he said.</P>

      <P>An Economic Cooperation Committee (ECC) that Taiwan and China have been planning
is expected to be formed soon, with a vice minister from each side acting as co-
convener, officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials, who asked not to be named, said the announcement will be made at
the meeting between the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), which will be held Monday to
Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Kuo-hsin Liang and China's
Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei are expected to jointly head the
committee.</P>
      <P>It will be formed in accordance with the Economic Cooperation Framework
Agreement (ECFA) that was signed by the chiefs of the SEF and ARATS in
Chongqing, China in June.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait ECC will be composed of seven panels that will deal
respectively with commodities trade, service trade, financial services,
intellectual property rights, economic cooperation, dispute settlement, and
investment, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The panels will be headed by government bureau or department executives. For
instance, on the Taiwan side, the commodity trade panel will be headed by Bureau
of Foreign Trade Director-General Bill Cho,  while  the IPR  panel  will  be led
by Wang  Mei-hua, director-general of the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Intellectual Property Office, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>The heads of the panels will be called "conveners," while the ECC leaders will
act as "general conveners" under the framework of the SEF and ARATS, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The deputy heads of the SEF and ARATS will be named chairpersons of the ECC, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his ARATS counterpart Chen Yunlin will meet for
a sixth round of formal talks Monday. An advance team, led by ARATS Vice
President Zheng Lizhong, arrived in Taiwan Sunday to prepare for the Chiang-Chen
talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to sign a medical and health cooperation agreement
and announce the formation of the ECC. The agreement will be the 15th signed
between the two sides since 2008, when cross-strait  relations saw marked
improvement  after the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou on May 20.</P>
      <P>With the approach of Jan.1, 2011 when an "early harvest" list of products will
begin enjoying preferential tariffs under the ECFA, the ECC is seen as necessary
to facilitate working-level talks on the implementation,  interpretation and
coordination of ECFA-related business.</P>
      <P>Also, the ECC panels are expected to do the follow-up work on commodity trade,
services trade, dispute settlement and investment protection, which means the
two sides would want the committee to be in place before the end of 2010.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Tommy Yen-po Chen, an ultra marathon runner from Taiwan, placed second in a
100-kilometer ultra marathon race in the South Pole Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen finished in a time of 15:15:58, becoming the first Asian to ever complete
the grueling race.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Chen, 24, fighting the freezing cold, frostbite and a sprained ankle, made
history in the ultra marathon just three days after completing a 42-km marathon
in the South Pole.</P>
      <P>"I just want the whole world to know how brave Taiwan is," he said.</P>
      <P>The Antarctic Ice Marathon presented a truly formidable and genuine Antarctic
challenge, with underfoot conditions comprising snow and ice throughout, an
average wind chill temperature of minus 20 degrees Celsius, and the possibility
of strong Katabatic winds -- winds that blows down a slope because of gravity.</P>
      <P>The climax of the marathon, the Antarctic 100-km ultra race, is reserved for
only the toughest of endurance athletes.</P>
      <P>Six athletes -- five men and one woman -- started the race, but one dropped out
halfway through. Brazilian Bernardo Fonseca, 33, finished first in a time of 12:
41: 52, while the only female, 24-year-old Clare Apps of the United Kingdom,
finished in third place in a time of 18:58:19.</P>
      <P>Chen has won marathons in Japan and Canada and finished third in the 600 km
Polar Challenge in 2008. He placed fourth in the 2009 Himalayan 160-km Stage
Race and third in the 2010 North Pole Marathon.</P>
      <P>He has set an Asian record of running the North and South Pole marathon within
nine months of each other, and has become the first Taiwanese to carry the
Republic of China's flag in the North and South Poles.</P>
      <P>Chen's mentor, Pan Jui-keng, recalled that Chen was the only one that could
withstand the rigors of helping to prepare Kevin Lin, another legendary
Taiwanese athlete, for a polar ultra marathon.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Antarctic Ice Marathon was first held in 2005. All the runners in the annual
event this year were required to train on the precarious terrain for at least
five days to acclimatize.</P>
      <P>Having completed races in the North and South poles as well in the Himalayan
region, Chen will head for Australia next March to take part in a 45-km run
through the Blue Mountains.</P>
      <P>Chen's parents usually worry about him whenever he is competing, but they know
they cannot keep him at home.</P>
      <P>Chen's father, Chen Pin, is a senior chiropractor. He is finding that his son's
reputation is quickly catching up with his.</P>
      <P>Chen's mother Lee Wan-ni said her son was raised by his grandmother in Yunlin,
south-central Taiwan, where he lived until five years ago. He developed a love
for nature and outdoor activities, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"He used to cry a lot when he was a child, but his personality changed after he
started training for marathons. He has become more adventurous and more
independent," she said. (Dec. 19, 2010)</P>

      <P>The only operational forest railway in Taiwan celebrated its 99th anniversary
Sunday with the resumption of service on a segment of line that was damaged
during a typhoon last year.</P>

anniversary of the Alishan Forest Railway, which began service on Dec. 25, 1912.</P>
      <P>Railway enthusiasts and visitors flocked to Beimen Station, one of the stations
along the main line of the unique narrow-gauge railway, in Chiayi City.</P>
      <P>Service on the section between Beimen and Jhuci Township in Chiayi County has

      <P>The 71.4 km railway and three of its branch lines were badly damaged by Typhoon
Morakot last August. The other line has been closed since a devastating
earthquake in 1999.</P>
      <P>The forest administration hopes to extend service to Fenchihu, one of the 15

      <P>Despite China's impressive economic boom in recent years, most people in the
communist country are still yearning for democracy because no amount of wealth
can satisfy people's hunger for basic freedom, said Chinese social activist and
dissident Wang Dan on Sunday during a lecture in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wang, a leader during the 1989 Tiananmen Square student freedom movement, said
while there are no visible indications that China is becoming democratic, he
still has high hopes for its eventual democratization because the younger
generation is becoming more aware of equality and human rights.</P>
      <P>"I am optimistic about the future of China," Wang told a group of young social
activists from Taiwan and Hong Kong. "Much of what we see in China now is
nothing but a facade because the entire social structure  is based  on lies
since  that is the only way a post-authoritarian regime like China can sustain
itself."</P>
      <P>The fact that China has a huge exodus of talent each year means that many
overseas Chinese understand that an economically advanced China without the
protections of basic freedom and human dignity is simply not enough, he said.</P>
      <P>"If you can sit down and really talk with a Chinese student, he will most likely
tell you that he wants democracy," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang was an initiator of the 1989 student protest in Beijing that was squelched
by the Chinese army in a bloody crackdown. He was imprisoned and arrested
several times for leading various democratic movements in China before his
eventual exile to the U.S. in 1998.</P>
      <P>He obtained a doctorate degree from Harvard University and now teaches Chinese
history at National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>He told the audience Sunday that to be a social activist, one cannot be afraid
of loneliness or failure.</P>
      <P>"We can never predict the exact direction of the society, therefore, much of
what we do as activists might not prevail as we would wish, but we must be
prepared for failures, he said. "Knowing that you might not succeed should never
prevent you from trying."</P>
      <P>Wang also urged the young social activists to maintain a tight network with
other like-minded groups "so that when the time comes, you will be able to move
at a quick and synchronized pace."</P>

it developed a sound policy to maintain cross-Taiwan Strait ties, said Wang, who
is currently a visiting assistant professor at Taiwan's National Tsing Hua
University.</P>
      <P>Wang said people in academic circles often come up with good ideas that can be
valuable to policy makers in both the DPP and ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Wang and former DPP Legislator Luo Wen-jia will jointly set up the cross-strait
democracy and culture offices in both Taipei and New York primarily to push for
the establishment of a platform to facilitate private sector dialogue between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>In response to a reporter's question on whether the office will advise DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen to visit China, Wang said that is an issue the DPP
itself should assess.</P>
      <P>However,  he said, "it's better to initiate some kind of engagement than to have
none."</P>
      <P>If Tsai decided to visit China, one of the issues would be whom she should meet
there, he said.</P>
      <P>It would be somewhat narrow-minded if she met only with Chinese officials or
ranking members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) , he said.</P>
      <P>"Tsai should meet with people in China's civic society, " he suggested.</P>
      <P>Luo said the DPP should seek closer engagement with China, particularly beyond
the Chinese government and the CPC.</P>
      <P>Luo said the cross-strait private-sector dialogue platform that the offices are
aiming to set up will be completely different from a DPP think-tank and it will
not be influenced by elections or people in high office.</P>
      <P>One of its tasks will be to change the DPP's anti-China image -- the perception
that the party has a closed-door policy toward China and refuses to engage with
Beijing, Luo said.</P>
      <P>It will also seek to lead the DPP toward closer engagements with China's civic
society as means of better understanding the Chinese people and propagating the
DPP's ideals, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More Sun Yun-suans needed in government service: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
12/19/10  21:28:19
(By Hsieh Chia-chen and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he hopes there will be many more Sun Yun-
suans in government, who will dedicate themselves to serving the people well.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a Sun Yun-suan Foundation ceremony at which two
outstanding public functionaries were each awarded NT$1 million and plaque in
recognition of their outstanding contributions.</P>
      <P>This is the 15th year the foundation has honored outstanding public
functionaries in the spirit of the former premier who many said missed the
chance to become president or vice president of the Republic of China due to a
stroke. Sun passed away in 2006 at the age of 93.</P>
      <P>Calling the award winners "Little Sun Yun-suans, " Ma said they are clean,
competent and amicable officials who can help speed up the progress of the
country.</P>
      <P>Noting that some of the previous  41 winners have become ministers, Ma said the
award is not merely an incentive but an indicator that the winners have great
prospects.</P>
      <P>Public authority in the hands of government officials is a double-edged sword
that can cut both ways -- it can promote national development, but it can also
hurt the people, the president said.</P>
      <P>Reiterating his favorite quote that power corrupts, Ma said an official could
make a decision that he or she would regret for the rest of his/her life and
that an inadvertent decision could cause the nation's institutions to collapse
and could deeply disappoint the people.</P>
      <P>This year's awards went to a railway engineering department executive and a
local hospital deputy manager.</P>
      <P>Wu Sheng-yuan, director of the Department of Southern Taiwan Engineering
Projects under the Ministry of Communications  and Transportation, has been in
charge of many projects in Taipei and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Wu has worked for more than 20 years on a Taiwan Railway project in Sungshan,
Taipei and a major project to integrate railway, high-speed rail, mass rapid
transit systems and a highway system into a transportation hub.</P>
      <P>The other winner, Deputy Director Lee Hsin-min of the Yuli Hospital in Hualien
County,  earned the prize because of his dedication to improving health care for
mentally ill patients.</P>
      <P>The hospital, under his management, has treated 2,555 mentally ill patients from
25 counties and cities around the island, and has helped other medical
institutions to handle emergency cases involving such patients.</P>

      <P>For the first time in Taiwan, an exhibition that featured specially designed
home facilities for the disabled is being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>On display are hundreds of devices that can be used at home to help the disabled
manage their daily lives more independently, according to the real estate agency
Evertrust Rehouse Co., that organized the event.</P>
      <P>One of the inventions, a hoist, enables wheelchair users to get up and down
stairs by themselves. Another one is a computer controller with an eyeball
detector that allows the disabled to select items on the screen simply by
staring at them.</P>
      <P>"If the disabled can take care of themselves independently, they will feel more
confident and more valuable, " said Sleeve Yu, a disabled woman who was invited
to speak at the event.</P>
      <P>Yu was a travel agency employee and a part-time model before she was diagnosed
with a mysterious disease in 1998 that rendered her unable to walk. She said she
spent a year and a half crying at home but finally came to realize the
importance of learning to deal with her disability.</P>
      <P>Yu said she was pleased to see that many people were willing to come forward
with creative ideas like those on display at the fair, which would make life
more convenient for the disabled.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes it is just a small and simple idea, but it is what we most need," she
added.</P>
      <P>The fair is being held December 16-19 at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September there were 1.07 million disabled people in Taiwan,
representing 4.6 percent of the country's total population, according to figures
on website of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The figure was an increase of about 10,000 year-on-year, the DGBAS site said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Crying kid finishes 42-km marathon run in Taipei</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
12/19/10  22:42:48
(By Hsiao Pao-hsiang and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-year-old boy started to cry in mid-way through a marathon race in Taipei
Sunday, telling reporters at the finishing line that "it was no fun, because it
was too far."</P>
      <P>The child, surnamed Wu, caught media attention as he ran with adult runners all
around him.</P>
      <P>As he passed the mid-way point, he suddenly cried out loud because of pain in
his knees. However, he stayed on course to finish the 42.195-km run, winning big
hands from the crowd.</P>
      <P>Though he said it was "no fun," he nodded his head in response to a media
question if he would attend the race again next year.</P>
      <P>The boy's brilliant performance drew mixed comments from experts, with a
majority of them saying it was not fit for a child to run a marathon because it
would affect his physical development.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-cheng, secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Track and Field
Association, said though the boy's tough will is laudable, "from my professional
point of view, I think 15 years of age would be a better time to start marathon
run."</P>
      <P>Chen Heng-hua, secretary general of the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association
which sponsored the Fubon Marathon Run 2010, agreed that marathon was not good
for six-year-olds.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not encourage kids to run for the prize money. Wu, who loves
to run just for fun, has actually passed the 9-km and 21-km tests before joining
the 42-km race, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-min, chief executive director of the Child Welfare League Foundation,
urged parents to get a grasp of their kids' physical limits and watch out for
possible sports injuries.</P>
      <P>"If a child shows pains or feels unwell during a long run, parents should not
allow him to finish the whole race; rather, he should be given enough time to
take a break," Wang said.</P>
      <P>As usual, the championships of the Taipei marathon race went to foreign runners.
Kenya's Yusuf Chango Chebii Songoka clocked 2:14: 04 to win the top prize in
men's division and the top woman runner was Yeshi Esayias Tesemma of Ethiopia,
who finished the race with 2:30:37, 32 seconds more than her own record last
year.</P>
      <P>Tesemma thus missed a chance to win NT$1.5 million in "record breaking prize"
and settled for the NT$1 million champion award.</P>
      <P>The best local runners are Wu Wen-chien, whose 2:26:00 record won him the 8th
place, which gave him NT$30,000 plus NT$200,000 as "Taiwan champion;" and Hsu
Yu-fang, who was also placed the 8th, in women's division, with 2:54:32.</P>
      <P>A whopping 31,000 people registered to join the race, including 1500 foreigners
from 47 countries. If the participants of the 3-km amateur run are counted, a
total of 110,000 people joined in Sunday's round the city run. enditem nnnn</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Wu Den-yih proposed Sunday that the many stories
related to Taiwan's decades-long aid to foreign countries could be adapted for
film, including the "A Lamp Lighting Up Africa" program that the country is
promoting in Burkina Faso.</P>
      <P>The films could be shown in 2011 as part of celebrations for the ROC's 100th
founding anniversary, Wu said while hosting a dinner for Taiwanese diplomats and
expatriates upon his arrival in the West African ally on a one-week visit.</P>
      <P>The "A Lamp Lighting Up Africa" project, for example, could be adapted for a TV
drama centered around a leading character who goes to Burkina Faso to carry out
the work, blended with subject matter such as kinship and friendship, according
to Wu.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at bringing electric light to the homes of disadvantaged
Burkina Faso students, who are often forced to study on the streets at night by
the light of street lamps because they do not have electric light at home.</P>
      <P>Under the program, photovoltaic power-generating systems have been installed in
participating schools and each student has been given an LED lighting kit
equipped with a rechargeable battery that lasts four-and-a-half hours. The
children can recharge their lamps at school and bring them home to use at night.</P>
      <P>Wu is the first Taiwanese premier to visit the impoverished West African ally
since the two countries resumed diplomatic ties in 1994. The main purpose of the
visit is to attend the Dec. 20 inauguration of Burkina Faso President Blaise
Compaore for a new term.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Wu will also host the completion ceremony for a Taiwan-funded
vocational training center and visit a new hospital constructed with a loan from
a Taiwanese bank. The hospital is scheduled to open in 2011.</P>
      <P>Immediately after his arrival earlier in the day, Wu had brief discussions with
Burkina Faso officials at the airport, in which he expressed hope that bilateral
cooperation can be further enhanced.</P>
      <P>According to Laurent Sedego, minister of agriculture of Burkina Faso, the rice
output of his country has doubled thanks to the assistance of an agricultural
technical mission from Taiwan. As a result of the assistance, the minister said,
within two years the country will no longer be dependent on imported rice.</P>
      <P>Wu is heading an 18-member delegation that includes Minister of Foreign Affairs
Timothy Yang, Council of Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan,  and  Tao  Wen-
lung,  secretary-general  of  the government-operated International Cooperation
and Development Fund.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Three Trend Micro founders lead 700 engineers to break Guinness World Record</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/20/10  15:56:13</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In addition to constant innovation in cloud technology, Trend Micro always
endeavors to boost employee morale, create a sense of belonging for its
employees and encourage team spirit. And this is why Trend's three founders,
chairman Steve Chang, chief executive officer Eva Chen, and chief culture
officer Jenny Chang, got together at this year's event to cheer their employees
up. Featuring various team games and discussions, the two-day engineering camp
provided those dedicated IT professionals with a chance to relax and engage in
interesting brainstorming and creative thinking. While learning to understand
users' needs, participants also developed team spirit and a sense of belonging
through each designed activity.</P>
      <P>The event reached its climax as three founders and over 700 employees broke the
Guinness World Record for the longest mouse trap queue.Trend Micro is big warm
family. We are thrilled to see our collaborative effort has made history,Eva
Chen said.Creating a pleasant work environment is a commitment we make to our
employees so that they can express their creativity openly and innovate freely.
The idea of the engineering camp is to make employee training fun and
educational. We ask our engineers to put aside their work to learn some soft
skills, which are more important and proved to be beneficial to their work
later.</P>
      <P>As Trend Micro chief culture officer, Jenny Chang spares no effort to enhance
and develop the company's culture.One of team games called the balloon tower
made a quite an impression on me. While everyone worked as a team to build a
tower with eighty balloons and an 80-centimeter long tape, they would learn the
skill of balancing groundwork and performance at work and realize how to produce
the best result with cross team effort. I believe each Trender benefited greatly
from the camp activities. When they are back to work, they will be able to take
much broader view of what consumers want and pay attention to details of their
work and collaboration. Our great employees are the backbone of our company and
we are very confident about setting more world records in the future,Chang said.

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: A long-overdue prom</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/20/10  16:00:15
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of Taiwan's most prestigious senior high schools -- Taipei Municipal Jianguo
High School and Taipei First Girls High School -- jointly held a prom last
Saturday as part of celebrations for the girls school's 107th anniversary.</P>
      <P>The event was considered groundbreaking given the conservative culture of
Taiwan's schools. In the past, male and female students would be punished even
for talking to each other, not to mention attending a prom together.</P>
      <P>In the Western world, people are taught since they are little how to interact
with the opposite sex, with school dances being part of the tradition.
Furthermore, boys and girls are allowed to study together from elementary school
to university, and in universities, male and female students even share
dormitory buildings.</P>
      <P>By comparison, there are still many girls-only or boys-only schools in Taiwan,
and many restrictions are imposed on students' hairstyles and the way they
dress.</P>
      <P>At the joint prom two days ago, the boys and girls were shy and awkward while
dancing together, a scene made worse by their wearing school uniforms and ugly
hairstyles. This shows how unsuccessful our gender education is.</P>
      <P>The team-up between the two top schools also reflects the strange concept of
class, which is derived from the outdated notion that marriage partners must be
from households of equal social standing.</P>
      <P>We hope that high school students will be given full freedom to dance and wear
the clothes and hairstyles they want in the future, breaking the boundaries
between schools. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 20, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China are set to sign a medical and health-care cooperation agreement
during the sixth meeting since 2008 between top negotiators of the two sides
slated for Dec. 20-22 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , arrived in Taipei
Monday to a warm welcome from his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Addressing a welcoming party at Chen's hotel, Chiang said that the two
intermediary bodies have been instrumental in concluding 14 cross-strait
agreements over the past two years, which have begun to yield dividends.</P>
      <P>The landmark  cross-strait  economic  cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA)
signed in June has contributed to improving Taiwan's investment climate,
prompting investments in the private sector to surge by 32 percent year-on-year
and the country's foreign trade to exceed US$500 billion this year, an all-time
record, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>As a result, he went on, Taiwan's economic growth is expected to top nearly 10
percent this year.</P>
      <P>He said the SEF and ARATS have agreed to ink a cross-strait medical and health-
care cooperation agreement Dec. 21 that will not only help boost health of the
people on the two sides but will also benefit the development of related
industries.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said China attaches great importance to the cross-strait
health-care  agreement,  which  reflects  the two intermediary bodies' values
and concern about humanity.</P>
      <P>He said it is regrettable that an investment protection agreement that has been
talked about since 1993 cannot be concluded in this round of talks, even though
"we (China) have maintained a positive and supportive attitude toward the
signing of such a pact."</P>
      <P>In addition to the signing of the medical and health-care cooperation agreement,
the SEF and ARATS negotiators will also exchange views on the much-talked-about
cross-strait investment protection pact over the next two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-Japan forum focuses on disputed Tiaoyutais</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials and scholars from Taiwan and Japan focused on the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands at an annual bilateral forum on Monday and could agree on only one
thing: more discussion is needed on the issue.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks at the one-day 2010 Taiwan-Japan Forum, Vice President
Vincent Siew said Taiwan and Japan shared common interests in the maritime
sovereignty dispute and in many other areas and urged both sides to cooperate to
create a win-win situation.</P>
      <P>Speakers from Taiwan expressed considerable interest in the controversial issue,
which resurfaced after a Chinese boat collided with Japanese Coast Guard vessels
in September in waters off the Tiaoyutais, stirring up a diplomatic row between
Tokyo and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The islands, which lie about 100 nautical miles off Taiwan's northeastern tip,
are claimed by Japan, China and Taiwan and could have an impact on Japan-China
relations and Japan-Taiwan relations at the same time, said Bau Tzong-ho, a
political scientist at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>Because China claims sovereignty over the islands through Taiwan -- which it
says it a part of China -- Japan's national interests would be well served if it
set aside the sovereignty dispute and negotiated an agreement on fishing in the
islands' waters, Bau contended.</P>
      <P>"That would deny China an excuse to intervene in the issue, " he argued.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais dispute could be the most important issue dividing Japan and
Taiwan, said Nobuo Kishi, a member of the House of Councilors in the Diet
(Japanese Congress) , but he agreed that handling it as a fisheries dispute
could lead to negotiations with Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>In contrast, it appeared that the Tiaoyutais had become a more intractable
territorial dispute between Japan and China, said Kishi, a member of the main
opposition Liberal Democratic Party.</P>
      <P>House of Councilors member Naoki Kazama of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan
said that while Taiwan  and China both claim sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais,
Japan found that it was easier to talk to Taiwan about the issue.</P>
      <P>Yang Yung-ming,  a political scientist  at National Taiwan University who has
served as a National Security Council adviser, proposed an "East China Sea
Initiative" that called for all countries involved to pledge to handle the issue
through peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Yang said China's recent tendency to solve disputes using economic measures --
such as banning rare earth exports to Japan -- posed concerns that it could
resort to the same approach in dealing with Taiwan in the future, despite
warming cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>Joe Hung, Taiwan's former representative to Italy, suggested that the dispute be
solved through Four Party Talks that include the three Tiaoyutai claimants --
Taiwan, China and Japan -- as well as the United States as a mediator.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Pay hikes expected in 1st half of 2011: official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>People will begin to see increases in both their pay checks and overall social
consumption in the first half of 2011, as Taiwan will likely register a 5
percent annual growth rate, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
made the remarks as "unfelt economic growth" has been a hot issue in Taiwan for
quite some time.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from lawmakers at a legislative committee meeting, Liu said
it is taking some time for the general public to feel the benefits of the recent
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-hua, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) legislator, asked how she is helping to
solve the problem of the middle class not being able to enjoy the benefits of
the economic growth, as the media has reported that the monthly pay of 3.6
million people is less than NT$30,000 (US$1,002) and that of another 1 million
people is below NT$20,000.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted some media outlets as predicting that Taiwan will see a gross
domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.5 percent next year, and yet only a minority
of the public will benefit from this expansion.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said that change can only come from the overall structure of
the economy, as Taiwan has in the past relied heavily on exports for its
economic growth. As Taiwan's major businesses have moved their production bases
abroad, she noted, the real benefits of the increase in the GDP output cannot be
felt by the workforce at home.</P>
      <P>Liu said the CEPD will try to design a strategy during the first half of the
coming year to increase local workers' incomes and balance economic activities
in the region.</P>
      <P>Under what she described as a policy of creating more jobs by setting up new
businesses that is expected to be finalized next June, the government will
promote industry around the country so that the fruits of the economic growth
can be enjoyed by all the people.</P>
      <P>Lee asked if she was as upbeat as some forecasters who say Taiwan's economy
might grow by 5 percent next year -- 0.5 percentage points higher than the
"mainstream" observers are forecasting, Liu said that "certainly it is likely,
as long as we work hard enough."</P>
      <P>In a similar vein, Legislator Huang Wei-che of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) asked how the CEPD is attempting to solve the problem of
grass-roots people being left out of the economic growth trend as Taiwan's
average wages and salaries rise to a new high and yet the wealth gap is also
widening.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Ching-chih pointed out that those whose monthly income falls
short of NT$30,000 account for 33 percent of the workforce.</P>
      <P>"This is a very serious problem for the national economy. It means economic
depression and grass-roots pain. The seriousness is even more striking if those
in the public sector payrolls are counted out," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said it is meaningless to talk about the average income, as high income
earners inflate the figure. She said she would ask government statisticians to
provide the average incomes of the top 50 percent and the bottom 50 percent,
which, when compared to the total number of people in both income groups, will
shed new light on the actual distribution of income.</P>

      <P>The founder and chairman of the Farglory Group, one of Taiwan's major property
development and construction companies,  promised Monday to donate NT$10 billion
(US$333.33 million) to develop a medical and health-care park in his hometown in
Miaoli County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chao Teng-hsiung, born in Miaoli's coastal township of Houlong into a poor
family and who began to serve his apprenticeship as a plasterer aged 15, told
Miaoli Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung that he will make sure the health-care park is
developed in Houlong to help Miaoli residents have access to better medical
attention.</P>
      <P>Construction of the park -- which will feature a 685-bed hospital, a nursing
home, a biotechnology research and development center and a cancer research
center -- is expected to start in the latter half of 2011 and to become
operational in three years, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Chao, whose assets exceed NT$200 billion, made the vow during a tea party at the
Miaoli Dome Gym to mark the fifth anniversary of Liu becoming magistrate.</P>
      <P>The self-made property magnate lauded Liu's administrative team, which has
worked to shorten the administrative procedure of the health-care park
development project to two years from five years.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he said, his group's plan for building a Taipei dome gym has lain
stagnant for over a decade with no date in sight for the project to start.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy for business corporations to contribute to society because of
Taiwan's political and administrative climate," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite that, Chao went on, he is determined to build the medical center and
health-care park, as around 47,000 Miaoli patients have to travel to the big
cities in northern or southern Taiwan for medical treatment, many of whom die
while on the road.</P>
      <P>About 37,000 of the total check into bigger hospitals in other cities and
counties each year, staying for an average of seven days for treatment,
prompting him to make the decision to set up the health-care park, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ongoing talks with China have been of little benefit to Taiwan, and agreements
reached to protect Taiwan's interests have gone mostly ignored,  the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) charged on Monday ahead of the latest round
of cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said that after five rounds of talks between the
heads of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) that began in June
2008, little has been done to protect China-based Taiwanese investors or the
general welfare of Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>"Out of the 14 agreements signed, many were merely empty contracts because they
have not been properly implemented. It is even more regrettable that several key
issues have not been discussed at all," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>One example he cited was the agreement on direct cross-strait flights. Though
the pact mentioned "beyond rights" of Taiwanese and Chinese airlines -- the
right to carry passengers from a second country on to other countries -- the
issue had yet to be explored further, he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said "beyond rights" should be treated as high priority because they are
closely linked to the profitability of Taiwan's airline industry and the
convenience of the public.</P>
      <P>Another  unfulfilled  promise  was  Beijing's  inaction  on compensating the
victims of China-produced tainted milk powder, he added.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said that during the last cross-strait talks held in Taiwan -- in
Taichung City in December 2009 -- the sides failed to sign an agreement on
investment protection, a crucial issue for China-based Taiwanese businessmen and
investors, and it was unlikely that the agreement would be forged this time as
well.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the agreement has yet to be concluded because China refuses
to negotiate further on the issue unless Taiwan agrees to offer the concession
of widening its market to Chinese investment.</P>
      <P>"Clearly, the Beijing government is setting up a trap by using the investment
protection agreement as a bargaining chip. It is a pity that President Ma Ying-
jeou's government does not have a counter-strategy against China's ploy," he
said.</P>
      <P>ARATS head Chen Yunlin arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport around
noon on Monday for a three-day visit that will include the sixth round of talks
with his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-kung.</P>
      <P>Many pro-independence groups have vowed to protest Chen's visit around the clock
by setting up various demonstrations in Taipei in the next 72 hours.</P>
      <P>A group of over 70 protesters gathered at the National Palace Museum Monday
afternoon to oppose Chen's visit and called on Beijing to release Chinese social
activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo.</P>
      <P>Compared however to the violent street clashes that took place in November 2008
when Chen arrived in Taiwan for the first time, the protests have been
relatively level-headed so far.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract
chip maker, will likely have better prospects than its U.S. rival, Intel Corp.,
on the back of a wider usage of TSMC products, Chairman Morris Chang said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The popularization of notebooks, netbooks and smartphones has generated huge
demand for TSMC's IC chips, while Intel's efforts in micro-processors make it
more attractive for high-end clients, said Chang in a speech at the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>"TSMC can be likened to a Toyota car with popularized technology and great
client demand, while Intel is more like a Mercedes-Benz that is aimed at a
smaller, high-end market," he said.</P>
      <P>The annual expenditure on research and development for the Hsinchu-based
chipmaker, totaled NT$36 billion (US$1.2 billion) in 2010, exceeding the total
budget of Taiwan's semi-official Industrial Technology Research Institute, and
Chang said the figure will grow to more than NT$50 billion next year, trailing
only behind Intel in the global semiconductor R&amp;D sector.</P>
      <P>"This is because Intel includes both process technology and design business,
while TSMC is devoted to process technology only, " said Chang, adding that
TSMC's R&amp;D expenditure would surpass that of Intel if the R&amp;D spending
of its IC design partners were included.</P>
      <P>Chang said that TSMC, with leading global shipments of logic ICs, has become one
of the world's top three semiconductor manufacturers along with Intel and the
world's No. 1 memory chip maker in terms of capital expenditure and shipments,
Samsung Electronics Co.</P>
      <P>TSMC recorded its capital expenditure of NT$180 billion this year, ranking in
second place behind Samsung in the global market.</P>
      <P>Regarding the company's market value, Chang said TSMC is now worth NT$1.9
trillion, representing the highest value of any single company in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>When asked about the rising appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar, Chang told
reporters that while he appreciates the efforts made by the government, it is
having a hard time fighting the appreciation and has been less successful than
previously hoped.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun will not find out her fate in a case
involving her disqualification at the Asian Games until Dec. 22 at the earliest,
a World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>WTF public relations director Kang Seok-jae told the Central News Agency that
the WTF would inform the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) of the
decision via e-mail first and then send it the ruling via express airmail.</P>
      <P>The WTF's disciplinary committee met Saturday to hear the case related to Yang's
disqualification at the Asian Games on Nov. 17, and according to Kang, the
committee's members delivered their sealed conclusions to the WTF Secretariat
after the meeting.</P>
      <P>But they did not have the authority to publicize the ruling, which still needed
to be approved by WTF President Chungwon Choue before becoming official, Kang
said.</P>
      <P>The committee, formed by Egyptian, Israel and Turkish officials, reviewed Yang's
disqualification in her opening bout in the women's under 49 kg division at the
Asiad and Yang's ensuing protest, which could lead to her being suspended from
competition.</P>
      <P>WTF officials claimed Yang violated the rules by wearing extra electronic
sensors on her socks during the bout to score more points, but video footage
later showed she did not have the sensors on against her opponent.</P>
      <P>A stunned Yang refused to leave the ring after the decision, and the
contradictory statements of taekwondo officials in explaining the

      <P>Christmas light displays around Taiwan are not putting a burden on the country's
electricity supply because many use energy-saving LED lights and are operating
at a time when demand for power is not at its peak, the state-run Taiwan Power
Co. said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Christmas light bulbs are consuming relatively small amounts of power. There is
no problem with the electricity supply," Taiwan Power spokeswoman Tu Yueh-yuan
told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Christmas  light  decorations  have  come under  fire from environmentalists,
with groups in Hong Kong saying that lighting decorations on the walls of
buildings in the Victoria Harbor area consumed enough electricity to run 330
four-person households for a year.</P>
      <P>Tu dismissed such concerns. She said Taiwan had seen record use of electricity
over the summer due to a surge in the use of air conditioners to combat the
heat, but that was not an issue during the winter.</P>
      <P>Many shopping malls and local governments in Taiwan have put up colored lights
on the street or on Christmas trees to mark the arrival of the Christmas season.</P>
      <P>Citibank Taiwan, for example, worked with the Taipei City government and the
Finland Trade Center, a Taipei-based foreign trade office, to install blue
lights covering trees and overpasses in a 400-meter section of the Xinyi
shopping district in Taipei on Dec. 18.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government has also installed eight long lines of "light dots"
on the square in front of the county government office building, with trees on
either side of the square also decorated with lights.</P>
      <P>More such celebrations are expected as Christmas approaches.</P>
      <P>Administration officials in the Tri-Mountain National Scenic Area in central
Taiwan's Taichung County plan to decorate a 20-meter-tall cedar with 90 13
-meter-long LED lights in front of the Lishan Guesthouse on Dec. 24.</P>
      <P>The tree, located at an altitude of 2,000 meters above sea level, will become
one of Taiwan's highest altitude Christmas trees, along with one at 2,116 meters
above sea level on Alishan in southern Taiwan.</P>

the 2010 Taiwan-Japan Forum, citing the signing of the Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China in June and more recent interest in an FTA
with Singapore.</P>
      <P>Private sector cooperation also has enormous potential, Siew said, because
Japanese businesses have long been known for their advanced technology and
Taiwanese enterprises excel in manufacturing and exploring new markets.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that Japan was Taiwan's second largest trade partner and its largest
source of imports in 2009 as two-way trade reached US$50.7 billion and Taiwan's
imports from Japan were worth US$36.2 billion.</P>
      <P>Yoshio Okawara, a consultant of the Institute for International Policy Studies,
agreed that a Japan-Taiwan coalition would be the best way for both countries to
tackle East Asia's fast-changing economic climate.</P>
      <P>But the former Japanese ambassador to the United States and Australia also
warned that the emergence of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) -- a
multilateral free trade agreement that aims to integrate the economies of the
Asia-Pacific region -- could create a new economic dynamic in the region.</P>
      <P>Scholars and officials also took time at the one-day forum to review the
security front in East Asia and addressed the threat of North Korea and a rising
China. The U.S.-Japan security pact, they agreed, was one of the pillars of East
Asian security.</P>
      <P>House of Councilors member Naoki Kazama of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan
said Japan welcomed reduced tensions between Taiwan and China but had concerns
over a Taiwan-China coalition at the same time.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan-China coalition would mean that the East China Sea and the South China
Sea could literally become China's "inland waters, " Kazama said.</P>
      <P>The scenario would make it impossible for Japan to stop the Chinese Navy from
projecting its power to the Pacific Ocean because Taiwan is an integral part of
the "First Island Chain, " which is formed by the Aleutians, the Kuriles, Japan,
the Ryukyus, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Borneo.</P>
      <P>Japan, as one of the major powers in East Asia, could also be crucial to Taiwan
in lending its support for Taiwan's participation in the international
community, said Bau Tzong-ho, a political scientist at National Taiwan
University.</P>
      <P>"An isolated Taiwan and the discontent of the people of Taiwan would be
detrimental to East Asian stability and does not serve Japan's national
interests, " Bau said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No `China fever' within party : DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that there is no
"China fever" within the party and that it will try to face China soberly and
calmly.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, a spokesman of the party that has long advocated Taiwan
independence, was rebutting a new report that "a China fever has been arising
within the DPP" after DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen decided to establish a party
think tank for research mainly on how the party should engage with the other
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We will face China calmly, in stark contrast to the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
which has been `embracing China' enthusiastically," Cheng added.</P>
      <P>He said that although the DPP will not exclude the possibility of dialogue with
China, such talks can take place only when the sovereignty of Taiwan and the
values of democracy and human rights are fully safeguarded.</P>
      <P>After becoming operational,  the think tank will work out proposals concerning
the DPP's China policy, including exchanges between the governments, civic
groups, think tanks and cultural organizations on the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>"In this way, we (the DPP) will not establish an exclusive DPP-Communist Party
of China (CPC) communication platform such as the one between the KMT and the
CPC," Cheng added.</P>
      <P>Another DPP spokesman, Tsai Chi-chang, said that Tsai Ing-wen has unveiled four
principles in the DPP's China strategy:</P>
      <P>-- The relationship between China and Taiwan must be mutually beneficial rather
than mutually discriminatory, must be peaceful rather than based on conflict,
and must be built on an equal footing rather than on a superior-subordinate
basis;</P>
      <P>-- The DPP will only consider Taiwan's relations with China from the
perspectives of global strategic balance and regional security, and that the
ties will not fall within the "one China" framework demanded by China;</P>
      <P>-- The DPP will insist on democracy and demand that the formation and
implementation of all China policies must follow democratic procedures and that
important issues must be decided by the people through referendum; and</P>
      <P>-- The DPP will insist on the universal values of freedom, democracy and human
rights, which make Taiwan totally different from China.</P>

      <P>The first batch of containers carrying parts of Taiwan's Shanghai World Expo
pavilion arrived in the northern Taiwan harbor of Keelung on Monday to a warm
welcome from a group of officials and shippers.</P>
      <P>Shaped like a sky lantern, the Taiwan Pavilion was one of the most visited
exhibits at the Shanghai Expo, which concluded on Oct. 31, and it was later sold
to the Hsinchu City government for NT$500 million (US$16.66 million).</P>
      <P>The Hsinchu City government will have the pavilion reassembled before opening it
to the public in October 2011.</P>
      <P>Other containers carrying the pavilion's parts are expected to be shipped back
to Taiwan in three batches before the end of January 2011, according to Frank
F.H. Lu, chairman of Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp., the company shipping the
pavilion back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu City Mayor Hsu Ming-tsai, who was on hand when the first group of
containers arrived, said Hsinchu City is welcoming the Taiwan Pavilion  home in
the same spirit as it would a new daughter-in-law.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Pavilion manager Walter Yeh said the pavilion, which features Taiwan's
natural landscape and culture, received 750,000 visits during the Shanghai
Expo's 184-day run, and it will now be one of the few national pavilions at the
Expo to return to its home country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Do not rely on Central Bank to stop currency appreciation: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
12/20/10  20:27:15

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior government official advised the nation's businesses Monday not to rely
on the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to fight currency
appreciation.</P>
      <P>Instead, the official said, they should diversify their export markets away from
the United States.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
made the remarks in response to lawmakers' questions at a legislative committee
meeting concerning the impact of the local currency's recent rise in value
against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>As the exchange rate of Taiwan's currency against the greenback broke through
the NT$30 barrier again in mid-session that day, lawmakers asked Liu how the
CEPD can help Taiwan's exporters -- major contributors to Taiwan's economy --
who have been complaining about their profits being eaten up by the NT dollar's
appreciation against the U.S. unit.</P>
      <P>The economist-turned-minister suggested that exporters use some hedging tools
that are available on the financial market, rather than looking at the central
bank for help to stop currency fluctuation.</P>
      <P>If the long-term prospects for the NT dollar is continued appreciation, she
said, Taiwan's export industry should no longer concentrate on the U.S. market
but "rather, should increase their shares of non-U.S. markets and divert export
orders away from the U.S.," adopting the "basket of currencies" model.</P>
      <P>Liu also advised local businesses to cut orders from Europe and look at the
emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>On the propriety of the central bank's policy of "following market principles"
in dealing with the currency issue, Liu said that if the market is releasing
U.S. dollars and the bank wants to buy them, it must spend New Taiwan dollars,
which drives up consumer prices.</P>
      <P>This, she pointed out, puts the central bank in a predicament in which it can
either allow the currency to rise or face the pressure of increasing consumer
prices.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Liu pointed out, the pressure on consumer prices is manageable at
the moment, so that the bank can afford to pay the price of stopping the NT
dollar from rising too much.</P>
      <P>Still, she went on, "we must let the people know that the central bank is paying
a price for stopping the NT dollar's appreciation, " a price that eventually
will be shared by all tax payers.</P>
      <P>Turning to the brilliant performance of Taiwan's economy this year -- which
could surge past the 10-percent mark -- and the fact that many people are still
unable to discern any improvement, much less enjoy a "share" of the benefits,
Liu said she hopes that next year, everyone will be able to feel what it means
to have a 10 percent growth in the economy.</P>
      <P>She said she expects a majority of the people to see the double-digit growth
increasing their incomes, thereby giving an impetus to domestic consumption.</P>
      <P>Between 1990 and 2000, Taiwan was leading the pack of Asia's "four dragons" in
terms of consumption and investment growth. "Now we are on track to return to
that glory," she said.</P>

      <P>Second-grader Yang Tzu-ling, who read 72 books in two months, received the award
for winning the elementary school division of a national reading contest for
visually impaired students.</P>
      <P>The contest was part of a program launched in September that was the first ever
in Taiwan to encourage more visually impaired students to read. More than 200
students participated in the event.</P>
      <P>Yang's mother said she used to read to her daughter and her twin brother --
whose eyesight is normal -- every day when they were small because she did not
want her daughter to feel she was different from other children.</P>
      <P>She even made Braille books by herself to give her daughter more of an
opportunity to read.</P>
      <P>Yang said she reads books after 4 p.m. every day, mostly picture and audio
books.</P>
      <P>Eighth-grader Lu Yi-chen, who won a writing contest for an essay she wrote after
reading a book, thanked her father at the ceremony for "being her eyes and

      <P>A government agency scrambled late Monday to clarify a report that Taiwan had
seen an increase in the number of the " working poor, " including a rise in the
number of those earning less than NT$20,000 (US$660) per month.</P>
      <P>In a front page story Monday, the Liberty Times cited the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) as reporting that the number of
employees with monthly incomes lower than NT$30,000 reached 3.597 million this
year, accounting for 45 percent of all salaried employees in the country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the number of workers who earned less than NT$20,000 per month climbed
to as many as 1.038 million this year, the second consecutive year that it had
exceeded the 1 million mark.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said the newspaper based its report on a DGBAS survey conducted in May
that only asked employees about their regular monthly income and did not
consider income from second jobs, overtime, year-end and other bonuses, and
allowances.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the survey showed that the average regular salary reached NT$34,431 in

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) urged the government to look at its China investment
policy from the industry's point of view rather than from its own "political
perspective."</P>
      <P>Comparing how officials in Taiwan and China deal with investment proposals by
Taiwanese businesspeople, a senior AUO executive said Taiwanese officials would
pull out a stack of newspaper clippings and ask them to point out -- based on
media reports -- where the government's policy has failed to address their
concerns.</P>
      <P>In contrast, said Paul S.L. Peng, executive vice president of AUO's display
business operations, Chinese officials would have already visited the
prospective investor's factory and understood its problems, ready to find
solutions.</P>
      <P>"They would take the initiative to tell us what kinds of services they can
offer, " Peng said.</P>
      <P>AUO on Friday received approval from the government to set up a 7.5-generation
flat panel fab in China, at a time when its South Korean rival LG Display Corp.
(LGD) has already broken ground on an 8.5-generation fab there.</P>
      <P>Samsung Corp., another South Korean consumer electronics giant, has bought into
the flat panel arm of China's TCL Corp., speeding up the building of plants for
manufacturing new-generation display panels.</P>
      <P>Relative to AUO's South Korean rivals, Peng said the government's permit for his
company's 7.5-generation fab in China "came a bit too late, " and he urged the
government to lift the "N-1 generation" limit.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that authorities allow AUO and other Taiwanese firms to buy
stakes in Chinese panel makers so they could compete with the Koreans on the
world market.</P>
      <P>Peng said AUO asked the government for permission to buy into Chinese companies
when it filed its application to invest in China, but the Ministry of Economic
Affairs turned down the request.</P>
      <P>In response to Peng's statements, a senior MOEA official said the government did
not have any plan to review the policy regarding investing in Chinese panel
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>As to why the government delayed approval of AUO's plan to invest in China,
Industrial Development Bureau Director General Woody Duh said AUO changed the
content of its plan while it was being screened.</P>
      <P>The government required AUO to submit more information, and the new information
and documents needed to be reviewed, so the whole process was slowed down, Duh
said.</P>
      <P>About one year ago, Peng said, Taiwanese panel makers were badly needed in
China. Now that newer-generation panel fabs are already in place, the Chinese
authorities are in no hurry to screen AUO's application to set up shop there, he
complained.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, China at the time had hoped to include five flat panel
corporations in its strategic industry development plan -- TCL and BOE
Technology of China, Samsung and LGD of South Korea, plus AUO.</P>
      <P>"If our proposal had gotten a green light as planned, our Chinese factories
would have been completed in early 2012. But now, they won't be in operation
until the end of 2012."</P>
      <P>MOEA officials were not wrong to do their jobs according to the law, but they
demanded that AUO repeatedly submit new information on the same issues while
delaying making a decision on the case, Peng said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the best time to build new factories in China has been missed," he
said.</P>

      <P>Despite an appreciating currency, Taiwan's export orders continued to grow in
November, putting it on course to reach its goal of US$405 billion in export
orders for the year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders in November rose 14.34 percent year on year to a record
US$35.74 billion on the back of strong demand for consumer electronic products
such as cell phones and computers, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>The November export orders only grew by 7.27 percent year-on-year in Taiwan
dollar terms after the local currency rose 5.04 percent against the greenback in
November, according to the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>The November figure grew 0.27 percent, or US$100 million, from October,
department officials said.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, Taiwan's export orders rose 27.32 percent
from the year-earlier level to US$370.15 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Export orders in December are expected to top US$35 billion, leaving the
department optimistic that the US$405 billion goal for all of 2010 would be
attained, officials said.</P>
      <P>Export orders indicate deliveries three months in advance and are considered a
key economic indicator.</P>
      <P>In November, export orders for information and communications products grew 7.67
percent year-on-year to US$9.24 billion, while those for electronic products
were up 12.57 percent to US$8.55 billion, and orders for precision equipment
were up 8.51 percent to US$3.01 billion, according to the Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Information and communications products, along with electronic goods and
precision equipment accounted for over 50 percent of Taiwan's total export
orders in November.</P>
      <P>Export orders for base metal related products rose 31.01 percent, or US$580
million, from a year earlier as a result of rising sales prices and a low
comparative baseline from 2009, according to the department.</P>
      <P>In November, export orders placed by China and Hong Kong totaled US$9.19
billion, up 16.56 percent from a year earlier, while export orders from the
United States grew 13.48 percent to US$7.8 billion, the department said.</P>
      <P>Export orders placed by Europe rose 17.61 percent from a year earlier to US$7.03
billion in November, while orders from Japan totaled US$4.05 billion, up 5.74
percent year on year, the department said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Statistics Department Director-General Huang Ji-shih said over half,
or 50.95 percent, of the export orders received in November would be produced
overseas, a new high, with 83.32 percent of the information and communications
products ordered to be produced outside Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) denied Monday that it engaged in "dollar
diplomacy" when Palau used Taiwanese government funds to help settle a bank
bankruptcy there in late 2006, but it did not address reports that a similar
practice was continuing now.</P>
      <P>According to the Palau Horizon newspaper, Palau has begun using US$955,000 left
over from a previous loan from Taiwan with the government's consent to reimburse
depositors of the failed Pacific Savings Bank (PSB) who were not reimbursed when
the bank went into receivership in November 2006.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang blasted the
government for "footing the bills of a failed foreign bank" and demanded that it
ask Palau to return the money to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the MOFA said the funds were part of the government's annual
assistance to Palau and no new money was used to help relieve the victims of the
bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>As many as 7,000 account holders were affected in a country with a population of
just 20,000, according to the MOFA, which said allowing the ally's government to
use that money to stabilize its economy to restore social order at the time was
the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement did not directly address, however, the most recent agreement
reported by the Palau Horizon allowing Palau the use of the balance of
US$955,000 from the 2007 loan to compensate the remaining 641 depositors who
never recouped their losses.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) urged the government to look at its China investment
policy from the industry's point of view rather than from its own "political
perspective."</P>
      <P>Comparing how officials in Taiwan and China deal with investment proposals by
Taiwanese businesspeople, a senior AUO executive said Taiwanese officials would
pull out a stack of newspaper clippings and ask them to point out -- based on
media reports -- where the government's policy has failed to address their
concerns.</P>
      <P>In contrast, said Paul S.L. Peng, executive vice president of AUO's display
business operations, Chinese officials would have already visited the
prospective investor's factory and understood its problems, ready to find
solutions.</P>
      <P>"They would take the initiative to tell us what kinds of services they can
offer, " Peng said.</P>
      <P>AUO on Friday received approval from the government to set up a 7.5-generation
flat panel fab in China, at a time when its South Korean rival LG Display Corp.
(LGD) has already broken ground on an 8.5-generation fab there.</P>
      <P>Samsung Corp., another South Korean consumer electronics giant, has bought into
the flat panel arm of China's TCL Corp., speeding up the building of plants for
manufacturing new-generation display panels.</P>
      <P>Relative to AUO's South Korean rivals, Peng said the government's permit for his
company's 7.5-generation fab in China "came a bit too late, " and he urged the
government to lift the "N-1 generation" limit.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that authorities allow AUO and other Taiwanese firms to buy
stakes in Chinese panel makers so they could compete with the Koreans on the
world market.</P>
      <P>Peng said AUO asked the government for permission to buy into Chinese companies
when it filed its application to invest in China, but the Ministry of Economic
Affairs turned down the request.</P>
      <P>In response to Peng's statements, a senior MOEA official said the government did
not have any plan to review the policy regarding investing in Chinese panel
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>As to why the government delayed approval of AUO's plan to invest in China,
Industrial Development Bureau Director General Woody Duh said AUO changed the
content of its plan while it was being screened.</P>
      <P>The government required AUO to submit more information, and the new information
and documents needed to be reviewed, so the whole process was slowed down, Duh
said.</P>
      <P>About one year ago, Peng said, Taiwanese panel makers were badly needed in
China. Now that newer-generation panel fabs are already in place, the Chinese
authorities are in no hurry to screen AUO's application to set up shop there, he
complained.</P>
      <P>According to Peng, China at the time had hoped to include five flat panel
corporations in its strategic industry development plan -- TCL and BOE
Technology of China, Samsung and LGD of South Korea, plus AUO.</P>
      <P>"If our proposal had gotten a green light as planned, our Chinese factories
would have been completed in early 2012. But now, they won't be in operation
until the end of 2012."</P>
      <P>MOEA officials were not wrong to do their jobs according to the law, but they
demanded that AUO repeatedly submit new information on the same issues while
delaying making a decision on the case, Peng said.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the best time to build new factories in China has been missed," he
said.</P>

      <P>Despite an appreciating currency, Taiwan's export orders continued to grow in
November, putting it on course to reach its goal of US$405 billion in export
orders for the year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders in November rose 14.34 percent year on year to a record
US$35.74 billion on the back of strong demand for consumer electronic products
such as cell phones and computers, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>The November export orders only grew by 7.27 percent year-on-year in Taiwan
dollar terms after the local currency rose 5.04 percent against the greenback in
November, according to the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>The November figure grew 0.27 percent, or US$100 million, from October,
department officials said.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, Taiwan's export orders rose 27.32 percent
from the year-earlier level to US$370.15 billion, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Export orders in December are expected to top US$35 billion, leaving the
department optimistic that the US$405 billion goal for all of 2010 would be
attained, officials said.</P>
      <P>Export orders indicate deliveries three months in advance and are considered a
key economic indicator.</P>
      <P>In November, export orders for information and communications products grew 7.67
percent year-on-year to US$9.24 billion, while those for electronic products
were up 12.57 percent to US$8.55 billion, and orders for precision equipment
were up 8.51 percent to US$3.01 billion, according to the Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>Information and communications products, along with electronic goods and
precision equipment accounted for over 50 percent of Taiwan's total export
orders in November.</P>
      <P>Export orders for base metal related products rose 31.01 percent, or US$580
million, from a year earlier as a result of rising sales prices and a low
comparative baseline from 2009, according to the department.</P>
      <P>In November, export orders placed by China and Hong Kong totaled US$9.19
billion, up 16.56 percent from a year earlier, while export orders from the
United States grew 13.48 percent to US$7.8 billion, the department said.</P>
      <P>Export orders placed by Europe rose 17.61 percent from a year earlier to US$7.03
billion in November, while orders from Japan totaled US$4.05 billion, up 5.74
percent year on year, the department said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Statistics Department Director-General Huang Ji-shih said over half,
or 50.95 percent, of the export orders received in November would be produced
overseas, a new high, with 83.32 percent of the information and communications
products ordered to be produced outside Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) denied Monday that it engaged in "dollar
diplomacy" when Palau used Taiwanese government funds to help settle a bank
bankruptcy there in late 2006, but it did not address reports that a similar
practice was continuing now.</P>
      <P>According to the Palau Horizon newspaper, Palau has begun using US$955,000 left
over from a previous loan from Taiwan with the government's consent to reimburse
depositors of the failed Pacific Savings Bank (PSB) who were not reimbursed when
the bank went into receivership in November 2006.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Tsai Huang-liang blasted the
government for "footing the bills of a failed foreign bank" and demanded that it
ask Palau to return the money to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a press release, the MOFA said the funds were part of the government's annual
assistance to Palau and no new money was used to help relieve the victims of the
bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>As many as 7,000 account holders were affected in a country with a population of
just 20,000, according to the MOFA, which said allowing the ally's government to
use that money to stabilize its economy to restore social order at the time was
the right thing to do.</P>
      <P>The MOFA statement did not directly address, however, the most recent agreement
reported by the Palau Horizon allowing Palau the use of the balance of
US$955,000 from the 2007 loan to compensate the remaining 641 depositors who
never recouped their losses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The move by Far Eastern Century Corp., one of Taiwan's leading textile makers,
to set up a purified terephthalic acid (PTA) joint venture in China reflects the
company's ambition to enhance its vertical integration, an analyst said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern announced Monday that it would join forces with China's Sinopec
Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co. Ltd. to build a PTA firm in Yangzhou, Jiangsu
Province. The plant will have an annual capacity of 1 million tons.</P>
      <P>The two partners signed a letter of intent for the joint investment, with Far
Eastern to hold a 60 percent stake in the new company and Yizheng to own the
remaining 40 percent.</P>
      <P>The proposed joint venture, which will require an investment of 3.8 billion
Chinese yuan (US$569 million) , has been approved by Chinese authorities, the
company said.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern said construction of the new plant is expected to be competed in two
years and production is scheduled to start no later than in 2013.</P>
      <P>"PTA is the main raw material of Far Eastern's polyester related products. The
investment is expected to help the company secure supply of the raw material, "
Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"The investment  shows the company's efforts to vertically integrate its
business and avoid possible raw material shortages in the future," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>At present, Far Eastern produces about 1.6 million tons of PTA a year, of which
1 million tons is made in Taiwan and 600,000 tons in China.</P>
      <P>Far Eastern said it expected to add another 600,000 tons from the new plant in
Yangzhou.</P>
      <P>"The interesting part of the joint venture plan is that Far Eastern will hold a
stake of more than 50 percent as a controlling shareholder. It could be another
form of China 'granting benefit' to Taiwan's companies," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The phrase "granting benefit" was first used by Wen Jiabao in March to describe
China's attitude in negotiating an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
(ECFA) with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party described Wen's comments at the time
as "lies" and an attempt to make the ECFA more palatable to Taiwan's people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Can government betray public's trust?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/21/10  13:23:37
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Green energy development and the establishment of a low-carbon homeland are high
on President Ma Ying-jeou's master plan to usher in a so-called "golden decade"
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government's implementation of its renewable energy policy, however, has
been plagued by loopholes and contradictions.</P>
      <P>Since the Statute on Renewable Energy Development was promulgated in July 2009,
many disputes have arisen. In October this year, solar cell makers filed appeals
with the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan to protest  what they called the
snail's pace at which state-owned Taiwan Power Co. was screening solar power
generation applications.</P>
      <P>At the time, Premier Wu Den-yih directed the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
to push Taipower to cut red tape and speed up the completion of the deals, that
would commit Taipower to buy the electricity produced at a set fee.</P>
      <P>Just two months later, a new controversy has erupted. On Dec. 17, the MOEA's
Bureau of Energy posted a notice on its website saying that the wholesale price
to be paid for the power generated by solar projects will be decided on the date
of completion of the investors' solar power facilities rather than when the
contract is signed.</P>
      <P>As Taipower is likely to lower its solar power procurement price by 30 percent
next year, the abrupt policy reversal would definitely inflict serious damage on
photovoltaic manufacturers and indiviudal investors in the sector.</P>
      <P>The policy flip-flop could take the heaviest toll on Pingtung County, where
about 100 land owners decided to install solar panels on their aquaculture farms
at the encouragement of the county government after Typhoon Morakot wreaked
havoc in the region in August 2009.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Tsao Chi-hung slammed the MOEA as acting like a fraud ring
because its policy reversal betrayed the trust of the people.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, Taipower has signed 166 contracts with electricity
suppliers since the beginning of this year based on previous regulations that
the procurement price would be calculated based on the rate in place the day the
contract was signed. All of these contracts would have to be renegotiated  under
the new regulations.</P>
      <P>How could the ministry have made such a big policy U-turn just 13 days before
the end of the year? The move reflects the MOEA's frivolous attitude in dealing
with major policy issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the MOEA's latest decision violated the basic legal tenet that laws
should not be retroactive.</P>
      <P>We hope the MOEA will reconsider its move in order to regain public trust.

      <P>Top negotiators from Taiwan and China began a new round of talks in Taipei
Tuesday, with the signing of a medical and health care cooperation agreement
topping the meeting's agenda.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks at the meeting, Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , touted the new agreement on medical
cooperation and previous agreements on food safety and agricultural quarantines,
as a cross-Taiwan Strait "safety net."</P>
      <P>The agreements safeguard the health of the people on both sides, guaranteeing
the quality of their interactions on the basis of a solid system, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang's counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , said both sides attached great
importance to the agreement, and he hoped it could be sealed at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chiang acknowledged that some of the agreements signed in their five previous
meetings had not worked as well as anticipated, citing the inadequate number of
cross-Taiwan flights, China's inaction on repatriating suspected economic, and
problems finalizing compensation for tarnished food imports.</P>
      <P>He said the two sides needed to resolve the problems face-to-face as early as
possible, and Chen agreed.</P>
      <P>"I would be every supportive" if the two sides could establish some kind of
mechanism to check and carry out the signed agreements within a certain period
of time, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meetings have become part of institutionalized talks between the
two quasi-official intermediary bodies in the absence of official ties across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During their previous five meetings, Chiang and Chen have signed 14 agreements
that have paved the way for the opening of direct shipping and air links,
tourist exchanges and closer economic ties.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that Taiwan's representative
offices in Europe are doing their best to help Taiwanese travelers stranded
around the northern part of the continent due to bad weather.</P>
      <P>The ministry confirmed that as of Tuesday morning, more than 100 Taiwanese
tourists were stranded in Cologne, Vienna and London after heavy snow caused the
cancellation and delay of flights across the European continent.</P>
      <P>With the help of Taiwan's representative office, 73 Taiwanese tourists received
a temporary visa or a Schengen visa exemption from the immigration office in
Vienna, MOFA spokesman James Chang said.</P>
      <P>Another group of 54 travelers on a China Airlines flight had arrived in London
after previously being kept in Cologne, where the tourists received a group
Schengen visa so they could leave the airport during their stay.</P>
      <P>Dozens of Taiwanese travelers were also still in London waiting for Heathrow and
Gatwick airports to open, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA believed there were other Taiwanese travelers facing problems in
Europe, and the Department of European Affairs was still gathering information
on their situations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The ministry had a similar experience in helping more than 1,900 Taiwanese
travelers get to their destination or apply for temporary travel documents in
April, when a volcanic eruption in Iceland disrupted thousands of flights around
Europe, Chang said.</P>

      <P>Ju Percussion Group will celebrate its 25th anniversary with four concerts in
Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung starting Jan. 2, it said in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The group, founded in January 1986 by one of Taiwan's most famous musicians  Ju
Tzong-ching,  was the country's first percussion ensemble.</P>
      <P>Since then, it has staged more than 2,000 shows in Europe, the U.S. Asia, and
Australia, and has composed more than 155 original pieces of music, Ju said.</P>
      <P>The 56-year-old musician said the group has encountered many frustrations during
the last 25 years, but with the support and encouragement  of its audiences,
"it has made the impossible possible."</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, sometimes it is difficult for the audience to tell the difference
between a mediocre and a good performance, but we always give our audience the
best," he said.</P>
      <P>Now in its 25th year, the group has "grown up" and will continue to expand the
influence of percussion music in Taiwan and give young percussionists a chance
to shine on the local and international stage.</P>
      <P>Ju, who has not performed in public in Taiwan in the last five years, will take
part in the four concerts of classic music that has been tailored for the group
by composers at home and abroad.</P>
      <P>"Speed Drums, " which caused a sensation when it premiered in Seoul in July,
will be on the program.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Ju received a lifetime award from the U.S.-based Percussive Arts
Society (PAS), which is considered the highest honor in the world of percussion
music. He was the first Taiwanese to receive the award from PAS, the largest
percussion music organization in the world.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.67 percent Tuesday amid optimism toward cross
strait economic exchanges after the sixth-round  of high-level talks between
Taiwan and China officially opened, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 59.07 points to the day's high of 8,827.79, off a low of
8,772.59, on turnover of NT$99.36 billion (US$3.32 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 0.39 percent higher and the momentum extended to the end of
the trading session, with buying concentrated on the old economy sector on hopes
that these stocks would further benefit from the fast growing China market,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,445 stocks closed up and 161 down with 423 remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector scored the highest gains, ending up 2.1 percent, led by Far
Eastern New Century, which announced a purified terephthalic acid (PTA) joint
venture with China's Sinopec Yizheng Chemical Fibre Co. Ltd..</P>
      <P>Foodstuff rose 1.4 percent, financial shares added 0.8 percent, construction,
and machinery and electronics stocks rose 0.7 percent, and the cement sector
closed up 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector rose 0.2 percent, while the plastics and chemical
sector closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>"China commands a huge domestic demand market, " Taiwan International Securities
analyst Michael Chiang said, "Traditional industrial companies that have a
foothold on the mainland are expected to reap gains from closer business ties
across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, Far Eastern New Century rose 3.26 percent to
NT$49.15 on a move to take a 60 percent stake in the PTA joint venture that is
expected to produce one million tons of PTA a year, starting from 2013.</P>
      <P>Shinkong Synthetic Fiber rose 3.87 percent to NT$16.10 and Tung Ho Textile
increased 6.77 percent to NT$14.20.</P>
      <P>"Investors are also hoping that Taiwan and China will allow individual Chinese
tourists to visit Taiwan soon, " Chiang said.</P>
      <P>However, as the index moved to the nearest resistance level of 8,900 points,
there seemed to be not much willingness to chase prices, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"The turnover was below NT$100 billion today. Such a quiet market needs some

      <P>Some of the dairy products marketed by three major small- and medium-sized dairy
companies in Taiwan have been found with false manufacturing dates or deferred
expiration dates, the government's consumer protection agency said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a recent inspection of products from five mid-sized dairy companies around
Taiwan, items from three were found to have manufacturing dates that were up to
67 days after the products were actually made.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Cheng-hsueh, a section chief of the Cabinet-level Consumer
Protection Commission,  juice-flavored  preserved milks produced by Tainan
County-based Gau Jiann Food Technical, Ltd. carried manufacturing dates that
were four and 67 days later than the actual production dates.</P>
      <P>The commission ordered Gau Jiann to destroy the products and fined the company
NT$40,000 (US$1,333) for its first mislabeling offense, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the commission  has asked the Tainan County government to monitor
the company's operations and products on a regular basis, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four types of products from the Taiwan Provincial Farmers Association
Dairy Plant in Taichung were found to carry expiration dates that were deferred
by 1-5 days.</P>
      <P>Those dairy products with suspect labeling have already been destroyed, and the
plant was also given an NT$40,000 fine, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The third company, a Pingtung County-based goat milk company known as Baali

      <P>A new agreement between Taiwan and China will create a two-way system for the
immediate  exchange  of information on accidents, disasters and epidemics,
health officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The medical and health care cooperation agreement -- the 15th cross-Taiwan
Strait pact since 2008 -- was signed in a meeting between top negotiators from
Taiwan and China in Taipei Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The agreement opens a window for swift reporting by the health departments on
both sides in emergency situations, said the health officials from both sides
who were at the meeting.</P>
      <P>For example, if a Chinese tour group was hit by a landslide in Taiwan, or
Taiwanese tourists were injured in traffic accidents in China, information such
as the number of people involved and their names would be relayed immediately to
the other side, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the two sides will establish a mechanism for reporting major
outbreaks of diseases such as influenza A(H1N1) and enterovirus, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>Under the medical cooperation agreement, Taiwan and China will also work
together on research for an enterovirus vaccine, they said.</P>
      <P>The health officials who participated in the meeting between the chief
negotiators -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- include Hsiao Mei-ling, vice
minister of Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH), and DOH officials in charge of
food and drug administration and disease control.</P>
      <P>On the Chinese side, the officials were from the General Administration of
Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, and the State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine.</P>
      <P>The meeting, which is being held Dec. 20-22, is the sixth between Chiang and
Chen since June 2008 when cross-strait relations began to warm up.</P>
      <P>The biannual meetings have become part of institutionalized talks between the
SEF and ARATS, two quasi-official intermediary bodies designated to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China have not yet reached common ground on a proposed investment
protection agreement since they began talks on the subject in October, because
of issues that involve sovereignty and China's request for easing of the
restrictions on Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is the same situation as with the proposed double taxation avoidance
agreement that was set aside by Taiwan and China's top negotiators in 2009, but
it has greater implications.</P>
      <P>"The investment protection agreement is a very urgent issue, especially the
aspects concerning compensation for expropriation and protection of personal
safety, " said Jack Yun-jie Lee, head of National Open University's Department
of Public Administration.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan began allowing companies to invest in China in 1991, the number of
disputes and complaints pertaining to property and personal safety risks have
increased every year.</P>
      <P>From 1991 to 2009, more than 1,700 cases of threats to personal safety and 1,000
instances of breach of financial interest have been reported.</P>
      <P>In a survey by Taiwan's General Chamber of Commerce, 70.66 percent of the
Taiwanese businesses in China said they were hardly satisfied with China's
efforts to resolve investment disputes.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwanese companies in China are not categorized as either foreign or
domestic, it is difficult for Taiwan and China to work out the basic aspects of
an investment protection agreement, such as jurisdiction,  investors'
nationality,  and rules  of arbitration, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Another issue that has further complicated the negotiations is whether the
agreement should include investment promotion, which would allow Chinese
companies to invest in areas beyond the current 192 categories in Taiwan, he
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is inclined to set aside the promotion aspect for the time being because
it would involve a long legislative process and policy changes, but China
remains firm on the issue.</P>
      <P>"One of the reasons Taiwan and China have not yet agreed on the issues of
foreign exchange and compensation for expropriation is that we lack bargaining
chips because so few Chinese companies invest in Taiwan," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Because of the political hurdles, the investment protection agreement will not
be finalized in the sixth round of cross-strait negotiations from Dec. 20-22, or
even in the seventh round, said Kao Charng, deputy minister of Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council. In the meantime, Taiwanese companies have no choice but to
endure the hardship they face in China.</P>

      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan said Tuesday it is scheduled to open a Shanghai branch Dec.
29, becoming the first state-owned bank to upgrade its mainland representative
office to a branch.</P>
      <P>In the initial phase, the Shanghai branch will offer funds in foreign currencies
to Taiwanese businesses operating in China, bank spokesman Wu Fu-rong said.</P>
      <P>After one year, the bank is expected to begin to show a profit and will expand
to Chinese yuan business services for Taiwanese customers, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chang-lung, who is currently the director of Land Bank's Shanghai
representative office, will head the new branch, which will be located in
Shanghai's Pudong District.</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan was among the first five Taiwanese banks to gain approval
from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to open branches in China.</P>
      <P>The bank has had a representative office in Shanghai since 2003 and was waiting
for a long time to upgrade to a branch. It is planning a grand opening ceremony
that will be attended by its chairman Wang Yao-shing and other bank officials.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank was also given the green light by Chinese authorities to
open a branch in Shanghai. Cathay United Bank and Chang Hwa Commercial Bank have
obtained approval to set up branches in Kunshan, while Taiwan Cooperative Bank
was given permission to open a branch in Suzhou.</P>
      <P>Under the recent economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan
and China, Taiwanese bank branches in China will be allowed to conduct Chinese
yuan business after two years once they are showing a profit following its
establishment. For other foreign banks, the requirement is three years in
operation.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese banks will also be allowed to conduct business in Chinese yuan
business with Taiwanese investors in China after one year of operation there.</P>
      <P>Wu forecast that his bank's Shanghai branch will double its revenue once it goes
into Chinese yuan business.</P>
      <P>In an earlier statement, the CBRC said it hopes that the presence of Taiwan's
bank branches in China will help promote cross-strait economic and trade
relations and maintain the steady development of the cross-strait banking
sector.</P>

      <P>Representatives of Taiwan and China signed a cross-Taiwan Strait medical and
health cooperation agreement Tuesday to better ensure the safety of medicines

      <P>The deal was signed by Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of Taiwan's Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), and Chen Yunlin, the president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) during their meeting
at Taipei's Grand Hotel, the sixth they have held since June 2008.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, Taiwan and China will work together to control the spread
of contagious diseases and to strengthen the quality control of medicines,
medical equipment, cosmetics and food supplements shipped across the strait.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also facilitate joint efforts to handle accidents involving
people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with mechanisms expected to be
established to help victims in emergencies.</P>
      <P>Another area of cooperation under the agreement will be the research and
development of new medicines.</P>
      <P>Both sides agreed to establish six working groups to take charge of disease
control, drug safety and medical research, traditional Chinese medicine research
and herbal medicine safety, emergency relief, and quarantine issues.</P>
      <P>These working groups will begin to meet within three months after the agreement
goes into effect to exchange information and decide on their modes of operation,
including the groups' liaison officers.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said an important reason for signing this agreement was
to ensure the safety of herbal medicines from China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said the agreement will
effectively stop epidemics originating in China from being imported to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The medical and health cooperation accord was the 15th agreement signed by the

      <P>Investment protection will top the agenda for the next round of high-level talks
between Taiwan and China, an official of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The seventh meeting between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will also address issues regarding
the creation of a mechanism to deal with trade and investment disputes, said SEF
Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian.</P>
      <P>"This was the consensus reached at the just-concluded sixth meeting since 2008
between the top negotiators from the two sides, " Kao said at a news conference
that was held at around noon after the first session.</P>
      <P>The two-hour meeting focused on a bilateral agreement  on cooperation in medical
and health care services, which would be formally signed later in the day, Kao
said.</P>
      <P>The two top negotiators also exchanged views on an investment protection
agreement that the two sides had intended to sign during the current talks but
decided to postpone until they could work out the details, Kao said.</P>
      <P>"They agreed that they should continue negotiations on issues regarding
investment protection so that a formal accord can be sealed in their next
meeting," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, the two negotiators agreed that talks should begin as soon
as possible on further liberalization of trade and services to substantiate the
goals listed in the cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
that was signed on June 29.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China had agreed that follow-up negotiations on the ECFA should start
within six months of it taking effect in September. However, in view of the
complexity of the issues involved in the ECFA follow-up accords, negotiations
are not expected to be finalized before the next round of Chiang-Chen talks, Kao
said.</P>
      <P>"But the two sides have agreed to begin consultations on relevant topics," Kao
added.</P>
      <P>The two sides have also agreed to activate as soon as possible a cross-strait
economic cooperation commission that will address ECFA-related negotiations and
consultations, as required by the pact.</P>
      <P>The meetings between SEF and ARATS heads have become part of institutionalized

      <P>Many people in Taiwan feel the security for the visit of Chinese official Chen
Yunlin has gone "overboard, " the Democratic Progressive  Party said Tuesday,
and it urged the government not to muffle those who oppose its policies.</P>
      <P>"A fundamental tenet of a democratic country is to allow protesting voices to
occur naturally and not to eliminate all opposing forces, " said DPP spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsang on the same day Chen and his Taiwanese counterpart Chiang Pin-
kung held their semi-annual meeting.</P>
      <P>According to a DPP poll, 61.6 percent of 665 respondents said the security
deployment  for Chen,  the head of the Beijing-based Association of Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) who is here for a sixth round of cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiations with Chiang, was "way too much."</P>
      <P>Local newspapers said over 2,500 police officers were mobilized to ensure his
safety during his three-day visit but the Taipei City Police Department said
only 211 officers were dispatched.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP Taipei City councilors who staged a sit-in in front of Chen's
hotel were forcefully evacuated by the police when they refused to comply with
the police request to leave the scene.</P>
      <P>The councilors branded their eviction an "injustice" and said their intention
was to give Chen a petition asking China to stop using President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration to trample on the human rights of Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>A representative  from  the Taiwan-based  Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF)
attempted to ease the tension by accepting the letter but was quickly booed away
by the protesters.</P>
      <P>Members of the Alliance of Referendum for Taiwan also hoisted an oversize banner
on a freeway across from the hotel that said Taiwan is an independent state and
Taiwan and China are two separate countries.</P>
      <P>Accusing the government of removing all Republic of China flags or any national
emblems from places Chen might go during his visit, the DPP's Cheng said the
purpose of security should be to ensure the smoothness of the trip and the
safety of the person.</P>
      <P>"But the government's version of security is to eliminate all forms of protests
so Chen can't hear or see the demonstrators," Cheng argued.</P>
      <P>Chen was in Taiwan for the third time since first visiting in November 2008,
when violent clashes and street protests erupted in Taipei between anti-China

      <P>Over 140 policemen and 200 civilians were reportedly injured in the chaos.</P>
      <P>For Chen's latest visit, the police set up the usual barbed wire fences and

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Tuesday, dropping NT$0.001 to
close at NT$30.600.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$572 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at 30.650 and moved between NT$29.825 and NT$30.655 before

      <P>After the market opened, the New Taiwan dollar extended its upward trend to rise
above the NT$30.00 level against the U.S. dollar on continued inflows of foreign

      <P>A weakening U.S. dollar against other Asian currencies in the region added
downward pressure on the greenback in the local foreign exchange market, they
said.</P>
      <P>A higher local bourse buoyed by optimism over cross-Taiwan Strait ties lent
further support to the local currency after high-level talks between Taiwan and
China officially opened in Taipei Tuesday morning, they added.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 0.67 percent to close at the day's high of 8,827.79.</P>
      <P>In late trade, Taiwan's central bank intervened in the local foreign exchange
market again to push the U.S. dollar higher and back above the NT$30.00 level,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>With the Christmas holiday approaching and many foreign traders sidelined, the
relatively thin trading volume made it easier for the central bank to manipulate

    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal is in the works to request compensation from the Taiwan government
for more than 500,000 veterans who served an extra year in the military during
the 1960s to 1980s.</P>
      <P>According to the draft bill, the government issued an illegal order to force
567,407 soldiers, during the period 1968 to 1986, to serve for three instead of
the two years mandated in the Act of Military Service System.</P>
      <P>Dozens of veterans, aged 43 to 64, attended a public hearing at the Legislative
Yuan Tuesday, saying that the government had treated them unfairly because they
had to spend an extra 12 months of their youth in the military.</P>
      <P>"I missed a lot of time with my wife and sons, " said Liu Tien-kuei, who was
conscripted in 1978 in the military police.</P>
      <P>Seeking to maintain troop levels after the retirement of many of its soldiers
who came to Taiwan from China, the Kuomintang government in 1966 issued a
temporary order for a one-year extension of service in the armored units,
engineering corps, missile troops, artillery, airborne troops, signal troops,
special forces and arsenal. The order was not revoked until 1986.</P>
      <P>According to Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Trong Chai who
initiated the bill, the regulations at that time stipulated that the compulsory
period of service was two years, therefore, the executive order was a clear
violation of the law.</P>
      <P>Trong said that the Ministry  of National  Defense should compensate the
affected veterans for the loss of time and money.</P>
      <P>The legislature's Rules Committee blocked the draft bill from the legislative
agenda Monday, but Chai vowed to forge bipartisan support for the proposal and
put the bill on the agenda next week.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is aiming to have a fully volunteer military service system by 2014 to
replace the current system, which is part volunteer and part conscription.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The command center for dengue fever set up in southern Taiwan in October is
expected to close soon, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Tuesday,
following a gradual decrease in the number of patients in Taiwan infected with
the mosquito-borne disease.</P>
      <P>Although there were 51 new cases of dengue fever originating in Taiwan last
week, it was only a third of the peak period when 150 new cases were reported in
a single week, said Lin Ting, the CDC's deputy director-general, at the agency's
weekly disease monitoring briefing.</P>
      <P>"The decision to close the center will be made by command center members, after
which a proposal will be passed to the Executive Yuan for approval, " said Lin,
expecting the motion to be decided as soon as this Friday.</P>
      <P>Despite the likely disbanding of the command center, Lin said the situation in
Kaohsiung City remained relatively grave, with 40 new dengue fever cases
reported there last week, and would require continued attention.</P>
      <P>But he indicated that the closing of the center would not affect dengue epidemic
prevention measures or weaken the inter-ministerial endeavor to combat the
disease.</P>
      <P>"There are rising signs of imported cases of dengue sufferers, and we fear that
it would lead to more dengue hemorrhagic fever due to cross-infection, " said
Lin, citing a 70-year-old housewife in Tainan County who contracted dengue
hemorrhage last week and is still in intensive care.</P>
      <P>Although dengue fever has shown signs of easing, Lin reminded people to take
precautions against seasonal influenza, which had claimed 261 lives since July.</P>
      <P>"With Christmas around the corner and the weather getting colder, we are about
to enter the peak period for flu infection," Lin said.</P>
      <P>As two more deaths reported were last week, he urged parents to get their
children vaccinated with the three-in-one seasonal flu shot, which protects
against this year's three prevalent virus strains -- H1N1, H3N2, and influenza
B.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun, who was disqualified at this year's
Asian Games, was banned from competition for three months and her coach Liu
Tsung-ta was suspended for one year and eight months, in a ruling released
Tuesday by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF).</P>
      <P>The WTF also fined the Chinese Taipei Taewondo Association US$50,000 because
Yang and Liu protested the decision ringside at the Asiad Nov. 17.</P>
      <P>A three-month suspension means an admonition to Yang since there will be no
major international events in the three months.</P>
      <P>Yang was disqualified on grounds that she had violated the rules by wearing
extra electronic sensors in her socks during the bout to score more points, but
video footage later showed that the sensors were not attached during the match
against her Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>A stunned Yang refused to leave the ring after the decision and the
contradictory statements by the taekwondo officials who were explaining the
disqualification sparked outrage in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The WTF's disciplinary committee met Saturday in Seoul to hear the case and the
committee's  members delivered  their sealed conclusions to the WTF Secretariat
after the meeting.</P>

      <P>Taichung Port reached a milestone Tuesday, as the total volume of cargo it
handled this year exceeded 100 million metric tons, a record that has lifted the
port into second place in Taiwan after Kaohsiung Port.</P>
      <P>A celebratory ceremony was held at the central Taiwan harbor after 26,681-metric
tons of cargo was unloaded from the Wan Hai 305, pushing the cargo volume up to
the new benchmark.</P>
      <P>"It is the best gift for the new special municipality after the merger of
Taichung City and County, " said Minister of Transportation and Communications
Mao Chi-kuo at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>According to the Taichung Harbor Bureau (THB), the total volume of cargo handled
by the port between January and November was 97.65 million metric tons, about 21
percent higher than in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>THB Deputy Director Chen Yi-hsiung said at the event that huge domestic demand
for raw materials was an indicator of economic recovery.</P>
      <P>He said the volume of fuel oil and minerals handled at the port has increased by
69.56 percent and 142.28 percent, respectively, year-on-year.</P>
      <P>The rising number of imported luxury automobiles unloaded at the port in recent

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan urged China Tuesday to speed up implementation of the accords signed
between the two sides over the past two and a half years.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the latest round of highest-level cross-strait
meetings in Taipei, Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin- kung said
the rapprochement that began after President Ma Ying- jeou took office in 2008
has contributed greatly to increasing cultural, scientific, educational, trade
and economic exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, he said, "implementation of some of the accords signed has fallen short
of expectations and needs to be enhanced."</P>
      <P>Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, have forged a total of 14 cross-strait
agreements in their last five meetings.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan and China have joined forces several times to bust cross-
strait fraud rings since a pact on crime-fighting and judicial cooperation was
signed April, 2009, but "there is a long way to go to obtain repatriation of
Taiwanese economic criminals hiding in China," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Many prominent businesspersons who are listed as wanted in Taiwan for committing
serious financial crimes are still in hiding in China.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the cross-strait Air Transportation Agreement inked in
November 2008 to open direct air links and expand tourism exchanges between the
two sides, saying the number of cross-strait flights needs to be increased to
meet market demand.</P>
      <P>Over 1.74 million Chinese tourists have visited Taiwan since a tourism deal was
concluded in May 2008, but the number is still lower than expected and the
measure is yet to be expanded, especially to allow individual Chinese tourist to
visit Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, a maximum of 3,000 Chinese tourists are allowed into Taiwan each day
in tour groups. Taiwan's tourism sector has been asking that the number be
increased and that the process of allowing individual visits be speeded up.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said that most of the cross-strait agreements have been well
implemented but "it would be difficult for all details of the pacts to be
implemented 100 percent."</P>
      <P>He said he agreed with Chiang that both sides should establish a mechanism to
monitor the implementation of the agreements.</P>
      <P>In addition, in future negotiations, the two sides should focus more on ways of
increasing cultural exchanges, he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's chief negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, said after his arrival in
Taipei Monday for a new round of talks with his Taiwanese counterpart that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should expand the scale and scope of their
economic exchanges and cooperation next year when China's 12th five-year plan
will formally kick off.</P>
      <P>It marked  the first  time that Chen,  president  of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , has publicly
invited Taiwanese investors to take part in China's new development plan.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, an economics official warned that Taiwan could become even more
reliant on China for merchandise production if Taiwanese companies continue
their current practice of "duplicating" their Taiwan-based production lines in
China while suspending their development of new production technology.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting China's economic development, social harmony and
stability, the 12th five-year plan is also expected to generate new
opportunities for cross-strait economic cooperation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"If our two sides expand the scale and intensity of economic exchanges and
cooperation, we will be able to cope with challenges and uncertainty lying ahead
in the coming year," Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to reports released by Beijing authorities, the 12th five-year plan
will focus on developing  several key emerging industries, including a new
generation of Internet technology, biomedicine and clean energy-powered
automobiles. (Dec. 21, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) showed that local
manufacturers received US$35.74 billion worth of export orders in November, the
second highest monthly record in Taiwan's trade history.</P>
      <P>The amount also marked a 14.34 percent year-on-year growth. Export orders from
China, which saw a decline in October, registered a double-digit year-on-year
growth in November.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy was that the ratio of overseas production in November further
expanded to 50.95 percent in November. The ratio in the information and
communication technology (ICT) sector even reached 83.32 percent.</P>
      <P>"The percentage could surge further in the future, " forecast Huang Chi-shih,
director of the MOEA's Statistics Department.</P>
      <P>An MOEA official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that in the past,
local manufacturers adopt a vertical division of labor model in operating their
production lines in Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The practice has, however, been gradually replaced by the practice of horizontal
division of labor with local companies "duplicating" their home-based production
lines in China.</P>
      <P>If local companies  fail to continue  developing  advanced production
technologies, the official said Taiwan could become increasingly reliant on
China for merchandise production.</P>
      <P>In the past the ratio hovered around 40 percent. Thanks to a worldwide economic
recovery, the ratio has stayed above 50 percent since March.</P>
      <P>Under this trend, large business groups may continue making money while
contributing little to improving domestic job opportunities, the official said,
adding that the effective way to resolve the issue lies in upgrading added value
of Taiwan-produced products and investing more in research and development.

    <HEADLINE>Slower GDP growth of 4.24 percent forecast for 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The growth of Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2011 is expected to slow
down from a year earlier to 4.24 percent largely on slowing global demand, the
Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The institute in June raised its forecast for Taiwan's 2010 economic growth from
5.88 percent to 10.03 percent on strong rebound in exports after the global
financial meltdown in 2008-2009.</P>
      <P>However, the momentum of exports is likely to fade to some extent next year as
global demand could be compromised by a slowing U.S. economy and the lingering
impact of the debt problems in Europe, the TRI said.</P>
      <P>The institute said the rising price of raw materials due to abnormal  global
weather is likely to put upward pressure on production costs for local
manufacturers, which in turn could undermine Taiwan's exports.</P>
      <P>As the U.S. has stepped up with its second round of quantitative easing by
pumping funds into the market to boost its economy, idle money is expected to
continue to spread to the markets in Asia and further lift the value of Asian
currencies, the think tank said.</P>
      <P>As a result, the average value of the New Taiwan dollar could rise to NT$29.23
against the U.S. dollar early in 2011 and hover around NT$29.00 in the second
half of the year.</P>
      <P>A strong New Taiwan dollar is expected  to hurt Taiwan's exporters' global
competitiveness and further drag down the island's exports.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, another think tank, Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, predicted that Taiwan's 2011 GDP will grow 4.55 percent, slowing from
the estimated 9.64 percent for 2010.</P>
      <P>In November, the government revised downward its economic growth forecast for
2011 to 4.51 percent from a previous estimate of 4.64 percent.</P>
      <P>The government has forecast economic growth of 9.98 for 2010 from the previous
year.</P>

      <P>Employees gave Taiwan's job market 64.4 points on a 100-point scale, with more
than one third of them scoring it below 60 points and 27.5 percent grading it at
71-80 points, a recent poll showed.</P>
      <P>According to the survey released Tuesday by the Yes123.com.tw job service, 16.1
percent of Taiwanese office workers said the only thing that keeps them in their
current jobs is the salary "and nothing else."</P>
      <P>The most attractive aspects of their jobs include "short distance from home, "
according to 17.4 percent of the respondents, "getting along well with co-
workers (12.1 percent) and "room for personal development" (11 percent).</P>
      <P>What they find most dissatisfying are poor employee benefits (21.5 percent), no
room for personal development (14.6 percent) and lousy bosses (12.2 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey found that the five leading reasons that prompt office workers to
change jobs are good year-end bonuses (59.1 percent) , dividends (48.8 percent)
, good bonuses for the three main festivals (48.1 percent), good opportunities
for promotion (44. 2 percent), and a good working environment in which they can
get along well with co-workers (35 percent).</P>
      <P>Chiu Wen-jen, deputy CEO of Yes123.com.tw, said "good pay, little responsibility
and short distance from home" have always been the major attractions for
Taiwanese office workers and the latest survey shows "good pay" is still the
primary motive for job seekers.</P>
      <P>However, under the globalization trend, Chiu said, it is no longer practical to
expect to land a job that is not time-consuming or not too far from home.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, people simply hope to have a job that offers good benefits and
a good working atmosphere in which they can get along well with their co-
workers, he said. The major attractions have thus become "good pay, good co-
workers, and good/caring bosses, " he said.</P>
      <P>Yes123.com.tw conducted the survey online from Nov. 29 through Dec. 6,
collecting 2,219 valid samples. The poll had a confidence level of 95 percent
and a margin of error of plus or minus 2.07 percentage points.</P>

      <P>Terry Guo, chairman of the Foxconn Group, was voted the most charismatic boss by
Taiwanese workers, the results of an online survey showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Twenty-one percent of the respondents in the Yes123 job bank poll said they

      <P>Yulong Group Chairman Kenneth Yen was second with 10.9 percent of the votes and
Yu Yun-chie, an entertainment agent who is former TV host, was third.</P>
      <P>Although Guo is known as a tough boss, his company was voted as the second most
attractive corporation in Taiwan because of the generous prize money it gives
away at its year-end party, said Chiu Wen-jen, the job bank's deputy CEO.</P>
      <P>Last year the top prize was 200,000 shares of the company's stocks, valued at
NT$26.9 million (US$900,000).</P>
      <P>Guo's personal fame has also helped the company's ranking, Chiu added.</P>
      <P>The company that most workers want to get into is the world's largest contract
chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), as indicated by 16.8
percent of the respondents, followed by Foxconn with 15 percent and Google with

      <P>Taiwanese brands have been working with partners in South Asian countries for
the first time as part of the government's  efforts  to  promote  Taiwan's
information  and communication technology (ICT) products in the emerging market,
the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The logo "Taiwan Excellence, " which is being used to brand the unique designs
of Taiwan's ICT products, has become more popular in Vietnam, Indonesia and
India since the implementation of a new marketing project, TAITRA Vice Chairman
Wu Wen-ya said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has also recruited three local celebrities -- Indonesian star Cathy
Sharon, Indian movie star Lara Dutta and Vietnamese beauty queen Huong Giang --
to serve as spokespersons for Taiwanese products at 18 promotional events in the
three countries this year, which attracted a total of 420,000 visitors, Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, 19 Taiwanese ICT operators, including Asustek Computer
Inc., Micro-Star International Co. (MSI) and BenQ, have taken part in a project
to sell their innovative products in local chain stores, shopping malls and
retailers in the three countries.</P>
      <P>For the first time, Taiwanese brands are selling their products in southeast
Asian markets using a business-to-consumer promotional approach instead of the
business-to-business model, said the Bureau of Foreign Trade, which is
overseeing the project, in a statement.</P>

      <P>A cross-strait Economic Cooperation Committee will be established "very soon, "
Vice Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Kao Koong-lian said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and China negotiators are close to agreement with regard to the EEC, and

      <P>Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun was given a three-month suspension
Tuesday by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) for protesting her
disqualification during the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, the Sports Affairs
Council (SAC) said Tuesday at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Yang was punished for staging a sit-in protest in the competition area Nov. 17
after she was disqualified on grounds of wearing extra electronic sensors in her
socks.</P>
      <P>The WTF ruling means that Yang will not be allowed to compete in any
international sports events for the next three months. Her coach Liu Tsung-ta
was slapped with a 20-month suspension, effective immediately.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA)  was fined US$50,000 for
"negligence and wrongdoing, " according to an email sent Tuesday by the WTF to
inform the CTTA of its ruling.</P>
      <P>In the email, WTF President Choue Chungwon also said that the committee had
"found evidence of various attempts, in particular in the Taiwan media,  to
negatively incite and manipulate public perceptions."</P>
      <P>According to the WTF, it's Sanctions Committee found Yang guilty of two separate
violations -- using illegal equipment and interfering with the management of the
competition.</P>
      <P>"The suspension is not likely to affect my chances of competing in the 2014
London Olympics, but I feel sorry for my coach because he is obliged to stand up
for his athletes, " said Yang, with tears rolling down her cheeks at the hastily
called press conference.</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, said that despite the "light" suspension, the WTF's accusation of her
cheating was hard to swallow. "But it seems that I can't do anything at this
moment to prove my innocence," she said.</P>
      <P>Yang said she will have to consider whether or not to try to participate in the
London Olympics.</P>
      <P>CTTA President Chen Chien-ping said at the press conference that the penalty was
"harsher than we had expected" but the CTTA was ready to pay the fine before the
Jan. 31, 2011 deadline to ensure the participation of Taiwan athletes in future
competitions.</P>
      <P>SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the 20-month suspension against Liu was a severe
punishment and the SAC and the CTTA are mulling their next move to overturn the
decision.</P>
      <P>The WTF's Sanction Committee, comprising Egyptian, Israel and Turkish officials,
reviewed the Yang issue Dec. 18 in Seoul, South Korea in a meeting that included
Yang, Liu and Chen.</P>
      <P>WTF officials said Yang had violated the competition rules by wearing extra
electronic sensors on her socks during her opening bout to score more points,
but video footage later showed she did not have the sensors on during the match.</P>
      <P>After the decision, Yang refused to leave the ring. Contradictory statements by
taekwondo officials explaining the disqualification later sparked outrage in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has officially filed an appeal with the Lausanne-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport against the disqualification.</P>

      <P>Beginning on January 1, 2011, the number of Chinese tourists allowed to enter
Taiwan each day will increase by 1,000 to 4,000, according to an agreement
reached between the two sides Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The increase is part of the agreements sealed in the sixth round of meetings
between top negotiators from Taiwan and China since June 2008. The current talks
are being held at Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Formal talks between the negotiators -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) --
began Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed to move quickly on negotiations on Taiwan's plan to
allow visits by individual Chinese travelers, saying the plan would be
implemented as soon as there is an appropriate date next year.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Chiang said the plan for individual Chinese tourists  to
visit designated  locations  would likely materialize around June.</P>
      <P>The original target date was around the Lantern Festival on February 17, but
there was not enough time for preparations, he said.</P>
      <P>With the approach of lunar New Year holidays in early February, both sides
agreed to start negotiations in the next few days on a proposal to increase the
number of cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>The decision to increase the daily number of Chinese tourists is applauded by
local tour operators, some of whom call for a review in six months leading to a
further increase.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary general of the Travel Agent Association of Taiwan, said
travel agencies had hoped for the daily quota to be expanded to 5,000.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuang-tsai of the Taipei-based Lion Travel Service Co. said, however, after
taking into consideration the current capacity of domestic hotels and tour
buses, he thinks the ceiling of 4,000 Chinese tourist visits per day is
appropriate.</P>

      <P>Principal Wu Chia-ku of Bade Junior High School in Taoyuan County was removed
from her post by the Ministry of Education Tuesday and ordered to wait for an
investigation into her alleged mishandling of a series of bullying incidents at
the school.</P>
      <P>Yu was suspended from the post after a Ministry of Education (MOE) meeting that
was held to discuss the matter. An MOE team is expected to investigate the
allegations and submit a report in a week's time.</P>
      <P>The principal came under investigation after 64 teachers from the school sent a
petition Monday to Legislator Lo Shu-lei, accusing Yu of repeatedly turning a
blind eye to campus bullying, and demanding that she be relieved of her duties.</P>
      <P>The teachers said they had received death threats from students whom they had
disciplined. It was the second report of violence at the school in a week.</P>
      <P>Last week, the media reported that a drop-out from the school was being bullied
and had been forced to take nude photos. Images of the victim being abused were
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>In an address to students and teachers of the school, Education Minister Wu
Ching-ji said Tuesday that "school campuses must not be allowed to become
lawless or unsafe environments."</P>
      <P>The minister made an urgent visit to the school after the news of the teachers'
petition broke Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He suggested that schools call in law enforcement personnel if students breach
the law. He urged teachers not to shirk their responsibility of educating
students, saying students must be taught to have respect for the law, human
rights, gender equality and life and this requires the joint efforts of
families, schools and society.</P>
      <P>"Most of the problematic students have trouble within their families and they
tend to misbehave at school and could become lawbreakers when they enter the
wider society," he added.</P>
      <P>Admitting that campus bullying has grown more serious than he had imagined,
Minister Wu said a national meeting of junior high school principals will be
held next Monday to discuss ways of dealing effectively with the problem.</P>
      <P>"Qualified teachers should have the skills to deal with campus bullying," he
said.</P>

      <P>An amendment bill cleared the legislative floor Monday, paving the way for more
women's restrooms to be installed in public places.</P>
      <P>According to the newly passed amendment to the Building Act, public facilities
such as theaters and schools should have separate restrooms for males and
females in a ratio of 1: 5, while smaller areas such as offices and restaurants
should maintain a ratio of 1:3.</P>
      <P>The washrooms are expected to be in place within five years, according to the
law.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the passage of the bill,  ruling Kuomintang Legislator Daniel
Hwang said a similar regulation under the Building Act has been in place for the
past five years, but since it was an administrative decree, it was not
necessarily followed, especially in cases where there were insufficient funds.</P>
      <P>However, once the new law takes effect, budgets would have to be allocated for
the relevant renovations, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) said a restroom
remodeling project is underway at the Taipei Railway Station to change the men's
to women's restroom ratio from the current 20: 48 to 23: 61. In addition, two
restrooms for families and the disabled will be built and more diaper changing
rooms will be added, he said.</P>
      <P>The remodeling project is expected to be completed before the end of September
2011, the TRA said.</P>

      <P>A never-seen-before performance combining music, dance, fireworks, and
multimedia technology will take place at Taipei's Dachia Riverside Park on the
night of Dec. 31 to mark the beginning of the country's centenary celebrations,
the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A brainchild of top artists from Asia including Lin Hwai-min, Lin Keh-hua, Cai
Guo-qiang, Leo Cheung, and Wang Chia-min, the New Year's Eve celebration is a
50-minute, four-act show that seeks to "convey the cultural depth of Taiwan and
its people, " CCA Minister Emile Sheng said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"This is a performance without any superstars or celebrities," he said. "But
nearly 1,000 technical staff and performers will put on a show the likes of
which have never been seen before."</P>
      <P>The world's largest water screen, which is 200 meters wide, will be set up along
the Keelung River and openly viewed for the first time at the performance. The
names of 100,000 citizens and the performance of the night will be projected
onto the giant screen.</P>
      <P>The show will begin with the singing of the mother of aboriginal singer
Samingad, followed by a dance, a drumming performance, and an ensemble of 400
children singing with Samingad in act four.</P>
      <P>U-Theatre  founder-director  Liu Ruo-yu told reporters that drummers will have
part of their bodies submerged in water for two minutes during their 10-minute
segment, creating a very different sound.</P>
      <P>Lin Keh-hua, artistic director of the New Year's Eve celebration, said the
performance is about the relationship between people, Mother Nature and the
universe, and through the combination of technology and art, he promises a
splendid and spectacular night on the last day of the year.</P>
      <P>Lin said the fireworks designed by Cai is certainly one of the highlights of the
show, but when it is time for the final countdown, there will be a climax and
"everything happens." Lin refused to give any details.</P>
      <P>With only 8,500 seats set up for the outdoor performance, the best way for most
people to enjoy it will be sitting at home and watching the live TV broadcast,
the CCA advised.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was established on Jan. 1, 1912 following the overthrow of
the Ching dynasty and encompassed mainland China until 1949.</P>
      <P>After losing a civil war to the Communists that year, Chiang Kai-shek and his

      <P>The WTF ruling means that Yang will not be allowed to compete in any
international sports events for the next three months. Her coach Liu Tsung-ta
was slapped with a 20-month suspension, effective immediately.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA)  was fined US$50,000 for
"negligence and wrongdoing, " according to an email sent Tuesday by the WTF to
inform the CTTA of its ruling.</P>
      <P>In the email, WTF President Choue Chungwon also said that the committee had
"found evidence of various attempts, in particular in the Taiwan media,  to
negatively incite and manipulate public perceptions."</P>
      <P>According to the WTF, it's Sanctions Committee found Yang guilty of two separate
violations -- using illegal equipment and interfering with the management of the
competition.</P>
      <P>"The suspension is not likely to affect my chances of competing in the 2014
London Olympics, but I feel sorry for my coach because he is obliged to stand up
for his athletes, " said Yang, with tears rolling down her cheeks at the hastily
called press conference.</P>
      <P>Yang, 25, said that despite the "light" suspension, the WTF's accusation of her
cheating was hard to swallow. "But it seems that I can't do anything at this
moment to prove my innocence," she said.</P>
      <P>Yang said she will have to consider whether or not to try to participate in the
London Olympics.</P>
      <P>CTTA President Chen Chien-ping said at the press conference that the penalty was
"harsher than we had expected" but the CTTA was ready to pay the fine before the
Jan. 31, 2011 deadline to ensure the participation of Taiwan athletes in future
competitions.</P>
      <P>SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling said the 20-month suspension against Liu was a severe
punishment and the SAC and the CTTA are mulling their next move to overturn the
decision.</P>
      <P>The WTF's Sanction Committee, comprising Egyptian, Israel and Turkish officials,
reviewed the Yang issue Dec. 18 in Seoul, South Korea in a meeting that included
Yang, Liu and Chen.</P>
      <P>WTF officials said Yang had violated the competition rules by wearing extra
electronic sensors on her socks during her opening bout to score more points,
but video footage later showed she did not have the sensors on during the match.</P>
      <P>After the decision, Yang refused to leave the ring. Contradictory statements by
taekwondo officials explaining the disqualification later sparked outrage in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has officially filed an appeal with the Lausanne-based Court of
Arbitration for Sport against the disqualification.</P>

      <P>Beginning on January 1, 2011, the number of Chinese tourists allowed to enter
Taiwan each day will increase by 1,000 to 4,000, according to an agreement
reached between the two sides Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The increase is part of the agreements sealed in the sixth round of meetings
between top negotiators from Taiwan and China since June 2008. The current talks
are being held at Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Formal talks between the negotiators -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-
based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin, president of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) --
began Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The two sides also agreed to move quickly on negotiations on Taiwan's plan to
allow visits by individual Chinese travelers, saying the plan would be
implemented as soon as there is an appropriate date next year.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Chiang said the plan for individual Chinese tourists  to
visit designated  locations  would likely materialize around June.</P>
      <P>The original target date was around the Lantern Festival on February 17, but
there was not enough time for preparations, he said.</P>
      <P>With the approach of lunar New Year holidays in early February, both sides
agreed to start negotiations in the next few days on a proposal to increase the
number of cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>The decision to increase the daily number of Chinese tourists is applauded by
local tour operators, some of whom call for a review in six months leading to a
further increase.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kao-ching, secretary general of the Travel Agent Association of Taiwan, said
travel agencies had hoped for the daily quota to be expanded to 5,000.</P>
      <P>Lee Kuang-tsai of the Taipei-based Lion Travel Service Co. said, however, after
taking into consideration the current capacity of domestic hotels and tour
buses, he thinks the ceiling of 4,000 Chinese tourist visits per day is
appropriate.</P>

      <P>Principal Wu Chia-ku of Bade Junior High School in Taoyuan County was removed
from her post by the Ministry of Education Tuesday and ordered to wait for an
investigation into her alleged mishandling of a series of bullying incidents at
the school.</P>
      <P>Yu was suspended from the post after a Ministry of Education (MOE) meeting that
was held to discuss the matter. An MOE team is expected to investigate the
allegations and submit a report in a week's time.</P>
      <P>The principal came under investigation after 64 teachers from the school sent a
petition Monday to Legislator Lo Shu-lei, accusing Yu of repeatedly turning a
blind eye to campus bullying, and demanding that she be relieved of her duties.</P>
      <P>The teachers said they had received death threats from students whom they had
disciplined. It was the second report of violence at the school in a week.</P>
      <P>Last week, the media reported that a drop-out from the school was being bullied
and had been forced to take nude photos. Images of the victim being abused were
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>In an address to students and teachers of the school, Education Minister Wu
Ching-ji said Tuesday that "school campuses must not be allowed to become
lawless or unsafe environments."</P>
      <P>The minister made an urgent visit to the school after the news of the teachers'
petition broke Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He suggested that schools call in law enforcement personnel if students breach
the law. He urged teachers not to shirk their responsibility of educating
students, saying students must be taught to have respect for the law, human
rights, gender equality and life and this requires the joint efforts of
families, schools and society.</P>
      <P>"Most of the problematic students have trouble within their families and they
tend to misbehave at school and could become lawbreakers when they enter the
wider society," he added.</P>
      <P>Admitting that campus bullying has grown more serious than he had imagined,
Minister Wu said a national meeting of junior high school principals will be
held next Monday to discuss ways of dealing effectively with the problem.</P>
      <P>"Qualified teachers should have the skills to deal with campus bullying," he
said.</P>

      <P>An amendment bill cleared the legislative floor Monday, paving the way for more
women's restrooms to be installed in public places.</P>
      <P>According to the newly passed amendment to the Building Act, public facilities
such as theaters and schools should have separate restrooms for males and
females in a ratio of 1: 5, while smaller areas such as offices and restaurants
should maintain a ratio of 1:3.</P>
      <P>The washrooms are expected to be in place within five years, according to the
law.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the passage of the bill,  ruling Kuomintang Legislator Daniel
Hwang said a similar regulation under the Building Act has been in place for the
past five years, but since it was an administrative decree, it was not
necessarily followed, especially in cases where there were insufficient funds.</P>
      <P>However, once the new law takes effect, budgets would have to be allocated for
the relevant renovations, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) said a restroom
remodeling project is underway at the Taipei Railway Station to change the men's
to women's restroom ratio from the current 20: 48 to 23: 61. In addition, two
restrooms for families and the disabled will be built and more diaper changing
rooms will be added, he said.</P>
      <P>The remodeling project is expected to be completed before the end of September
2011, the TRA said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. also said that it will renovate its restrooms

      <P>A never-seen-before performance combining music, dance, fireworks, and
multimedia technology will take place at Taipei's Dachia Riverside Park on the
night of Dec. 31 to mark the beginning of the country's centenary celebrations,
the Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A brainchild of top artists from Asia including Lin Hwai-min, Lin Keh-hua, Cai
Guo-qiang, Leo Cheung, and Wang Chia-min, the New Year's Eve celebration is a
50-minute, four-act show that seeks to "convey the cultural depth of Taiwan and
its people, " CCA Minister Emile Sheng said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>"This is a performance without any superstars or celebrities," he said. "But
nearly 1,000 technical staff and performers will put on a show the likes of
which have never been seen before."</P>
      <P>The world's largest water screen, which is 200 meters wide, will be set up along
the Keelung River and openly viewed for the first time at the performance. The
names of 100,000 citizens and the performance of the night will be projected
onto the giant screen.</P>
      <P>The show will begin with the singing of the mother of aboriginal singer
Samingad, followed by a dance, a drumming performance, and an ensemble of 400
children singing with Samingad in act four.</P>
      <P>U-Theatre  founder-director  Liu Ruo-yu told reporters that drummers will have
part of their bodies submerged in water for two minutes during their 10-minute
segment, creating a very different sound.</P>
      <P>Lin Keh-hua, artistic director of the New Year's Eve celebration, said the
performance is about the relationship between people, Mother Nature and the
universe, and through the combination of technology and art, he promises a
splendid and spectacular night on the last day of the year.</P>
      <P>Lin said the fireworks designed by Cai is certainly one of the highlights of the
show, but when it is time for the final countdown, there will be a climax and
"everything happens." Lin refused to give any details.</P>
      <P>With only 8,500 seats set up for the outdoor performance, the best way for most
people to enjoy it will be sitting at home and watching the live TV broadcast,
the CCA advised.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China was established on Jan. 1, 1912 following the overthrow of
the Ching dynasty and encompassed mainland China until 1949.</P>
      <P>After losing a civil war to the Communists that year, Chiang Kai-shek and his
Kuomintang forces retreated to Taiwan where the ROC has continued to exist.</P>

      <P>The sixth round of talks between the chief negotiators of Taiwan and China,
Chiang Pin-kung and Chen Yunlin, concluded Tuesday with the signing of a medical
and health care cooperation agreement. Though the limited number of agreements
reached has drawn much criticism, it nevertheless highlights the necessity to
adjust the cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue mechanism.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on future agreements are expected to become more and more
difficult. Examples are the suspension of negotiations on a double taxation
avoidance  agreement and the slow progress in negotiations on an investment
protection pact. Similar deadlocks are bound to emerge in upcoming negotiations
on trade in goods and services.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the two sides should stop setting a time frame for
completing negotiations, and future dates for the Chiang-Chen talks should be
flexibly arranged instead of meeting regularly twice a year.</P>
      <P>With a total of 15 agreements having been sealed through six rounds of Chiang-
Chen talks, implementing these pacts will be a more important issue than
promoting new ones. Using the dialogue platform to regularly review the progress
of implementation will ensure that the agreements produce their best results.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, cross-strait negotiations on political issues, such as the signing
of a peace accord and setting up military confidence building measures, will
probably become unavoidable in the future. It is therefore imperative for the
government to properly plan and prepare for them. There should be no further
delay based on the pretext "the time is not ripe for cross-strait political
talks."</P>

January.</P>

      <P>The preferential treatment does not extend, however, to the small minority of
holders of Taiwan passports that do not have an identity card number.</P>
      <P>To include Taiwan in the visa-waiver program, the EU added it to the list of
countries eligible for the program in Annex II of the regulations under the
category "Entities and territorial authorities that are not recognized as states
by at least one member state."</P>
      <P>The visa waiver allows local travelers to enter countries covered under the
exemption for up to 90 days within a six-month period without a visa.</P>
      <P>The exemption applies to 25 Schengen Area countries, comprising 22 EU member
states and three non-EU states -- Norway, Iceland and Switzerland -- and three
non-Schengen EU member states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It also includes seven smaller European countries and territories -- the
Vatican, Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands.</P>
      <P>Because the EU is Taiwan's fourth largest trade partner, the visa-waiver
treatment is expected to have a positive effect on bilateral commerce and
tourism.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said earlier this month that the EU visa exemption is an
important milestone in the country's diplomatic history, one that he believed
would contribute to bilateral trade and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>The visa exemption drive took off in July when the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, put forth a concrete bill to include Taiwan in the visa-waiver
program.</P>
      <P>The proposal then went through a 15-step process and cleared its last hurdle on
Nov. 25 when the Council of the European Union passed it unanimously without
debate.</P>
      <P>European Parliament Speaker Jerzy Buzek and Belgian Secretary of State for EU
Affairs Oliver Chastel signed the bill on Taiwan's inclusion in the EU visa-
waiver program in Strasbourg, France Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>The EU inclusion brings the number of countries and territories offering
Taiwanese citizens visa exemptions to 96, with 75 granting Taiwan passport
holders visa-waiver privileges and 21 others allowing travelers to obtain visas
at their ports of entry.</P>

      <P>Sino-American Silicon Products Inc. (ASA) said Tuesday it is planning to
publicly list Texas-based subsidiary  GlobiTech Inc.  on the back of the unit's
strong profitability and mentioned Taiwan as a possible target.</P>
      <P>SAS Chairman M.K. Lu said his company did not rule out having GlobiTech, a
provider of silicon epitaxy products, launch a primary listing on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony launching GlobiTech's second plant, Lu said the U.S. unit
is expected to deliver a return on equity (ROE) of 20 percent in 2010 and 35
percent in 2011, after turning a profit last year.</P>
      <P>SAS acquired financially troubled GlobiTech for US$45 million (NT$1.19 billion)
in April 2008 and helped turned the company around to post net earnings of about
US$1 million in 2009.</P>
      <P>Lu said GlobiTech is expecting net income of US$11 million on sales of US$72
million in 2010, and he predicted sales would rise to US$100 million in 2011.</P>
      <P>He said the company's sales per employee exceeded NT$20 million (US$669,482) ,
even higher than SAS's sales per employee of NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, because GlobiTech procures 90 percent of its silicon wafer
needs from SAS, the acquisition had created synergies for both companies.</P>
      <P>GlobiTech President Doris Hsu said GlobiTech will serve as a "golden key" for
SAS to gain access to global buyers, as GlobiTech's customers include Texas
Instruments, NXP Semiconductor and SoiTech Corp.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is willing to share its experiences with Burkina Faso in the development
of the photovoltaic industry and work with it to establish the sector in the
West African country, Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Enjoying abundant sunlight, Africa is a good place to develop the industry that
creates electricity in the most modern way, Wu said while discussing a visit the
previous night to a city road equipped with solar street lamps -- gifts from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lucas Chiu, the general manager of Taiwan-based Speed Tech Corp. who had
accompanied Wu on his trip to Africa, said Burkina Faso has an average of six
hours of sunlight per day, higher than in Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and its
neighbors  and highly favorable for the development of solar power.</P>
      <P>With one hour of sunlight, a photovoltaic product can work for three to four
hours, said Chiu, who disclosed that his company is preparing to build a factory
in Burkina Faso to produce photovoltaic devices and equipment.</P>
      <P>Wu, heading an 18-member delegation, is on a one-week visit to the diplomatic
ally. He represented President Ma Ying-jeou at the inauguration ceremony of
Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore on Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>Wu is the first Taiwanese premier to visit the West African ally since the two
countries resumed diplomatic ties in 1994.</P>
      <P>Earlier Tuesday, Wu conferred the Order of Brilliant Star on his Burkinabe

      <P>China's chief negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, visited the Taipei
International Flora Exposition Wednesday amid tight security in anticipation of
protests by pro-independence groups.</P>
      <P>Chen, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait, was accompanied by his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange Foundation
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>It was Chen's last stop on his three-day visit to Taiwan, during which he
participated in a sixth round of talks with Chiang and signed a medical and
health care cooperation agreement with Taiwan on behalf of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was deeply impressed with the creativity, new technologies and care
and concern for humanity displayed by the Flora Expo.</P>
      <P>According to Hau, Chen promised to publicize the exhibition's "power of beauty"
to the Chinese people after returning to China.</P>
      <P>The mayor said Chen was received as an important guest, but no special
arrangements were made to prevent him from seeing the Republic of China flag.</P>
      <P>A total of 394 policemen were dispatched inside and outside the exhibition areas
as well as major road junctions leading to the areas, according to the Taipei
City Police Department.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the large police force was aimed at protecting Chen's safety and
preventing any possible accidents, police said.</P>
      <P>Two groups of protesters waited to no avail for Chen on Zhongshan North Road and
at the expo's main entrance, because of the tactics adopted by police.</P>
      <P>Also Wednesday, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah told legislators that 1,525
policemen were deployed to maintain security during this latest visit by Chen,
compared with 6,131 officers during his previous visit in 2009 and 8,752
officers during his first visit in 2008.</P>
      <P>The declining need for a huge police deployment indicates that cross-Taiwan
Strait talks are becoming increasingly acceptable to Taiwanese society, with
protesters gradually replacing violent means of protest with more peaceful ones,
Jiang said.</P>
      <P>On an incident in which a protester who shouted "Taiwan, China, one country on
either side" was moved away by police, the minister explained that the action
was taken because the protester was trying to break through a police blockade
rather than because he shouted the pro-independence slogan.</P>

      <P>China Airlines, one of Taiwan's leading international airlines, will launch
regularly scheduled flights between Taipei and Wuhan, China on Jan. 26, 2011,
the company said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The carrier will operate two round-trip flights a week to Wuhan, which will
become its 17th destination in China.</P>
      <P>China Airlines said the new route reflected its interest in adding flights to
second-tier Chinese cities, such as Wuhan, and in taking advantage of growing
demand from the tourism sector for flights between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>It sees Wuhan, one of China's ancient cities, as an attractive destination
because it has long been a tourism center and is the largest city in central
China.</P>
      <P>The city is also conveniently  located  and offers  quick connections northward
to Beijing, southward to Guangzhou, eastward to Shanghai and westward to
Chongqing, the carrier said.</P>
      <P>China Airlines said it will offer a 12 percent discount on economy class fares
on the new route, to be served by Airbus A330-300 aircraft, until the end of
February.</P>

      <P>The Executive Yuan has paid close attention to a recently reported case of
bullying at a junior high school in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan, and has
vowed to eliminate violence from the campus, according to a statement released
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It has ordered the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) to work out measures and an efficient mechanism to stop campus bullying,
the statement said.</P>
      <P>Such bullying has undergone a substantial negative change in terms of the
behavior, scale and frequency of occurrence in Taiwan, according to the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>No time should be wasted in resolving the problem, the Executive Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Last week, local media reported that a drop-out from Bade Junior High School was
being bullied by a group of students and had been forced to pose for nude
photos.</P>
      <P>The MOE removed school principal Wu Chia-ku from her post Tuesday after 64
teachers from the school sent a joint petition to a lawmaker the previous day,
accusing her of repeatedly turning a blind eye to the worsening campus bullying.</P>
      <P>The teachers said they had also received death threats from students they had
disciplined. It was the second report of violence at the school in a week.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-ji said Wednesday that it has instructed  the
National  Police Agency  to have local police departments around the country put
elementary and middle high schools on the list of their regular patrol
checkpoints.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOE has activated a national emergency reporting mechanism for
campus bullying to allow the relevant authorities to take immediate response
measures, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>"Only with determination can we make bullying disappear, " he said while

      <P>A Taiwanese LED street lamp alliance reportedly has signed a letter of intent
with a Taiwan affairs task force under China's Fujian provincial government on
cooperation in building a world-class LED lighting company.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan alliance is eyeing the potential 500 billion yuan (NT$2.3 trillion)
opportunity in the sector expected to be generated by China's next five-year
development plan, which includes upgrading the LED industry as one of its major
goals.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, China Postal Airlines inaugurated direct flight services
between Fuzhou,  Fujian Province  and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport to
meet the rapidly growing demand for speedy postal services amid increasing trade
and tourism exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, following the signing of an agreement in Taipei on cross-strait
medical and health care cooperation on Tuesday, China's Ministry of Health
announced that it will unveil a set of regulations in January that will help
facilitate the development of Taiwan-funded hospitals in China.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Upstream LED company Epistar revealed Tuesday that China's central government
held its first-ever open tender for LED products in November.  Although  all of
the 28 winning  bidders  were Chinese-funded companies, many of them have
promised to use Epistar's crystalline grains.</P>
      <P>That means that the company will be able to take part in China's government-
funded green light projects, an Epistar executive said,</P>
      <P>In line with China's new drive to promote energy conservation and carbon
reduction, many of China's provincial and city governments have also approached
Taiwanese companies in the LED supply chain for possible collaboration, industry
sources said.</P>
      <P>Besides Epistar, other major LED companies, including Delta, Formosa Epitaxy,
UNi LED Desklamp, Everlight and LIGITek, will also benefit from China's new
clean energy promotion campaign, the sources said. (Dec. 22, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>A China Postal Airlines all-cargo B737 plane landed at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport at 10:10 a.m. Tuesday, a flight that ushered in speedier
postal services across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hereafter, the carrier will operate two round-trip flights between Fuzhou and
Taoyuan per week using a B737 all-cargo aircraft, its local ground service agent
China Airlines said.</P>
      <P>The inauguration of the new flight service marks a further improvement in cross-
strait postal services since Taiwan and China resumed direct postal links on
Dec. 15, 2008 after a decades-long hiatus. (Dec. 22, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>China began to promote medical service reform last year, with its government
pledging to invest 850 billion yuan over three years to improve the country's
medical and health care services.</P>
      <P>According to official Chinese estimates, China's medical and health care service
market will grow at an annual rate of 24 percent in the coming five years.</P>
      <P>China's Ministry of Health said it will help Taiwanese investors get a slice of
that big pie. Among the measures will be allowing the establishment of hospitals
fully owned by Taiwanese investors in China.</P>
      <P>Industry  sources said the Taiwan Business Association  in Dongguan, Guangdong
is planning to acquire the shares held by local Chinese authorities in a
hospital in Dongguan once China's new policy is put into force. (Dec. 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.37 percent Wednesday as buying ignited by
overnight Wall Street gains rotated to the bellwether electronics sector,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 32.70 points to 8,860.49, after moving between 8,834.32
and 8,865.42, on turnover of NT$129.99 billion (US$4.35 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.22 percent as investors took cues from Wall Street's
more-than two-year overnight high and bargain hunting focused on select high-
tech stocks to push the index to the day's high, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, institutional investors cut their holdings in old economy stocks to
compromise the early gains ahead of the nearest technical resistance at 8,900
points, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,424 stocks closed up and 1,833 were down with 380 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gains, ending up 0.7
percent. Cement stocks rose 0.3 percent, financial stocks added 0.2 percent, and
the paper and pulp sector closed up 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>However, textile and construction stocks fell 0.5 percent and foodstuffs lost
0.3 percent, while plastics and chemicals closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>Horizon Securities analyst Benson Huang said touch-panel makers were highlighted
by buying interest after recent consolidation.</P>
      <P>"In addition to their attractive valuations, investors have high hopes that
their sales will continue to grow next year as these firms are riding rising
demand for Apple iPads," Huang said.</P>
      <P>However, large-cap old economy stocks suffered heavier pressure after recent
significant gains posted by hopes that a rising New Taiwan dollar will boost the
value of their domestic assets, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"The selling came as no surprise as the index had moved closer to the critical
8,900-9,000 point range, " Huang said. "Unless buying in large-cap high-tech
stocks resumes, the market is expected to continue to move in a narrow range,"
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Among the touch-panel stocks, Sintek Photronic gained 2.00 percent to close at
NT$25.50 and Young Fast Optoelectronics closed up 1.23 percent to finish at
NT$288.00.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Kuo Yang Construction fell 1.44 percent to end at
NT$24.00 and Kindom Construction lost 1.36 percent to finish the day at

      <P>More Hong Kong residents have become supportive of Taiwan's efforts to rejoin
the United Nations and fewer are now identifying as Chinese since China
authorities blocked Liu Xiaobo from accepting the Nobel Peace Prize, according
to a survey released this week.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong University poll conducted earlier this month found that 42 percent
of Hong Kongers backed Taiwan's bid to become a UN member, which represented a 5
percent increase from similar polls in September.</P>
      <P>The increase in support for Taiwan's efforts could have resulted from the fact
that China refused to free dissident Liu Xiaobo from prison to attend the Nobel
Peace Prize award ceremony in Norway, said Robert Chung, director of the Public
Opinion Programme at the university.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 63 percent of Hong Kong residents consider themselves
"Hong Kongers" rather than "Chinese, " compared to 57 percent six months ago.</P>
      <P>According to the recennt survey, 35 percent see themselves as either "Chinese in
Hong Kong" or "Chinese, " a drop of 8 percentage points from a similar survey in
June.</P>
      <P>Chung said China's treatment of Liu was most likely also responsible for the
slide.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the good performance of Hong Kong athletes at the
Guangzhou Asian Games last month and a hostage situation in the Philippines in
August involving 15 Hong Kong tourists could have contributed to the stronger

      <P>China's chief negotiator with Taiwan, Chen Yunlin, left Taipei to return to
Beijing Wednesday after wrapping up a three-day visit here.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of Chen's visit, the third of its kind since 2008, was to hold
the sixth round of talks with his Taiwan counterpart, Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, and sign a medical and health care
cooperation agreement with Taiwan on behalf of China.</P>
      <P>Chen, the president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) , said prior to his departure that the ARATS and SEF will continue
negotiating  a cross-strait  investment protection pact, which was expected to
be signed at the Chiang-Chen meeting but was delayed because of bilateral
differences.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, many important issues still await the handling of the two
intermediary bodies, with various difficulties and obstacles expected on the
road ahead.</P>
      <P>But while those obstacles could stall the speed of progress, they will never
change the trend of peace across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the 15 cross-strait agreements signed by the ARTS and SEF over the past
two years have obtained the understanding and support of many Taiwanese people,
and he promised to continue to seek to improve the well-being of people on both
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chiang said the latest medical and health care agreement was aimed at
enhancing the physical well-being of the people.</P>
      <P>Noting that people on the two sides have exchanged more than 6 million visits so
far this year, Chiang said setting up a system for disease reporting and
emergency care was essential to protecting people's lives.</P>
      <P>The agreement will also allow the health and medical sectors of the two sides to
work together to explore new business opportunities, Chiang said.</P>

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Wednesday that it has approved
an application  filed by Japan-based memory chip maker Elpida Memory, Inc. to
list its Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).</P>
      <P>According to the FSC, the company is planning to issue 180 million to 200
million TDRs, each one of which will represent 0.05 common shares of the
company, which has been listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since November 2004.</P>
      <P>If the TDR listing plan is realized, Elpida will become the first Japanese firm
to issue depositary receipts in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In November, when the Japanese firm filed an application for the listing,
underwriter KGI Securities said it expected the listing to take place in the
first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>However, KGI Securities was not immediately available to give further details
about the listing after the FSC issued the greenlight to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Based on local regulations, the FSC has a final say on TDR listing applications
after the central bank and the TWSE.</P>
      <P>Elpida, which was set up in 1999 through an integration of the DRAM businesses
of NEC and Hitachi, aims to raise up to NT$3.6 billion (US$120 million) from the
TDR listing, according to the company's prospectus.</P>
      <P>It is planning to use the proceeds for research and development of next-
generation DRAM chips, the company said, adding that the new technology is
expected to lower production costs and maintain its lead in the business.</P>
      <P>Currently, Elpida ranks as the world's third-largest DRAM maker.</P>
      <P>Elpida said in an earlier statement that it expects the TDR listing to enhance
the company's presence in Taiwan, not only among business clients but also among
local investors.</P>
      <P>Elpida and Taiwan-based Powerchip Technology Corp. have set up a joint venture
called Rexchip Electronics Corp., while the Japanese firm has also built

      <P>The visa waiver privilege for Taiwan passport holders to the Schengen Area and
three European Union (EU) member states will take effect Jan. 11, 2011, the EU's
representative office in Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision to lift visa requirements for Taiwan citizens will be published in
the Dec. 22 issue of the Official Journal of the EU and will take effect 20 days
from that date, said Guy Ledoux, head of the European Economic and Trade Office
(EETO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We finally know the first day that Taiwan visitors will be able to visit Europe
without a visa," he said. "That will be the 11th of January next year."</P>
      <P>He said that an expected rise in the number of Taiwanese visitors to the EU
signals a need to increase the number of flights between Taiwan and the EU --
the world's largest economy with 500 million inhabitants.</P>
      <P>The visa waiver allows Taiwanese travelers to enter countries covered under the
exemption for stays of up to 90 days within a six-month period.</P>
      <P>The exemption applies to 25 Schengen Area countries, comprising 22 EU member
states and three non-EU states -- Norway, Iceland and Switzerland -- and three
non-Schengen EU member states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It also includes seven smaller European countries and territories -- the
Vatican, Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands.</P>
      <P>Ledoux announced the start date of the visa waiver at the launch of a comic
journal, which coincided with the publication of Taiwan's visa exemption in the
Official Journal of the EU.</P>
      <P>The comic journal was published by Taiwanese cartoonist Wan Wan, who was named
Goodwill Ambassador to the EU and was invited by the EETO to visit seven
European countries from June 16 to July 5 this year on a 20-day tour. The

      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate in November fell to 4.73 percent, mainly on a decline in
the number of business closures and downsizing under the improving local
economic situation, the government said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Last month, the unemployment rate was 0.19 percentage points lower than October
and down 1.13 percentage points from a year earlier, according to tallies from
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate fell below 5 percent in October for the first time since
November 2008 as the local economy staged a strong rebound from the global
financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>In November, the number of jobless totaled 527,000, down 19,000 from October,
with the number of unemployed affected by business downsizing and closures
falling 9,000 from a month earlier, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>After seasonal adjustments, the jobless rate stood at 4.79 percent in November,
down 0.17 percentage points from October and also down 1.14 percentage points
from a year earlier, the agency added.</P>
      <P>Last month, the jobless rate among people with junior high school education or
below was 4.32 percent, and 5.10 percent among those with senior high school
education or below, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>During the same period, the jobless rate among college graduates or above was
4.66 percent, while among university graduates or above it was 5.32 percent, the
DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>In November, a total of 10.61 million people were on payroll, up 45,000 from
September and 236,000 from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of this year, the average jobless rate stood at 5.26
percent, down 0.60 percentage points from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, Premier Wu Den-yih said the government was determined to
reduce unemployment to below 5 percent by the end of this year, or he would step
down to assume responsibility.</P>

      <P>People should get regular medical check-ups even if they feel they are in good
shape, doctors said in a press conference held following the detection of
several kidney tumors in healthy persons who had physical examinations.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual for people with tumors to feel fit and strong, said Chen Kuo-
chiang, a urologist at Cathay General Hospital (CGH) , citing the case of a 56
-year-old male who had a tumor weighing 1.3 kg yet showed no signs of
abnormality before undergoing the check-up.</P>
      <P>If not removed, it is likely that the man would have suffered from a stroke in
the near future, said Chen, referring to the 24cm x 15cm x 14 cm tumor that was
pressing against his internal organs and blood vessels.</P>
      <P>"I want to stand up and call on people to go for health checks, " said the
patient, Hung Chiang-kun, who is slowly recovering from surgery.</P>
      <P>Hung's boss had suggested that he to go for a thorough physical examination and
would pay for half of the cost. "He thought I had dropped a few pounds, but I
was energetic and felt well, " said Hung, who added that he is glad he listened
to his employer's advice.</P>
      <P>Lin Shing-huey, chief of family medicine at CGH, said that a lot of companies
work with hospitals to provide annual health checks for their employees. "Some
businesses even cover the whole cost, " said Lin,  urging everyone to take the
opportunity  to look after themselves.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, many health problems can be detected through health
examinations, including cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes,
high cholesterol levels and cancer. "We should keep in mind that some of these
are among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Celebrating Christmas has made strides in Taiwan, but it is still rare for the
country's children to have their picture taken with Santa Claus, let alone with
one coming from Santa's home in Finland.</P>
      <P>This year marked the first time that the Finland Trade Center, a Taipei-based
trade office,  has brought a "genuine Santa from Finland's Lapland" to Taiwan,
according to the office.</P>
      <P>"The idea is to provide as genuine as possible a Christmas feeling to the people
in Taiwan, and also introduce a bit of the Christmas culture, " the center's
representative Jari Seilonen told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Some 400 groups of families or couples in Taiwan will be able to have their
photo taken with the visiting Santa and a magic elf in the Xinyi shopping
district's Chanti Square on Dec. 25 and 26, according to the event's sponsor,
Citibank Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those who want to do so need to make an appointment at a booth on the square
before Dec. 25. A booth employee said the sizes of groups applying have ranged
from two to 10 people.</P>
      <P>"Some people immediately called their friends after signing up to encourage them
to sign up as well," he said.</P>
      <P>To welcome the Santa Claus, Citibank Taiwan has built a Christmas City on the
square that consists of a post office and a sled pulled by four fake reindeer.</P>
      <P>It also features a Christmas tree with two 120-inch LED screens showing text
messages sent by the public to convey their best wishes to their loved ones.</P>
      <P>Many were already seen gathering at the square, bathed in blue lights, to take
photographs of these installations at night.</P>
      <P>The Finnish Santa, who arrived in Taiwan on Dec. 18, has come here to do more
than pose for pictures. During his nine-day stay, he is also visiting local
schools and hospitals.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, for example, he will visit children cancer patients at National
Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>"Arranging the authentic Santa to go to the hospitals is to inspire all the ill
children to have the courage to fight for their lives, " said Louis Ma, general
manager of Event Design and Marketing Execution, the organizer of the event.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou expressed his full support for Yang Shu-chun, the
taekwondo athlete disqualified at the 2010 Asian Games, and has asked government
agencies to do all they can to protect her rights through all possible  legal
means, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yang, who refused to leave the mat after being disqualified for allegedly
wearing two extra electronic sensors during a bout in the women's under 49-kg
division in November and who later lodged a protest with the World Taekwondo
Federation  (WTF)  over the disqualification, was barred from competition for
three months Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Her coach Liu Tsung-ta was punished with 20-month suspension, while the Chinese
Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000.</P>
      <P>Yang said Tuesday that she felt sorry about the development and complained about
the harsh punishment for Liu but called for an end to the matter.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether she will take part in the 2012 Olympic Games in
London, Yang said she needs time to consider, as the WTF verdict has failed to
clear her name, which will affect her chances in the games.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the WTF ruling, Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai Hsia-
ling said that same day that the council will definitely seek to have Yang's
case heard by the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) , to

disqualification.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar rose against the New Taiwan dollar Wednesday, gaining NT$0.005
to close at NT$30.605.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$825 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.650 and moved between NT$29.860 and NT$30.655
before the close.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar increased its strength in early trade from the previous
session but the gains were compromised by selling by foreign banks, including
Citibank, HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, dealers said.</P>
      <P>It is possible that the bank selling could have been prompted by fund
remittances entrusted by Carlyle Group, a U.S. private equity fund, which
started to remit funds out of Taiwan after closing a deal to sell a local cable
TV operator for a reported NT$65.3 billion (US$2.19 billion), they added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank a day earlier approved an application from Carlyle to send
the funds arising from the deal out of the country.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the fund withdrawal by Carlyle might continue over the next few
trading sessions and is expected to place further downward pressure on the New
Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Carlyle's move led to a reduction in the central bank's efforts to intervene in
the local foreign exchange market in a bid to maintain the value of the U.S.
dollar above the NT$30.00 level to protect Taiwan's exports, they said.</P>
      <P>Quiet trade in other markets in the region because of the approaching Christmas
holiday is expected to keep the New Taiwan dollar in a range trade for the rest

    <HEADLINE>DPP criticizes Beijing for employing 'two-faced' strategy</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's main opposition party criticized Beijing Wednesday for adopting a "two-
faced" strategy in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is a form of political manipulation for China to deploy missiles against
Taiwan, on one hand, while asking for talks with Taiwan on removal of the
missiles, on the other, " said Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesman
Cheng Wen-tsan.</P>
      <P>The criticism  came one day after Taiwan and China's top cross-strait
negotiators met in Taipei and signed a medical and health-care agreement.</P>
      <P>It was the 15th pact between the two sides since rapprochement began following
the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The missile issue arose when Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, paid a courtesy call
Tuesday on Mainland Affairs Council Minister Lai Shin-yuan, whom he refused to
call by her official title.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lai said the missiles that China has deployed along its
southeastern coast pose a great threat to the people of Taiwan and should be
removed in the interest of good cross- strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lai also urged China to pay greater attention to the Taiwan people's deep desire
for more international space.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen, a former director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's
State Council, said both sides have to "sit down and talk" about removing the
missiles as there is no agreement in place that officially allows an end to
cross-strait hostility.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing "is happy to see Taiwan play a greater role on the international
stage, " once it would not lead to the creation of "two Chinas".</P>
      <P>The DPP, which has long advocated independence for Taiwan and has been wary of
official contact with China, is seen as changing its China policy to increase
its chance of winning Taiwan's 2012 presidential election.</P>
      <P>A recent announcement by DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen that the party will set up
a think tank to study how the DPP should engage with China has given some weight
to the perception of a DPP policy change.</P>

      <P>Police have the right to use reasonable force  to protect  themselves  when they

Wednesday at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The use of force by the police is necessary when facing assault by gangsters or
anyone who refuses to obey the public authorities, Jiang said in response to an
incident in which three plainclothes police officers were beaten up by a group
of 11 thugs in eastern Taiwan's Yilan County.</P>
      <P>One of the officers, Chen Ching-yu, a substitute service draftee, took a
photograph of the main suspect, surnamed Chuang, for not wearing helmet while
riding a scooter two days earlier.</P>
      <P>Chuang, aged 20, later contacted his friends and launched an attack on the
officers using knives, police said, adding that the two policemen suffered minor
injuries while Chen received lacerations to his head.</P>
      <P>One of the officers, Li Chi-nan, said he identified himself as a police officer
at the start of the altercation but only managed to halt the assault when he
drew his gun.</P>
      <P>Police in Yilan County will not tolerate any acts of violence and will
strengthen a crackdown on criminal offenses and organizations to improve public
safety, Yilan Deputy Magistrate Wu Tse-cheng said while visiting Chen in
hospital.</P>

      <P>Prices  of sweet rice dumplings, traditionally eaten on the winter solstice in
Taiwan, have risen by 10 percent-30 percent this year, but the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday that they are still under control.</P>
      <P>The statement was made by COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung after a lawmaker cited
complaints from the public about the price increase, which are result of a hike
in the price of glutinous rice, one of the main ingredients in the product.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produced more than 58,000 metric tons of glutinous rice this year, over
15,000 metric tons short of the amount required to meet demand,  Kuomintang
Legislator Ting Shou-chung said at a legislative yuan session.</P>
      <P>The COA should have responded to the situation earlier, according to Ting.</P>
      <P>Part of the glutinous rice sold in Taiwan in the past years was imported, said
Chen, who added that global prices have gone up because a drought in Thailand
has caused a shortage.</P>
      <P>However, the COA has been monitoring he increase, which is not out of control,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The council has not yet allowed newly imported glutinous rice to go on sale, as
some local farmers are still harvesting their crops and the imports might cause
the price of the domestic crop to fall, he added.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker suggested Wednesday that a formal statute be established to provide
guidelines for handling bullying incidents in schools.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kuo Su-chun put forward the proposal at a
meeting of the legislature's Education and Culture Committee,  saying  that  the
government  should  assemble  an inter-ministerial team to draft the bill.</P>
      <P>The problem of bullying in schools cannot be solved by the Ministry of Education
alone, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Her views were supported by KMT Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin, who said bullying
has become embedded in the social structure and cannot be addressed without the
help of the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Agency and the Ministry of
the Interior.</P>
      <P>There should be a specific statute, modeled the Domestic Violence Prevention
Act, to prevent and control campus violence, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He said the existing laws related to child and juvenile welfare are inadequate
for dealing with the problem of school bullying.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that
the problem lies with the educational system, which has ignored the bullying
issue for a long time.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said that when he was a student at Bade Junior High
School in Taoyuan County it was a simple and respectable school.</P>
      <P>Now the image of the school has been tarnished by a series of bullying incidents
that have been widely reported, he said.</P>
      <P>He said  the  problem  arose  in part  from  the  school administration's
ignorance in the face of violence and its leniency toward the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the school administration, Taoyuan County Magistrate Wu Chih-
yang and county officials in charge of educational affairs engage in deep self-
reflection.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, also a DPP spokesman, urged the government to assign
professional student counselors to schools and implement a system for reporting
bullying incidents. In addition, campus safety should be one of the indices in
the performance assessments of principals and local police chiefs, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Last week, the media reported that a drop-out from Bade Junior High School was
being subject to severe bullying. Images of the victim being abused were
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>Principal of the school, Wu Chia-ku, was suspended from her post Tuesday and
ordered to wait for an investigation into her alleged mishandling of a series of
bullying incidents at the school.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators expressed concern Wednesday about Taiwan's strategy in its efforts
to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with its trading partners and to compete
with South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is lagging behind South Korea, which signed an FTA with the European
Union (EU) in October and is scheduled in January to ratify an FTA that it inked
with the United States (U.S.) four years ago, said Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's historic trade pact with China and the ensuing FTA negotiations
with Singapore, Taiwan has made little progress in terms of its broader FTA
drive, Lin said in a session of the Foreign and National Defense Affairs
Committee of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has four FTAs with its five Central American allies. In June this year,
it inked an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China and in
August began to explore the possibility of an FTA with Singapore.</P>
      <P>But compared to South Korea, its toughest economic rival in Asia, Taiwan lacks
an effective strategy, according to some of the legislators in the session.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Economics Minister Francis Kuo-hsin Liang said there are other
factors that must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>"South Korea has always been a threat to us, " he conceded. However, while
around one third of South Korean exports to the U.S. overlap with Taiwanese
products, the total value of the South Korean products "is not as much as people
believe," he said.</P>
      <P>In the EU market, the situation is almost the same, he said. In other words, the
effect of South Korea's FTAs with the two major economies of the U.S. and EU is
not that great, Liang said.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, South Korea is concerned about being at a disadvantage in
the Chinese market since Taiwan and China signed the ECFA, "Liang said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Thomas Ping-fu Hou said in the session that it is easier
for South Korea to seek FTAs because it has official diplomatic relations with
more countries.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said that its primary targets for FTAs are the U.S.,
the EU, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the Association of South East Asian
Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>But KMT legislators  Shuai Hua-min and Liao Wan-ju warned Wednesday against
pursuing as many FTAs as possible without employing a strategy that would
comprehensively weigh the pros and cons of trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>"The FTA drive should not be a game of numbers, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>Shuai also urged the government to use the ECFA to gain a better foothold in
China, which does not have FTAs with either South Korea or Japan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan must forge an internal consensus and build fully fledged mutual trust
with China before it is in a position to start cross-Taiwan Strait political
talks, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai's remarks came after the United Daily News reported that same day that Chen
Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , told Lai during a meeting in Taipei the previous day
that as no concrete agreements have been worked out by Taiwan and China to end
their hostilities, the two sides must hold negotiations on that issue.</P>
      <P>Lai met Chen during a meeting with delegates from both sides who were holding
their sixth round of systematic talks in Taipei. Chen was the top delegate of
the Chinese mission, which concluded its three-day negotiation with the
Taiwanese delegation led by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper, Lai renewed Taiwan's urging for China to remove  its
missiles  targeting  Taiwan and to reduce its interference in Taiwan's
participation in international activities.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said she raised the issues with Chen in a bid to help him
understand that this is an issue of prime concern to Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>"I have repeatedly made it clear in public that China can take the initiative to
deal with its missiles aimed at Taiwan, " she said.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS representatives signed a medical and health cooperation agreement
Tuesday in their sixth round of negotiations to better  ensure  drug safety  and
bolster  two-way  health-care cooperation.</P>
      <P>It was the 15th agreement signed by the SEF and ARATS since June 2008 after
President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in May that year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan had more job vacancies than applicants in the fourth quarter of this year
for the first time in four years for the October-December period, Taiwan's
largest online manpower agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"This year is a special case because there are usually not many job openings in
the fourth quarter, " said 104 Job Bank public relations manager Max Fang.</P>
      <P>He attributed the reasons to a recovering economy, a surge in the number of
temporary jobs in the service sector for the Lunar New Year holiday in February
and the government's short-term recruitment measures.</P>
      <P>His remarks came as Taiwan reported its latest jobless rate Wednesday, with the
November rate falling to 4.73 percent, mainly on a decline in the number of
business closures and a reduction in downsizing on the back of the improving
economic situation.</P>
      <P>According to the agency's figures for December, the number of job offers has hit
359,000 so far, a rise of 10,000 from the previous month.</P>
      <P>The number of job seekers in December fell to 278,000, down 37,000 from last
month, the figures show.</P>
      <P>Fang said the category of finance-related jobs saw the highest supply and demand
ratio of 3.4, which means that one job applicant has 3.4 job offers on average.</P>
      <P>The beauty salon category came in second at 2.9, followed by the category of
construction planning jobs (1.7) and sales jobs (1.7).</P>

    <HEADLINE>154 aboriginal cultural sites to be assessed for heritage value</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) unveiled Wednesday a list of 154
aboriginal cultural heritage sites that will be assessed for potential
archaeological value and heritage preservation.</P>
      <P>The list comprises 127 tangible heritage sites and 27 intangible heritage items,
said Wang Shou-lai, head of the CCA's preparatory office for cultural heritage
preservation department.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal cultures are an important part of Taiwan's cultural heritage and the
CCA attaches great importance to the preservation of heritage sites associated
with Taiwan's 14 officially recognized indigenous tribes, he said.</P>
      <P>Through site surveys and the compilation of archival documents, professors Kuang
Hua-shan of Tungshai University and Wang Sung-shan of Taipei National University
of the Arts have compiled the list of Taiwan's aboriginal cultural heritage
sites and items in terms of underlying value, belief systems, lifestyles,
artifacts and legends, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Their research serves as an important reference  for the preservation of our
indigenous cultures, " Wang said. "The professors have also drawn up strategies
for short-, mid-, and long-term preservation."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council will distribute the list to local governments for
follow-up survey and research for formal listing as heritage sites or items in
the future, he added.</P>
      <P>All of the 154 newly recommended heritage sites and items are highly
fascinating, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Among the intangible heritage items, for instance, is a nose flute, a special
musical instrument used by the Paiwan tribe, he said. Traditionally, only male
members of the chieftain's family were permitted to play the instrument which
has a snake-like sound.</P>
      <P>Three aboriginal sites -- the Puyuma tribe relics in Mount Malatan in Taitung
County, Tao tribal settlements on Orchid Island and the Paiwan tribe's stone-
slab houses -- have been added to a list of 18 items that will be submitted to
the United Nations for recognition as world heritage sites.</P>
      <P>In October 2009, the council picked 10 non-tangible cultural heritage sites,
including Atayal tribal legends, Bunun ballads, Ami tribe's annual harvest
festivities and Saisiyat tribe's dwarf spirit ceremony, which will also be sent
to the U.N.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MediaTek, MStar forecast to face fierce competition for talent</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) designers will face fierce competition for
skilled workers as more Chinese firms are expected to enter the 3G chip market
next year, the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"IC designers such as MediaTek Inc. and MStar Semiconductor Inc. will have to
make strong efforts to keep or recruit talent in China's highly competitive 3G
chip market, " MIC Industry Consultant Deputy Director Chris Hung told the CNA
on the sidelines of a press conference.</P>
      <P>This is because the Chinese government is preparing to help local IC designers
develop  3G communications,  while  international chipmakers like Qualcomm have
managed to cut their product prices in a bid to strengthen their shares in the
China market, he said.</P>
      <P>"Chinese IC designers seem to be more attractive to Taiwanese employees because
of better wages and benefits, especially as Taiwan workers have not been
receiving as big a share of company profits as in the past," Hung said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, MStar Chairman Wayne Liang said the company plans to launch its
first chips for use in 3G mobile phones in the first half in 2011. The move is
expected to set the stage for direct competition with the country's biggest
handset chip designer, MediaTek, which currently dominates China's 2G handset
chip market.</P>
      <P>MStar chips are used in the production of consumer electronic products such as
flat panel TVs, monitors and cell phones.</P>
      <P>The company, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, operates primarily in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, and most of its products are exported to China, South
Korea and the United States.</P>
      <P>According to a study by the MIC, the global semiconductor market will reach an
estimated US$291 billion in 2010 with a year-on-year growth of 28.6 percent. But
the figure is expected to hit US$308 billion in 2011, representing a moderate
year-on-year grow of 5.8 percent due to stabilized demand for consumer devices.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's semiconductor market is forecast to grow by 32 percent to
NT$1.6 trillion (US$53.6 billion) this year, but in 2011 the growth will slow
down to 6.2 percent with an estimated total value of NT$1.7 trillion, the MIC
said.</P>

      <P>Two prominent business executives, Alex Lo and Rose Tsou, said Wednesday they
are honored to have been invited to host the flag-raising ceremony at the
Presidential Office plaza on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Lo, general manager of Taiwan's largest food maker Uni-President Enterprises

performance.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Taipei, they told reporters that the invitation was a
surprise because "hosting a national ceremony is not something we are
particularly good at."</P>
      <P>Tsou  said that when she was a university  student,  she participated in the
national flag raising ceremony several times and she is very excited about
playing a bigger part in the upcoming one.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lo said he is nervous about speaking in front of thousands of
people at the ceremony because it is very different from presiding at a company
meeting.</P>
      <P>"But celebrating the nation's 100th birthday is very meaningful, therefore, I
will do my best to make the ceremony interesting and different," he promised.</P>
      <P>He said many of his company's employees are planning to attend the ceremony

      <P>A Taiwan journalist association hit back at the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)
Wednesday over a comment about sports reporting in Taiwan, advising WTF
officials to "watch your words and beware of your behavior."</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Sports Journalism Federation was upset by WTF accusations
that Taiwanese media were fanning anti-Korean sentiments in their reports about
the disqualification of Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun at the Asian
Games in Guangzhou, China in November.</P>
      <P>In a decision published Tuesday, the WTF slapped a 3-month ban on Yang and a
20-month suspension on her coach Liu Tsung- ta for staging a ringside protest
after Yang was disqualified during a match in the 49-kg division event.</P>
      <P>Upset by the WTF's implications that the Taiwanese media were manipulating their
reports about the controversial event,  the Taiwanese sports journalist
association lodged a protest with WTF President Chungwon Choue.</P>
      <P>The group said Taiwanese journalists have been reporting the controversy over
Yang's disqualification on the basis of facts and eye witness accounts.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the WTF has used biased and provocative language to
allude to the Taiwanese media, the sports journalism federation said.</P>
      <P>It urged Choue to take note of the fact that Taiwan is a democracy in which all
citizens enjoy freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>All the Taiwanese media that covered the Yang Shu-chun incident had sent their
own reporters  to Guangzhou  and they worked independently without bias, the
federation said.</P>
      <P>The group said the Asian Taokwondo Union's accusation against the Taiwanese
athlete was wrong and that WTF Secretary General Yang Jin-suk had hurt the
Taiwan team at the Asian Games in Guangzhou.</P>

      <P>The National Communications Council (NCC) decided to revoke the operating
license for the Comprehensive Channel of the ERA TV over repeated acts of
embedded advertising, the official broadcast watchdog announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to spokesman Chen Cheng-chang, the NCC decided to make the move -- the
first of its kind since its establishment four years ago -- coupled with a fine
of NT$2.1 million.</P>
      <P>The channel was found to have violated relevant regulations 49 times, with fines
totaling NT$167.5 million (US$5.49 million) when it applied for a licence
renewal in November last year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The NCC agreed in February to renew the channel's license for one year on
condition that there would be no more violation for that period, he said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the NCC decided to withdraw the license for the channel
after it was caught engaging in the same practice again.</P>
      <P>The NCC demanded the channel stop operations in July after it was found to have
breached regulations three times from February to June.</P>
      <P>The channel did not comply and has continued its broadcast, forcing the NCC to
impose a new fine of NT$2.1 million, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The ERA TV said it would file an administrative appeal against the NCC decision.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese makers of large-sized panel displays are forecast to take 40 percent
of the global market next year, the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting
Institute (MIC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers  of the small and medium-sized panels, however, are expected
to adopt a "diversifying" strategy as a result of reduced shipments caused by
weak demand, MIC said.</P>
      <P>The world market for large-sized panels will increase by 10 percent in 2011,
with 85 percent of the total market being shared by the top four markers of the
world --  South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co, and LG Display Corp. and
Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp. and Chimei Innolux Corp., it added.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese providers of the large-sized panels, in the face of sharp competition
from their Japanese and Korean counterparts, will likely see a mere 6 percent
increase in their shipments, the MIC said.</P>
      <P>Shipments of local small- and medium-sized panels, less then 40 inches, will
fall by 12 percent due to competition from China, it added.</P>
      <P>As a result, providers of the small-sized panels will try to shift to producing
such other devices as e-readers, touch panels or active matrix organic light
emitting diode (AMOLED), the MIC said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will join six other nations that are participating in the third-stage
clinical trial of a new drug to treat late-stage oral cancer, a leader of the
program said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hao Sheng-po, president of the Asian Society of Head and Neck Oncology, said
that the new drug is meant to work by stimulating the immune systems of
patients, before resorting to treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy or
radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the patients' own immune systems will suppress the growth of
the cancer cells, he said.</P>
      <P>Orient Europharma Co., the agent for the U.S.-produced drug, said that in the
second-stage clinical trials, the cancer cells in 12 percent of the patients
disappeared completely.</P>
      <P>On average, the cancer cells in all the patients in the test group shrunk by 50
percent, the agent said. Follow-up tests showed that the patients survival rate
increased by an average of 33 percent, it said.</P>
      <P>It will be the first large-scale trial that would prioritize immune therapy over
other treatments.</P>
      <P>Eighty-eight patients in seven hospitals in Taiwan, including Shin Kong Wu Ho Su
Memorial hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital, Mackay Memorial
Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital,

      <P>Taiwanese wage earners' regular salary rose in October by 1.62 percent from a
year earlier to a monthly average of NT$36,480 (US$1,220), marking the 12th
consecutive increase, the Directorate General of Budget,  Accounting and
Statistics said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said their average salary -- NT$40,035 (US$1,338 ) in October, was up
0.47 percent but down 7.12 percent from the previous month, when most workers
received a Moon Festival bonus.</P>
      <P>The government statistics agency said during the first ten months of this year,
the average monthly salary was NT$44,919, an increase of 5.87 percent over the
same period of last year. Of that amount, the regular salary was NT$36,205, up
1.92 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wage earners' average substantive salary from Jan. through Oct. of 2010
grew 4.94 percent year-on-year, the largest growth in 17 years, according to the
DGBAS.</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-tzu, a bureau director of the DGBAS, said the ten-month average salary
was about the same as in 2007, though a bit lower than the 2008 figure of
NT$45,290.</P>
      <P>During the Jan.-Oct. period of this year, Taiwan wage earners' average monthly
salary was NT$36,205, compared with NT$36,279 in 2007 and NT$36,600 in 2008, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Asked why most people do not feel they are making as much as NT$44,000, Liu said
the average salary includes non-regular income such as year-end bonuses and
performance-related bonuses.</P>
      <P>"If these bonuses are evened out into each month's income, they would feel their

      <P>Prices  of sweet rice dumplings, traditionally eaten on the winter solstice in
Taiwan, have risen by 10 percent-30 percent this year, but the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday that they are still under control.</P>
      <P>The statement was made by COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung after a lawmaker cited
complaints from the public about the price increase, which are result of a hike
in the price of glutinous rice, one of the main ingredients in the product.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produced more than 58,000 metric tons of glutinous rice this year, over
15,000 metric tons short of the amount required to meet demand,  Kuomintang
Legislator Ting Shou-chung said at a legislative yuan session.</P>
      <P>The COA should have responded to the situation earlier, according to Ting.</P>
      <P>Part of the glutinous rice sold in Taiwan in the past years was imported, said
Chen, who added that global prices have gone up because a drought in Thailand
has caused a shortage.</P>
      <P>However, the COA has been monitoring he increase, which is not out of control,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The council has not yet allowed newly imported glutinous rice to go on sale, as
some local farmers are still harvesting their crops and the imports might cause
the price of the domestic crop to fall, he added.</P>
      <P>This year, the winter solstice falls on Dec. 22.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker suggested Wednesday that a formal statute be established to provide
guidelines for handling bullying incidents in schools.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kuo Su-chun put forward the proposal at a
meeting of the legislature's Education and Culture Committee,  saying  that  the
government  should  assemble  an inter-ministerial team to draft the bill.</P>
      <P>The problem of bullying in schools cannot be solved by the Ministry of Education
alone, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Her views were supported by KMT Legislator Chiang Nai-hsin, who said bullying
has become embedded in the social structure and cannot be addressed without the
help of the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Agency and the Ministry of
the Interior.</P>
      <P>There should be a specific statute, modeled the Domestic Violence Prevention
Act, to prevent and control campus violence, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He said the existing laws related to child and juvenile welfare are inadequate
for dealing with the problem of school bullying.</P>
      <P>Also on Wednesday, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that
the problem lies with the educational system, which has ignored the bullying
issue for a long time.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan said that when he was a student at Bade Junior High
School in Taoyuan County it was a simple and respectable school.</P>
      <P>Now the image of the school has been tarnished by a series of bullying incidents
that have been widely reported, he said.</P>
      <P>He said  the  problem  arose  in part  from  the  school administration's
ignorance in the face of violence and its leniency toward the perpetrators.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the school administration, Taoyuan County Magistrate Wu Chih-
yang and county officials in charge of educational affairs engage in deep self-
reflection.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, also a DPP spokesman, urged the government to assign
professional student counselors to schools and implement a system for reporting
bullying incidents. In addition, campus safety should be one of the indices in
the performance assessments of principals and local police chiefs, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Last week, the media reported that a drop-out from Bade Junior High School was
being subject to severe bullying. Images of the victim being abused were
broadcast on TV.</P>
      <P>Principal of the school, Wu Chia-ku, was suspended from her post Tuesday and
ordered to wait for an investigation into her alleged mishandling of a series of
bullying incidents at the school.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators expressed concern Wednesday about Taiwan's strategy in its efforts
to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with its trading partners and to compete
with South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is lagging behind South Korea, which signed an FTA with the European
Union (EU) in October and is scheduled in January to ratify an FTA that it inked
with the United States (U.S.) four years ago, said Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Despite Taiwan's historic trade pact with China and the ensuing FTA negotiations
with Singapore, Taiwan has made little progress in terms of its broader FTA
drive, Lin said in a session of the Foreign and National Defense Affairs
Committee of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has four FTAs with its five Central American allies. In June this year,
it inked an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China and in
August began to explore the possibility of an FTA with Singapore.</P>
      <P>But compared to South Korea, its toughest economic rival in Asia, Taiwan lacks
an effective strategy, according to some of the legislators in the session.</P>
      <P>However, Deputy Economics Minister Francis Kuo-hsin Liang said there are other
factors that must be taken into account.</P>
      <P>"South Korea has always been a threat to us, " he conceded. However, while
around one third of South Korean exports to the U.S. overlap with Taiwanese
products, the total value of the South Korean products "is not as much as people
believe," he said.</P>
      <P>In the EU market, the situation is almost the same, he said. In other words, the
effect of South Korea's FTAs with the two major economies of the U.S. and EU is
not that great, Liang said.</P>
      <P>"On the other hand, South Korea is concerned about being at a disadvantage in
the Chinese market since Taiwan and China signed the ECFA, "Liang said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Thomas Ping-fu Hou said in the session that it is easier
for South Korea to seek FTAs because it has official diplomatic relations with
more countries.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government has said that its primary targets for FTAs are the U.S.,
the EU, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the Association of South East Asian
Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>But KMT legislators  Shuai Hua-min and Liao Wan-ju warned Wednesday against
pursuing as many FTAs as possible without employing a strategy that would
comprehensively weigh the pros and cons of trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>"The FTA drive should not be a game of numbers, " Shuai said.</P>
      <P>Shuai also urged the government to use the ECFA to gain a better foothold in
China, which does not have FTAs with either South Korea or Japan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan must forge an internal consensus and build fully fledged mutual trust
with China before it is in a position to start cross-Taiwan Strait political
talks, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai's remarks came after the United Daily News reported that same day that Chen
Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , told Lai during a meeting in Taipei the previous day
that as no concrete agreements have been worked out by Taiwan and China to end
their hostilities, the two sides must hold negotiations on that issue.</P>
      <P>Lai met Chen during a meeting with delegates from both sides who were holding
their sixth round of systematic talks in Taipei. Chen was the top delegate of
the Chinese mission, which concluded its three-day negotiation with the
Taiwanese delegation led by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang
Pin-kung Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the newspaper, Lai renewed Taiwan's urging for China to remove  its
missiles  targeting  Taiwan and to reduce its interference in Taiwan's
participation in international activities.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said she raised the issues with Chen in a bid to help him

      <P>"I have repeatedly made it clear in public that China can take the initiative to
deal with its missiles aimed at Taiwan, " she said.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS representatives signed a medical and health cooperation agreement
Tuesday in their sixth round of negotiations to better  ensure  drug safety  and
bolster  two-way  health-care cooperation.</P>
      <P>It was the 15th agreement signed by the SEF and ARATS since June 2008 after
President Ma Ying-jeou assumed office in May that year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan had more job vacancies than applicants in the fourth quarter of this year
for the first time in four years for the October-December period, Taiwan's
largest online manpower agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"This year is a special case because there are usually not many job openings in
the fourth quarter, " said 104 Job Bank public relations manager Max Fang.</P>
      <P>He attributed the reasons to a recovering economy, a surge in the number of
temporary jobs in the service sector for the Lunar New Year holiday in February
and the government's short-term recruitment measures.</P>
      <P>His remarks came as Taiwan reported its latest jobless rate Wednesday, with the
November rate falling to 4.73 percent, mainly on a decline in the number of
business closures and a reduction in downsizing on the back of the improving
economic situation.</P>
      <P>According to the agency's figures for December, the number of job offers has hit
359,000 so far, a rise of 10,000 from the previous month.</P>
      <P>The number of job seekers in December fell to 278,000, down 37,000 from last
month, the figures show.</P>
      <P>Fang said the category of finance-related jobs saw the highest supply and demand
ratio of 3.4, which means that one job applicant has 3.4 job offers on average.</P>
      <P>The beauty salon category came in second at 2.9, followed by the category of
construction planning jobs (1.7) and sales jobs (1.7).</P>

    <HEADLINE>154 aboriginal cultural sites to be assessed for heritage value</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) unveiled Wednesday a list of 154
aboriginal cultural heritage sites that will be assessed for potential
archaeological value and heritage preservation.</P>
      <P>The list comprises 127 tangible heritage sites and 27 intangible heritage items,
said Wang Shou-lai, head of the CCA's preparatory office for cultural heritage
preservation department.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal cultures are an important part of Taiwan's cultural heritage and the
CCA attaches great importance to the preservation of heritage sites associated
with Taiwan's 14 officially recognized indigenous tribes, he said.</P>
      <P>Through site surveys and the compilation of archival documents, professors Kuang
Hua-shan of Tungshai University and Wang Sung-shan of Taipei National University
of the Arts have compiled the list of Taiwan's aboriginal cultural heritage
sites and items in terms of underlying value, belief systems, lifestyles,
artifacts and legends, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"Their research serves as an important reference  for the preservation of our
indigenous cultures, " Wang said. "The professors have also drawn up strategies
for short-, mid-, and long-term preservation."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council will distribute the list to local governments for
follow-up survey and research for formal listing as heritage sites or items in
the future, he added.</P>
      <P>All of the 154 newly recommended heritage sites and items are highly
fascinating, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Among the intangible heritage items, for instance, is a nose flute, a special
musical instrument used by the Paiwan tribe, he said. Traditionally, only male
members of the chieftain's family were permitted to play the instrument which
has a snake-like sound.</P>
      <P>Three aboriginal sites -- the Puyuma tribe relics in Mount Malatan in Taitung
County, Tao tribal settlements on Orchid Island and the Paiwan tribe's stone-
slab houses -- have been added to a list of 18 items that will be submitted to
the United Nations for recognition as world heritage sites.</P>
      <P>In October 2009, the council picked 10 non-tangible cultural heritage sites,
including Atayal tribal legends, Bunun ballads, Ami tribe's annual harvest
festivities and Saisiyat tribe's dwarf spirit ceremony, which will also be sent
to the U.N.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MediaTek, MStar forecast to face fierce competition for talent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's integrated circuit (IC) designers will face fierce competition for
skilled workers as more Chinese firms are expected to enter the 3G chip market
next year, the Market Intelligence Center (MIC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"IC designers such as MediaTek Inc. and MStar Semiconductor Inc. will have to
make strong efforts to keep or recruit talent in China's highly competitive 3G
chip market, " MIC Industry Consultant Deputy Director Chris Hung told the CNA
on the sidelines of a press conference.</P>
      <P>This is because the Chinese government is preparing to help local IC designers
develop  3G communications,  while  international chipmakers like Qualcomm have
managed to cut their product prices in a bid to strengthen their shares in the
China market, he said.</P>
      <P>"Chinese IC designers seem to be more attractive to Taiwanese employees because
of better wages and benefits, especially as Taiwan workers have not been
receiving as big a share of company profits as in the past," Hung said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, MStar Chairman Wayne Liang said the company plans to launch its
first chips for use in 3G mobile phones in the first half in 2011. The move is
expected to set the stage for direct competition with the country's biggest
handset chip designer, MediaTek, which currently dominates China's 2G handset
chip market.</P>
      <P>MStar chips are used in the production of consumer electronic products such as
flat panel TVs, monitors and cell phones.</P>
      <P>The company, which is registered in the Cayman Islands, operates primarily in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, and most of its products are exported to China, South
Korea and the United States.</P>
      <P>According to a study by the MIC, the global semiconductor market will reach an
estimated US$291 billion in 2010 with a year-on-year growth of 28.6 percent. But
the figure is expected to hit US$308 billion in 2011, representing a moderate
year-on-year grow of 5.8 percent due to stabilized demand for consumer devices.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's semiconductor market is forecast to grow by 32 percent to
NT$1.6 trillion (US$53.6 billion) this year, but in 2011 the growth will slow
down to 6.2 percent with an estimated total value of NT$1.7 trillion, the MIC
said.</P>

      <P>Two prominent business executives, Alex Lo and Rose Tsou, said Wednesday they
are honored to have been invited to host the flag-raising ceremony at the
Presidential Office plaza on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Lo, general manager of Taiwan's largest food maker Uni-President Enterprises
Corp, and Tsou, managing director of Yahoo Asia, promised to deliver a unique
performance.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Taipei, they told reporters that the invitation was a
surprise because "hosting a national ceremony is not something we are
particularly good at."</P>
      <P>Tsou  said that when she was a university  student,  she participated in the
national flag raising ceremony several times and she is very excited about
playing a bigger part in the upcoming one.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lo said he is nervous about speaking in front of thousands of
people at the ceremony because it is very different from presiding at a company
meeting.</P>
      <P>"But celebrating the nation's 100th birthday is very meaningful, therefore, I
will do my best to make the ceremony interesting and different," he promised.</P>
      <P>He said many of his company's employees are planning to attend the ceremony

      <P>A Taiwan journalist association hit back at the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF)
Wednesday over a comment about sports reporting in Taiwan, advising WTF
officials to "watch your words and beware of your behavior."</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Sports Journalism Federation was upset by WTF accusations
that Taiwanese media were fanning anti-Korean sentiments in their reports about
the disqualification of Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun at the Asian
Games in Guangzhou, China in November.</P>
      <P>In a decision published Tuesday, the WTF slapped a 3-month ban on Yang and a
20-month suspension on her coach Liu Tsung- ta for staging a ringside protest
after Yang was disqualified during a match in the 49-kg division event.</P>
      <P>Upset by the WTF's implications that the Taiwanese media were manipulating their
reports about the controversial event,  the Taiwanese sports journalist
association lodged a protest with WTF President Chungwon Choue.</P>
      <P>The group said Taiwanese journalists have been reporting the controversy over
Yang's disqualification on the basis of facts and eye witness accounts.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the WTF has used biased and provocative language to
allude to the Taiwanese media, the sports journalism federation said.</P>
      <P>It urged Choue to take note of the fact that Taiwan is a democracy in which all
citizens enjoy freedom of expression.</P>
      <P>All the Taiwanese media that covered the Yang Shu-chun incident had sent their
own reporters  to Guangzhou  and they worked independently without bias, the
federation said.</P>
      <P>The group said the Asian Taokwondo Union's accusation against the Taiwanese
athlete was wrong and that WTF Secretary General Yang Jin-suk had hurt the
Taiwan team at the Asian Games in Guangzhou.</P>

      <P>The National Communications Council (NCC) decided to revoke the operating
license for the Comprehensive Channel of the ERA TV over repeated acts of
embedded advertising, the official broadcast watchdog announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to spokesman Chen Cheng-chang, the NCC decided to make the move -- the
first of its kind since its establishment four years ago -- coupled with a fine
of NT$2.1 million.</P>
      <P>The channel was found to have violated relevant regulations 49 times, with fines
totaling NT$167.5 million (US$5.49 million) when it applied for a licence
renewal in November last year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The NCC agreed in February to renew the channel's license for one year on
condition that there would be no more violation for that period, he said.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the NCC decided to withdraw the license for the channel
after it was caught engaging in the same practice again.</P>
      <P>The NCC demanded the channel stop operations in July after it was found to have
breached regulations three times from February to June.</P>
      <P>The channel did not comply and has continued its broadcast, forcing the NCC to
impose a new fine of NT$2.1 million, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The ERA TV said it would file an administrative appeal against the NCC decision.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese makers of large-sized panel displays are forecast to take 40 percent
of the global market next year, the Market Intelligence &amp; Consulting
Institute (MIC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Local manufacturers  of the small and medium-sized panels, however, are expected
to adopt a "diversifying" strategy as a result of reduced shipments caused by
weak demand, MIC said.</P>
      <P>The world market for large-sized panels will increase by 10 percent in 2011,
with 85 percent of the total market being shared by the top four markers of the
world --  South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co, and LG Display Corp. and
Taiwan's AU Optronics Corp. and Chimei Innolux Corp., it added.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese providers of the large-sized panels, in the face of sharp competition
from their Japanese and Korean counterparts, will likely see a mere 6 percent
increase in their shipments, the MIC said.</P>
      <P>Shipments of local small- and medium-sized panels, less then 40 inches, will
fall by 12 percent due to competition from China, it added.</P>
      <P>As a result, providers of the small-sized panels will try to shift to producing
such other devices as e-readers, touch panels or active matrix organic light
emitting diode (AMOLED), the MIC said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will join six other nations that are participating in the third-stage
clinical trial of a new drug to treat late-stage oral cancer, a leader of the
program said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hao Sheng-po, president of the Asian Society of Head and Neck Oncology, said
that the new drug is meant to work by stimulating the immune systems of
patients, before resorting to treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy or
radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the patients' own immune systems will suppress the growth of
the cancer cells, he said.</P>
      <P>Orient Europharma Co., the agent for the U.S.-produced drug, said that in the
second-stage clinical trials, the cancer cells in 12 percent of the patients
disappeared completely.</P>
      <P>On average, the cancer cells in all the patients in the test group shrunk by 50
percent, the agent said. Follow-up tests showed that the patients survival rate
increased by an average of 33 percent, it said.</P>
      <P>It will be the first large-scale trial that would prioritize immune therapy over
other treatments.</P>
      <P>Eighty-eight patients in seven hospitals in Taiwan, including Shin Kong Wu Ho Su
Memorial hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital, Mackay Memorial
Hospital, Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Changhua Christian Hospital,

      <P>Taiwanese wage earners' regular salary rose in October by 1.62 percent from a
year earlier to a monthly average of NT$36,480 (US$1,220), marking the 12th
consecutive increase, the Directorate General of Budget,  Accounting and
Statistics said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said their average salary -- NT$40,035 (US$1,338 ) in October, was up
0.47 percent but down 7.12 percent from the previous month, when most workers
received a Moon Festival bonus.</P>
      <P>The government statistics agency said during the first ten months of this year,
the average monthly salary was NT$44,919, an increase of 5.87 percent over the
same period of last year. Of that amount, the regular salary was NT$36,205, up
1.92 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wage earners' average substantive salary from Jan. through Oct. of 2010
grew 4.94 percent year-on-year, the largest growth in 17 years, according to the
DGBAS.</P>
      <P>Liu Tien-tzu, a bureau director of the DGBAS, said the ten-month average salary
was about the same as in 2007, though a bit lower than the 2008 figure of
NT$45,290.</P>
      <P>During the Jan.-Oct. period of this year, Taiwan wage earners' average monthly
salary was NT$36,205, compared with NT$36,279 in 2007 and NT$36,600 in 2008, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Asked why most people do not feel they are making as much as NT$44,000, Liu said
the average salary includes non-regular income such as year-end bonuses and
performance-related bonuses.</P>
      <P>"If these bonuses are evened out into each month's income, they would feel their

    <TEXT>
      <P>HSBC said Thursday that it expected Taiwan's economic growth to moderate to 4.7
percent in 2011, after strongly rebounding in 2010, amid uncertainty over global
demand.</P>
      <P>HSBC has revised downwards the island's gross domestic product (GDP) growth
forecast for 2011 to 4.7 percent from an earlier estimate of 4.9 percent, while
upgrading the 2010 forecast to 9.6 percent from an earlier forecast of 7.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Donna Kwok, an economist for the Greater China division at HSBC, said that
Taiwan's economy remained heavily exposed to the global tech cycle.</P>
      <P>"Western manufacturers have recovered from their summer lull, but new problems
in Europe are likely to linger, making 2011 uncertain for Taiwan's exporters,"
Kwok said.</P>
      <P>According to HSBC, Taiwan's exports in 2011 are expected to grow 8.2 percent,
compared with an estimated 31.7 percent jump in 2010, when the island benefited
from a global economic recovery after a financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's labor market seems to be recovering as the island's
unemployment has declined to a near two-year low, Kwok added.</P>
      <P>In November, Taiwan's jobless rate fell 0.19 percentage points from October to
4.73 percent.</P>
      <P>In October, the jobless rate also fell below 5 percent for the first time since
November 2008.</P>
      <P>"Real wage growth has risen since February, helping to keep local commercial
sales growth in the black," Kwok said.</P>
      <P>"But much of the recovery to date has depended on global manufacturer
restocking, which won't last forever," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sales of 3 Taiwan fabless IC firms to top US$1 billion: IC Insights</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  23  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Among the 13 fabless IC suppliers worldwide, three Taiwan-based companies --
MediaTek Inc., Novatek Microelectronics Corp. and MStar Semiconductor Inc. --
are expected to post more than US$ 1 billion in sales each for 2010, IC Insights
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the semiconductor market research company, MediaTek is expected to
generate US$3.61 billion (NT$107.9 billion) in sales for 2010, up 3 percent from
a year earlier,  making it the fourth-largest fabless IC supplier among the 13
firms.</P>
      <P>IC Insights also said that it expected Novatek to become the 11th largest firm
among the 13 companies after posting US$1.15 billion in sales this year, up 40
percent from last year, while MStar is expected to become the 13th largest
company in the industry after reporting US$1.06 billion in sales, up 75 percent
from a year ago.</P>
      <P>IC Insights said that the number of fabless firms whose sales were expected to
exceed US$1 billion in 2010 will go up to 13 this year from 10 in 2009 and 8 in
2008.</P>
      <P>The 13 suppliers are expected to post a combined US$41.4 billion in sales for
this year. That amount accounts for 70 percent of sales of all the fabless IC
companies in the world this year, the researcher said.</P>
      <P>IC Insights said that nine out of the 13 IC firms were based in the United
States, while one was headquartered in Europe. There are no Japanese companies
on the list.</P>
      <P>"It is obvious that the fabless/foundry business model has not significantly
caught on in Japan, and, in IC Insights' opinion, is unlikely to do so in the
near future," the research company said.</P>
      <P>U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. tops the ranking. It is expected to generate US$7.1
billion in sales for 2010, up 11 percent from 2009, according to IC Insights.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwanese and Chinese IC design houses continue to expand, IC Insights
said that an increasing  number of Taiwan-  and China-headquartered companies
will eventually make their way into the list of the top fabless suppliers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting in 2011, Taiwan citizens will be required to file their passport
applications in person to confirm their identity, as part of Taiwan's efforts to
be included in the U.S. visa waiver program, Deputy Foreign Minister Shen Lyu-
hsun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The new procedure will be introduced on a trial basis between March and June
2011, and if it works well, it will be implemented officially in July, Shen said
during a meeting of the legislature's Foreign and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Passport applicants will have two options, the first of which will be filing
their documents in person at the Bureau of Consular Affairs under the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), he said.</P>
      <P>Alternatively, they will be allowed to take their application forms to a local
household registration office to have their identities confirmed before
entrusting a travel agency or proxy to file the applications on their behalf,
Shen said.</P>
      <P>The United States has expressed concern over Taiwan's passport application and
issuance procedure, which does not require applicants to appear in person. This
loophole has allowed for rampant forgery of Taiwan passports, according to
reports.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the U.S. has said one of the conditions to inclusion in its
visa-waiver program is that Taiwan citizens must file their passport
applications in person.</P>
      <P>Other factors that will be examined are visa refusal rates and the number of
overstay cases involving Taiwan citizens, according to the U.S.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- New guidelines for defining death from overwork</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The  Cabinet-level  Council  of  Labor  Affairs  (CLA)
12/23/10  15:20:27
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>announced Wednesday new guidelines for defining "death from overwork" as an
occupational  disease,  as  part  of  its  efforts  to reduce labor-management
disputes and better protect employees' rights and benefits.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines will be applied in the case of a 29-year-old engineer at
Nanya Technology Corp. who died earlier this year, said Fu Huan-jan,  director
of the CLA's Labor Safety and Health Department.</P>
      <P>The engineer's relatives have been trying to have his case classified as
"karoshi, " which means "death from overwork" in Japanese, saying that he had
been working constant overtime hours for six months prior to his demise.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Many companies in the high-tech industrial sector often do not keep records of
their employees' work hours on grounds that they adhere to a "responsibility
system." Under this system, which employees are responsible for completing
specific tasks, regardless of the time it takes, and therefore are not eligible
to claim overtime.</P>
      <P>This practice has caused controversy from time to time in cases of alleged death
from overwork.</P>
      <P>Fu said Wednesday the CLA has decided to change the guidelines for defining
death from overwork and will now place the burden of proof on employers in order
to reduce the incidence of occupational injury and death.</P>
      <P>Under the new CLA regulations, the employer will be required to pay compensation
payment to the family of the deceased if the employer is unable to provide solid
evidence that the employee had not been literally worked to death.</P>
      <P>The "karoshi" issue was highlighted in January when an engineer at Nanya
Technology Corp. (NTC) was found dead in front of his computer at home. His
parents said he had been putting in about 80 hours of overtime per month for six
months.</P>
      <P>Similar cases are not uncommon in the high-tech sector. More often than not, the
family of the deceased is unable to claim labor insurance compensation because
it is difficult for the courts and labor authorities to determine death as a
result of overwork.</P>
      <P>The CLA is expected to announce a decision soon in the case of the NTC engineer.
If the CLA rules in favor of the family, the Bureau of Labor Insurance and Nanya
Technology, a DRAM memory chip maker affiliated with the Formosa Plastics Group,
will each have to pay the engineer's family the equivalent of 45 months of his
salary. (Dec. 23, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The CLA said Wednesday it has decided to make it easier for doctors and
investigators to classify a case as death or injury from overwork.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, the CLA will follow the standards used in Japan, which include
contributing  factors such as abnormal  working conditions, heavy short-term
overwork, and long-term overwork.</P>
      <P>Under these standards, long-term overwork is defined as 92 hours of overtime in
the month before death, or 72 hours of overtime per month for two to six months
before death.</P>
      <P>Based on the new guidelines, the range of conditions that could be attributed to
overwork will be expanded to include ischemic heart disease, severe cardiac
arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral
infarction, acute heart failure and aortic rupture. (Dec. 23, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei book fair to highlight Bhutanese literature</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>When the Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) opens on Feb. 9 next year
at the Taipei World Trade Center, the spotlight will be on Bhutanese culture and
literature, the organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Book Fair Foundation (TBFF) said it has invited three renowned
Bhutanese writers -- Karma Ura, Kunzang Choden, and Yonden Dargye -- to attend
the show, one of the world's largest annual book fairs.</P>
      <P>In addition, the book fair will feature more than 300 Bhutanese publications,
and for the first time, three of the Himalayan country's national treasures,
said TBFF Executive Director Paulina Lin at a press conference.</P>
      <P>One of the treasures  is the Eight  Thousand  Verses  of Transcendental Wisdom,
a major Buddhist classic that dates back to the 12th century, Lin said.</P>
      <P>She described Bhutan as a small country with strong faith, a place where people
live in happiness and spiritual well-being.</P>
      <P>"By showcasing books on Bhutanese culture, we hope local readers will get to
know Bhutan better and learn some of its secrets to leading happier lives," she
said.</P>
      <P>Grace Huang, president of the Bhutan Office in Taiwan, said many people may
think that Bhutanese do not read, but the truth is that the country's free
education policy has helped to foster a reading habit.</P>
      <P>Bhutan also has a thriving publishing industry that includes some 20 publishers,
she said.</P>
      <P>The 2011 book fair is expected to attract several prominent contemporary authors
from abroad such as Jostein Gaarder, author of "Sophie's World;" " Dan Millman,
whose "The Journey of Socrates" has sold millions of copies around the world;
and Japanese fiction writer Yuko Tsushima, who is the daughter of famed novelist
Osamu Dazai.</P>
      <P>In total, some 100 international authors and 200 local writers are expected to
take part in the 2011 TIBE, which is being sponsored by the Government
Information Office. The fair will be held in three exhibition halls at the
Taipei World Trade Center from Feb. 9-14.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: DPP's China policy at crucial juncture</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/23/10  16:24:31
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When the chief negotiators across the Taiwan Strait, Chiang Pin-kung of Taiwan
and China's Chen Yunlin, first held talks in Taipei two years ago, the pro-
independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party led massive protests
against the meeting.</P>
      <P>But similar scenes did not occur when Chiang and Chen met with each other in
Taipei this week. During the run-up to last month's special municipality
elections, the DPP did not even challenge the economic cooperation framework
agreement signed with China in June, because surveys conducted by the DPP itself
revealed that more than 50 percent of the public are in favor of the trade deal.</P>
      <P>With two years having passed since cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue was resumed, the
two sides have engaged in even closer economic exchanges. Furthermore, the
possibility for de jure independence for Taiwan  has  completely  vanished
following  failure  by  the pro-independence force to promote a referendum on a
new constitution during the former DPP administration.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, putting forward a pragmatic China policy is a major
challenge facing the DPP leadership. This is an issue that the party cannot
bypass when bidding for the 2012 presidency.</P>
      <P>If the DPP backtracks to its old anti-China line, the party will probably lose
the support of swing voters that it has managed to obtain over the past year.

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed higher Thursday, hitting a 31-month high, amid active
rotational buying in a market awash in liquidity, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed up 38.38 points, or 0.43 percent, at 8,898.87, the
highest level since May 22, 2008, after moving between 8,874.87 and 8,914.34, on
turnover of NT$133.62 billion (US$4.47 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.35 percent after Wall Street recorded a new two-year
high, and the momentum pushed the index higher, with buying focusing on select
old economy stocks, in particular the paper and cement sectors, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,210 stocks closed up and 1,961 down, while 437 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector scored the highest gains, closing up 2.8 percent.
Cement stocks rose 1.6 percent, construction firms gained 1.4 percent, and the
plastic and chemical sector closed up 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronic sector rose 0.4 percent and the financial sector
gained 0.3 percent, while foodstuffs fell 0.2 percent and textile stocks lost
0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>"The gains were basically liquidity driven, " Concord Securities analyst Allen
Lin said. "With ample funds on hand, investors tended to park their money in
those stocks that have a rosy earnings outlook."</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector was boosted by rising product prices, while investors
were upbeat that cement makers will benefit from strong demand in China when it
kicks off its 12th five-year economic development plan next year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Lin said investor confidence at home and abroad has been reinforced by the two-
year record gains in the U.S. markets.</P>
      <P>"Although recent gains in the local bourse have been limited as the index moves
closer to the resistance point of 8,900, investors have high hopes that the
upward trend will continue in tandem with the foreign markets," Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the paper and pulp sector, Yuen Foong Yu Paper rose 5.17 percent to close at
NT$15.25 and Taiwan Pulp and Paper gained 2.51 percent to end at NT$18.40.</P>
      <P>In the cement sector, Asia Cement closed up 1.86 percent at NT$32.85 and Taiwan
Cement ended 1.83 percent higher at NT$33.40.</P>

      <P>Children at National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital in Taipei received a visit
Thursday from Santa Claus, who had traveled all the way from Finland to bring

      <P>"I wish you all a Merry Christmas, " Santa said to the young patients gathered

      <P>Vice Premier Sean Chen said Thursday that the Ministry  of Education  (MOE)  is
planning  to launch  a cross-ministerial project aimed at stopping campus
bullying, which has come to the forefront in Taiwanese society recently.</P>
      <P>The project -- to be supported by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry
of Justice -- will review and study the core of the campus violence problem,
work out a prevention  and response mechanism,  and seek  cooperation  with
local  governments  in implementing the project, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If  necessary,  he  suggested,   the  MOE  can  ask Minister-without-Portfolio
Ovid Tzeng to preside over the project as a coordinator, the vice premier said.</P>
      <P>Tzeng, a former minister of education, has been known in recent years for his
defense of the rights and interests of Taiwanese athletes and students in
international competitions.</P>
      <P>Noting that bullying has a tremendously negative impact on students' physical
and mental development, Chen said the campus violence-prevention project must be
carried out efficiently in order to provide the country's youth with a safe
environment for education.</P>
      <P>The Bade Junior High School in Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan was the focus of
a series of campus bullying reports in the recent week.</P>
      <P>The MOE removed the school's principal, Wu Chia-ku, from her post Tuesday after
64 teachers from the school sent a joint petition to a lawmaker the previous
day, accusing her of repeatedly turning a blind eye to the worsening safety
situation on her campus.</P>
      <P>In related news, a group of human rights activists met Thursday on the issue and
offered their opinions and suggestions.</P>
      <P>Vita Yeh, secretary-general of the non-profit Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of
Youth Rights and Welfare, called for the MOE to increase the number of social
workers on campuses and to build a preventive network to solve the bullying
problem.</P>
      <P>Yeh called for the MOE to appropriate between NT$1 billion (US$33.33 million)
and NT$2 billion per year to have social workers posted on campuses as the major
pillars of a campus violence prevention drive.</P>

      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der said Thursday that the government is planning to
introduce a "luxury tax, " mainly to satisfy public expectations.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Financial Committee,
Lee said that the plan is to levy reasonably higher taxes on "some goods and
services." However, it will not necessarily be called a "luxury tax," he said.</P>
      <P>But Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the ruling Kuomintang urged the government to
give some thought to the proposal, saying that the tax would not add much more
to the country's revenues and would prompt consumers to buy their high-priced
goods abroad.</P>
      <P>For example, because of its lower tax rates, Hong Kong has been more attractive
than Japan to buyers of high-priced items, Sun said.</P>
      <P>"The luxury tax may not benefit the country much in the long run and may

    <HEADLINE>Academia Sinica: 2011 economy to grow 4.71 percent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica said Thursday that Taiwan's economic growth for 2011 is expected
to be a moderate 4.71 percent from a strong showing in 2010 amid uncertainty
over global economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica, the nation's top research institute, said the moderation also
reflects a high comparison base in 2010, when the country's gross domestic
product (GDP) is expected to rise 10.31 percent, an upgrade of an earlier
forecast by the institute of 6.89 percent.</P>
      <P>The institute said the recent declines in Taiwan's leading indicators point to
the likelihood of an economic growth moderation.</P>
      <P>It said the debt problems in Europe, China's move to tighten its monetary policy
in a bid to curb inflation and a rising New Taiwan dollar are expected to have
an impact on the local economy in the coming year.</P>
      <P>The institute said, however, that exporters might benefit from the recent
passage of an extension of tax cuts for two years in the U.S. Congress, which is
expected to boost demand for consumer electronics and precision machinery.</P>
      <P>On the back of the tax cuts in the U.S., it is likely that the 2011 economic
growth will top 5 percent, said Ray Chou, an economist at the institute.</P>
      <P>While prices of raw materials and crude oil in the international markets are
expected to climb in the coming year amid high liquidity, China's efforts to
fight inflation and the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar are likely to
stabilize domestic consumer prices, Academia Sinica said.</P>
      <P>The institute said the consumer price index for 2011 is expected to rise 1.87
percent, compared with an estimated 1.02 percent increase for 2010.</P>
      <P>While the New Taiwan dollar is riding the wave of appreciation on continued
inflows of foreign funds, Chou said, the central bank is expected to make
significant efforts to stabilize the local currency.</P>
      <P>Chou said that as Taiwan is an export-oriented economy, it is necessary for the
central bank to prevent the New Taiwan dollar from rising too rapidly in a bid
to protect the country's global competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chou said it is unlikely that the central bank will allow the New Taiwan dollar
to rise to NT$28.00 against the U.S. dollar in 2011.</P>
      <P>The institute said private consumption in 2011 is expected to grow 3.54 percent,
while private investment is likely to rise 1.57 percent.</P>

      <P>Labeling that appears on high-quality Taiwanese produce will become a legal mark
in China next year, which is expected to help sales of Taiwanese agricultural
and processed goods, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Certified Agricultural Standards (CAS) label is set to be officially
recognized by the Chinese authorities Jan. 20, said COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung
upon being asked by ruling Kuomintang Legislator  Lin Te-fu at a legislative
session about Chinese consumers' attitudes toward Taiwanese produce.</P>
      <P>The label will let Chinese consumers easily recognize premium agricultural
products from Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwanese produce sales in China is estimated to jump from NT$45

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-cher accused
Korean Air Thursday of discriminating against Taiwanese and demanded an apology
from the company.</P>
      <P>Huang said at a press conference that Korean Air charges S$430.30 (US$329.61)
per ticket "starting from Taiwan" to Seoul on its traditional Chinese-character
website.</P>
      <P>But the airline in its simplified Chinese-character websites charges only 1,831
Chinese Yuan (US$275.4) per trip "from Taiwan, China" to Seoul.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the move is "an attempt to downgrade" Taiwanese, as they
would only be entitled to the cheaper tickets if they accept Beijing's claim
that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>"Korean Air should immediately make a correction and offer an apology to Taiwan,
otherwise we will boycott it," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yung-ching,  a section chief of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said Korean Air prices its tickets from Taipei to Seoul at about NT$8,200 on its
websites in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong, but charges NT$9,800 on its
Singapore website.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he is not sure whether the differences are a result of "a tagging
mistake " and that the CAA will ask the airline to make improvements and
establish a website for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liang Chao-lin, a senior official with the Foreign Ministry's Department of
Asian-Pacific Affairs, said officials at the Taipei branch of Korean Air told
him it has already suggested to its headquarters that the website should be
revised so that it no longer describes Taiwan as "Taiwan, China."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index hit a new high in November on rising demand
from China on a buying spree ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which will
take place in February, the government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The November industrial production index reached 130.34, up 3.08 percent from
October and up 19.37 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said.</P>
      <P>It is the sixth time the index has hit a high so far this year on the back of a
strong showing in export orders and a growing local economy, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mei-na,  deputy director of the ministry's statistics department, said
growing demand for high-tech products from China and an increase in investment
in Taiwan pushed the November industrial production index up further.</P>
      <P>After seasonal adjustments, the local industrial production index for November
rose 6.61 percent from a month earlier, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>The index of manufacturing production rose 19.94 percent, with production in the
electronic component segment rising 28.72 percent after new products hit the
market and fresh promotion  sales strategies boosted buying interest.</P>
      <P>Production of the base metal segment for the month rose 21.73 percent from a
year earlier, while production of the chemical segment gained 4.75 percent year-
on-year, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the ministry shows that 14.75 percent of the respondents
agreed that December's industrial production will continue to expand,  while
8.72 percent of those polled said production will fall. Meanwhile, 76.53 percent
said December's industrial production will be little changed from November.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next China leader likely to keep peaceful cross-strait ties: SEF head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
12/23/10  20:12:10
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The next leader of China is likely to continue with a peaceful approach to
China-Taiwan affairs, Taiwan's top cross-strait negotiator said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fresh off the sixth round of cross-strait negotiations, Chiang Pin-kung,
Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told CNA in an interview that
the peaceful development of cross-strait relations is obviously a vision shared
by the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Peace" is the key word in cross-strait exchanges because the two sides can only
develop and prosper if peace is preserved, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, Chiang said, some Taiwanese businessmen in recent years have opted
to invest in Vietnam or Indonesia instead of the Philippines, where social order
and political stability have been less than satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he has not met Xi Jinping, who is scheduled to succeed Hu
Jintao in 2012 as president of China, but he expects that Xi will maintain Hu's
Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>However,  Chiang  acknowledged  that  there  has been some inconsistency  in
China's  policies  toward direct cross-strait negotiations and Taiwan's
international participation.</P>
      <P>This is because China's foreign ministry "has its own way of thinking," he said.</P>
      <P>Several cases in the past were indicative of China's intolerance regarding
Taiwan's participation in the international community, he said.</P>
      <P>China's attitude on this issue could affect bilateral relations and the Taiwan
people's impression of China since "almost all these cases made headlines in the
Taiwanese newspapers," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had often reminded the Chinese government that Beijing's foreign
embassies "are still acting in the same way," he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Chiang and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, President of the
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), signed a medical and
health-care cooperation agreement, the 15th pact between the two sides since
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008 and began advocating cross-strait
detente.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, cross-strait talks have entered a phase of "substance over
style, " which he said means the content of the negotiations is more important
than the process. In the future, the talks are likely to be more difficult, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the SEF will focus on the implementation of the existing
agreements  and will advocate continued and wide bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan should be more confident and open its doors wider to
Chinese students, he said.</P>
      <P>With its proud democracy, Taiwan will be able to "make them pro-Taiwan, " he
said. "The more China and the people of China understand Taiwan, the more they
will respect us for our democracy, hospitality, courtesy, vibrant culture and
way of life."</P>
      <P>Chiang lauded the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) move to
establish a think tank that will formulate its China policy over the next
decade.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP, which was firmly anti-China in the past, had to think
about this issue sooner or later.</P>

      <P>More than 52 percent of Taiwan's office workers cannot wait to quit their jobs
even before receiving their year-end bonuses, according to the results of an
online survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the 104 job bank, said 77 percent of the employees
surveyed plan to change their jobs, of which 25 percent said they will start job
hunting after receiving their New Year bonuses, a period considered to be the
best time to change jobs.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, there will be 359,000 vacancies for 278,000 job
seekers, as a result of the economic rebound.</P>
      <P>Seventy-four percent of the companies surveyed in the financial sector,

in 2011, the manpower agency said.</P>
      <P>Office workers are expected to receive an average bonus of 1.82 months at the
year-end, a slight increase from 1.73 months last year, according to another
online survey conducted by the 1111 job bank.</P>
      <P>The 1111 online bank said 82 percent of the companies will give incentives based
on employee performance appraisals and the average bonuses given out by other

      <P>First Commercial Bank, which is partially government controlled, opened a branch
in Shanghai Thursday, becoming one of the first two Taiwan banks to do so.</P>
      <P>The First Commercial Bank branch, located in the Changning District in
Shanghai's Puxi Region, is poised to take advantage of a boom in China's
domestic consumer market, said Chou Po-chiao, executive vice president of the
bank.</P>
      <P>The branch initially aims to serve Taiwanese businesspeople in China who require
funds in foreign currencies, said Chou, who traveled to Shanghai from Taipei for
the grand opening.</P>
      <P>The Puxi branch will start with this service and after one year, it is expected
to show a profit and thus become eligible to expand to Chinese yuan business
services, according Lu Hsin-chih, who has been appointed manager of the branch.</P>
      <P>Under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) that was signed
between Taiwan and China in June, Taiwanese banks will be allowed to conduct
Chinese yuan business in the second year if they make a profit in the first year
of operation.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank will soon begin planning for branches in other areas of
China, including the central and western parts of the country, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also on Thursday, another Taiwan institution, Cathay United Bank,
opened a branch in Shanghai's upscale Lujiazui financial zone in the Pudong
Region.</P>
      <P>Cathay United Bank Vice President Lee Wei-cheng said at the opening ceremony
that the bank will seek to establish a second branch in China soon, probably in
the Haixi Area, the Bohai region or in Sichuan Province.</P>
      <P>After its two branches have been set up, Cathay United Bank will be able to
found a subsidiary in China to expand its business to personal wealth services,
according to Lee.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank and Cathay United Bank were among the first five Taiwanese
banks to gain approval from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to
open branches in China.</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan was also given the green light by CBRC to open a branch in
Shanghai, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank has obtained approval to set up a branch in
Kunshan, and Taiwan Cooperative Bank was given permission to open a branch in
Suzhou.</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan said Tuesday it is scheduled to open a Shanghai branch Dec.
29, becoming the first state-owned bank to upgrade its mainland representative
office to a branch.</P>
      <P>In an earlier statement, the CBRC said it hopes that the presence of Taiwan's
bank branches in China will help to promote cross-strait economic and trade
relations and maintain the steady development of the cross-strait banking
sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semi-professional basketball league will open its new season Saturday
in suburban Taipei, with defending champion Yulon Luxgen eyeing its fifth title
in the team's history.</P>
      <P>Yulon is scheduled to meet Dacin Tigers Dec. 25 in a rematch of last season's
final to unveil the 2010-11 season of the Super Basketball League (SBL),
Taiwan's top basketball competition.</P>
      <P>Perennial powerhouse Yulon, which won three straight titles from 2003-2006,
defeated Dacin four games to two in the best-of-seven SBL Finals in May to win
its fourth crown.</P>
      <P>However, the team lost its starting point guard Lee Hsueh-lin, who signed with
the Chinese Basketball Association's (CBA's) Beijing, and it is in jeopardy of
losing its starting center Tseng Wen-ting, whose contract will expire Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Tseng is also contemplating playing in China and is still negotiating a contract
extension with Yulon.</P>
      <P>A total of 105 regular season games will be played from Dec. 25, 2010 to March
20, 2011 in four venues around the country, including Sinjhuang Stadium in
Xinbei City, Yilan University Gymnasium in the eastern city of Yilan, Taipei
Gymnasium in downtown Taipei City and Fengshan Gymnasium in Fengshan in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Every team will play a 30-game regular season, meeting each of their six
opponents five times, according to the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association
(CTBA), governing body of the seven-team SBL, which was established in 2003.</P>
      <P>The top four teams will advance to the playoffs, which are scheduled to be
played from March 23 to April 17. The first round playoffs and the finals will
both adopt the best-of-seven format.</P>
      <P>One imported player is allowed for every team. The import registration deadline
is Feb. 12, which means that teams are free to change their imports up until
that day.</P>

      <P>NX Theatre, a new group that combines magic tricks with other performing arts,
will challenge itself by staging more than 100 shows in two months in Taipei,
its director said Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-ling, a music composer who founded NX Theatre, said at a press
conference that in the last 10 years, he has spent over NT$5 million on large-
scale props and equipment from Las Vegas, in the hope of creating a new
entertaining art form.</P>
      <P>"Illusion is the highest form of magic. It's about appearance, disappearance,
incision,  transformation and escape, " he told reporters.</P>
      <P>NX Theatre shows are not the type that focus on a single magician performing a
dazzling array of magic tricks, he said. Rather, each actor is trained to
perform magic on stage, and to complement his or her performance with dance,
singing, and plenty of visual effects, he said.</P>
      <P>"One More Day with You, " NX Theatre's first presentation, was inspired by the
work of Taiwanese illustrator Jimmy Liao. It tells the story of a sentimental
boy meeting a girl whose best friend has just passed away, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Director of the show Hung Hung said Liao's work is very popular among readers in
Taiwan, but it is somewhat difficult to visualize on stage because of the
artist's surrealistic style.</P>
      <P>Hung promised to give audiences a surprise every five to 10 minutes, saying the
magic acts in the show are the best he has ever seen.</P>
      <P>"One More Day with You" will star Faye, the lead vocal in the local band "FIR;"
Jack Yao, who plays the main character in the movie "Au Revoir Taipei;" and
indie pop singer-songwriter Peggy Hsu.</P>
      <P>The shows will be held at Huashan Creative Park from Dec. 24 to Feb. 28, 2011.</P>

      <P>Prohibitive property prices in major cities, which have continued to skyrocket
despite a wage stagnation, will eventually lead to a bubble in Taiwan's real
estate sector, a pundit warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>The average housing price in Taipei City has leapt to NT$419,000 (US$13,967) per
ping (3.3 square meters) , about 11.1 times the per capita income in the capital
city, said Chang Chin-oh, a professor of land economics at National Chengchi
University, citing the results of a recent survey on housing demand in Taiwan in
the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The ratio of housing price to per capita income was a record high of its kind,
with buyers paying an average of NT$11.35 million for a home in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>This means that the average adult will not necessarily be able to buy a home in
the city even if he were to stop spending altogether on food or drink for 11
consecutive years to save money, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the other six major cities around Taiwan, the average housing price was
NT$207,000 per ping, about eight times the per capita income in those cities.
Home-buyers paid an average of NT$7.18 million for a home, according to the
survey conducted by the Construction and Planning Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>With a housing price-per capita income ratio of 8: 1, also a record high, home
buyers in the six cities would have to "stop eating and drinking" for eight
consecutive years in order to buy a home, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said the administration should come up with more efficient measures to arrest
skyrocketing housing prices -- which are mostly the result of real estate
speculation.</P>
      <P>"To prevent Taiwan from becoming 'an island of real estate speculation,' the
government needs to crack down on the speculators," he said.</P>

      <P>A concert celebrating the approaching New Year's Eve will be held this year for

      <P>The event was initiated after the number of Chinese travelers to Taiwan in

      <P>Labeling that appears on high-quality Taiwanese produce will become a legal mark
in China next year, which is expected to help sales of Taiwanese agricultural
and processed goods, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Certified Agricultural Standards (CAS) label is set to be officially
recognized by the Chinese authorities Jan. 20, said COA Minister Chen Wu-hsiung
upon being asked by ruling Kuomintang Legislator  Lin Te-fu at a legislative
session about Chinese consumers' attitudes toward Taiwanese produce.</P>
      <P>The label will let Chinese consumers easily recognize premium agricultural
products from Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwanese produce sales in China is estimated to jump from NT$45
billion (US$1.505 billion) to NT$53 billion per year once the label makes its
debut there, Chen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Huang Wei-cher accused
Korean Air Thursday of discriminating against Taiwanese and demanded an apology
from the company.</P>
      <P>Huang said at a press conference that Korean Air charges S$430.30 (US$329.61)
per ticket "starting from Taiwan" to Seoul on its traditional Chinese-character
website.</P>
      <P>But the airline in its simplified Chinese-character websites charges only 1,831
Chinese Yuan (US$275.4) per trip "from Taiwan, China" to Seoul.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the move is "an attempt to downgrade" Taiwanese, as they
would only be entitled to the cheaper tickets if they accept Beijing's claim
that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>"Korean Air should immediately make a correction and offer an apology to Taiwan,
otherwise we will boycott it," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yung-ching,  a section chief of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
said Korean Air prices its tickets from Taipei to Seoul at about NT$8,200 on its
websites in the United States, Europe and Hong Kong, but charges NT$9,800 on its
Singapore website.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he is not sure whether the differences are a result of "a tagging
mistake " and that the CAA will ask the airline to make improvements and
establish a website for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liang Chao-lin, a senior official with the Foreign Ministry's Department of
Asian-Pacific Affairs, said officials at the Taipei branch of Korean Air told
him it has already suggested to its headquarters that the website should be
revised so that it no longer describes Taiwan as "Taiwan, China."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's industrial production index hit a new high in November on rising demand
from China on a buying spree ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which will
take place in February, the government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The November industrial production index reached 130.34, up 3.08 percent from
October and up 19.37 percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said.</P>
      <P>It is the sixth time the index has hit a high so far this year on the back of a
strong showing in export orders and a growing local economy, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mei-na,  deputy director of the ministry's statistics department, said
growing demand for high-tech products from China and an increase in investment
in Taiwan pushed the November industrial production index up further.</P>
      <P>After seasonal adjustments, the local industrial production index for November
rose 6.61 percent from a month earlier, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>The index of manufacturing production rose 19.94 percent, with production in the
electronic component segment rising 28.72 percent after new products hit the
market and fresh promotion  sales strategies boosted buying interest.</P>
      <P>Production of the base metal segment for the month rose 21.73 percent from a
year earlier, while production of the chemical segment gained 4.75 percent year-
on-year, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the ministry shows that 14.75 percent of the respondents
agreed that December's industrial production will continue to expand,  while
8.72 percent of those polled said production will fall. Meanwhile, 76.53 percent
said December's industrial production will be little changed from November.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next China leader likely to keep peaceful cross-strait ties: SEF head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
12/23/10  20:12:10

    <TEXT>
      <P>The next leader of China is likely to continue with a peaceful approach to
China-Taiwan affairs, Taiwan's top cross-strait negotiator said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fresh off the sixth round of cross-strait negotiations, Chiang Pin-kung,
Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), told CNA in an interview that
the peaceful development of cross-strait relations is obviously a vision shared
by the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Peace" is the key word in cross-strait exchanges because the two sides can only
develop and prosper if peace is preserved, he said.</P>
      <P>For example, Chiang said, some Taiwanese businessmen in recent years have opted
to invest in Vietnam or Indonesia instead of the Philippines, where social order
and political stability have been less than satisfactory.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that he has not met Xi Jinping, who is scheduled to succeed Hu
Jintao in 2012 as president of China, but he expects that Xi will maintain Hu's
Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>However,  Chiang  acknowledged  that  there  has been some inconsistency  in
China's  policies  toward direct cross-strait negotiations and Taiwan's
international participation.</P>
      <P>This is because China's foreign ministry "has its own way of thinking," he said.</P>
      <P>Several cases in the past were indicative of China's intolerance regarding
Taiwan's participation in the international community, he said.</P>
      <P>China's attitude on this issue could affect bilateral relations and the Taiwan
people's impression of China since "almost all these cases made headlines in the
Taiwanese newspapers," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had often reminded the Chinese government that Beijing's foreign
embassies "are still acting in the same way," he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Chiang and his Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, President of the
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), signed a medical and
health-care cooperation agreement, the 15th pact between the two sides since
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008 and began advocating cross-strait
detente.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, cross-strait talks have entered a phase of "substance over
style, " which he said means the content of the negotiations is more important
than the process. In the future, the talks are likely to be more difficult, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the SEF will focus on the implementation of the existing
agreements  and will advocate continued and wide bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan should be more confident and open its doors wider to
Chinese students, he said.</P>
      <P>With its proud democracy, Taiwan will be able to "make them pro-Taiwan, " he
said. "The more China and the people of China understand Taiwan, the more they
will respect us for our democracy, hospitality, courtesy, vibrant culture and
way of life."</P>
      <P>Chiang lauded the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) move to
establish a think tank that will formulate its China policy over the next
decade.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP, which was firmly anti-China in the past, had to think
about this issue sooner or later.</P>

      <P>First Commercial Bank, which is partially government controlled, opened a branch
in Shanghai Thursday, becoming one of the first two Taiwan banks to do so.</P>
      <P>The First Commercial Bank branch, located in the Changning District in
Shanghai's Puxi Region, is poised to take advantage of a boom in China's
domestic consumer market, said Chou Po-chiao, executive vice president of the
bank.</P>
      <P>The branch initially aims to serve Taiwanese businesspeople in China who require
funds in foreign currencies, said Chou, who traveled to Shanghai from Taipei for
the grand opening.</P>
      <P>The Puxi branch will start with this service and after one year, it is expected
to show a profit and thus become eligible to expand to Chinese yuan business
services, according Lu Hsin-chih, who has been appointed manager of the branch.</P>
      <P>Under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) that was signed
between Taiwan and China in June, Taiwanese banks will be allowed to conduct
Chinese yuan business in the second year if they make a profit in the first year
of operation.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank will soon begin planning for branches in other areas of
China, including the central and western parts of the country, Lu added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, also on Thursday, another Taiwan institution, Cathay United Bank,
opened a branch in Shanghai's upscale Lujiazui financial zone in the Pudong
Region.</P>
      <P>Cathay United Bank Vice President Lee Wei-cheng said at the opening ceremony
that the bank will seek to establish a second branch in China soon, probably in
the Haixi Area, the Bohai region or in Sichuan Province.</P>
      <P>After its two branches have been set up, Cathay United Bank will be able to
found a subsidiary in China to expand its business to personal wealth services,
according to Lee.</P>
      <P>First Commercial Bank and Cathay United Bank were among the first five Taiwanese
banks to gain approval from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) to
open branches in China.</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan was also given the green light by CBRC to open a branch in
Shanghai, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank has obtained approval to set up a branch in
Kunshan, and Taiwan Cooperative Bank was given permission to open a branch in
Suzhou.</P>
      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan said Tuesday it is scheduled to open a Shanghai branch Dec.
29, becoming the first state-owned bank to upgrade its mainland representative
office to a branch.</P>
      <P>In an earlier statement, the CBRC said it hopes that the presence of Taiwan's
bank branches in China will help to promote cross-strait economic and trade
relations and maintain the steady development of the cross-strait banking
sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semi-professional basketball league will open its new season Saturday
in suburban Taipei, with defending champion Yulon Luxgen eyeing its fifth title
in the team's history.</P>
      <P>Yulon is scheduled to meet Dacin Tigers Dec. 25 in a rematch of last season's
final to unveil the 2010-11 season of the Super Basketball League (SBL),
Taiwan's top basketball competition.</P>
      <P>Perennial powerhouse Yulon, which won three straight titles from 2003-2006,
defeated Dacin four games to two in the best-of-seven SBL Finals in May to win
its fourth crown.</P>
      <P>However, the team lost its starting point guard Lee Hsueh-lin, who signed with
the Chinese Basketball Association's (CBA's) Beijing, and it is in jeopardy of
losing its starting center Tseng Wen-ting, whose contract will expire Jan. 15.</P>
      <P>Tseng is also contemplating playing in China and is still negotiating a contract
extension with Yulon.</P>
      <P>A total of 105 regular season games will be played from Dec. 25, 2010 to March
20, 2011 in four venues around the country, including Sinjhuang Stadium in
Xinbei City, Yilan University Gymnasium in the eastern city of Yilan, Taipei
Gymnasium in downtown Taipei City and Fengshan Gymnasium in Fengshan in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Every team will play a 30-game regular season, meeting each of their six
opponents five times, according to the Chinese Taipei Basketball Association
(CTBA), governing body of the seven-team SBL, which was established in 2003.</P>
      <P>The top four teams will advance to the playoffs, which are scheduled to be
played from March 23 to April 17. The first round playoffs and the finals will
both adopt the best-of-seven format.</P>
      <P>One imported player is allowed for every team. The import registration deadline
is Feb. 12, which means that teams are free to change their imports up until

      <P>NX Theatre, a new group that combines magic tricks with other performing arts,
will challenge itself by staging more than 100 shows in two months in Taipei,
its director said Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-ling, a music composer who founded NX Theatre, said at a press
conference that in the last 10 years, he has spent over NT$5 million on large-
scale props and equipment from Las Vegas, in the hope of creating a new
entertaining art form.</P>
      <P>"Illusion is the highest form of magic. It's about appearance, disappearance,
incision,  transformation and escape, " he told reporters.</P>
      <P>NX Theatre shows are not the type that focus on a single magician performing a
dazzling array of magic tricks, he said. Rather, each actor is trained to
perform magic on stage, and to complement his or her performance with dance,
singing, and plenty of visual effects, he said.</P>
      <P>"One More Day with You, " NX Theatre's first presentation, was inspired by the
work of Taiwanese illustrator Jimmy Liao. It tells the story of a sentimental
boy meeting a girl whose best friend has just passed away, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Director of the show Hung Hung said Liao's work is very popular among readers in
Taiwan, but it is somewhat difficult to visualize on stage because of the
artist's surrealistic style.</P>
      <P>Hung promised to give audiences a surprise every five to 10 minutes, saying the
magic acts in the show are the best he has ever seen.</P>
      <P>"One More Day with You" will star Faye, the lead vocal in the local band "FIR;"
Jack Yao, who plays the main character in the movie "Au Revoir Taipei;" and
indie pop singer-songwriter Peggy Hsu.</P>
      <P>The shows will be held at Huashan Creative Park from Dec. 24 to Feb. 28, 2011.</P>

      <P>Prohibitive property prices in major cities, which have continued to skyrocket
despite a wage stagnation, will eventually lead to a bubble in Taiwan's real
estate sector, a pundit warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>The average housing price in Taipei City has leapt to NT$419,000 (US$13,967) per
ping (3.3 square meters) , about 11.1 times the per capita income in the capital
city, said Chang Chin-oh, a professor of land economics at National Chengchi
University, citing the results of a recent survey on housing demand in Taiwan in
the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The ratio of housing price to per capita income was a record high of its kind,
with buyers paying an average of NT$11.35 million for a home in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>This means that the average adult will not necessarily be able to buy a home in
the city even if he were to stop spending altogether on food or drink for 11
consecutive years to save money, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the other six major cities around Taiwan, the average housing price was
NT$207,000 per ping, about eight times the per capita income in those cities.
Home-buyers paid an average of NT$7.18 million for a home, according to the
survey conducted by the Construction and Planning Administration under the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>With a housing price-per capita income ratio of 8: 1, also a record high, home
buyers in the six cities would have to "stop eating and drinking" for eight
consecutive years in order to buy a home, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said the administration should come up with more efficient measures to arrest
skyrocketing housing prices -- which are mostly the result of real estate
speculation.</P>
      <P>"To prevent Taiwan from becoming 'an island of real estate speculation,' the
government needs to crack down on the speculators," he said.</P>

      <P>Due to the various complex and sensitive issues involved, a planned Taiwan-China
investment protection agreement was not ready for signing  in the sixth round of
talks between  the chief cross-strait negotiators, Taiwan's Chiang Pin-kung and
China's Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention is the question of where arbitration proceedings
should be held. China rejected Taiwan's proposal that investment disputes be
resolved at the Washington-headquartered International Center for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes (ICSID) under the World Bank, or the Paris-based
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) . China expressed concern that this
might internationalize cross-strait issues. China saw Hong Kong as the best
choice, but Taiwan would not agree because Hong Kong is part of China.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, we suggest considering Singapore as an alternative.</P>
      <P>Beijing is willing to sign an investment protection agreement with Taipei
because it expects a large number of Chinese businesses will invest in Taiwan.
However, although Taiwan opened its doors to Chinese investors last year, many
restrictions remain. If Chinese businesses cannot invest in Taiwan, what is the
point of China signing such a deal with Taiwan?</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government, therefore, should further liberalize its restrictions on
Chinese investors and open up all non-sensitive sectors.</P>
      <P>An increased presence of Chinese investors in Taiwan will boost Beijing's
interest in negotiating  the agreement with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>recently decided to revoke the license of ERA Comprehensive Channel, which will
in effect shut down the channel after repeated violations of a ban on embedded
advertising. The decision has raised a public outcry.</P>
      <P>Over the past six years, the NCC has slapped fines totaling NT$16.75 million
(US$558,333)  on the channel. We think these penalties are enough. The
violations do not deserve such a severe punishment as license revocation.
Furthermore, is there a law that stipulates the NCC can "revoke licenses" at its
own discretion?</P>
      <P>In a broader context, the NCC's action has undoubtedly hurt freedom of speech in
Taiwan. Some people may think that this incident is unrelated to freedom of
speech because the victim is a news channel. However, if society allows an
administrative agency to exercise such great power over the fate of
entertainment channels today, this power will probably expanded to news channels
tomorrow. In other words, it can become a government tool to control the media.</P>
      <P>We believe the power of the market and society will correct any undesirable
media trends and we hope that the government will use its regulatory authority
with caution and restraint. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 24, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Today is Christmas Eve, a time to celebrate the nativity of Jesus and the
heavenly peace it brought.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Christmas Eve night is not supposed to be for partying, but rather
should be a time for reflecting -- something that our government policy makers,
in particular, need to do.</P>
      <P>Is there peace in Taiwanese society? The answer is probably 'no.' Today,
children are bullied in school, and after graduation, they have to worry about
finding a good job. People who want to get married are deterred by skyrocketing
housing prices, while those who want to have children are afraid that they
cannot afford to become parents.</P>
      <P>Although government officials always say they want to boost the country's birth
rate, the government's housing policy in recent years in fact has been fueling
the already red-hot housing market.</P>
      <P>Official statistics show that there are approximately 2 million workers in
Taiwan who earn less than NT$20,000 a month, and more than 1 million people are
in households affected by unemployment. This problem will never be solved unless
the government changes its industrial policy.</P>
      <P>Jesus said that "in me you may have peace." We earnestly wish that our policy
makers will review their current policies with a compassionate spirit, so as to
end the people's suffering and bring them peace instead. (Editorial abstract --

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Three measures to stabilize currency market</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The Central  Bank of the Republic  of China  (CBC)
12/24/10  13:05:39
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>has tightened monitoring of investment activities of local financial service
providers abroad and taken new steps to stabilize the Taiwan dollar amid a
global capital overflow.</P>
      <P>It has reportedly adopted a "three noes" policy that prohibits financial service
companies from remitting their overseas earnings back to Taiwan, increasing
their hedged positions or conducting forward foreign exchange trading.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, market sources said Thursday that although the CBC has taken many
steps to help cool the local property market, housing prices have continued to
rise in metropolitan Taipei and NT$1.3 trillion worth of projects will be
tendered throughout Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issues:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The weighted price index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange closed at a 31-month high
Thursday, which helped drive the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate against the U.S.
dollar up by NT$0.798 to a high of NT$29.807 at one point during the trade.</P>
      <P>However, with the central bank's intervention late in the session, the Taiwan
dollar closed at NT$30.485 Thursday, up NT$0.12.</P>
      <P>With hot money inflows continuing unabated, the central bank remains firm on its
goal to keep the Taiwan currency stable. Under this policy, banking sources
said, large domestic banks with huge overseas investments and insurance
companies have become the CBC's priority watch targets.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the overseas investments of Taiwan life insurers  have
reach an estimated  NT$3.55 trillion (US$118.33 billion).</P>
      <P>The central bank has asked life insurance companies not to remit profits from
their overseas investments back to Taiwan as this will fuel the Taiwan dollar's
appreciation against the greenback, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the sources said, the central bank has also rejected some commercial
banks' applications  to increase their hedged positions after they remitted some
of their U.S. dollar holdings abroad.</P>
      <P>The central bank has also advised local exporters not to engage in forward
foreign exchange trading but instead to engage in currency swap to prevent
further appreciation of the local currency, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Senior bankers said the central bank was forced to adopt these measures to
prevent financial services groups from engaging in speculative currency deals
under the guise of hedging against risk. (Dec. 24, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Despite the government's efforts to stem housing prices, the results of the
latest government survey indicated that the home procurement miserable index
(the ratio of housing price to household income) in Taipei City surged to yet
another high in the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The survey conducted by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) found that housing
prices in Taipei City rose to an average of NT$419,000 per ping (3.3 square
meters) in the third quarter -- 11.1 times the city's average household income.
In the second quarter, the figure was 10.87 times the average household income.</P>
      <P>The home procurement miserable index in the neighboring Taipei County also rose
from 7.8 in the first half of this year to 8.9 in the third quarter, while the
figure for the whole of Taiwan hit an all-time high of 8, according to the MOI
survey.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that CBC's selective credit control moves have not cooled
real estate investment, as new home trade deals accounted for 18.5 percent of
overall transactions around the country, up from 17.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a housing magazine published by PC Home Group said the value of new
housing construction projects to be launched next year around Taiwan will reach
a historic high of NT$1.37 trillion. (Dec. 24, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has intimated that the reports of defects
in the new Taiwan passports were overblown considering that there have only been
a few faulty documents among the 2 million issued.</P>
      <P>Since the first biometric passports were issued on Dec. 29, 2008, the Bureau of
Consular Affairs (BOCA) has received only 14 requests for changes to the
passports based on physical flaws in the documents, the MOFA said in a statement
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that the BOCA has issued nearly 2.3 million e-passports, it means
that only about 6 millionths have defects, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>The passports were designed according to strict security and quality standards,
the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>The state-owned Central Engraving and Printing Plant in Taipei County, which has
the contract to print the new passports, was cited by the MOFA in the statement
as saying that it had adhered to the standards set by the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO).</P>
      <P>The ICAO is a specialized United Nations agency that adopts standards and
recommended practices for, among other things, the facilitation of border-
crossing procedures for international civil aviation.</P>
      <P>The plant, which also prints banknotes and stamps, said that after printing,
the blank passports  are sent to France for professional quality checks before
delivery to the BOCA. The paper quality must meet international standards, it
added.</P>
      <P>At a Legislative Yuan hearing earlier in the day, ruling Kuomintang Legislator
Lu Shiow-yen said the new biometric passports were flawed and that the
production was sub-standard.</P>
      <P>Displaying an e-passport that she said was issued in August, Lu pointed out that
the spine was damaged.</P>
      <P>"The whole passport is falling apart" and it is basically a new one, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu also questioned the quality of the paper used, saying that the pages of the
passport were "thin like cicadas wings" and could be easily torn out.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's retail sales for 2010 are expected to hit a record high on the back of
a strong economic rebound, The Ministry of Economic Affairs said Friday.</P>
      <P>Beatrice Tsai, deputy director of the statistics department at the MOEA,
forecast that retail sales for 2010 will rise 6.4 percent from 2009 to NT$3.49
trillion (US$116.85 billion).</P>
      <P>"Retail sales data is one of the major indicators of private consumption, " Tsai
told the Central News Agency. " As the local economy is growing, we expect
retail sales to hit a record high this year."</P>
      <P>In November, retail sales totaled NT$299.9 billion, up 5.46 percent from a year
earlier, and the figure in December is expected to reach NT$300 billion, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>The falling jobless rate, which was at almost a two-year low of 4.73 percent in
November, and a booming local stock market has boosted buying in the retail
sector, she said.</P>
      <P>Many retailers in Taiwan are expanding their operations by opening new stores,
in anticipation of more business as a result of larger numbers of Chinese
tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said the implementation of the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) signed by Taiwan and China in late June has also reinforced consumer
confidence.</P>
      <P>"With consumer confidence on the rise, sales of big-ticket items are rebounding,
in particular car sales," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In the first 11 months of the year, car sales totaled around 297,000 units and
the number is expected to reach a four-year high of 325,000 for the entire 2010,
Tsai said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan shares closed down 0.42 percent Friday on profit taking from a previous
session as investors took cues from a lackluster performance on Wall Street
overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 37.77 points to 8,861.10, after moving between 8,861.01
and 8,911.41, on turnover of NT$120.77 billion (US$120.04).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.13 percent and moved to the day's high on follow-through
buying, but pressure emerged to reverse the gains after the index briefly
breached the technical resistance point of 8,900, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,911 stocks closed down and 1,278 up, while 348 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector suffered the steepest decline, ending down 1.2
percent. Cement stocks fell 0.9 percent, textile firms lost 0.7 percent and the
machinery and electronic sector closed down 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Foodstuffs lost 0.4 percent,  construction stocks fell 0.3 percent, and plastic
and chemical shares dropped 0.1 percent, while the financial sector closed
unchanged.</P>
      <P>"As the index moved closer to the 8,900 point mark after recent gains,
resistance pressure mounted,"  TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>The local bourse hit a 31-month  high Thursday on active rotational buying.</P>
      <P>"With turnover remaining moderate ahead of the Christmas holiday, it was not
easy for the market to overcome the technical hurdles. That's why it took a
pause today," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said selling largely focused on old economy stocks that had been boosted by
a rising New Taiwan dollar on hopes that the value of their domestic assets
would rise accordingly.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, the downside was limited as the market still held itself well
above 8,800 points amid ample liquidity," Shih said, "It is possible that the
market will move in a narrow range over the next few trading sessions."</P>
      <P>Among the old economy stocks, food maker Lien Hwa Industrial fell 2.69 percent
to NT$23.50, Prince Housing dropped 2.20 percent to NT$24.40 and Taiwan Pulp and
Paper slid 1.63 percent to NT$18.10.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmakers to press NCC to retract license revocation decision</HEADLINE>

      <P>Opposition legislators vowed Friday to introduce a resolution demanding that the
National Communications Commission (NCC) retract its decision to revoke the
license of a cable TV channel, a decision the lawmakers feared would have a
chilling effect on other broadcasters.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Men-an, a whip of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
caucus, the NCC's decision could be unlawful and may have violated the
constitutionally protected freedom of communication.</P>
      <P>The caucus would also seek the support of ruling Kuomintang legislators for its
action, Pan said.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan, which enacted the NCC's organic law, does not want to
become an accomplice in the suppression of the media," he said.</P>
      <P>The NCC decided on Wednesday to revoke the license of ERA TV's entertainment
channel because it repeatedly violated a ban on embedded advertising. The
decision has drawn heavy criticism from media freedom advocates.</P>
      <P>NCC spokesman Chen Cheng-chang defended the agency's decision, however, saying
that the NCC had given the station a one-year buffer period to improve, but the
station obviously failed to do so.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that a committee reviewing the TV channel's license renewal
application a year ago had recommended that the NCC reject the application, but
the regulator eventually agreed to renew the station's license on condition that
there would be no more violations.</P>
      <P>With the channel guilty of several similar violations over the past year, the
NCC's latest decision to revoke the channel's license was completely lawful, he
insisted.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the channel will have to stop broadcasting starting
Dec. 30 or Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said President Ma
Ying-jeou will not interfere with any decisions made by the NCC because it is an
independent organization.</P>
      <P>If the TV channel is not satisfied with the NCC ruling, it can file an appeal,
Lo said.</P>

      <P>Luxgen Motor Co., a subsidiary of Taiwan's largest carmaker Yulon Motor Co.,
said Friday that it will work to expand its markets in the Middle East and make
inroads into Russia next year.</P>
      <P>Luxgen, which was launched in January 2009, has recently signed agreements with
dealers in Oman, Bahrain, Vietnam, Qatar and the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>The company entered these markets after participating in car exhibitions that
eventually led to partnerships between the company and its dealers in these
countries, Luxgen's Senior Vice President Vincent Tsao told reporters at an auto
show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We plan to expand our market scope in the Middle East to cover Saudi Arabia,
Iran and others countries," he said.</P>
      <P>The car company will take part in an auto exhibition in Dubai next year, he
said. With an eye on entering the Russian market next year, the company is also
considering participating an auto show in Russia in the second half of 2011, he
added.</P>
      <P>On the question of how it plans to market its vehicles to foreign consumers,
Tsao said that Luxgen's advantage is its incorporation of Taiwan's information
and energy technologies  into its vehicle electronic systems.</P>
      <P>He added that Luxgen's current marketing strategy is focused on branding rather
than quantity.</P>
      <P>Luxgen made its first overseas shipment on Dec. 20, sending 100 vehicles to the
Dominican Republic. The company has forecast that its overseas shipments will
exceed 1,000 units next year.</P>
      <P>For the Chinese market, a joint venture formed by Yulon and China's Dongfeng
Motor Corp. earlier this month is planning to ship luxury Luxgen models there in
the first half of next year, Tsao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan should help U.S. defend Taiwan: Japanese poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of Japanese agreed to their country offering logistical
support to the United States if America had to assist Taiwan militarily in a
showdown with China, according to the results of a Japanese poll released
Friday.</P>
      <P>In the survey conducted by Japanese daily The Asahi Shimbun Dec. 4-5, 57 percent
of the 3,000 respondents said Japan's self-defense forces should provide
transportation and other logistic support to the U.S. military if war were to
break out across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Only 30 percent of respondents opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>On the same question asked in a parallel poll conducted in the U.S. by Harris
Interactive for the newspaper Dec. 2-6, 65 percent of the 1,009 respondents said
Japanese self-defense forces should assist the U.S. logistically while 23
percent said there was no such need.</P>
      <P>The Asahi survey in Japan also found that an increasing number of Japanese feel
that China's military poses a threat to their country. Some 32 percent of
respondents felt that way in this year's poll, up from 13 percent in 2005 and 8
percent in 2001.</P>
      <P>North Korea was perceived as Japan's biggest military threat, with almost half
(49 percent) of the respondents citing it as such.</P>
      <P>Some 72 percent of the Japanese respondents felt Japan should strengthen
cooperation with the U.S., and 61 percent of the Americans felt their country
should do the same with Japan, according to the surveys.</P>
      <P>The polls also found that 51 percent of the Japanese respondents and 55 percent
of the Americans surveyed thought their countries should beef up cooperation
with China.</P>
      <P>Which country is more important to the Japanese: China or the U.S.? Over two-
thirds (68 percent) of Japanese said the U.S. , compared with a mere 15 percent
who pointed to China.</P>
      <P>But when Americans were asked which country was more important to them, half of
the U.S. respondents named China and only 33 percent said Japan.</P>
      <P>As many as 78 percent of Japanese respondents said the Japan-U.S. security
treaty should be maintained and 68 percent of the Americans agreed.</P>
      <P>With China boosting its military capability, 48 percent of those surveyed in
Japan said their country should increase its military presence in its
southwestern islands to respond to the threat, but 36 percent opposed the
suggestion.</P>
      <P>Over half (51 percent) of the Japanese polled said U.S. President Barack Obama
should visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two Japanese cities devastated by U.S.
atomic bombs toward the end of World War II, while 36 percent saw no need for
him to do so.</P>
      <P>The Japanese poll also had a domestic component. It found that 60 percent of
those surveyed did not support incumbent Prime Minister Naoto Kan, whose
popularity stood at 24 percent.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar closed unchanged at NT$30.485 against the New Taiwan dollar
Friday.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$628 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at 30.510 and moved between NT$29.670 and NT$30.525 before
the close.</P>
      <P>Further inflows of foreign funds continued to boost the value of the New Taiwan
dollar against the U.S. dollar, while quiet trade in other foreign exchange
markets in the region ahead of the Christmas holiday offered little direction to
the trading session, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Foreign banks remained the major seller of the U.S. dollar, betting the New
Taiwan dollar would extend its momentum to reflect the island's strong economic
fundamentals, they said.</P>
      <P>As the U.S. is pumping funds into the market through purchases of treasury bonds
to boost its economy, investors have high hopes that more and more idle money
will enter the markets in Asia and further lift the currencies in the region,
they added.</P>
      <P>Dealers said Taiwan's central bank, which has shown a strong will to prevent
rapid appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar and protect the island's exports,
intervened in the local foreign exchange market again in late trade.</P>
      <P>With the central bank's presence, the U.S. dollar staged a rebound from the
day's low to above the NT$30.00, a level the market believes is the central
bank's bottom line in the near term.</P>

      <P>Shares of integrated circuit designer MStar Semiconductor Inc. closed sharply
higher on the first day of its primary listing Friday on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange amid optimism toward the company's bottom line, dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, the gains of the stock were compromised due to mounting pressure in the
broader market as the index moved closer to the nearest technical resistance at
8,900 points after recent significant gains, they said.</P>
      <P>MStar rose 10 percent to NT$330.00 (US$11.05) , off a high of NT$347.00, with
17.28 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index closed
down 0.42 percent at 8,861.10.</P>
      <P>"MStar is emerging as one of MediaTek Inc.'s rivals in the China market, and the
Taiwan market showed enthusiasm toward the stock, " MasterLink Securities
analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>But the strong interest in MStar stalled Friday to some extent as the market was
faced with stiff technical resistance, Tang said.</P>
      <P>"In addition to the technical factors, investors began to consider whether MStar
was too expensive compared with MediaTek, " Tang said.</P>
      <P>MediaTek closed the day at NT$423.50, down 1.85 percent.</P>
      <P>Tang said MediaTek, which is expected to post an earnings per share of NT$32 for
2010, was traded at a price-earnings multiple of 13 Friday, while MStar was
expected to record an EPS of about NT$15 with a PE multiple of 23.</P>
      <P>Tang said that both and MStar are MediaTek are facing fierce competition in the
China market.</P>
      <P>"MediaTek's profit margin has been seriously squeezed, but so has MStar's," he
said.</P>
      <P>According to IC Insights, MStar is expected to rank as the 13th largest fabless
IC provider in the world this year by generating US$1.06 billion in sales, up 75
percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>IC Insights, a global semiconductor market research firm, said MediaTek is
likely to rank fourth, posting US$3. 61 billion in revenue, up 3 percent year-
on-year.</P>
      <P>MStar, established in Taiwan in June 2002, moved its headquarters to the Cayman
Islands in 2007 and registered there with the goal of expanding globally and
opening subsidiaries in Singapore and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>The company operates primarily in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, and most of its
products are sold outside Taiwan to China, South Korea and the United States.</P>
      <P>Microchips made by MStar are used in a wide range of consumer electronic
products, including LCD-TVs, monitors, set-top boxes, and mobile communications

      <P>Several social groups called Friday for a law revision to deal with the imminent
loss of self-governance in five aboriginal  townships,  which  will occur  when
four new municipalities come into effect on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>The groups, including Citizen Congress Watch, the Green Party and the  Alliance
to  Safeguard  Aboriginal  Rights  after  Five Municipalities, held a protest
outside the Legislative Yuan to draw public attention to the situation.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government Act, five aboriginal townships -- Wulai Township in
Taipei County; Namaxia, Taoyuan, and Maolin Townships in Kaohsiung; and Heping
Township in Taichung -- will become districts within the four new
municipalities, a spokesman for the groups noted.</P>
      <P>The district chiefs will be appointed by the municipality mayors, instead of
being selected by the residents, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>"The aboriginal people will lose their administrative  and financial management
rights," he said.</P>
      <P>This will be not only a violation of human rights, but also a contravention of
the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law and will result in the extinction of the
aboriginal peoples, he said.</P>
      <P>The four new municipalities will become effective Saturday with the upgrade of
Taipei County to New Taipei City and three city and county mergers in Taichung,
Tainan and Kaohsiung, respectively.</P>
      <P>Pan Han-sheng, convener of the Green Party, said at the protest that if the
aboriginal people lose their self-governance rights, they could end up like the
Pingpu Tribe, which has been assimilated into the general population.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-fu, chairman of the Taiwan Grassroots Alliance for Peace, pointed out
that the United Nations has said aboriginal peoples have the right to self-

      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-chi ruled out the possibility Friday of
reintroducing physical punishment in schools as means of dealing with bullying.</P>
      <P>"Physical punishment can't be allowed, but discipline can, " he said in a
meeting with more than 500 heads of junior and senior high schools and
vocational  schools to discuss ways of preventing bullying.</P>
      <P>"Zero physical punishment" is still a major policy of the Ministry of Education,
Wu said in response to a call to reintroduce physical punishment in schools to
deal with bullying.</P>
      <P>"Physical punishment would encourage students to meet violence with violence,"
Wu said.</P>
      <P>The meeting was held after a series of bullying incidents at a junior high
school were reported in the media in the recent week.</P>
      <P>Wu said that every possible means will be used to deal with the problem and its
root causes.</P>
      <P>"Do not give up on any students," he urged the school principals.</P>
      <P>He asked them to encourage their teachers to help guide students onto the right
path.</P>
      <P>However, bullying cannot be wiped out unless good morals are restored in
schools, he said.</P>
      <P>Schools should reinforce education in the fields of morals and behavior,
judiciary systems, human rights, and gender equality, and should enlist families
and the wider community in the efforts to stop bullying, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Since the bullying problem was exposed in the media, the Executive Yuan has
assigned Minister without Portfolio Ovid Tzeng to host an inter-ministerial
forum for the exchange of opinions and suggestions on how to deal with the
issue.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Tzeng, a prominent educator and former minister of
education, suggested that one of the necessary steps is for adults to refrain
from violence.</P>
      <P>Adults, including politicians across party lines, should be role models for

      <P>Taiwan Cooperative Bank said Friday it will sign a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) with Bank of China on cooperation between the two banks in the future.</P>
      <P>The plan to sign the MOU with the Chinese bank on Dec. 28 was made after
Taiwan's financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Commission, gave the
local bank the green light earlier this month, Taiwan Cooperative bank said.</P>
      <P>Under the MOU, the two banks will work together in providing several financial

interbank lending, and loans for small and medium enterprises, the bank said.</P>
      <P>It also indicated that the two partners would soon launch personnel exchanges to

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that it has never
acknowledged the existence of the so-called "1992 consensus" or "one-China
consensus."</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang was responding to President Ma Ying-jeou's challenge
to DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen in an interview, when he demanded that Tsai
clearly state if her party acknowledges the "1992 consensus" between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan does not recognize the cross-Taiwan Strait consensus, which Ma called
a bedrock of the relationship, uncertainty would be created and doubts would
arise over cross-strait peace, Ma was quoted as saying by the United Evening
News on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin said that for the DPP, the so-called "1992 consensus" represents a consensus
on "one China, " which the party has never agreed to.</P>
      <P>Lin said the president should explain first what he meant by the "1992
consensus."</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang, which Ma leads, has defined the "1992 consensus" with
China as a tacit agreement between Taipei and Beijing that there is but "one
China" whose meaning is open for each side to interpret.</P>
      <P>The KMT would interpret "one China" as the Republic of China on Taiwan while the
Beijing government would define it as the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lin cited recent examples of Chinese officials  addressing Taiwanese officials
not by their official titles but with "Mr., " "Mrs., " or the honorific form of
"you", raising doubts about the government's approach to dealing with China.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese officials call their Chinese counterparts by their official
titles, such as "President Chen Yunlin" of the Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan could only
express regret at being addressed by her first name or as "you" by Chen during
his recent visit to Taipei, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>"Why is it that Chinese officials visiting Taiwan do not show their respect to
Taiwanese officials and address them by their official titles?" Lin asked.</P>
      <P>"Is that what President Ma has called equality between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait?" he wondered.</P>
      <P>The spokesman asked the president to explain this to the people, instead of
trying to divert attention to the DPP's position regarding the 1992 consensus.</P>

      <P>The family of former President Chen Shui-bian has remitted back to Taiwan an
additional US$234,036 from their accounts in two Swiss banks, prosecutors in
charge of the case said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
said the money -- part of a total of US$21 million held by Chen's family members
in Merrill Lynch Bank (Suisse) S.A. and the Royal Bank of Scotland -- was wired
to Taiwanese bank accounts designated by the SID earlier that day.</P>
      <P>The money in the Swiss banks, which had been frozen since 2007, was held in
accounts under the names of the ex-president's son and daughter-in-law -- Chen
Chih-chung and Huang Jui-ching.</P>
      <P>To date, the SID has received US$21,204,313.17 from the two Swiss banks, and
only about US$250,000 in the form of mutual funds remains to be remitted, the
SID said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the US$21 million frozen in the two banks, the former first
family also transferred NT$570 million (US$19 million) to Swiss private bank
Wegelin &amp; Co. in June 2007.</P>
      <P>The funds were drawn from the NT$740 million the family had put in a Cathay
United Bank vault in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have argued that all the money deposited by Chen's family overseas
was illegally acquired and should be confiscated, but Chen and his wife were
recently found not guilty of corruption charges related to the money deposited
with Wegelin &amp; Co.</P>
      <P>Chen, who served as president from 2000 to 2008, and his wife Wu Shu-jen were
both sentenced to life in prison and fined NT$200 million and NT$300 milling
respectively in September last year on charges of taking bribes, money
laundering and forgery.</P>
      <P>After two appeals, the sentences for Chen and Wu were reduced to 17 1/2 years.</P>
      <P>Chen has begun serving his sentence, but judicial authorities are still
determining if Wu, who is a wheelchair user, can serve her sentence without
imperiling her health.</P>

      <P>The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) will soon open its first ever large-scale
exhibition dedicated to a Taiwanese artist, as it plans to showcase the
versatile Ni Tsai-chin and his 30 years of work that offers a window on the
evolution of contemporary Taiwanese art.</P>
      <P>MOCA Director Shih Jui-cheng said the solo exhibition titled "Mediaholic: Arts
of Ni Tsai-chin, " which opens Saturday, will mark the first time the 10-year-
old museum has dedicated the majority of its space to a single Taiwanese artist.</P>
      <P>The museum had previously held major solo exhibitions for international artists
but not local artist because few of them have been as prolific as the 55-year-
old Ni, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"Ni is one of the very few interdisciplinary artists working across, and
sometimes in between, the boundaries of different art forms, including
literature, painting, sculpture, and installation art, and he also teaches art
and is an enthusiastic environmentalist and art critic," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Ni, whose work has also been shown in Italy, Germany, Korea, and China,
describes himself as a "crazy person" who likes to explore different media as
vehicles of creation.</P>
      <P>In the 1990s, he began his "newspaper creation" series as a means to criticize
the mainstream media's lack of interest in reporting on environmental  and
cultural  issues  and its overemphasis  on politicians' lies during election
campaigns.</P>
      <P>The seven newspapers he published during the last 16 years, also on display at
the MOCA exhibition, copy the format of local newspapers, but the stories carry
a sarcastic and even cynical tone.</P>
      <P>"In Taiwan, the media creates problems instead of monitoring them. Media workers
only run stories that correspond to their own identities and interests; and the
more violent or erotic a news story, the bigger the chance it will be carried in
the newspaper," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite his interest in experimenting with different art forms, he told
reporters his favorite pastime remains painting. Ni, who was diagnosed with
liver disease some 30 years ago and has battled liver cancer for the past
decade, said he forgets about the physical pain whenever he starts to paint.</P>
      <P>The solo exhibition, which runs through Feb. 13, 2011, will also showcase Ni's
landscape paintings, his involvement in environmental and social issues, his
"super flat" series, and his most recent sculptures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China urged to address cross-strait issues with benevolence</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China should promote a Chinese cultural renaissance and handle cross-Taiwan
Strait issues with benevolence if it wants to be a great world power, former
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu said British historian Arnold J. Toynbee predicted that the only human
civilizations that could save the world in the 21st century were the Chinese
civilization of Confucianism and the Buddhist civilization of Mahayana Buddhism.</P>
      <P>But Liu said Toynbee's prediction could not come true unless today's  China made
a great contribution  to global  cultural development.</P>
      <P>"While China has emerged as an economic powerhouse and is the world's largest
manufacturing center and consumer market, it would not be able to command the
same stature or influence as Britain in the 19th century and America in the 20th
century if it fails to contribute greatly to human civilization and culture,"
Liu argued.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony at the Presidential Office in his capacity as president
of the National Cultural Association, Liu suggested that China follow the
principles of "benevolent rule" preached by Mencius (372-289 B.C.), arguably the
most famous Confucianist after Confucius himself.</P>
      <P>Moreover, China should initiate a Chinese cultural renaissance and draw on the
essence of traditional Chinese culture while learning from the fusion of ancient
and modern cultures and Eastern and Western civilizations, Liu said.</P>
      <P>On President Ma Ying-jeou's appeal in his 2010 New Year's Day speech that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should seek a pragmatic and feasible solution to
their disputes on the basis of traditional Chinese culture, Liu said the first
step toward that goal is to address cross-strait issues with a benevolent way of
thinking.</P>
      <P>Liu cited a media report published during negotiations between Taiwan and China
on the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) earlier this year to
underscore the importance of Mencius' philosophy of "benevolent rule" in dealing
with Taiwan-China affairs.</P>
      <P>According to the report, some Chinese officials found Taiwan's call for China to
yield further concessions under the ECFA's early harvest program annoying.</P>
      <P>But under a benevolent mind-set, Liu said, justice, righteousness or fairness
should always take precedence over unilateral interests.</P>
      <P>For its part, Liu said, Taiwan can play the role of vanguard and catalyst in the
pursuit of a Chinese cultural renaissance.</P>
      <P>As an immigrant society, Taiwan is inclusive and innovative in cultural
development, and it can use those assets to help shape new rules of the game for
the 21st century, such as how to deal with international disputes with
benevolence and devise ways to ensure sustainable development, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's outlying Orchid Island will be the first location in the country to
welcome the sun on New Year's Day, with the first glimpse of the rising sun
expected at 6: 33 a.m., the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Friday.</P>
      <P>For those hoping to greet the first sunrise on the main island of Taiwan, the
CWB said the top options would be major scenic spots in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, Kending in Pingtung County and Sansiantai along the
southeastern coast in Taitung County will both see the sunrise at 6: 35 a.m.,
the earliest anywhere on the island.</P>
      <P>In northern Taiwan, the best location will be Sandiaojiao in Taipei County,
where the sunrise is expected to take place at 6: 37 a.m.</P>
      <P>The CWB's astronomic observatory explained that because the incident angle of
the sun (the angle at which it strikes the earth's surface) is steep in the
southern hemisphere in December, the further south people go, the earlier they
will see the sunrise.</P>
      <P>"Daytime in southern Taiwan will be slightly longer than that in northern areas,
which explains why the sunrise comes earlier and the sunset later there, " said
Ho Pei-li, the observatory's associate technical specialist.</P>
      <P>As a result, people who want to waive farewell to the last sunset of 2010 should
also head south, where they can see it at 17: 25 p.m. in Cigu in Tainan County
and Cijin in Kaohsiung City, according to the CWB forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Environmental groups urge halt to man-made lake plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental groups urged the Executive Yuan on Friday to put a stop to a man-
made lake development project in southern Taiwan to prevent the pumping of
underground water in a way that would endanger the water rights of over 1
million people.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) asked the Executive
Yuan that it not approve the Jiyang Man-Made Lake Project, which would straddle
Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties, before a new environmental impact assessment is
provided and the project's content is finalized.</P>
      <P>Hung Hui-hsiang, chairman of the TEPU's Pingtung Chapter, said he had no idea
why the government changed its original plan to use the lakes to conserve
surface water from the Laonong River during the rainy season into filling them
with groundwater pumped from Meinong, Cishan and Ligang townships.</P>
      <P>Under the new plan, expected to be approved at the end of this year, the two
man-made lakes will be 12 meters deep and will extract some 200,000 cubic meters
of groundwater a day from those three townships to fill the lakes, according to
Hung.</P>
      <P>"Excessively pumping groundwater is a suicidal and irreversible act," Hung said
at a press conference held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the WRA tackle the water-shortage problem at its root by
clearing out the illegal aquaculture ponds along the Laonong River, which
regularly use subsurface water flow, and choose other proper locations  to build
the man-made lakes,  if the development of such lakes is absolutely necessary.</P>
      <P>TEPU Secretary-General Lee Cho-han said, meanwhile, that he suspected the man-
made lake development  project was aimed at benefiting gravel industry operators
as some 30 million tons of high-quality gravel worth over NT$10 billion would be
created by the project.</P>
      <P>Wu Li-hui, a spokeswoman for the TEPU's Tainan Chapter, said the development
project could bring about a repeat the disastrous digging of 13 groundwater
wells by Taiwan Water Corp. in Ligang Township in the early 1990s.</P>
      <P>The 13 wells, pumping some 100,000 cubic meters of water per day, drained the
township's groundwater, sparking outcries from local residents and aquaculture
pond operators.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Pingtung County government was forced to order the wells
closed, Wu said.</P>
      <P>On the environmental activists' suspicions that the project was a pretext to
benefit gravel developers, WRA Director-General Yang Wei-fuu said the theory was
outdated because gravel has been in abundant supply since Typhoon Morakot hit
Taiwan in August 2009.</P>
      <P>Since that time, a huge amount of gravel has been dredged from the Cishan and
Laonong Rivers, which flow into the Gaoping River, he said.</P>
      <P>Yang pledged that the WRA would give top priority to capturing subsurface flow
-- the precipitation that penetrates the soil through infiltration -- to supply
water in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he said the volume of subsurface flow was inadequate and not consistently
available around the year, necessitating the development of the man-made lakes
to store water and stabilize supply.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Five special municipalities to begin operation</HEADLINE>

12/24/10  22:23:50
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five special municipalities across Taiwan with 60 percent of the country's
population will begin operations Saturday, kicking off a new phase in Taiwan's
administrative history.</P>
      <P>Taipei,  Xinbei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung will begin operating as mega
cities almost one month after the residents of the five municipalities chose
their mayors in high profile elections on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taipei City and Xinbei City, the former Taipei County, the other
three cities were expanded through a merger of two administrative districts.</P>
      <P>Greater Taichung City is the result of a merger of Taichung City and Taichung
County; Tainan a merger of Tainan City and Tainan County; and Kaohsiung a merger
of Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, the change is aimed at making the
five mega cities "spearheads of Taiwan's regional development" and "cores of the
three living areas of northern, central and southern Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The new system is not likely to affect the everyday life of the 13.7 million
residents in the five cities, but integrating local governments and
administrative branches are likely to present a big challenge in the cities
where mergers took place.</P>
      <P>Tainan and Kaohsiung both split their agencies into two parts to keep them in
their original office buildings while Taichung City opted for three office
buildings  in different  parts of its administrative area.</P>
      <P>Effective Saturday, townships and county-administered cities will also be
renamed "districts" and villages will be renamed "wards." District chiefs will
be appointed by mayors rather than being elected, as was previously the case.</P>
      <P>Township councils will be disbanded, which means thousands of township and city
councilmen have lost their jobs.</P>
      <P>Newly elected mayors have focused on the financial aspects of the new city
governments. Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu publicly expressed concerns that the
city would be in financial trouble if budget allocating procedures and tax
regulations were not reformed.</P>
      <P>Xinbei City faced a different problem -- trying to figure out what to call
itself in English.</P>
      <P>Mayor Eric Liluan Chu wanted to change the new city's name to "New Taipei City,"
because Xinbei means "new Taipei" in Chinese.</P>
      <P>But the move was blocked by the Ministry of the Interior for now, with Deputy
Interior Minister Chien Tai-lang saying the ministry would discuss the proposal
with Chu at a later date.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Engineer's death may be re-defined as 'karoshi' under new rules</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) committee is examining whether the death of a
Nanya Technology Corp. engineer in January could be defined as related to
overwork under newly promulgated rules, an official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>If the Occupational Disease Appraisal Committee determines that the engineer
died from overwork, the Bureau of Labor Insurance's previous classification of
the man's passing as a "non-occupational death" will be revoked, said CLA Vice
Minister Kuo Fang-yu.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old engineer, surnamed Hsu, was found dead in front of his computer
at home in January. His parents said he had been putting in about 95 hours of
overtime per month for six months before his death.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Labor Insurance, however, did not classify it as a case of karoshi
-- the Japanese word for death from overwork after an initial examination.</P>
      <P>The decision drew criticism from labor rights groups, who were dismayed by the
CLA's failure to protect wage earners' legitimate rights and interests  because
of what they called flaws and deficiencies in existing laws.</P>
      <P>Kuo argued at a news conference called by several ruling Kuomintang legislators
Friday that there have been regulations governing the appraisal of occupational
injury and death.</P>
      <P>"Controversies  might  have risen mainly  because  relevant provisions were not
clear and concrete enough," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Responding to widespread concern, he said, the CLA already announced new
guidelines on Wednesday for defining "death from overwork" as an occupational
disease.</P>
      <P>"The new guidelines  will make it easier for doctors and investigators to
classify the case as death or injury from overwork, "Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The new guidelines follow the standards used in Japan, which include
contributing factors such as abnormal working conditions, heavy short-term
overwork, and long-term overwork, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Under the new standards, long-term overwork is defined as 92 hours of overtime
in the month before death, or 72 hours of overtime per month for two to six
months before death.</P>
      <P>Based on the new guidelines, the range of conditions that could be attributed to
overwork have been expanded to include ischemic heart disease, severe cardiac
arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, sudden cardiac death, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral
infarction, acute heart failure and aortic rupture, he added.</P>
      <P>The CLA is expected to announce a decision soon in Hsu's case. If the CLA rules
in favor of the family, the Bureau of Labor Insurance and Nanya Technology, a
DRAM memory chip maker affiliated with the Formosa Plastics Group, will each
have to pay the engineer's family the equivalent of 45 months of his salary.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has sent a World Taekwondo Federation  (WTF)  ruling suspending  a
Taiwanese athlete from competition to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS),
hoping that it will hear the case, the government said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Lausanne, Switzerland-based CAS could be expected to make a ruling on the
case in three months if it establishes it has jurisdiction over the case,  said
Chow Jui,  director of the International Sports Department of the Cabinet-level
Sports Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 21, the WTF suspended Yang Shu-chun from competition for three months
for refusing to leave the mat after she was disqualified from her opening round
bout in the women's taekwondo at the under 49 kg division at the Asian Games in
Guangzhou in November.</P>
      <P>Her coach Liu Tsung-ta, who later lodged a protest after the disqualification,
was punished with 20-month suspension, and the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo
Association (CTTA) was fined US$50,000.</P>
      <P>CTTA Chairman Chen Chien-ping said the association has not determined when it
will pay the fine. The WTF ruled that the US$50,000 fine should be paid by Jan.
31, 2011.</P>
      <P>Yang, who was one of the gold medal favorites in the event, was apparently
disqualified for wearing two extra electronic sensors on her socks to score
extra points, but a replay of the bout showed she did not have them on as she
took a 9-0 lead against her Vietnamese opponent.</P>
      <P>After hearing she was disqualified for reasons she could not understand, a
shocked Yang refused to leave the ring and broke into tears, knowing that her
gold medal hopes had disappeared after less than two minutes of action in the
event.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCC looks to public for fair judgment on TV license decision</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
12/24/10  23:25:31
(By Huang Hui-min and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) said Friday it was following the
law in revoking the license of a commercial TV channel, a decision that it
believed would be judged fairly by the public.</P>
      <P>The NCC's decision on Dec. 22 to not renew the ERA TV's license for its
entertainment channel has sparked heated debate, with some opposition lawmakers
suggesting that the NCC might have acted unlawfully and expressing concerns that
the decision could have a "chilling effect" on the media industry as a whole.</P>
      <P>Denying that the NCC was "bullying" the TV station, NCC spokesman Chen Cheng-
tsang said the regulator had followed all legal procedures -- including warning,
fining and suspending the station's operating permit -- before deciding not to
renew its license.</P>
      <P>An NCC task force reviewing the application to renew the channel's license found
that over the past six years, the channel had repeatedly violated a Satellite TV
Broadcasting Act ban on embedded advertising and other provisions of the act,
and had fined it a total of NT$16.75 million for 49 violations, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The entertainment channel's license should have been revoked in Feb. this year,
but the NCC decided at that time to give it a "grace period" in the hope that it
would meet the NCC's requirements and earn the right to continue its operations,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>One such requirement was quite simple -- not to violate the ban again, he said,
but instead of taking advantage of the opportunity, the TV channel broke the ban
on March 14 and March 16 by airing programs in which advertisements were mixed
into the content.</P>
      <P>On July 15, the NCC gave the TV channel a stern warning, effectively withdrawing
its operating permit. Still, the channel continued to broadcast programs without
permits and violated the rules five more times, which should have resulted in
fines totaling NT$3.6 million, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The NCC did not fine the entertainment channel until Dec. 22, when it finally
decided to reject its application for renewing the license and to fine it NT$2.1
million, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Observers have wondered why if the NCC felt its decision was legitimate and
reasonable did it wait for three days, during which criticism against the
decision mounted,  before it offered an explanation.</P>
      <P>Chen said that just like school authorities who decide to expel a student for
good reason, the NCC did not have to say anything about revoking the station's
license.</P>
      <P>The NCC believes that members of the public will judge its decision fairly, he
said, adding that if ERA TV thinks the decision is unfair, it could file a
complaint with the administrative court.</P>
      <P>As to some media operators' concern that the NCC decision would have a "chilling
effect" on them, Chen said, "As long as you abide by the law, you don't have to
worry about anything."</P>
      <P>Chen said he was aware some suspected that President Ma Ying-jeou might have
interfered in the case while others have accused the NCC of having acted out of
partisan rather than public interests.</P>
      <P>But he rejected the speculation, saying the president "absolutely did not" play
any role in the NCC decision on ERA TV and stressed that, "as an independent
government agency, our members have acted independently."</P>

      <P>In Taiwan, "public housing" is equal to "slums " and people have the stereotyped
impression that building a public housing project in their communities will
lower their quality of living and the value of their homes.</P>
      <P>No wonder local residents have been protesting against a proposal by the Taipei
city government to build a social housing project in the city's Songshan
district. A plan by the National Property Administration to build an old-age
housing complex in the city's Neihu district was also forced to a halt due to
strong opposition by residents.</P>
      <P>In promoting the social housing policy, the government should first remove such
prejudice from society. It should tell people that social housing is not cheap
housing that groups disadvantaged individuals together. Rather, it is mixed-
incoming housing intended to allow financially weaker groups such as young
people and single parents to rent a proper place to live in at an affordable
price.</P>
      <P>The government must display its determination and ability to realize the policy.
The people, on the other hand, should broaden their horizons and open their

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four counties in Taiwan became history Dec. 25, 2010, when they were
reclassified as special municipalities as a result of upgrade or mergers.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the historic day, many staff of the disappearing Taipei, Taichung,
Tainan and Kaohsiung county governments shed tears as they watched the signs of
their old offices being replaced.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>At 5 p.m. Dec. 24, Taichung County government staff and residents of the central
county gathered at County Hall to observe the county flag being lowered for the
last time. They sang the county anthem, some in tears.</P>
      <P>"I have served in the county government for 30 years, from teenager to middle-
aged woman, " said caretaker Lin Mei-fen.</P>
      <P>County resident Wang Li-huei traveled from Dali Township to take part in the
flag-lowering ceremony. "I have never attended a flag-hoisting ceremony, so I
thought I should be here for the last flag-lowering ritual," she told reporters.</P>
      <P>In the southern county of Tainan,  outgoing Magistrate Su Huan-chih hosted a
farewell party at County Hall that evening. He said that "Tainan County" will
always stay in the hearts of its residents.</P>
      <P>Outgoing Kaohsiung Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin bade a weeping farewell to every
member of the county government staff before leaving County Hall, established 60
years ago. (Dec. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>While the Kaohsiung county government was submerged in sorrow over its closure,
street vendors in the county said they sensed no difference in the change of
status.</P>
      <P>"We still have to do business and live our lives, even though Kaohsiung County
is gone," said vendor Hsiao Kuo-yu.</P>
      <P>On the eve of its formal upgrading to a special municipality, Taipei County --
which will be renamed Xinbei after the upgrade -- attracted many people to
County Hall to capture its last image.</P>
      <P>High-ranking staff were busy packing, since the new government has its own
administrative team.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several aboriginal groups staged a protest in front of the
Legislative Yuan Friday, voicing fear that their autonomy rights will be harmed
after the inauguration of the new municipalities. (Dec. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Taipei County, Taichung County, Tainan County and Kaohsiung County disappeared
from the map of Taiwan on Dec. 25, 2010.</P>
      <P>While most of the outgoing magistrates appeared to be looking forward to the new
era, with their counties upgraded to special municipalities, Kaohsiung
Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsin expressed concern over the possibility that the county
will be marginalized after merging with Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>Many of the county government staff might lose their jobs due to the merger, he
said. (Dec. 25, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Apple Daily: Death from overwork disgraces employers</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/25/10  15:41:30
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recently there have been a string of deaths from overwork reported in Taiwan.
The increase in these cases means that Taiwan workers have too heavy workloads
but too little time to rest.</P>
      <P>The work hours of Taiwanese are often rated as the world's longest or second-
longest in international surveys. This is not a glorious record, because it
shows that Taiwanese do not pay attention to leisure and that there is a lack of
care for humanity in the work environment.</P>
      <P>This might be linked to the influence of Confucianism, which emphasizes
obedience,  diligence and compliance with morality. Individuals who work
themselves to death are therefore commendable, according to Confucian
principles.</P>
      <P>It is, however, more important to allow everyone to enjoy proper working
conditions, such as reasonable work hours,  reasonable workloads, reasonable pay
and reasonable benefits.</P>
      <P>It is time to change our Confucian way of thinking. What we need are work ethics
that are consistent with humanity. Allowing workers to die from overwork is a
shame on employers. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 25, 2010)</P>

it will celebrate the retirement of date stampers that have been in use since

the country's centennial.</P>
      <P>The century-old stampers will have to stop being used from 2011, the 100th year

double-digit years on cardboard-style train tickets, according to the Takao
Railway Museum.</P>
      <P>The museum will extend its opening hours to 9 p.m. on New Year's Eve and invite
railway fans to get the historic 99.12.31 stamp on specially designed train
tickets to mark the event.</P>

      <P>China will talk more about the "1992 consensus" than the one China principle,
while Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will seek dialogue
with China without giving up its pro-independence stance in 2011, scholars
predicted Saturday.</P>
      <P>"China is expected to maintain its support of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
and President Ma Ying-jeou. At the same time, it will launch dialogue with the
DPP as a hedging strategy, " Lai I-chung, a researcher of the Taiwan Thinktank,
said in a symposium organized by the pro-independence Taiwan New Century
Foundation.</P>
      <P>China is likely to talk more about the "1992 consensus" and anti-Taiwan
independence  in the coming year rather than its long-standing one China
principle, Lai said, because it does not want to jeopardize President Ma Ying-
jeou's re-election bid in 2012 with a hawkish position.</P>
      <P>The DPP, meanwhile, is expected to show pragmatism in its new China policy,
which has not yet been formulated, in order to move to a more centrist position
for the 2012 presidential  election, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Lai forecast that the DPP, under the leadership of Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, will
present its new China policy based on a 1999 resolution stating that the DPP
upholds that Taiwan is an independent country named the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The party will likely  highlight  the risk management  of cross-Taiwan Strait
economic exchanges and seek dialogue with China without prerequisites, he said,
adding that China will also seek to engage the DPP.</P>
      <P>But the engagement will be confined to scholarly exchanges rather than a party-
to-party dialogue, since the DPP still advocates Taiwan independence, he said.</P>
      <P>Yan Jiann-fa, a professor at Ching Yun University who served in the former DPP
government,  said the DPP is going through a transformation period, in
particular in its China policy.</P>
      <P>Citing a public opinion poll conducted by Global Views magazine in May 2009
revealing that 48.5 percent of the respondents favored eventual independence
over 16.2 percent who preferred eventual unification, Yang said the DPP had
realized a change of direction is needed for the party.</P>
      <P>While the independence-unification issue has always been the most sensitive and
critical issue in Taiwan's political debates, neither Taiwan nor China are in a
hurry to touch upon the issue, Yan said.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is not in a hurry to unify with Taiwan as long as Taiwan does not
`stray too far, ' because it has its own domestic and exterior problems to
handle, " he said.</P>
      <P>Yan added that it would be better for Taiwan to focus on solving more urgent
domestic issues at present, such as decreasing the wealth gap and improving
national spatial planning, both of which affect the everyday lives of the
people.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Next TV station set up by Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai showed new
determination Saturday to reach a wider local audience after its repeated
failures to obtain an operating license for its news channel from Taiwan's
government media watchdog.</P>
      <P>Next TV was slated to give away 2,000 TV set-top boxes worth a combined value of
NT$6 million (US$202,800) to a long line of waiting people in Taipei on a cold
rainy day before the TV station officially opens Dec. 28.</P>
      <P>To help raise publicity, Next TV has been running a series of TV commercials in
recent days in which Lai is portrayed as being pregnant, suggesting that he is
about to give birth to the Next TV station.</P>
      <P>Next TV has been broadcasting news and entertainment programs on the Internet
since July this year after the National Communications Commission (NCC) rejected
several license applications from the company from late 2009 due to concerns
over the sensationalism of its animated news.</P>
      <P>Next TV, nevertheless, won approval for movie and sports channels earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>In an animated video played at a press briefing, Next TV mocked the NCC for "not
giving licenses to those it doesn't like."</P>
      <P>The TV station's chairman, Chu Wah-hui, said at the press briefing that a new
application was submitted to the NCC in late November that is still awaiting a
reply.</P>
      <P>Next TV has already issued invitations to the subscribers of the Chinese-
language Apple Daily and Next Magazine, both owned by Lai, for the free set-top
boxes.</P>
      <P>Asked how many will be given away, Chu declined to offer a specific number,
although media reports put the number at nearly 80,000.</P>
      <P>Chen Jeng-chang of the NCC said the council will monitor Next TV's programs and
will take action if any of them violate the law.</P>
      <P>Also Saturday, Next TV vowed to bring quality digital TV to local audiences
while criticizing the government's lack of progress on the development of TV
digitization.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has world-leading information technology ability, but it falls far
behind China and Hong Kong in terms of TV digitization, " Chu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's digital TV penetration rate is 6 percent to 7 percent, which is much
lower than in neighboring countries," he said.</P>
      <P>The government has vowed to boost the penetration rate to 50 percent by 2015,  a
goal that is similar to China's current penetration rate, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Asked how he sees an upcoming rival in TV digitization, Da-fu Media, Chu said it
is good to see more businesses involved in the field.</P>
      <P>Da-fu Media has become Taiwan's largest cable TV operator after acquiring Kbro
Co. from U.S. private equity firm the Carlyle Group Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>TV digitization allows viewers to watch programs on demand, to have interaction

    <TEXT>
      <P>The visiting president of City University (CityU) of Hong Kong, Way Kuo, has
said that he wants to persuade elite Taiwanese high school students to study at
his school.</P>
      <P>It is Kuo's second recruitment drive in Taiwan since he assumed office as CityU
president in May 2008.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with local reporters on Friday, Kuo, who was born and had most
of his education in Taiwan before moving to the United States, where he lived
for more than three decades, said he "likes Taiwan a lot."</P>
      <P>However, practically no high school graduates from Taiwan opt to study at
universities in Hong Kong, said Kuo.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  is close  to Hong Kong geographically,  but seems nevertheless to be a
great distance from the former British colony, he said.</P>
      <P>Enrolling Taiwanese students in Hong Kong universities provides advantages for
both places since Hong Kong can have more diverse campuses while Taiwanese young
people can also see a bit more of the world, according to Kuo.</P>
      <P>Advocating the globalization of universities, he said that distinguished
professors and teachers can improve a university's environment, while
globalization can sharpen its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>CityU is the first Hong Kong university to come to Taiwan to recruit students.
It has a total of 27 students from Taiwan, 18 of whom were enrolled this year.</P>
      <P>Kuo, a fellow of Taiwan's top academic research institute Academia Sinica,
received a PhD in nuclear engineering in 1980 from Kansas State University.</P>
      <P>Kuo, also an elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Engineering, is
renowned for his work in designing and modeling reliability for electronics
systems and products, and is a recipient of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers' Reliability Society Lifetime Achievement Award.</P>

      <P>Chinese Taipei gained its second straight win Saturday at the Asian Little
League Championships being held in Japan, triumphing over Thailand 16-0 in a
game that ended in the fifth inning.</P>
      <P>"All 15 players took part in the game and we scored an overwhelming win, " Kuo
Tong-yen, leader and coach of the Taiwanese team, told CNA. "The third hitter,
Wang Wei-an, and the seventh hitter, Yeh Huang-you, both turned in outstanding
performances,"  he said.</P>
      <P>"In the pitching lineup, five players were called to the mound rotationally in
such a way that we totally blocked the strikes of the Thai hitters," he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo said he is hopeful the team will get through to the semifinals as long as
they can adapt to the weather in Japan, which is much colder than in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei team, composed of players from several elementary and junior
high schools in northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County, narrowly defeated China 4-3
the previous day in its opening match of the championships that kicked off
earlier that same day in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture. Kuo is chief coach at
Gueishan Junior High School.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, China, Indonesia and Thailand are grouped in the A division, while
division B groups Japan, South Korea, Pakistan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The top team from each group will compete on the 27th, with the semifinal
winners meeting for the championship game the day after that.</P>
      <P>The Asian Little League Championships have been held every two years in a
country in the region since they began in 2000. Taiwan has won the championship
four straight times since 2002.</P>

      <P>Audiences will be surprised and touched by an upcoming dance performance by a
group of non-dancers whose passion will make their dream of being dancers come
true,  Taiwanese choreographer Cheng Tsung-lung said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, an emerging choreographer and former dancer with Cloud Gate Dance
Theatre, has been working with 60 untrained dancers and 10 professional dancers
on a 15-minute dance that will make its debut Dec. 31 as part of the Republic of
China centennial celebrations.</P>
      <P>The 34-year-old choreographer said that celebrating the country's birthday is a
good thing, but that as an artist, he wants to find greater meaning for the
celebration.</P>
      <P>"The celebration will not be complete without the participation of the public,
because the country is made up of each and every individual," he told reporters
after a Saturday rehearsal.</P>
      <P>With this in mind, he held auditions several months ago to recruit 60 untrained
dancers with a passion for dance, and started a three-month training project.</P>
      <P>He admitted that there were a lot of frustrations, as it was difficult to get
ordinary people to change the way they use their bodies. However, as time went
by, he said, he was very touched to see the performersjoy in moving and their
willingness to work together to finish the challenge.</P>
      <P>"I think I will burst into tears when the dance is presented on stage,he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the 15-minute dance is about presentingthe struggles, troubles and
hopes of everyday life.</P>
      <P>The dance includes a two- to three-minute section during which 44 dancers will
have part of their bodies submerged in water, which poses an even greater
challenge for the non-dancers, he added.</P>
      <P>In March 2007, Cheng's Tete Beche won the Bronze Medal of the No Ballet 1st
International Choreography Competition in Ludwigshafen, Germany, beating out 300
competitors.</P>
      <P>He has since created and restaged works for several international dance
companies, including Transitions Dance Company at the Laban Centre, London,

      <P>Herding sheep. Learning to make German sausage. Working at German theaters.
Traveling around Germany to look for suitable schools and thesis instructors for
future doctoral study programs.</P>
      <P>These are just a few of the proposals presented by Taiwanese applicants for
German working holiday visas that have impressed officials at Germany's
representative office in Taiwan with their ingenuity.</P>
      <P>Heinrich Hubbe, deputy director of the legal affairs division at the German
Institute Taipei, said he is often amazed by the diversity and creativity of
working holiday programs made up by Taiwanese hopefuls since the office began
accepting visa applications Oct. 11.</P>
      <P>Some of the applicants used paintings, graphics and diagrams to explain their
work and travel plans, Hubbes said, adding that he has been  moved  by the
novelty  and lavishness  of some of the presentations.</P>
      <P>Germany is the first European country to have signed a working holiday agreement
with Taiwan, under which up to 200 Taiwanese citizens aged between 18 and 30 are
allowed each year to enjoy a maximum one-year stay in Germany and to undertake
incidental work to supplement their holiday money. The reciprocal nature of the
program offers similar opportunities for young Germans to undertake working
holidays in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hubbe said the local response to the program has been extremely enthusiastic. In
the first few days following the announcement of the program, he recalled, phone
glitches were reported at the German representative office occasionally because
of the number of inquiries being made.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, an average of 6,000 people visited our website each day, far
outnumbering the average of 1,000 to 1,500 before the program was launched, "
Hubbe went on, adding that the significant increase reflects the popularity of
the program.</P>
      <P>In addition to producing health insurance certificates and proof of financial
status, applicants are required to present a report detailing their motivation
for applying for working holiday visas and the activities they plan to do during
their stay.</P>
      <P>The German office also arranges  a 15-minute  face-to-face interview for a each
applicant.</P>
      <P>"What we want to see is that the person is really well-planned and wants to
achieve something," Hubbe said.</P>
      <P>So long as hopefuls present clear plans, their applications will be accepted, he
added.</P>
      <P>Although language proficiency is not a prerequisite, Hubbe said a good command
of English or German will make it easier for applicants to work and engage
people in Germany.</P>
      <P>The German office has so far issued about 50 working holiday visas to Taiwanese
applicants and 100 other hopefuls have been booked for interviews. Because some
of them have not shown up for interviews or have failed to present clear
programs, the office is still accepting new applicants, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Wei-ting, 26, was one of the first local applicants to receive a working
holiday visa. She is scheduled to leave for Berlin on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a computer programmer, said she had already contacted several German
companies seeking internships or part-time work contracts. But she added that
she most wants to improve her German language ability.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Karen Jasmin, a 30-year-old German citizen, has arrived in Taipei to
start a one-year working holiday in Taiwan and has posted a notice at the German
Institute seeking work as a babysitter or language teacher.</P>
      <P>Jasmin said she has visited Taiwan four or five times because her American
boyfriend is in Taiwan. With a holiday working visa, she said, she will be able
to travel more extensively around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also signed working holiday agreements with New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, Canada and South Korea.</P>

      <P>Mayors and councilors of Taiwan's five existing and new special municipalities
assumed office Saturday, ushering in a new era in the country's grassroots
administration.</P>
      <P>Councilors from the Taipei,  Xinbei, Taichung,  Tainan and Kaohsiung city
councils also elected speakers and deputy speakers after being sworn in for a
four-year term.</P>
      <P>In the hotly contested elections, the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) won the top two
posts of the Xinbei City Council and the speaker seat of both the Taipei and
Kaohsiung city councils as well as the deputy speaker seat of the Taichung City
Council.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) garnered both the speaker and
deputy speaker seats of the Tainan City Council and deputy speaker spots of both
the Taipei and Kaohsiung city councils, while the speaker post of the Taichung
City Council was won by an independent.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin said the party's Taipei City chapter will make a self
review after losing the deputy speaker election. KMT city councilors who failed
to vote for the party's nominee will also be disciplined, he added.</P>
      <P>The KMT controls 31 of the 62 seats in the Taipei City Council, but its
candidate Chen Chin-hsiang lost to his DPP rival Chou Po-ya in the second round
of vote, 29-30. The DPP only has 23 seats in the council.</P>
      <P>Chou said after learning of his surprise victory that he had no idea about the
sources of the extra ballots.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin took the oath to begin his second
four-year term, vowing to invigorate the capital city and strengthen its role as
the bellwether of the country's five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu also took her oath and began her
second four-year term in office, pledging to build new horizons for the port
city that saw its administrative district expanded to cover neighboring
Kaohsiung County on the same day.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Eric Liluan Chu assumed office as the first mayor of the new special
municipality of Xinbei, an upgrade of Taipei County.</P>
      <P>"There will not be any holidays over my coming four-year term. Every day will be
a workday to strive for the development of Xinbei," Chu said during the
swearing-in ceremony.</P>
      <P>Almost at the same time, Lai Ching-te took oath to become the first mayor of the
new special municipality of Tainan, which was officially formed Saturday by
merging Tainan City with Tainan County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In central Taiwan, Jason Hu was sworn in as the first mayor of the new special
municipality of Taichung, which was officially formed by merging Taichung City
with Taichung County.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of the Interior statistics, the population of the five
special municipality totals 13.81 million, accounting for 59.63 percent of
Taiwan's total.</P>
      <P>The city with the largest population is Xinbei, with 3.89 million people.
Kaohsiung comes in second with 2.77 million, followed by Taichung (2.64 million)
, Taipei (2.61 million) , and Tainan (1.87 million).</P>

      <P>Xinbei Mayor Eric Liluan Chu visited two aborigine communities in the northern
city formerly known as Taipei County Sunday and promised to help residents
there.</P>
      <P>Chu inspected the Sanying community near the Dahan River and the Sijhou
community by the Xindian River, where die-hard aboriginal residents have lived
without basic utilities since their dwellings were demolished before 2008.</P>
      <P>Chu, on his second day in office after the Xinbei city government began
operating a day earlier, promised the residents to try his best to solve the
water, electricity, household registration, postal and other problems facing
them.</P>
      <P>Flanked by deputy mayors Hsu Chih-chien, Hou Yu-ih and Xinbei Secretary-General
Chen Shen-hsien, Chu met with Sanying tribal chief Lin Kuang-fu and Chiang Yi-
hao, an adviser to the Sanying Tribe Self-Help Association.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that the houses in the Sanying community have been torn down seven
times over the past three decades by former Taipei county governments, as the
law prohibits people from living in riverside areas.</P>
      <P>Members of 42 remaining tribal households are still living on the Sanying site,
according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>"What they are fighting for are reasonable treatment and respect for different
cultures," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>On future relocation or settlement, Chiang said, the residents' greatest wish is
to have the characteristics and completeness of their cultures kept.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chiang's remarks, Chu said he is starting to learn about how to
resolve the problems facing urban aborigines, such as those living by rivers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Sunday that the government will
upgrade and overhaul Taiwan's three major public nursing homes, as the residents
there have grown old and now have different needs.</P>
      <P>From 2010, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will spend NT$135.8 million
(US$4.53 million) over a period of four years to improve facilities  and
services  at the three education  and nursing institutions located in Nantou
County, Yunlin County and Tainan City, Jiang said in the central county of
Nantou.</P>
      <P>Most  of the  970 residents  at the  three  MOI-sponsored institutions, who
entered the homes decades ago when they were in their teens, have grown old,
making it necessary for the MOI to change the homes' services from education-
centered efforts to better care for old people, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The minister visited the Nantou Education and Nursing Institute located in the
county's Mingjian Township, where he experienced Snoezelen multi-sensory therapy
in a ward known as the White Room.</P>
      <P>Snoezelen therapy, developed in the late 1970s by two Dutch therapists, can
stimulate, relax, calm or energize patients by adapting the lighting,
atmosphere, sounds and textures to the specific needs of the patients.</P>
      <P>Chiang also visited a vegetable garden at the institution, where he planted
asparagus lettuce seeds and told his hosts he will visit the home again when the
lettuce has grown.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at the institution, Jiang said that about 1.06
million Taiwanese citizens are holders of the Handbook for the Handicapped as
physically or mentally challenged people.</P>
      <P>Of the total, about 23,000 suffer from medium or severe handicaps and need to

      <P>Taiwanese former comfort women denounced Japan Sunday at the opening of an
exhibition that unveils Taiwan's litigation against Japan over the issue of sex
slaves used by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War Two.</P>
      <P>Chen Tao, one of the 13 surviving comfort women in Taiwan, said she traveled all
the way from Pingtung, the southernmost county in Taiwan, to the capital to
attend the opening and ask for assistance from President Ma Ying-jeou, who
attended the opening, in helping them find justice and dignity.</P>
      <P>"We flew to Japan several times but they would not let we victims testify in
court, " said Chen, referring to trials that took place between 1999 and 2005,
when the Japanese high court ruled against the comfort women in three separate
appeals.</P>
      <P>"These grandmothers don't want monetary compensation from the Japanese
government. They only ask for an official apology, " said Liao Ying-chih,
chairwoman of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) , the main support
group for the former comfort women in Taiwan and the exhibition organizer.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Japan's disappointing attitude toward the comfort women, Ma noted
that Germany endeavored to confront its historical trauma and even put details
of concentration camps in textbooks. "It is a great pity that there are places
or nations that have not achieved this stage," he said.</P>
      <P>He added that the events of history should not be forgotten, even though they
can be forgiven. "The government must not think of setting up memorial halls and
revising textbooks as creating public shame, " said Ma, explaining that such
measures can stop the same mistakes from being repeated.</P>
      <P>Liao said that over the past year, the TWRF has been seeking assistance from
Japan's Diet, or parliament, in hope that laws can be passed to oblige the
Japanese government to apologize for the country's treatment of the comfort
women.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, a rough estimate of the number of comfort women used by the
Japanese government during World War II stands at 500,000, including victims
from Taiwan, Korea, China, the Philippines and various other countries.</P>
      <P>The exhibition displays legal documents, petitions, media reports and videos
relating to the decade-long international litigation process between Taiwan and
Japan, said the TWRF.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is free and will run from Dec. 24 to Feb. 2 at the Datong
district headquarters of the Taipei City Police Department.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Academia protests against practice of using advertorials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
12/26/10  16:33:24
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 100 scholars lodged a stern protest Sunday urging the government to stop
the practice of placing advertorials in the media, saying that this trend of
purchasing news space distorts the definition of "good reporting."</P>
      <P>The protest was sparked by an entry in a popular blog written by Huang Che-ping,
a former senior China Times reporter, who slammed the government's practice of
placing advertorials in various media outlets such as TV stations and newspapers
to further its interests.</P>
      <P>Advertorials are a form of paid advertisement masquerading as objective news
stories. An example would be a pharmaceutical company paying a reporter to write
a story on the company's new painkiller in the form of an objective article.</P>
      <P>In his blog entry, titled "Leaving China Times on a Jet Plane, " Huang says the
deep-rooted practice of advertorials has eroded local journalism.</P>
      <P>"Reporters have turned into advertising salesmen, while public relations firms
and advertising companies have become news writers. The government and big
corporations have their hands directly in the news desk, dictating the content
of the stories," he said.</P>
      <P>The effect of advertorials, said National Chengchi University Journalism
Department head Lin Yuan-hui, has greatly distorted what "good reporting" means
in this country.</P>
      <P>"Right now, the definition of good news is no longer based on its content but on
its earning power," he said.</P>
      <P>Over 128 scholars from the country's leading journalism schools such as National
Taiwan University (NTU) National Taiwan Normal University signed a petition
calling on the government and the business sector to stop eroding the profession
by "buying news."</P>
      <P>Touting Huang's courage in speaking up,  NTU professor of journalism Lin Li-yun
said the main purpose of Sunday's protest was to urge the government to take the
problem seriously and stop tainting pure journalism with paid ads posing as hard
news.</P>
      <P>Media outlets must also practice self-discipline by rejecting advertorials  and
the Cabinet and legislature should implement measures to improve the media
industry in Taiwan, she said.</P>
      <P>The National Communication Commission (NCC) , an independent organization,
announced Dec. 22 that it would not renew ERA TV's license for its entertainment
channel because of the company's repeat offenses under the Satellite
Broadcasting Act.</P>
      <P>The NCC said that the network has embedded paid advertisements in its programs
at least 49 times, for which it has been fined NT$16.75 million (US$560,000).</P>
      <P>The station has denied any wrongdoing and is planning to appeal against the
decision.</P>
      <P>The move, however, has ignited a wave of fear and protest among the media that
the case will set a precedent for the government to exert control over the
media.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Boost FSC authority, ability</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/26/10  17:04:21
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The banking industry in Taiwan appears poised to end this year with a shining
balance sheet, allowing banks to dole out bounty bonuses to their employees.
However, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) should look squarely at the
complicated factors leading to this seeming luster and boost its own authority
and competence in the face of upcoming challenges.</P>
      <P>One reason for the banking sector's "brilliant" 2010 performance is the
government's deliberate efforts to create an environment of loose liquidity and
low interest rates. As the government is withdrawing its policy of full-amount
guarantees for deposits by the year-end, it must get ready for a possible
outbreak of systemic risks.</P>
      <P>In the event of another financial crisis, will the FSC be able to keep things
under control in advance and take quick and decisive action to stem the risks?
To do this, the FSC must have enough power and ability.</P>
      <P>It is quite well-known that the FSC might not be ready to do a good job in risk
control because first, it does not have a strong and competent staff and,
second, its leaders do not have strong political will to carry out its legal
mandates.</P>
      <P>To realize its four core values of independence, responsibility, transparency
and integrity, the FSC needs to recruit more talented and competent  officials
and allow  them  to do their  jobs professionally. For instance, they should be
given higher pay and greater authority, as well as better protection that will
rid them of the risk of prosecution.</P>
      <P>The 2008 financial crisis has shown that chaos in the financial sector can ruin
a nation's economy. To prevent systemic risks from erupting, foundation-laying
work is required during the "economic peacetime."</P>
      <P>Therefore, the FSC should look beyond the banking sector's shining record and
look out for any possible cracks in the system. In short, it must prepare itself
in such a way that it will be able not only to help the banking industry prosper
but also to nip any developing risk in the bud. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 26,

against his will.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-nan said he had no clues about the reports that Chang, currently with
the Sinon Bulls -- another CPBL club -- will be traded from the Taichung-based
Sinon Bulls to the Tainan-based Uni-President Lions at a release amount of

      <P>According to the reports, the Sinon Bulls management hopes Chang, 34, will

      <P>A total of 124 Taiwanese students clinched perfect scores in the American
Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8), one of the best results on record since Taiwan
was invited to join the international competition a decade ago, the organizer
said Sunday at an award presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>The 2010 AMC 8, a 25-question,  40-minute multiple choice examination designed
mostly for junior high school students, was taken by over 152,900 participants
from over 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, China
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan section of the AMC 8 was held Nov. 21, with a record high 9,593
participants who averaged 15.7 in the contest, higher than the global average of
9.98, according to a statement from the organizer, the Nine-Nine Cultural and
Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>The 124 Taiwanese students, ranging from 11 to 15 years old, accounted for
nearly 25 percent of the competition's 499 perfect score students, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>"This is because the Taiwanese participants are good at solving most types of
this year's questions such as proportions, quadrature and number theory, " said
Ho Yang-ming, president of the foundation, at the award ceremony.</P>
      <P>Taiwan set the record of 124 perfect score students in 2008 among 9,012 local
participants, Ho added. The local part of the competition has been running since
1999.</P>
      <P>Hsu Min-heng, a 11-year-old elementary student who entered the contest for the
first time this year, was the youngest participant among the local perfect
scorers.</P>
      <P>The child first showed an interest in math at kindergarten age and then spent
most of his time reading math by himself instead of going to cram school, his
father Hsu Wen-jong told CNA on the sidelines of the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"When he was seven, my wife and I found one day that he had been trying to read
his older sister's mathematics junior high school textbook. He really enjoys
thinking about mathematical questions, " said Hsu's father, who is dean of
academic affairs in a senior high school in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho also noted that the foundation subsidizes the application fees for
more than 300 students from low-income families to encourage their participation
in the competition.</P>
      <P>"We will continue our subsidies for those children who have few opportunities to
take part in international events and we hope the contest will become another
credible channel for talent-selection in addition to the basic competence test
held by the government, " he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mounting debts of Taiwan's local governments are not only marginalizing
counties and cities outside of the five special municipalities but are also
driving them into pauperism, a politician-turned-scholar said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Peng Pai-hsien, who had served as Nantou magistrate and is now a professor of
finance at Kainan University in northern Taiwan, made the remarks at a seminar
discussing the financial situations faced by the local governments as a new page
was turned a day earlier with the launch of Xinbei,  Taichung,  Tainan and
Kaohsiung as special municipalities, putting them on an equal administrative
footing with Taipei.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that both the central and local governments have been piling up
debts so high that it is no longer feasible to just amend the tax revenue
distribution law or the public debt law.</P>
      <P>"The real problem is that the domestic sources of tax are limited," he said.</P>
      <P>Recalling a 2008 incident which 12 county or city governments ran out of funds
and could not pay salaries to their employees, Peng said the new administrative
regions will make non-municipal cities and counties so marginalized they might
end up being "beggar" cities and counties.</P>
      <P>He quoted the latest amendment to the tax revenue distribution act as reporting
that the central government will give the five municipalities NT$60.7 billion
out of the NT$98.2 billion budgeted for all local governments.</P>
      <P>This will do little to alleviate the total debt burden of NT$803.4 billion in
the five municipalities, which includes their shares of the labor and health
insurance expenditure, pension payments and subsidies for retired government
employees eligible for preferential interest rates for their term deposits, Peng
said, quoting 2009 government statistics.</P>
      <P>Peng said a fairer -- and more reasonable -- formula to distribute national tax
revenues would be to adopt a national "per capita"  standard  for public
services  that include teachers, policemen, firefighters and environmental
protection officers, based on which tax money is assigned to each local
government.</P>
      <P>An urgent task to get the nation out of the financial mess is to overhaul the
government's finance structure, a task that calls for the newly elected
municipal mayors to submit a long-range land-use plan and an administrative
rezoning plan by 2014, when their term of office expires, he said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Peng's proposal, Chen Chin-chi, a think tank researcher, recommended
that the power of the central and local governments should be redefined in such
a way as to satisfy the principles of local autonomy and financial autonomy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A historical committee under the Kinmen County government determined Sunday to
list the 40-year-old Jincheng Civic Tunnel as an officially-designated
historical relic site entitled to special protection.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen County Historical Structure Screening Committee, headed by Kinmen
Magistrate Lee Wo-shih, decided at a meeting to have the 2,559-meter tunnel,
excavated in 1968 and rebuilt in 1978, listed as an officially recognized
historical relic.</P>
      <P>It is one of the major and longest of the 12 deep underground military base
(DUMB) tunnels built as defense installations on Kinmen since the late 1950s.</P>
      <P>The tunnels bear witness to how Kinmen survived the many Chinese communist
strikes against it in years gone by, including extensive shelling in 1958, and
how Kinmen has been transformed from a frontline anti-communist bastion into a
tourist attraction in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Jincheng Civic Tunnel was opened to the public two years ago after being
refurbished.</P>
      <P>Located in the center of downtown Jincheng, the tunnel connects Kinmen County
Hall, the Kinmen Bus Station, the Kinmen Post Office, the Kinmen Branch of the
Land Bank of Taiwan, the ruling Kuomintang's Kinmen Chapter, an elementary
school and the Kinmen Senior High School.</P>
      <P>The safety of the wartime tunnel, however, has been called into question in
recent months after a property developer began building a 10-story building
above the underground fortification.</P>
      <P>"We will work out measures to ensure the landowners' rights, as well as protect
the historical site," Lee said.</P>
      <P>If designated as an official historical relic, the Jincheng Civic Tunnel will be
the 45th protected historical relic site on the island and the first tunnel to
be listed, according the county government's Cultural Affairs Bureau.</P>

      <P>In the city council speaker and deputy speaker elections that followed, the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) took three speaker seats, two deputy speaker seats, and

      <P>The KMT traditionally dominates local city councils, but this time, the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for the first time grabbed both
speaker and deputy speaker seats in Tainan City.</P>
      <P>The DPP also won deputy speaker seats in Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, meaning
that for the first time, the KMT has less chance of having a free hand in

DPP has taken the post. (Dec. 26, 2010)</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bankers will likely raise the benchmark interest rate by 0.125
percentage points when they meet Dec. 30, to tighten credit and suppress rising
real estate prices, foreign institution experts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The move follows an announcement from China that it will raise its one-year loan
and deposit interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, effective Sunday -- the
second rate hike in China this year. The first came on Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Tony Phoo, an economist with the Standard Chartered Bank Taiwan, said that as
the pressure on inflation grew while substantive interest rates remained low,
the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) will likely up its key
interest rate by 0.125 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The central bank might also be thinking about raising the reserve ratio for
banking institutions and issuing one-year negotiable certificates of deposit
(NCDs) to claw back capital from the market, said the economist.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the central bank might announce measures for dampening
housing prices in municipal areas as soaring prices are creating an impression
of a widening wealth gap.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist of Citibank Taiwan, noted that his bank has
adjusted upward its forecast for Taiwan's economic growth this year from 8.7
percent to 9.1 percent.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economy is on track for a strong recovery, Cheng said, the central
bank is likely to decide during its fourth-quarter board meeting, to hike
interest rates by 12.5 basis points.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will expel city councilors who
did not toe the party line in the Dec. 25 voting for council speakers and deputy
speakers, the party's secretary-general said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan said he will recommend that the party's Central Advisory Committee
kick out those named by the respective council caucuses as having failed to vote
according to caucus resolutions in the elections for speakers and deputy
speakers in the five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>One of these apparent wayward councilors was Lee Wan-yu of Xinbei City, who cast
her ballot for herself rather than for the party's nominee for speaker. DPP
Xinbei City branch chief Wu Ping-jui said Lee violated the caucus resolution and
that the caucus has therefore decided to kick her out. An official request to
that effect will be sent to the party headquarters the following day, Wu added.</P>
      <P>In the election for the Kaohsiung City Council speaker, the DPP's nominee won
only 31 votes,  two short of the council caucus expectations. In Tainan,
meanwhile, the DPP nominee got only 25 ballots in the first-round vote and 30
votes in the second.</P>
      <P>This means that in both cities, some DPP councilors did not follow party orders
to vote for their comrades. The identities of the culprits were being
investigated, and once the results have been out, the lists will be sent to the
party headquarters. enditem nnnn</P>

      <P>A total of 124 Taiwanese students clinched perfect scores in the American
Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8), one of the best results on record since Taiwan
was invited to join the international competition a decade ago, the organizer
said Sunday at an award presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>The 2010 AMC 8, a 25-question,  40-minute multiple choice examination designed
mostly for junior high school students, was taken by over 152,900 participants
from over 20 countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, China
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan section of the AMC 8 was held Nov. 21, with a record high 9,593
participants who averaged 15.7 in the contest, higher than the global average of
9.98, according to a statement from the organizer, the Nine-Nine Cultural and
Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>The 124 Taiwanese students, ranging from 11 to 15 years old, accounted for
nearly 25 percent of the competition's 499 perfect score students, the statement
said.</P>
      <P>"This is because the Taiwanese participants are good at solving most types of
this year's questions such as proportions, quadrature and number theory, " said
Ho Yang-ming, president of the foundation, at the award ceremony.</P>
      <P>Taiwan set the record of 124 perfect score students in 2008 among 9,012 local
participants, Ho added. The local part of the competition has been running since
1999.</P>
      <P>Hsu Min-heng, a 11-year-old elementary student who entered the contest for the
first time this year, was the youngest participant among the local perfect
scorers.</P>
      <P>The child first showed an interest in math at kindergarten age and then spent
most of his time reading math by himself instead of going to cram school, his
father Hsu Wen-jong told CNA on the sidelines of the ceremony.</P>
      <P>"When he was seven, my wife and I found one day that he had been trying to read
his older sister's mathematics junior high school textbook. He really enjoys
thinking about mathematical questions, " said Hsu's father, who is dean of
academic affairs in a senior high school in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho also noted that the foundation subsidizes the application fees for
more than 300 students from low-income families to encourage their participation
in the competition.</P>
      <P>"We will continue our subsidies for those children who have few opportunities to
take part in international events and we hope the contest will become another
credible channel for talent-selection in addition to the basic competence test
held by the government, " he said.</P>

      <P>The mounting debts of Taiwan's local governments are not only marginalizing
counties and cities outside of the five special municipalities but are also
driving them into pauperism, a politician-turned-scholar said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Peng Pai-hsien, who had served as Nantou magistrate and is now a professor of
finance at Kainan University in northern Taiwan, made the remarks at a seminar
discussing the financial situations faced by the local governments as a new page
was turned a day earlier with the launch of Xinbei,  Taichung,  Tainan and
Kaohsiung as special municipalities, putting them on an equal administrative
footing with Taipei.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that both the central and local governments have been piling up
debts so high that it is no longer feasible to just amend the tax revenue
distribution law or the public debt law.</P>
      <P>"The real problem is that the domestic sources of tax are limited," he said.</P>
      <P>Recalling a 2008 incident which 12 county or city governments ran out of funds
and could not pay salaries to their employees, Peng said the new administrative
regions will make non-municipal cities and counties so marginalized they might
end up being "beggar" cities and counties.</P>
      <P>He quoted the latest amendment to the tax revenue distribution act as reporting
that the central government will give the five municipalities NT$60.7 billion
out of the NT$98.2 billion budgeted for all local governments.</P>
      <P>This will do little to alleviate the total debt burden of NT$803.4 billion in
the five municipalities, which includes their shares of the labor and health
insurance expenditure, pension payments and subsidies for retired government
employees eligible for preferential interest rates for their term deposits, Peng
said, quoting 2009 government statistics.</P>
      <P>Peng said a fairer -- and more reasonable -- formula to distribute national tax
revenues would be to adopt a national "per capita"  standard  for public
services  that include teachers, policemen, firefighters and environmental
protection officers, based on which tax money is assigned to each local
government.</P>
      <P>An urgent task to get the nation out of the financial mess is to overhaul the
government's finance structure, a task that calls for the newly elected
municipal mayors to submit a long-range land-use plan and an administrative
rezoning plan by 2014, when their term of office expires, he said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Peng's proposal, Chen Chin-chi, a think tank researcher, recommended
that the power of the central and local governments should be redefined in such
a way as to satisfy the principles of local autonomy and financial autonomy.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) will discuss punishment for its city councilors who
did not support the party in the deputy speaker election for the Taipei City
Council, party officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The KMT suffered an unexpected loss in the deputy speaker election in the
capital for the first time a day earlier after failing to secure all the votes
from its 31 councilors. The KMT has eight more seats on the council than the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>DPP councilor Cho Po-ya defeated incumbent Deputy Speaker Chen Ching-hsiang by a
30-29 margin.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that six KMT members voted for the DPP candidate, said Pan Chia-
sen, chief of the KMT's Taipei branch. He added that the party had tracked down
four or five of them.</P>
      <P>"There is no other choice but to expel them, " Pan said.</P>
      <P>He said the party would hold a meeting the following day, after which the
disciplinary committee of the Taipei branch will talk about punishment.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who serves concurrently as KMT chairman, said that "we
have to reflect on ourselves."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bankers will likely raise the benchmark interest rate by 0.125
percentage points when they meet Dec. 30, to tighten credit and suppress rising
real estate prices, foreign institution experts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The move follows an announcement from China that it will raise its one-year loan
and deposit interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, effective Sunday -- the
second rate hike in China this year. The first came on Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>Tony Phoo, an economist with the Standard Chartered Bank Taiwan, said that as
the pressure on inflation grew while substantive interest rates remained low,
the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) will likely up its key
interest rate by 0.125 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The central bank might also be thinking about raising the reserve ratio for
banking institutions and issuing one-year negotiable certificates of deposit
(NCDs) to claw back capital from the market, said the economist.</P>
      <P>He also predicted that the central bank might announce measures for dampening
housing prices in municipal areas as soaring prices are creating an impression
of a widening wealth gap.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist of Citibank Taiwan, noted that his bank has
adjusted upward its forecast for Taiwan's economic growth this year from 8.7
percent to 9.1 percent.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economy is on track for a strong recovery, Cheng said, the central
bank is likely to decide during its fourth-quarter board meeting, to hike
interest rates by 12.5 basis points.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will expel city councilors who
did not toe the party line in the Dec. 25 voting for council speakers and deputy
speakers, the party's secretary-general said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su Jia-chyuan said he will recommend that the party's Central Advisory Committee
kick out those named by the respective council caucuses as having failed to vote
according to caucus resolutions in the elections for speakers and deputy
speakers in the five special municipalities.</P>
      <P>One of these apparent wayward councilors was Lee Wan-yu of Xinbei City, who cast
her ballot for herself rather than for the party's nominee for speaker. DPP
Xinbei City branch chief Wu Ping-jui said Lee violated the caucus resolution and
that the caucus has therefore decided to kick her out. An official request to
that effect will be sent to the party headquarters the following day, Wu added.</P>
      <P>In the election for the Kaohsiung City Council speaker, the DPP's nominee won
only 31 votes,  two short of the council caucus expectations. In Tainan,
meanwhile, the DPP nominee got only 25 ballots in the first-round vote and 30
votes in the second.</P>
      <P>This means that in both cities, some DPP councilors did not follow party orders
to vote for their comrades. The identities of the culprits were being
investigated, and once the results have been out, the lists will be sent to the
party headquarters. enditem nnnn</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a low temperature warning Monday after a
cold front swept Taiwan and brought the temperature down to below 10 degrees
Celsius in most areas on the subtropical island in the early hours of the day.</P>
      <P>Xinbei City's Danshuei, which is located at the mouth of the Danshuei River in
northern Taiwan, recorded a temperature of 5.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest in
the municipal district since the beginning of winter.</P>
      <P>The cold front has also sent temperatures in Keelung in the north, Yilan in the
east, Taichung in the central region and Tainan in the south plummeting to their
lowest levels this winter on early Monday morning, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>The temperature in Keelung stood at 6.4 degrees C., while it was 6.8 degrees in
Yilan, 7.5 degrees in Taichung and 9 degrees in Tainan.</P>
      <P>Even in the usually-warm southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, the temperature
dropped to 11.3 degrees, the CWB added, as it reminded people to keep themselves
warm and ensure proper air flows while activating gas-powered water heaters
indoors.</P>
      <P>The cold front would turn weaker in the daytime Tuesday, the CWB predicted,
adding that the next dry cold front would hit Taiwan on Dec. 30.</P>
      <P>That could lead to temperatures across Taiwan plunging again, possibly to record
lows, the CWB said. It also said that the next cold front would linger until

      <P>Taiwan's financial stocks attracted buying, outperforming the broader market in
Monday morning trade,  as investors bet that the central bank will raise
interest rates in the upcoming policy meeting, dealers said.</P>
      <P>They said that pressure on Taiwan's central bank to hike interest</P>
      <P>rates has mounted after China increased its key interest rates by 0.25
percentage points over the weekend.</P>
      <P>If interest rates are hiked in Thursday's policy meeting, local banks are
expected to benefit from higher interest income, which should lift their bottom
lines.</P>
      <P>Market observers said that there was a consensus in the market that the central
bank would raise benchmark interest rates by 0.125 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In Monday morning trade, the financial sector rose 1.89 percent, while the
weighted index rose 0.10 percent to 8,870.09.</P>
      <P>"More and more investors expect the central bank to raise interest rates further
on Thursday, as the local economy has staged a strong rebound," MasterLink
Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>"After the People's Bank of China announced a 25 basis point hike in the one-
year base lending rate and deposit rate Saturday, interest rate hikes in the
local market seem a sure thing," Tang said.</P>
      <P>In September, Taiwan's central bank raised the discount rate by 0.125 percentage
points, the second increase since June, after the local economy climbed out of a
recession, following a global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>Tang said that, with the domestic economy growing, lending to enterprises is on
the rise, "so higher interest rates would be positive for the banking sector's
bottom line."</P>
      <P>Tang said that, once the central bank increased rates, inflows of foreign funds
were expected to accelerate accordingly.</P>
      <P>"High liquidity is expected to push up local share prices, in</P>
      <P>particular, prices of large cap financial stocks which need ample funds to go
higher," Tang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the financial sector has been consolidating for some time, its
valuations look attractive compared with the broader market, Tang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: The race is on among five megacities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/10  13:39:03
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mayors of Taiwan's five special municipalities rushed to begin work right
after they assumed office last weekend, each with their eyes on the goal of
building their constituencies as the best in the nation.</P>
      <P>Some mayors immediately called brainstorming sessions to chart new strategies,
while others went on community outreach tours to get first-hand information
about ongoing development projects.</P>
      <P>Given the special status of the megacities under their control, the five
popularly elected mayors arguably will play important roles in Taiwan's
political arena in the next four years. It is also very likely that a future
national leader will emerge from their ranks.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, some mayors have already shown their leadership with the
selection of their administrative teams.</P>
      <P>For instance, the recruitment of former National Police Agency Director-General
Hou Yo-yi as deputy mayor of Xinbei City is an encouraging sign of Mayor Eric
Liluan Chu's determination to improve law and order in his constituency and
uphold clean politics.</P>
      <P>For years, Taiwan's city and county councils have been dominated by
controversial figures with shady ties to underground criminal gangs. Despite the
upgrade or expansion of some areas into special municipalities, this frustrating
scenario is not likely to disappear soon. The election Saturday of some corrupt
figures as speaker or deputy speakers in some of the new megacities bears this
out.</P>
      <P>In the speaker and deputy speaker elections, both the ruling Kuomintang and
opposition Democratic Progressive Party saw some of their councilors vote in
contravention of their party's directives in an apparent pursuit of personal
interests.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, municipality mayors, while respecting the legal
supervision of the city council in their administrations, should have the spine
to reject shady or improper requests by council members. We hope the newly
elected mayors will help correct the long-distorted local political culture and
environment. Folding under pressure will endanger not only national interests
but also the mayors' own reputations and future. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 27,

      <P>Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang on Monday confirmed the results of a
poll that showed 76.5 percent of respondents will voluntarily fight for their
country if it comes under military threat.</P>
      <P>In response to reporters' questions, Chao confirmed that the military in October
commissioned a civilian poll on national defense policies.</P>
      <P>In similar survey in 2009, the percentage of people who said they would
volunteer if Taiwan came under attack was 74.5 percent, Chao said, attributing
the higher percentage this year to what he called successful national defense
education.</P>
      <P>The results  of the poll this year was reported  in the Chinese-language  China
Times,  which said it was the highest percentage in recent years.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, civilians between the ages of 40 and 59 would be most
likely to voluntarily defend Taiwan, and blue-collar workers would be more
willing than white-collar workers to do so.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that the military is preparing to switch to a fully
volunteer recruitment system, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said, the
poll was conducted to determine the level of volunteerism that could be expected
in the event of a war, the paper reported.</P>
      <P>The results were not publicized because they were meant to be used only as
reference by the military's personnel recruitment units, the MND said.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted on nearly 1,000 civilians over the age of 20 around
Taiwan via telephone, the military said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan shares close up 0.35 percent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.35 percent Monday,  led by the financial
sector,  which was boosted by expectations that the central bank will decide in
its upcoming policy meeting to raise its key interest rates, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 31.21 points to 8,892.31, after moving between 8,828.67
and 8,908.42, on turnover of NT$111.53 billion (US$3.77 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 5.57 points and moved higher as buying focused on financial
stocks on high hopes that their profitability will be lifted by the central
bank's imminent announcement of interest rate hikes, dealers said.</P>
      <P>"Since China hiked its benchmark interest rates, pressure has been rising for
Taiwan's central bank to follow suit, " Mega Securities analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>The People's Bank of China announced over the weekend that it would raise its
one-year base lending rate and deposit rate by 25 basis points to fight rising
inflation.</P>
      <P>Huang said there is general agreement in the market the Taiwan central bank will
announce 0.125 percentage points hike Thursday since the local economy has
rebounded strongly.</P>
      <P>"There is a strong possibility that Taiwan's central bank will hike its key
interest rates, " Huang said. "Many investors think that the rate increase is a
sure thing so they rushed to pick up banking stocks this morning."</P>
      <P>However, selling in the bellwether high tech sector offset the gains posted by
the financial sector due to a rising New Taiwan dollar, which is likely to
undermine Taiwan's global competitiveness, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,626 stocks closed up and 2,591 down, while 325 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector scored the highest gains, ending up 2.9 percent. Textile
stocks rose 1.1 percent, and foodstuffs and plastic and chemical shares added
0.1 percent, while the paper and pulp and construction sectors closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>Among the financial stocks, China Development Financial rose 6.76 percent to
NT$11.05, E. Sun Financial added 5.43 percent to NT$19.40 and First Financial
gained 2.88 percent to NT$25.00.</P>
      <P>Cement stocks fell 0.6 percent, and machinery and electronic shares lost 0.4
percent.</P>
      <P>In the electronic sector, PC vendor Acer fell 0.97 percent to NT$91.80 and flat
panel maker Chimei Innolux dropped 0.90 percent to NT$38.40.</P>
      <P>Huang said the market remains awash in liquidity, prompting buying to rotate
from sector to sector as investors seek safe havens to park funds. Meanwhile,
the market lacks a mainstream sector to make a significant breakthrough, he
said.</P>
      <P>"The index is gradually moving ahead instead of making big swings and such
movements are making the market technically healthier, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- New steps to highlight ECFA effects</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/27/10  17:05:23
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the early harvest program under the Taiwan-China Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) set to take effect on New Year's Day, the Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) will open a new service center Wednesday to offer guidance
on ECFA-related issues.</P>
      <P>It will also take three steps -- stage large-scale trade forums in 10 Chinese
cities to introduce trade and investment opportunities in Taiwan, invite large
Chinese enterprises to purchase goods in Taiwan, and organize professional trade
fairs in China -- to further maximize the trade deal's impact.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Cho Shih-chao said over the weekend that the new ECFA
service center will remain open during the coming New Year holiday from Saturday
through Sunday.</P>
      <P>The center will mainly help local manufacturers and exporters resolve problems
related to merchandise trade under the ECFA's early harvest program.</P>
      <P>Starting on Jan. 1, more than 800 items from Taiwan and China shipped to the
other side will have their tariffs phased out during a two-stage process over
three years under the ECFA's early harvest program.</P>
      <P>From New Year's Day, some 80 Taiwan-made products will enjoy duty-free access to
the Chinese market.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 1, 2012, an additional 400-plus products made in Taiwan will also
receive duty-free treatment when imported into China.</P>
      <P>Government sources said the number of Taiwan-made products to be granted tariff-
free access to China under the early harvest program has increased to 557 from
the original 539 after adjusting customs classification code numbers.</P>
      <P>The items accounted for 16.14 percent of Taiwan's total exports to China in
2009.</P>
      <P>Cho said the BOFT hopes the ECFA will generate initial gains by the end of the
first quarter of 2011 so that the average person will feel that the agreement is
benefiting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To reach the goal of having the ECFA become a "nationally felt" economic
phenomenon, Cho said the BOFT will continue holding "early harvest"
presentations in various cities around Taiwan this week.</P>
      <P>In addition, the BOFT will collaborate with the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) to sponsor seminars starting in the second half of
January in 10 major Chinese cities -- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Qingdao,
Dalian, Xiamen, Nanjing, Wuhan, Nanning and Chengdu.</P>
      <P>The seminars will be aimed at trying to get large Chinese business groups to
source products from Taiwan, particularly those items that will have their
import duties reduced or eliminated under the early harvest list.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will also organize professional trade delegations, such as those in the
bicycle, automotive component, textile and orchid sectors, to embark on market
promotion tours of China, Cho added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture Minister Chen Wu-hsiung said the council will
cooperate with Uni-President Group in setting up an outlet in Shanghai in April
to display and distribute Taiwan-made agricultural products.</P>
      <P>"The establishment of the center will enable Chinese tourists to place orders
during their trips in Taiwan and pick up their purchases in China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Eighteen Taiwanese agricultural items will enjoy duty-free access to China from
Jan. 1 under the ECFA's early harvest program, said Chen, who estimated that the
preferential treatment would help expand Taiwan's farm produce sales to China
six-fold in three years. (Dec. 27, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang denied a report on Monday that a
committee to serve as a window for trade negotiations between Taiwan and China
would be launched Tuesday, but said it could be formed by the end of the week.</P>
      <P>"Tomorrow is impossible, " Shih said during a question and answer session at the
legislature. "It is still being negotiated. It will not take too long."</P>
      <P>Asked if the formation of the proposed cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
committee would take effect by the end of this year, the minister said "we are
trying (to make it happen)."</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language United Daily News reported Monday that the committee would
be launched Tuesday to fulfill one of the clauses of the Taiwan-China Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), which took effect in September.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Kuo-hsin Liang and China's
Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei are expected to jointly head the
committee.</P>
      <P>The trade deal's "early harvest" list of products enjoying preferential tariffs
under the ECFA takes effect Jan. 1, 2011, and the committee is seen as necessary
to facilitate talks on the implementation, interpretation and coordination of
the early harvest list and other ECFA-related business.</P>
      <P>Panels under the committee are also expected to follow up on commodity trade and
service access issues, dispute settlement, and investment protection, which
means the two sides would want the committee to be in place before the end of
2010.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, several lawmakers cast doubt over the transparency of the proposed
committee, but Shih said it would be subject to legislative supervision.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCC's stance on ERA TV license draws bipartisan flak</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
12/27/10  17:33:26
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Communication Commission (NCC) stood firm Monday on its decision to
revoke the license of a TV entertainment channel for what it said was the use of
embedded advertisement.</P>
      <P>Faced with criticisms in the legislature by lawmakers across the political
spectrum, NCC Chairwoman Su Herng said ERA TV had failed to honor its promise to
stop the practice of clandestine advertising on its entertainment channel and
therefore had to be penalized.</P>
      <P>In revoking the channel's license on Dec. 22, the NCC said ERA TV's
entertainment channel had repeatedly violated the Satellite and Broadcasting Act
by placing illegal product ads and excessive infomercials in its program line-
ups.</P>
      <P>When the station's license came up for its sixth annual renewal in November last
year, the NCC review committee, in consideration of the staff employed at the
station, decided to renew the license on condition that ERA would stop
advertising certain products on its shows, Su told the lawmakers.</P>
      <P>However, the station did not hold up its end of the bargain and the NCC brought
to bear the penalty for the total of 46 violations that the station had racked
up in six years, Su said.</P>
      <P>"It was like telling a student who deserved to be expelled that you would hold
off on the punishment if he promised to behave, " she said. "When the student
continued to violate the rules there was no choice but to execute the penalty."</P>
      <P>But legislators  of both the ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  and opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) took issue with Su's explanation, saying that NCC, an
independent media regulator that was established in 2006, had overstepped its
authority and was loosely interpreting the relevant laws.</P>
      <P>KMT Lawmaker Sun Ta-chien, who was one of the advocates of the NCC's
establishment four years ago, said it was setting a bad precedent and had made a
non-objective decision.</P>
      <P>"There is no legal basis for determining that 46 violations in six years amount
to a serious offense, " Sun said. "Furthermore, the NCC has no clear-cut
parameters or definition of what is product placement."</P>
      <P>Sun also argued that since ERA TV had bought the station from the Eastern
Multimedia  Group two years ago,  ERA should be held accountable only for the
violations incurred during its period of ownership.</P>
      <P>Two other KMT legislators, Luo Shu-lei and Chu Fong-chi, also slammed  the NCC's
decision,  saying it had gone beyond  its jurisdiction and twisted the laws. The
NCC should have temporarily suspended the operations of the station instead of
revoking its license, they said.</P>
      <P>Joining the chorus of criticisms against the NCC, DPP Lawmaker Pan Meng-an said
it was a government tool used to control the media.</P>
      <P>Kuo Wen-chen, also of the DPP, said the NCC should leave the public to deal with
the ERA TV channel issue.</P>
      <P>"Viewers will switch to another channel if they don't like what they see," Kuo
said. "It should be their choice."</P>
      <P>Bucking the wave of criticisms, senior KMT lawmaker and former teacher Hung
Hsiu-chu said the NCC had done the right thing.</P>
      <P>"If a driver's license is subject to periodical renewal based on the holder's
driving record, why should a TV station be any different? " he asked.</P>
      <P>"Some broadcasts  such as infomercials  contain  misleading information that
could seriously damage the health of consumers," she said. "The NCC must step in
and root out these practices to prevent people from being duped."</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Monday,  dropping NT$0.06 to
close at NT$30.425  after rebounding from the day's low of NT$29.481.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at the day's high of NT$30.525 and then moved to the day's
low before rebounding due to the central bank's continued intervention in the
local foreign exchange market to prevent rapid appreciation of the local
currency, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$971 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>Selling by exporters and foreign banks pushed down the U.S. dollar after the
market opened on further inflows of foreign funds into the local market, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>They said expectations that the central bank would raise its key interest rates
at Thursday's policy making meeting added downward pressure on the greenback as
investors were betting higher local interest rates would attract more idle funds
from overseas and further boost the local currency.</P>
      <P>The likelihood of the central bank increasing interest rates has risen recently,
especially after the People's Bank of China raised its one-year base lending
rate and deposit rate by 0.25 percentage points over the weekend to fight
inflation, they added.</P>
      <P>The general market consensus is that Taiwan's central bank will boost its
interest rates by 0.125 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In late trade, the central bank stepped in again to boost the value of the U.S.
dollar back to NT$30.00, a level the market believes is the central bank's
bottom line in the short term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sacked JAL flight attendants to protest on New Year's Day</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese flight attendants who were laid off by Japan Airlines (JAL)
in July are planning to stage a protest on New Year's Day against what they
called the government's apathy toward their plight.</P>
      <P>The flight attendants, to be joined by workers' rights activists, will hold a
demonstration in front of the Presidential Office on Jan. 1 to draw public
attention to their predicament, said Yang Shao-yung, chairman of the ROC
Alliance of International Airport Labor Unions.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese JAL flight attendant, one of seven who have refused to accept
severance pay from JAL, said she is furious and saddened that the Taiwan
government had sat idly by while a foreign company was bullying Taiwan workers
in their own country.</P>
      <P>The JAL Taiwan branch was fined NT$600,000 (US$20,000) by the Taipei City
government last week for job discrimination after the airline laid off 70
Taiwanese flight attendants, reportedly on account of their age.</P>
      <P>The flight attendants, whose positions were eliminated at the end of July under
an early retirement  program,  in August filed age-discrimination complaints
against JAL,  Japan's largest air carrier.</P>
      <P>Both the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Taipei City
Department of Labor have said that the JAL layoffs were illegal  and have asked
the airline to reinstate  the flight attendants.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese officials, however, did not specify which of Taiwan's labor laws
had been violated in the move, which was reported as an effort by JAL to address
its financial difficulties by downsizing.</P>
      <P>To date, JAL has not responded to the CLA's request and none of the seven flight
attendants who have refused to accept severance pay have been invited to return
to their jobs.</P>
      <P>Sixty-three of the 70 workers who were laid off have agreed to the early
retirement deal offered by the airline.</P>
      <P>JAL had said that the layoffs were based on evaluations of functionality, cost
and performance.</P>
      <P>But according to a Department of Labor official, some of the Taiwanese employees
who were laid off had been top scorers in the JAL's performance appraisals for
several consecutive years and some had received awards as the airline's best
flight attendants.</P>
      <P>The layoffs were part of a plan by JAL to reduce its global work force by a
third this year as part of a restructuring program after filing for bankruptcy
in January.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC in talks with Powerchip to buy buildings, land for expansion</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chip
maker, said Monday it is in talks to buy property from memory chip maker
Powerchip Technology Corp. that would be used for future expansion.</P>
      <P>"We have entered negotiations with Powerchip for a possible purchase of land and
buildings located in the Hsinchu Science Park, " said Elizabeth Sun, a TSMC
spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>"It would be possible for TSMC to build a 12-inch wafer plant on the site if we
could reach an agreement on the purchase, " Sun said. "But talks remain ongoing
and no deal has been reached."</P>
      <P>Sun said that even if the purchase were to go through, any expansion project at
the particular location would not be completed until 2012.</P>
      <P>She declined to disclose further details, but said TSMC would hold an investor
conference in January to announce its expansion plans for 2011.</P>
      <P>Currently, TSMC operates two 12-inch wafer plants -- one in the northern Hsinchu
Science Park and the other in the Southern Taiwan Science Park -- and is
building a third plant in the Central Taiwan Science Park.</P>
      <P>The Commercial Times reported on Monday that TSMC was likely to spend NT$3
billion (US$101 million) to acquire land and buildings owned by Powerchip that
are close to TSMC's 12-inch plant in the Hsinchu Science Park.</P>
      <P>Powerchip, which produces dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, declined to
comment on the report.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said TSMC is likely to use the possible
new 12-inch wafer plant to focus on the development of higher end technology,
including 40 nanometer, 28 nm and even more advanced processes.</P>
      <P>"The expansion is necessary for TSMC to maintain its technology lead in the
market to secure its No. 1 position and leave its rivals far behind," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>For Powerchip, Hsu said, the possible property sale could be expected to help
the company improve its financial structure by repaying short-term debt.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Powerchip has NT$7.6 billion in loans with a maturity of one
year or less and an additional NT$32 billion in long-term debt as of the end of
third quarter.</P>

      <P>Governments at the central and local level should avoid buying news coverage to
promote their policies and initiatives, a leading Kuomintang (KMT) official was
quoted as saying Monday.</P>
      <P>King Pu-tsung, secretary general of the ruling KMT, was quoted as saying that
the party and the government should hold a "serious" discussion about the issue.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Su Jun-pin, King made the suggestion during the
party's weekly meeting, and for two weeks in a row has expressed concern over
the subject.</P>
      <P>He quoted King as saying that the KMT has always been opposed to the government
practice of "buying" media coverage for political messages.</P>
      <P>However, King said there was a difference between political advocacy and charity
or public-service messages such as AIDS and anti-fraud information, according to
Su.</P>
      <P>Su said King criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for buying space
in the media during Chen Shui-bian's administration from 2000-2008 to promote a
referendum on Taiwan's right to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"That was political buying of advertorials, which we firmly oppose," King was
quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Kim is not in favor of commercial interests buying space in the
media for coverage of business messages disguised as news stories, according to
Su.</P>
      <P>The government  should  promote  its policies  openly  and transparently, King
was quoted as saying. He added that these were principles he had stuck to,
whether as information department chief, deputy mayor of Taipei, or KMT
secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Since both the central and local governments have problems in this regard, King
said, a party-government meeting should be held by weekend to seriously discuss
the matter.</P>

      <P>More than 90 percent of Taiwan's students plan to work part time during the
upcoming winter break, a survey by an online manpower agency showed Monday.</P>
      <P>As many as 93.12 percent of the college and graduate students polled said they
planned to work part time during the month-long vacation from mid-January to
mid-February, the 1111 Job Bank survey found.</P>
      <P>The respondents' top three reasons for getting a part-time job were to make more
money, gain more social and work experience, and expand their network of social
contacts.</P>
      <P>Of the nearly 7 percent of respondents who said they would not work during the
break, just over half (53.37 percent) said they did not have time to work part
time and another 32.14 percent said they could not find a suitable job.</P>
      <P>Job bank spokesperson Chang Hsu-lan said students should not consider part-time
jobs simply as a way to make money but also as an opportunity to make
connections.</P>
      <P>Albert Yuan, the marketing manager of the Leofoo Village Theme Park, also saw
money as merely an added benefit of doing a temporary job, saying that learning
something from the experience should be the most important goal.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online from Dec. 9 through Dec. 23, with 1,221 valid
samples collected. The poll had a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.80 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A decline in November's economic monitoring indicator and an unchanged leading
indicator index showed that Taiwan's economy was still growing but at a more
moderate pace, the government said Monday.</P>
      <P>Last month, the overall economic monitoring indicator compiled by the Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) fell to 32 points from October's 34
points, but still flashed a "yellow-red" light for the third consecutive month.</P>
      <P>In August, the economy flashed a "red" light, indicating it was overheating.</P>
      <P>The economic planning agency uses a five-color system to gauge the country's
economic performance for any given month.</P>
      <P>Blue implies a sluggish economy,  yellow-blue represents a slowdown, green
indicates a stable economy, yellow-red means the economy is mildly overheated,
and red signifies overheating.</P>
      <P>Among the sub-indexes forming the economic monitoring indicator, money supply,
employment in the non-farm sector, exports, mechanical and electrical equipment
imports, manufacturing sales, and retail, wholesale and restaurant sales fell.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sub-indexes related to share prices, direct and indirect
financing, and industrial production rose.</P>
      <P>The composite index of leading economic indicators, which gauges economic
performance over three to six months, measured 119.3 in November, unchanged from
a month earlier.</P>
      <P>The year-on-year six-month rate of change in November stood at 1.0 percent, down
1.0 percentage point from October. The rate of decline narrowed from the
previous month, the seventh consecutive month that has happened.</P>
      <P>The November index of coincident indicators, which reflect economic activity in
the period measured, rose 0.8 percent from October to 126.4.</P>
      <P>Though the overall monitoring indicator for November fell, the CEPD said it
remained optimistic about Taiwan's economic growth for 2011 as demand from
emerging economies remained strong and would provide a spark to the island's
exports.</P>
      <P>"Although domestic growth will be moderating next year, the pace of growth
remains stable," the CEPD said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"The government will continue to solicit foreign companies to invest in Taiwan
in a bid to boost domestic demand for further economic expansion," it added.</P>

      <P>The incidence of crashes involving T-34 Mentor airplanes during regular training
missions is "relatively higher" in Taiwan compared with other countries, Air
Force Chief of Staff Wang Cheng-hsiao said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks while answering a question by Legislator Chen Ying of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party at a hearing of the legislative Foreign
and National Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Noting that in the past two decades, Taiwan recorded a total of eight accidents
involving T-34 airplanes used for air force pilot training, Chen asked what was
the cause of the high rate of crashes.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang agreed that the number of the T-34 crashes in Taiwan was
indeed higher than in other countries, but he did not pinpoint a reason for the
high rate.</P>
      <P>He said the Air Force's fleet of T-34 pilot trainers has been grounded for
safety checks since the most recent crash in a southern Taiwan mountain area on
Dec. 15, in which a flight instructor and an Air Force Academy cadet were
killed.</P>
      <P>It was the second crash this year involving a T-34 trainer plane. In January, an
aircraft of the same model went down during a training flight in southern
Taiwan, killing the two pilots aboard.</P>
      <P>Wang said the investigation into the January crash is still in progress.</P>
      <P>The T-34 Mentor that crashed in December was the eighth to go down since the
U.S.-made trainer was introduced in Taiwan in 1985.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the T-34 Mentor that went down in January had a lifespan of
16,000 hours, and the one that crashed less than two weeks ago had a lifespan
that would have lasted until 2031.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang told reporters on the
sidelines of the legislative hearing that more than 20 other countries around
the world also use the T-34 Mentor for air force pilot training.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's Air Force Academy, the oldest T-34 has only 8,000 hours of flying
time, and the one that went down recently had only 7,600 hours, he said.</P>
      <P>The cause of the most recent crash is being investigated, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan outlasted South Korea 2-1 in the semifinal of the Asian Little League
Championships on Monday, keeping its hopes for a fifth consecutive title alive
heading into Tuesday's championship game showdown against Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chu Yi-kun hit a two-run homer in the first inning to give his team a
2-0 lead against the Koreans, in the game being played in Kurashiki, Okayama
Prefecture, in southern Japan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's lineup was shut down after that but its pitching rotation of Chu Yi-
kun, Wu Chun-an and Chang Yen-hsun made the lead stand up, allowing their
opponents to score only one run in the seven-inning contest.</P>
      <P>"The game was a pitching duel. Both teams sent their best pitchers to the mound
to frustrate opposing hitters, " said Lee Kuo-chiang, a coach of the Taiwanese
team, whose players came from several elementary and junior high schools in
Taoyuan County, northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said Japan, a strong team that trounced South Korea 10-1 on Dec. 24, would
be a tough opponent, but he was confident his team could overcome the hosts
despite cold and snowy weather that has almost taken its toll on some of
Taiwan's players.</P>
      <P>Over the past two days, many of them have complained about being too cold, and a
few of them had diarrhea or vomited, but Lee said they were all healthy now.</P>
      <P>Taiwan swept China, Indonesia and Thailand to win Group A at the Asian
Championships while Japan won Group B ahead of South Korea, Pakistan and Hong
Kong, setting up Monday's semifinal game between Taiwan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The Asian Little League Championships have been held every two years in a
country in the region since they began in 2000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has won the last four championships in a row, played in Wuxi, China,
Guanzhou, China, Hong Kong and Tokyo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Measure pushing harsher game-fixing sentences passes first hurdle</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislative committees passed an amendment on Monday that would deal harshly
with game-fixing in Taiwan's professional baseball league, the latest effort to
eradicate the gambling and game-rigging that have plagued the sport since 1996.</P>
      <P>The draft amendment, which would revise the Sports Lottery Act, calls for jail
terms ranging from three to 10 years and fines of up to NT$50 million (US$1.66
million) for group game-fixing involving over three people.</P>
      <P>For individual offenses, anybody convicted of game-fixing could face up to seven
years in jail and a fine of between NT$10 million and NT$30 million, according
to the bill jointly passed by the Education and Culture Committee and Finance
Committee.</P>
      <P>It still must get through the full legislature's second and three readings
before becoming law.</P>
      <P>The legislators called for the harsher punishments to replace amendments
proposed by the Executive Yuan that they felt were "too lenient" to solve the
persistent problem.</P>
      <P>In the Executive Yuan's version of the amendment it approved on April 1,
individuals found guilty of fixing professional baseball games would be subject
to a jail term of under five years and fines of up to NT$10 million.</P>
      <P>Game-fixing scandals have nearly caused the demise of Taiwan's Chinese
Professional Baseball League (CPBL) , repeatedly challenging fans' loyalty to
the country's national pastime.</P>
      <P>At its peak in the mid-1990s, the league drew an average of more than 6,000
fans, but in recent years its average attendance has ranged between 1,000 and
2,000.</P>
      <P>All four CPBL clubs said they welcomed the proposed legislation. Su Ching-hsuan,
the La New Bears president, said the harsher sentences would be an effective
deterrent to game-fixing.</P>
      <P>Brother Elephants President Yang Ai-hua, whose team was ravaged by a game-fixing
scandal last year, said, "what we have hoped for has finally arrived."</P>
      <P>Yang hoped that if the amendment were passed into law, it would be enforced
effectively, with law enforcement forces dealing with future suspects
impartially.</P>
      <P>CPBL Secretary-General Wayne Lee also said that "the law must be observed and
enforced completely."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Official calls for renaming of Taiwan office in Hong Kong</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official in charge of Hong Kong affairs said Monday that the Hong Kong
government should allow Taiwan to rename its representative office there as step
toward better bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Renaming the office "will serve as a key indicator of closer relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong, " said James Shi Chu, director- general of the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Department under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
at a seminar in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's representative office in Hong Kong bears the confusing and
often misleading title of Chung Hwa Travel Service (CHTS).</P>
      <P>In their dealings  with Taiwan,  the Hong Kong and Macau governments have been
sticking to the "seven-point guidelines" -- based on the "one China" principle
-- that were laid out by former Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen in 1995, Chu said.</P>
      <P>However,  since  then,  the cross-strait  and international situations have
changed considerably, therefore, Macau and Hong Kong should try to engage Taiwan
in a more practical and flexible manner, he said.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chu's views, Former Taiwanese representative to Hong Kong Cheng An-kuo
said that the CHTS looks just like a travel agency and not in the least like a
Taiwan representative office.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan-Kong Kong ties will only progress if they each establish a
representative office on the other side, with an appropriate title," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>Professor Lee Chih-chiang of Tamkang University said that the proposed
representative offices, if managed well, could serve as an important reference
for Taiwan and China to set up similar ones in Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>David Lie, vice chairman of the Hong Kong-Taiwan Business Cooperation Committee
and a member the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that
the Hong Kong government has assigned a task force to consider the issue, but
stressed that the proposal could only be realized under the "one China"
principle.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will not have to pay more than other countries to purchase U.S.-made UH-
60M helicopters, Deputy Defense Minister Chao Shih-chang assured lawmakers
Monday.</P>
      <P>In response to a question by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang at a
hearing in the legislative Foreign and National Defense Committee, Chao said the
price of U.S.-made helicopters is public knowledge.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will not have to pay a higher price than other buyers," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that in the Ministry of National Defense's (MND's) 2008 budget
proposal, it had listed a sum of NT$71.8 billion for the purchase of 60 UH-60M
helicopters to replace the old UH-1Hs that are still in commission.</P>
      <P>However, in the budget presented to the committee Monday, the MND had an
allocation of NT$84.7 billion for the helicopters, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the price quoted by the U.S. was US$2.1 billion, now it has risen to
US$2.5 billion, he further noted, asking the MND to seek a price reduction.</P>
      <P>In response, Chao stressed that the MND has always done its best to obtain good
arms procurement deals.</P>
      <P>The increase in the price of the helicopter package was due to the rising costs
of materials over the last few years, Chao said.</P>
      <P>At the hearing, Lin also asked about the MND's plans for the purchase of new
armored vehicles for the Army, as outlined in the ministry's 2009 policy paper.</P>
      <P>In response, Chao said the MND is still evaluating the needs of the Army and may
increase the number of new armored vehicles to 200.</P>

      <P>The new chairman of Taiwan's largest shipbuilder forecast Monday that the

NT$4 billion more than this year.</P>
      <P>Tan Tai-ping, who assumed chairmanship of CSBC Corporation, Taiwan earlier in
day, said that the world economy is recovering gradually from the financial
crisis of 2008-2009, prompting shipyards worldwide to expand production
capacity.</P>
      <P>However, the shipbuilding sector will not fully recover until 2012, he said,
adding that the average price of building ships is now only 80 percent of the
2008 level.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tan said, he expects a 20 percent to 30 percent growth next year
in the number of ships built by his company.</P>
      <P>Tan vowed to push for a more diversified operation by negotiating with China's
Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Ltd. for a strategic alliance.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he hopes to recruit new blood, he said, noting that the average age

      <P>A year-round series of Hakka cultural and art festivities will add ethnic color
to the Republic of China's 100th anniversary celebration next year, the Council
for Hakka Affairs (CHA) said Monday at the festival launch party.</P>
      <P>Held annually for the past two years, the year's slate of festivals will bring
together popular events of the past, such as the tung blossom festival and food
carnivals, and comic characters created by a well-known Hakka comic master to
fit the jovial mood, said CHA Minister Huang Yu-cheng.</P>
      <P>"Compared to 19 events held this year, a total of 21 rich Hakka cultural feasts
will take place in 2011, " Huang said.</P>
      <P>Twelve municipalities, including Taitung County and Hualien County in eastern
Taiwan, will present at least one festival per month.</P>
      <P>Huang explained  that the festivities  have helped enliven traditional Hakka

      <P>"People involved in the festivities, locals and tourists alike, responded that
they felt proud, " Huang said. "Our goal is to promote Hakka heritage among the

      <P>People in Taiwan will soon be able to see photos sent from friends' cell phones
on their television screen, a local telecom operator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Such an experience will be made possible sometime around February thanks to a
service to be launched by Taiwan Mobile Co., the country's second largest
telecom service provider.</P>
      <P>The digital convergence service will allow users to use one single account to
access photos, videos and songs through different Internet-connected devices,
such as a TV set, a computer, a tablet computer, and a mobile phone, the company
said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"For example, a married couple in Taipei can send photos of their children via a
cell phone during a family trip to a cloud photo album, " the company said,
referring to photos being stored on a distant server.</P>
      <P>"Their parents in Kaohsiung will receive an alert on the TV screen and can
immediately see the photos of their grandchildren by using the remote control,"
it added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile said it will be the country's first provider of this "four-screen"
service and one of its pioneers in Asia. The initiative is the result of two
years of effort and a heavy investment of resources, Taiwan Mobile President
Harvey Chang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile hopes to draw 50,000 to 100,000 users to the new service next
year.</P>
      <P>The company said its new product will focus on videos, online interactive games
or online shopping in the future, and it could also be applied to Internet-
enabled refrigerators.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Mobile said it expects to forge partnerships with Kbro Co. and other
multiple system operators to promote the service.</P>

      <P>China's biggest e-reader maker Hanvon Technology Co. unveiled an online e-book
store in Taiwan Monday as part of its efforts to extend its business to Chinese-
language markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>The e-book store has more than 10,000 titles in traditional Chinese, simplified
Chinese and English and allows Taiwanese users to preview or subscribe to
digital content like newspapers and magazines that is downloadable to the
company's e-reader devices, said Hanvon chief strategist Ray Zhang at a press
briefing.</P>
      <P>Zhang said Hanvon, with a 70 percent market share and more than 1 million
shipments of e-readers in China, cannot find a well-matched rival in the China
market.</P>
      <P>"The density of bookstores and handset makers makes the Taiwan market a
challenge for us, " he said. "By establishing an online e-book store here, we
are trying to create a business model that can be applied to Chinese-language
markets worldwide."</P>
      <P>Zhang said sales of Hanvon e-books and e-readers in Taiwan will focus on
individual consumers, unlike its business model in China that is supported
mainly by government purchases.</P>
      <P>According to Gartner Inc., an information technology research and advisory firm,
worldwide e-reader sales are forecast to reach 6.6 million units this year, up
79.8 percent from 3.6 million in 2009. The number is projected to surpass 11
million in 2011, an increase of 68.3 percent from 2010.</P>
      <P>The growth of the e-reader market is primarily driven by sales of Amazon's
e-readers in North America, which is predicted to total 4 million units by the
end of this year, Gartner said.</P>
      <P>Zhang said if the online bookstore service goes smoothly in Taiwan, the company
will launch a similar service in North America in the next few years, in a bid
to meet demand there for non-English content.</P>
      <P>In September, Hanvon unveiled a 10.1-inch "TouchPad" tablet computer that uses
the Windows 7 operating system, a move that was seen as likely to hurt the
company's sales of e-readers.</P>
      <P>However, Zhang said the company plans to launch an Android-based tablet device
in the second quarter of 2011.</P>
      <P>He said Hanvon has found that its e-readers do not meet the increasing need for
its online bookstore services, therefore, the company is offering more choices
of e-book devices in a bid to combine its advantage in handset manufacturing
with its platform services.</P>

      <P>An electronic music composer from Taiwan has won one of the top prizes of an
international competition with digitized variations of the timbre and tone of
the pipa,  a four-stringed traditional Chinese music instrument.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yu-chung, a professor in National Chiao Tung University's (NCTU's)
Institute of Music, won the top prize in the A-category of Music Nova 2010, an
international electroacoustic music competition held in the Czech Republic, with
a composition titled "Points of Departure with 17 Variations."</P>
      <P>Tseng performed his composition, which he said was inspired by the sounds of the
pipa, at a news conference held at an NCTU studio Monday.</P>
      <P>The concept behind the piece was to investigate and explore all possible
transformations or variations of pipa sounds using advanced digital technology,
Tseng said.</P>
      <P>Through  a compositional  technique  similar  to developing variations employed
by Brahms and other masters, Tseng said, he created 17 variations, with each one
departing on its own new sound journey with a punctuated percussive sound
similar to that of the pipa's plucked sound.</P>
      <P>Tseng also recorded sounds of two other traditional Chinese instruments -- the
bell and cymbals -- as well as the sound of a mole cricket in his composition.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese composer was the first ever to win top honors at the competition,

      <P>In one of the most sensational acquisitions in Taiwan's professional baseball
league history, Sinon Bulls veteran slugger Chang Tai-shan was bought Monday by
the Unir-President Lions for an NT$2.5 million (US$83,333) fee.</P>
      <P>Both the Taichung-based Bulls and the Tainan-based Lions notified Taiwan's
Chinese Professional Baseball League by fax that Chang, the league's all-time
leading home run hitter with 241, would join the Lions in 2011.</P>
      <P>The club confirmed to the media later in the day that it had paid the Bulls
NT$2.5 million in cash to acquire Chang, who will be making NT$210,000 per month
with the Lions next year, down from the NT$250,000 per month he was making with
the Bulls.</P>
      <P>In a news release, the Bulls management said the club had hoped that the 34
-year-old Chang would become a coach or player/coach in 2011 and beyond, but
Chang believed he could still be an everyday player.</P>
      <P>"The failure in reaching a consensus led the club to try to deal him," the Bulls
management said.</P>
      <P>Chang, who also holds the CPBL records for RBIs with 1,030 and hits with 1,622
in a 15-year career, first joined the now defunct Weichuan Dragons in 1996 at
the age of 19 and later transferred to the Sinon Bulls in 1999.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive telephone interview with the Central News Agency, Chang said he
would try his best to maintain his records after joining the Lions.</P>
      <P>"I will make records of my own and records for the Uni-President Lions as well,"
a resolute Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said he appreciated the Bulls' plans for him to become a coach, but he said
he was not yet ready to scale down his playing time.</P>
      <P>On the pay cut he took to play for the Lions, Chang said the new contract was
acceptable because he had yet to contribute to the club.</P>
      <P>The move to acquire a player for a fee is not unprecedented in the CPBL. The
Lions acquired left-handed pitcher Hsu Yu-wei from the La New Bears for NT$3
million in 2009.</P>

      <P>More than 800 volunteers washed and cleaned 15,400 Buddha statues of different
sizes at the Fo Guang Shan Monastery in Kaohsiung Monday, an action that senior
monk Hui Chuan said would cleanse people's minds as they prepare to greet the
new year.</P>
      <P>Fo Guang Shan Monastery, the largest in southern Taiwan, kicked off a campaign
to clean the Buddha statues as part of the activities to celebrate the 100th
year of the founding of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Hsin Pei, the monastery's head monk, said Buddha himself, as an enlightened
being, would not care if his image were covered with dust.</P>
      <P>But the ritual and symbolic action of cleaning his statues with water could
endear believers to Buddha's body, enabling them to get rid of physical dirt and
spiritual disturbances.</P>
      <P>Senior monk Hui Chuan said the temple held an activity two years ago asking
people to bathe and clothe their seniors in a gesture of filiality and respect.</P>
      <P>For similar reasons, he said, bathing the Buddha statues could be seen as a way
for people to clean their minds, giving them the peace of mind needed to obtain
enough wisdom to weather all difficulties and enjoy a smooth and auspicious
future.</P>
      <P>A three-floor scaffold was erected on the wall of the main temple hall, and
volunteers passed down all of the 14,800 statues to the ground where another
group of volunteer workers cleaned them with fresh water.</P>
      <P>In addition, another 600 statues were taken from three other halls for the
annual cleaning, bringing the total to 15,400 washed.</P>
      <P>Many of the volunteers were overseas Chinese hailing from Argentina and other
countries,  some of whom came with three generations of family members.</P>
      <P>Some of the tourists visiting Fo Guang Shan from China marveled at the grand and
rare sight of so many people acting together to wash Buddha statues, while
others actually joined the ranks of volunteers.</P>
      <P>When their tour guides called them to return to their tour buses, they regretted
having to leave so soon. "How quickly time passes! It's too bad. I haven't
gotten enough out of this," one said.</P>

      <P>Department of Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang said Monday that Taiwan will not
open its doors to generic drugs from China anytime soon even though the two
sides concluded a medical and health care cooperation agreement recently.</P>
      <P>"Generic drugs developed and manufactured in Taiwan are of better quality than
those from China, " Yaung said after attending an award-presentation  ceremony
for exceptional pharmaceuticals and biotechnology products.</P>
      <P>Generic drugs are drugs produced and distributed without patent protection. In
Taiwan, qualified pharmaceutical companies can produce and market the generic
product once the patent protection afforded to the original developer have
expired.</P>
      <P>On the cross-strait medical and health care cooperation agreement that was
signed in Taipei last week, Yaung said the pact was aimed mainly at establishing
mechanisms on pharmaceutical and medication management between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Such a move would not only help ensure the quality of drugs on both sides but
also shorten the period of time required for drug examination and screening.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to an early passage of the pact by the legislature," he said.</P>

      <P>A planned theater featuring natural scenery will be built along eastern Taiwan's
coastline to further boost tourism in the underdeveloped area, Hualien County
Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said Monday.</P>
      <P>The proposed site for the arts and culture park is near the coast where the Liwu
River feeds into the Pacific Ocean, said Fu as he unveiled the project with
playwright and director Stan Lai and architect Kris Yao.</P>
      <P>The proposed park will feature a theater whose rear wall can open for the
audience sitting on 800 rotating seats that will enable them to enjoy the
mountain and sea views surrounding the venue.</P>
      <P>Lai said the spectacular dual view inspired him to come up with the idea of
adding rotating seats to the proposed design.</P>
      <P>The park will be named after the town of Taroko roughly 10 kilometers away that
sits at the entrance of the mountain road leading to Taroko Gorge,  one of
Taiwan's best known tourist attractions that draws 6 million visitors a year, Fu
said.</P>
      <P>The park, which will likely take three and a half to four years to complete,
will be developed along green building principles, including the use of rain
catchment areas and solar power, Yao said.</P>
      <P>The project, budgeted at NT$3 billion, will have to go through an 18 months to
two year environment impact assessment process, said Hualien County tourism
director Chen Yu-chen.</P>
      <P>The county government cannot finance the project on its own and will have to
request funds from the central government and possibly even solicit investment
from private enterprises, Chen said.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on
Monday urged the government to establish a long-term care system for elderly
people in need of help.</P>
      <P>The appeal came after an 83-year-old man allegedly killed his wife, who was
suffering from Parkinson's disease, by driving a screwdriver into her skull with
a hammer.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Bi-ling, who concurrently serves as the DPP caucus secretary-
general, said the incident was a heart-wrenching tragedy that underscored the
need for the government to create a long-term care system for the elderly in
need of assistance.</P>
      <P>She recalled that the DPP began pushing for the development of a localized,
community-based long-term care system in 2002 when the party was in power.</P>
      <P>"The drive was suspended after the DPP lost power in 2008. We hope the current
Kuomintang (KMT) administration can devise a long-term care mechanism for the
elderly in need of help as soon as possible to prevent the recurrence of a
similar tragedy," Kuan said.</P>
      <P>She said the DPP was opposed to the KMT's idea of developing large-scale
institutions to look after elderly people in need of long-term care, preferring
community-based and small-sized facilities instead.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Chen Ting-fei said the tragedy could be attributed to Taiwan's
flawed and inadequate social security system, which has left many senior
citizens on their own without receiving the proper care.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's population aging, she said, the number of people aged 65 or over
now accounts for 10.5 percent of the total population, and the ratio will reach
14.5 percent in 2017 and 40 percent in 2060.</P>
      <P>The government should pay more attention to problems that an aging society tends
to face and figure out a response strategy as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Prosecutors Office said Monday it will collaborate with
coroners next week in performing an autopsy on the 80-year-old woman allegedly
killed by her husband of more than five decades.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said the octogenarian, identified as Wang Ching-hsi, was taken into
custody Sunday evening on a charge of homicide.</P>
      <P>The man told police by phone earlier that day that he had administered
euthanasia on his chronically ill wife according to an agreement they reached
more than a decade ago "to die in peace."</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that his wife was miserable because she had long suffered from
Parkinson's disease and had lately broken her left leg.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they will contact the couple's two sons in the United States in

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar extended its strength in Tuesday morning trading, rising
above NT$30.00 again, as investors ignored the central bank's latest measures to
limit foreign exchange derivative positions to slow down the pace of
appreciation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>At 11:45 a.m., the Taiwan dollar stood at NT$29.464 against the U.S. dollar,
compared with Monday's close of NT$30.425.</P>
      <P>The central bank announced on Monday that the ceiling on banks' holdings of
Taiwan dollar non-deliverable forwards and options would be lowered to 20
percent of their total positions, down from the previous one-third, effective
immediately.</P>
      <P>The central bank said the move was aimed at maintaining trading order in the
foreign exchange market and curbing market speculation.</P>
      <P>Despite the measures, demand for the Taiwan dollar remained strong, in
particular from exporters as the year comes to an end.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors also continued to move funds into the local
market, betting the local currency would continue to ride the wave of fund
inflows as the United States pumps money into the market to boost its economy.</P>
      <P>Expectations are high that the central bank will raise its key interest rates in
its quarterly policy-making meeting scheduled for Thursday, dealers said, and
higher local interest rates would also attract more foreign funds, they
believed.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the central bank was very likely to intervene in the local foreign
exchange market again in late trading to push the U.S. dollar back to the
NT$30.00 level against the Taiwan dollar, a level the market believes the
central bank can tolerate in the short term.</P>
      <P>Since the end of August, the Taiwan dollar has risen 5.22 percent against the
U.S. dollar based on closing prices, but by 8.1 percent if actual rates during
trading sessions or available at banks, which are now around NT$29.5 to the
greenback, are considered.</P>

      <P>A 83-year-old man made shocking headlines Monday after killing his chronically-
ill wife by pumping her with sedatives and then hammering a 15 centimeter screw
driver into her skull. The man, identified as retired engineer Wang Ching-hsi,
said the act was intended as a "mercy killing" to end his wife's suffering from
Parkinson's disease.</P>
      <P>The couple were in fact quite well off financially. We wonder about the lives of
families with similar problems but not similar financial means. Their stories
are not reported by the media, but they are probably leading a life that is
worse than death.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that there are more than 600,000 people who need long-term care
in Taiwan, 400,000 of whom are attended to by their own families. The figure
does not include unreported cases, and the problem is expected to worsen as
Taiwanese society grays rapidly in the coming decades.</P>
      <P>The latest tragedy provides food for thought for people and the government. This
is an ordeal that every "Mr. Wang" and "Mrs. Wang" might go through. Sufficient
social support should be provided to them to keep them company on this long,
long road. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>As part of efforts to conserve  energy and reduce carbon emissions, the central
government in recent years has been asking its employees to turn off any
unnecessary lights and not to wear suits to work so that less electricity for
air-conditioning would be required.</P>
      <P>However, it is doubtful whether this policy has been observed at the local
government level or in the private sector.</P>
      <P>In fact, the policy is often set aside whenever there is a festive occasion or
an election. As a result, the Mid-Autumn Festival has become a barbecue
festival, New Year's Eve a night for fireworks shows, and elections a season for
firecrackers.</P>
      <P>We have nothing against festive celebrations, but we believe the government's
policy should be consistent. Also, environmental groups should monitor local
governments efficiently and promote the concept of energy conservation and
carbon reduction in the private sector.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei-based China Life Insurance Co. announced Monday it would collaborate with
China Construction Bank Corp., China's second largest bank, to explore that
country's insurance market.</P>
      <P>China Life Chairman and CEO Alan Wang said at a news conference that the company
will pay 379 million yuan (US$57 million) to acquire a 19.9 percent stake in
Shanghai-based Pacific Antai Life Insurance Co., in which Construction Bank
controls a majority share of 51 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said the company has filed an application with the Financial Supervisory
Commission to gain approval of its China investment plan.</P>
      <P>If approved, it will be the first insurance-bank joint venture since Taiwan and
China signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in June to pave
the way for closer bilateral economic and financial ties.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the event:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Pacific Antai Life Insurance was established in Shanghai in 1998 by China
Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. and ING Group NV,  a Netherlands-based global
financial services company. It is the 12th largest of 28 insurance joint
ventures in China as measured by total assets.</P>
      <P>Construction Bank bought out ING's 50 percent stake in Pacific Antai a year ago.
As Pacific Insurance owned another life insurance company, it had to sell its 50
percent stake in Pacific Antai under Chinese regulations governing the insurance
business.</P>
      <P>Construction Bank decided to partner with Taiwan's China Life Insurance and
three other financial service providers to buy out Pacific Insurance's stake in
the company, which will be renamed CCB Life Insurance Co.</P>
      <P>After the company's management is restructured, Construction Bank will hold a 51
percent stake in CCB Life, China Life a 19.9 percent, and three other investors
the remaining 29.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang said the new insurance joint venture would be able to use Construction
Bank's 13,403 branches throughout China to sell its insurance policies and
expand its market penetration.</P>
      <P>No other Taiwanese insurers are expected to secure access to the retail networks
of big Chinese banks in the foreseeable future, Wang said, because the three
other biggest Chinese banks selling life insurance on a trial basis --
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Bank of
Beijing -- have already signed up partners to help them expand into the
business.</P>
      <P>If all goes well, Wang said, his company will be able to formally begin its
joint venture operations in China in the second quarter of next year. (Dec. 28,
2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan's life insurers opted to set up new life insurance
companies  in China  in collaboration  with Chinese enterprises.</P>
      <P>China Life chose a different path by teaming up with one of China's largest
state-owned commercial lenders to buy into an existing life insurance company.</P>
      <P>A China  Life  executive  said the company  believed  its "insurance-bank tie-
up" option would be far more effective in penetrating the vast Chinese insurance
market than the previous model of setting up new equal-share joint ventures with
Chinese partners.</P>
      <P>China's insurance market has been growing rapidly and has emerged as Asia's
second largest, behind only Japan's.</P>
      <P>Given its relatively low insurance penetration rate (the ratio of premiums to
GDP) of 2.3 percent, the executive said, China still has great potential for
insurance market growth. Taiwan's insurance penetration rate is 13.8 percent.

      <P>Taiwan-based China Life Insurance Co. said Tuesday that it expected its
acquisition of a stake in China-based Pacific Antai Life Insurance would be
completed in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>In the deal announced by China Life on Monday, the insurer will spend 379
million Chinese yuan (NT$1.78 billion) to buy a 19.9 percent stake in Pacific
Antai Life from China Pacific Insurance Co., while China Construction Bank Corp.
will raise its stake in the Chinese insurer to 51 percent from the current 50
percent.</P>
      <P>China Construction Bank bought the 50 percent stake it now holds from ING Group
NV a year ago.</P>
      <P>After the transaction, China Life, China Construction Bank and three unspecified
Chinese investors will jointly operate Pacific Antai Life, which will be renamed
CCB Life Insurance Co. It is expected to officially begin operations in the
second quarter.</P>
      <P>China Life said there was no need for it to raise funds separately to finance
the deal because it had sufficient cash on hand.</P>
      <P>The deal is pending regulatory approval from Taiwan and China, China Life said.</P>
      <P>China Life, one of Taiwan's five biggest life insurers, said the investment
represents a big step in its effort to expand its presence in China's fast
growing insurance market, after first opening a representative office in Beijing
in 2005.</P>
      <P>In making the investment, China Life said it hoped to capitalize on China
Construction Bank's extensive retail network of 13,000 branches and 278 million
customers to penetrate China's market.</P>
      <P>According to the local insurer, CCB Life is expected to rank among the top five
life insurers in China within five years and rise to the top three within 10
years.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.24 percent Tuesday on a mild correction from
the previous session, but ample funds helped to keep the market above the 8,800
point mark, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 21.55 points to 8,870.76, after moving between 8,839.83
and 8,919.26, on turnover of NT$101.34 billion (US$3.42 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.30 percent on follow-through buying and it briefly
breached the technical resistance of 8,900 points in early trade before profit
taking emerged to reverse the early gains, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,915 stocks closed down, 1,092 finished up and 368 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector encountered the heaviest pressure, ending down 1.4
percent. Textile stocks lost 0.9 percent, cement and financial shares fell 0.3
percent, and the machinery and electronic sector dropped 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The construction sector fell 0.1 percent, while the foodstuff and plastic and
chemical sectors closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>"With many foreign institutional investors remaining away from trading floor
ahead of the New Year holiday, the local bourse appeared quiet, moving in a
narrow range," Horizon Securities analyst Benson Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said a lackluster Wall Street overnight failed to provide any meaningful
indication to the local market.</P>
      <P>Selling focused on select old economy stocks, which have been significantly
boosted by a stronger New Taiwan dollar on hopes of an increase in domestic
asset value, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"For the rest of the year, the local market is expected to continue range trade,
" Huang said. "High liquidity is likely to shield the market from a major
pullback."</P>
      <P>In the paper and pulp sector, Taiwan Pulp &amp; Paper fell 1.93 percent to close
at NT$17.75 and Shihlin Paper lost 1.61 percent to end at NT$73.20.</P>
      <P>Among the high tech stocks, PC vendor Acer dropped 1.09 percent to NT$90.80,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A series of recent bullying incidents in schools has given rise to widespread
discussions of the issue in Taiwan, with most people agreeing that it is a
serious problem that requires stronger preventative measures.</P>
      <P>However, most of the opinions expressed have been from the standpoint of the
victims, with many people advocating that school bullies be punished and
expelled. Scant attention has been paid to the family background, personality
traits or motives of school bullies, who are often stigmatized.</P>
      <P>Bullies are also children who need education. If their deviant behaviors can be
corrected, there probably will be fewer crimes in society in the future. Giving
up on them too early would mean pushing more people over to the side of evil.</P>
      <P>To ensure that schools are a safe place for study, an effective mechanism for
reporting and dealing with bullying is required. If the bullying acts amount to
violations of the law, the police must be called in to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>The top priority now is to restore a safe school environment for our children.
But in the process of protecting students from being bullied, we must not give
up on the bullies. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 28, 2010)</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Tuesday, shedding NT$0.029 to
close at NT$30.396, off a low of NT$29.445 after the central bank's
intervention, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$657 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.435 and moved between NT$29.445 and NT$30.440
before the close.</P>
      <P>Soon after the market opened, the New Taiwan dollar rose above the NT$30.00 mark
again, although the central bank tightened the rules on derivative trade in the
local currency in a bid to curb market speculation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The central bank announced Monday that the ceiling on banks' holdings of Taiwan
dollar non-deliverable forwards and options would be lowered to 20 percent of
their total positions, down from one-third, effective immediately.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the New Taiwan dollar was boosted by further inflows of foreign
funds as traders were betting the local currency would continue to strengthen on
a strong rebound in the local economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar is expected to continue to gain against the U.S. dollar
also because the greenback is under downward pressure as the United States
injects funds into its market through treasury bond purchases to boost its
economy, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan central bank is widely expected to raise its key interest rates in
its quarterly policy meeting Thursday, which is likely to attract more foreign
funds, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A weaker U.S. dollar in the regional market spurred selling of the U.S. currency
in the local foreign exchange market, they said.</P>
      <P>In late trade, the central bank intervened to lift the value of the U.S. dollar
above to NT$30.00, a level the market believes the central bank can accept in
the short term, the dealers added.</P>

Tuesday on partnership in a wide range of services.</P>
      <P>Under the "comprehensive business cooperation" agreement, the two banks are

financing, project loans, syndication loans, interbank  lending,  risk
management  and loans for small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>

      <P>The MOU was signed in Beijing by the presidents of the two banks, Tsai Chiu-jung

      <P>In a statement, Taiwan Cooperative Bank noted that Bank of China is the most

will likely show growth of more than 10 percent this year on the back of a
recovering economy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's statistics bureau has forecast economic growth of 9.98 percent for this
year -- a 21-year high -- and has predicted growth of 4.51 percent in 2011, when
the global economy is expected to slow down.</P>
      <P>However, Shih said Tuesday that his ministry will work to boost the economic
growth in Taiwan to 5 percent for next year and he raised the forecast for this
year.</P>
      <P>"Various data show that there should be no problem achieving growth of over 10
percent this year," he said at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has set a "pragmatic" goal of
attracting US$7.4 billion worth of investments by foreign companies, US$120
million by Chinese businesses and NT$45 billion (US$1.5 billion) by overseas-

      <P>So far this year, the MOEA said, it has attracted US$7 billion, US$100 million

      <P>Total investments from these sources are expected to grow nearly 7 percent in
2011 compared to this year.</P>

reporters who he will choose as his running mate in the 2012 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Ma was asked if Vice President Vincent Siew will be his running mate again in
2012. The Ma-Siew pair won 7,659,000 votes in 2008, or 58 percent, to beat the
DPP ticket of Frank Hsieh and Su Tseng-chang, who garnered 5,445,000 ballots, or
42 percent of the popular vote.</P>
      <P>Ma said Siew has been a great help to him over the past two years but added that
it is premature to talk about his running mate in his 2012 re-election bid.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has also not nominated either
a presidential candidate or legislative candidates for the quadrennial battle
for power.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which won more votes but fewer mayoral seats than the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) during the Nov. 27 special municipality elections, will hold a special
plenary session Jan. 22 to discuss party rules for the nominations, DPP
Legislator Huang Wei-cher said.</P>
      <P>A  local  newspaper  reported  that  same  day  that  DPP Secretary-General Su
Jia-chyuan said during an internal meeting of the party a day earlier that
nominations for the presidential and legislative elections should be completed
by March.</P>
      <P>An issue being hotly debated inside the DPP is whether to hold a nationwide
survey to help decide the party's nominees for president and vice president.</P>
      <P>Party insiders told CNA that the party's leaders have nearly reached a consensus
on using a national poll result as a major buttress for naming the presidential
candidate, but that members are split over the question of what percentage of
the public poll versus the party vote should be used as a basis.</P>
      <P>Since the nomination rules will not be set until after Jan. 22, which will be
followed by the Lunar New Year holiday in early February, Huang said the process
of electing the candidates will probably not be launched until March.</P>
      <P>Possible names being circulated for the DPP hopefuls include DPP Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen and Su Tseng-chang, a former premier and DPP chairman, both of whom were
defeated in the municipality elections.</P>

      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) said Tuesday that as part of its fourth
anniversary celebrations it will launch a charity event to raise funds for
school children who cannot afford to pay tuition.</P>
      <P>Working with the Christian charity World Vision Taiwan for the second
consecutive year, the THSR said, it hopes to help at least 45,000 impoverished
students in Taiwan to attend school in 2011.</P>
      <P>The campaign last year raised NT$7.89 million (US$268,000), which was disbursed
to 3,157 students, according to the company.</P>
      <P>The fundraising campaign is part of the company's efforts to address social
welfare issues, THSR said.</P>
      <P>In July, THSR donated 1,000 train tickets to college volunteers involved in
community services.</P>
      <P>"We want to use our 'high speed' ability to deliver timely help to those in
need, " said the THSR Chairman Ou Chin-der.</P>
      <P>THSR said that during the fundraising campaign from Jan. 1 to March 6, 2011,
donations can be made onboard its trains or on the World Vision Taiwan website

      <P>Taiwanese artist Ju Ming,  who is internationally known for his sculpture,
debuted his latest work titled "Cube" Tuesday at the National Theater, a work he
says has less to do with aesthetics and more to do with problems he sees in
society.</P>
      <P>The work, consisting of two hexagonal pieces, is a 265-cm tall sculpture that
features a human head at the center of a large cube. Inside the head is another
cube where the brain should be. Another work shows a human, with arms and legs
wide open, locked in a giant cube.</P>
      <P>"This is not a work of art or sculpture. Rather, it is about my discovery -- it
is about humankind creating the cube, and is framed within it," he said at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>The 72-year-old told reporters that even though his family was too poor to allow
him an education, he has had an immense interest in science sine he was very
young and has always had the habit of observing the relationship between people
and Mother Nature.</P>
      <P>The idea was born when he was watching a TV program introducing bacteria and
cells and it suddenly struck him that the shape of a cube does not really exist
in nature but was invented by humans.</P>
      <P>One can see cubes everywhere in the city, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"Cubes bring limitation and distance among people, and the longer a person is
trapped in a cube, the more likely his thoughts will change in a bad way, " he
said, adding that the reason people living in the city get irritated easily is
probably linked to the fact that they live in a closed, cubical environment.</P>
      <P>The two pieces will remain on display at the National Theater from until Jan.

      <P>The non-fiction work titled "Seven Days in Heaven" has been selected as one of
the 10 most influential books in Taiwan of 2010 by the Kingstone Bookstore, the
Taipei-based chain bookstore said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The book, which in its manuscript form won first prize in the Lin Rung San
Literary Awards in 2006, features a Taiwanese funeral ceremony,  through which
the author,  Essay Liu, tells how a collectivism-dominated society can strongly
bind an individual, Kingstone commented.</P>
      <P>Liu has also revised her book into a screenplay to show her experience of death
and local funeral rites on the big screen.</P>
      <P>The film, which bears the same title as the book, made its debut in Taiwan in
August and won the 2010 Golden Horse Film Award in November for best screenplay
adaptation.</P>
      <P>The annual top-10 influential books are selected through a poll conducted by the
bookstore among publishers, authors, readers, media outlets and managers of its
chain stores around the country.</P>
      <P>In addition to the books of the year, Kingstone has also awarded Linden Lin, the
publisher of the Taipei-based Linking Publishing Co., and Chiang Hsun, a
painter, poet and writer, as "men of the year" in the publishing sector.</P>
      <P>Lin was cited for introducing Latin American literature to local readers and
publishing works of the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa. Llosa is winner of
the Nobel Prize in literature in 2010.</P>
      <P>Chiang, meanwhile, was awarded due to his concentration on creation, which
encourages readers to raise their levels of thinking, Kingstone said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese people's overall impression of the people of South Korea has turned
sour after two recent international incidents, with over half of Taiwanese
respondents to a recent survey agreeing to boycott Korean products, according to
the results of the survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A high of 65.6 percent of the Taiwanese citizens responding to the poll
conducted by Global Views Magazine (GVM) now hold negative attitudes toward
Koreans after Taiwanese taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun was disqualified from
the 2010 Asian Games and Samsung Electronics' blew the whistle on Taiwanese flat
panel makers' price-fixing to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The GVM poll, conducted a week earlier, found that Taiwanese people aged between
40-49 have changed their attitudes toward South Koreans most negatively,
followed by those in the 30-39 age group. Those in the 15-19 age group showed
little change in their attitudes toward the Koreans, despite the two incidents.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the two incidents, 51.1 percent of the respondents said they will
reduce their purchases of Korean products and 50.1 percent said they will not
visit South Korea.</P>
      <P>Another 40.7 percent said they will spend less time watching Korean soap operas
and 38 percent said they will listen to fewer Korean pop songs.</P>
      <P>Of those in the 40-49 age group, 63.7 percent said they will cut their purchases
of Korean goods, the survey found.</P>
      <P>On Yang's controversial disqualification, 52.1 percent of the respondents said
they are not satisfied with the way the government has handled the case, while
27.9 percent said they are satisfied with the government's treatment of the

one of the major countdown concerts in Taipei, Mayor Hau Lung-bin announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese that have performed well in different fields such as sports and the
arts will attend the New Year's Eve celebration in front of Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>Taekwondo athlete Yang Shu-chun, ultramarathon runner Tommy Chen and a tug-of-

moments, as well as a baseball team from Chongqing Junior High School and Hsiao

      <P>The move is to express appreciation for their efforts in bringing "glory to

Hau after a municipal meeting.</P>
      <P>The concert features a 3D stage and a huge LED screen, said to be the world's

      <P>The  controversy  over  embedded advertisements disguised as television programs
or news reports prompted Premier Wu Den-yih to promise Tuesday that the
government will do its best to stop the practice.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters, Wu said propaganda is essential for many, such as
candidates, political parties, governments and companies. The important thing,
however, is to make a clear distinction to the audience between advertising and
news.</P>
      <P>The debate on product placement and "advertorials" as the ads masquerading as
news are known, have become a hot topic in Taiwan in the last few weeks after a
former reporter wrote in his blog about the growing trend of the government
buying news coverage.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the National  Communications  Commission,  an independent media
regulator, last week decided not to renew the broadcasting license of a local
cable TV channel on the grounds that it used excessive product placement and
refused to take corrective action.</P>
      <P>The incidents have stirred up heated debate among scholars and politicians on
the role of government in regulating the media and the proper way of marketing
government policies.</P>
      <P>While President Ma Ying-jeou and the premier have shied away from making any
direct comments on the incidents, both have promised that the government will
root out the practice in its own policy promotion.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the use of embedded advertising to further government interests
started a decade ago under the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"An upstanding policy should be presented in an upstanding and open manner.
There is no need to disguise it as news. The problem has been accumulating for
10 years and now that the Kuomintang is back in power, we regret that in the
past two years we have not solved the problems," he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has already had discussions with the president on how to come up with
comprehensive measures to curb the practice and has also instructed the
Government Information Office to monitor the way the government does its
marketing.</P>
      <P>However, Wu was non-committal when asked if the government plans to enact an
anti-product placement or anti-advertorial law, saying that would be the
Legislative Yuan's prerogative.</P>

      <P>Keith Lin of Taiwan has been selected to design the costumes for an edition of
the French play "La Dame aux Camelias" that will be staged in Taiwan next
February.</P>
      <P>Lin was chosen from among a handful of competitors to design more than 30
costumes for a version of the play that will be directed by the famous Tadashi
Suzuki of Japan and produced by the National Theatre and Concert Hall (NTCH),
said Sylvia Chuang of the NTCH's program and marketing department.</P>
      <P>At a press conference Tuesday, Lin said he was very nervous when he first met
with Suzuki in Japan but the director was kind and advised him to look for
inspiration in the two films "My Heart Will Go On" and "Sin City."</P>
      <P>"Suzuki gave me a lot of freedom to design the costumes," Lin said. "While he
wants to present the original story written by French novelist Alexandre Dumas,
he is looking for something more futuristic in the costumes."</P>
      <P>The designer said the 30 costumes will portray a fusion of Gothic style, punk
and elements of Chinese skirts. The actresses will wear gray and silver make-up
to symbolize their concealment of their true feelings from the rest of the
world, he added.</P>

      <P>China's persecution of Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo has upset the people
of Hong Kong, lowering their confidence in the "one country, two systems"
arrangement, and in particular, damaging their trust in the Beijing regime,
according to a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The University of Hong Kong conducted the poll among a sampling of 1,000 adults
in Hong Kong in mid-December, soon after the Nobel Peace Prize Committee awarded
the prize to an empty chair because neither Liu nor his family were allowed to
attend the ceremony in Oslo, Norway on Dec. 10.</P>
      <P>The survey found that Hong Kong residents' distrust of Beijing has risen sharply
by 10 percent since the last such poll in September.</P>
      <P>The main reason, according to analysts of the poll, was the Chinese authorities'
imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo and the parents of children who had died from the
consumption of toxic powdered milk.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 32 percent of Hong Kong residents do not trust Beijing,
while 37 percent still have trust, 5 percent less than in the September poll.</P>
      <P>Beijing's handling of the Peace Prize issue has also affected the Hong Kong
people's trust in the Hong Kong government, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>Some 44 percent said they trust the local government, 9 percent lower than in
the previous poll, while 22 percent said they do not trust it, an increase of 6
percent.</P>
      <P>The latest survey further indicated that 62 percent of the people are confident
about Hong Kong's future, a drop of 7 percent from three months ago.</P>
      <P>The percentage of respondents  who said they do not have confidence in the
territory's future rose by 7 percent from three months ago to 30 percent in the
latest poll.</P>
      <P>As for the future of China, 77 percent of Hong Kong people still have
confidence, a drop of 4 percent, while 15 percent said they do not have
confidence in the future of the country, up 2 percent from the previous survey,
the poll showed.</P>
      <P>On their views on the "one country, two systems" arrangement between Hong Kong
and China, 61 percent of the respondents said they were confident, a decline of
1 percent, while 32 percent said they have no confidence in the arrangement, an
increase of 3 percent from September.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that a 17th round of fishery
talks with Japan will most likely take place next year after a one-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press briefing, Association of East Asian Relations
Secretary-General Huang Ming-lung said that Taipei and Tokyo have established a
"tacit understanding" that the long-stalled bilateral fishery talks will be held
in 2011.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and Japan enjoy a stable partnership in various realms such as
trade, culture and trade, conflicts over the East China Sea fishing grounds
remain a major flashpoint between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The bilateral fishery talks mechanism was initiated in 1996, but talks were
suspended for three-and-a-half years in 2005 after the 15th round of talks in
Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The talks resumed in February 2009 in Taipei, during which the two sides agreed
to set up an emergency communication channel and allow two organizations to act
as contact windows on behalf of their respective governments.</P>
      <P>In December 2009, the Fisheries Administration announced that Taiwan had forged
an agreement with Japan to allow inspectors from both sides to conduct on-board
inspections of each other's vessels.</P>
      <P>In other news concerning Japan that day,  Huang said the government will
continue to fight for compensation from the Japanese government on behalf of
Taiwanese women who were forced into sexual servitude, euphemistically described
as "comfort women, " for the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II.</P>
      <P>In 2008, the Legislative Yuan passed a bill seeking proper compensation from the
Japanese government for the surviving Taiwanese comfort women.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are 13 surviving Taiwanese former comfort women. According to
the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation, approximately 500,000 women from Taiwan,
the Philippines, China and various other countries, were forced into becoming
sex slaves by the Japanese.</P>

      <P>losses in Taiwan resulting from the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 has led
to the drawing up of a law specifically designed to protect investors in
financial products.</P>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) submitted its draft proposal to the
Cabinet Dec. 14 for review, after which it will be sent to the legislature.</P>
      <P>The proposal has gained support from lawmakers, as the Legislative Yuan's
Finance Committee has said it will speed up the legislative process so that it
can be passed quickly.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, not being fully informed about potential investment risk and
difficulty in seeking compensation from banks for losses are common complaints
related to retail banking deals and the proposed new legislation would impose
strict liability on financial institutes.</P>
      <P>Additionally, an organization to handle the arbitration of disputes will be set
up, the compensation rulings of which will be binding under a certain amount,
said FSC Chairman Chen Yuh-chang.</P>
      <P>Lawyer Lin Jui-yang said that once the law is passed, businesses in the
financial industry will be held liable for customer investment losses if it is
decided that the risks were not fully explained beforehand.</P>
      <P>The burden of proof will fall on the businesses if the case is brought to court,
Lin added.</P>
      <P>One bank executive said banks will have to change their current marketing
approach that "promises no loss, " since no investment is without risk.</P>
      <P>The majority of consumers complain that banks use complicated structures that
require depositors to enter into a trust relationship with the banks, which
promise total returns of initial funds. In the event, however, such total
returns are rarely seen.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chen said, the commission will implement new regulations to
enhance the management of banks' financial advisers that will require them to
register with the country's  Trust Association.</P>
      <P>In terms of another concern of lawmakers that banks at present can deny
responsibility by blaming the financial planners they employ to advise their
clients, Chen said the bank and its employees will both be responsible in such
disputes.</P>
      <P>This might be seen as banks' wealth management business being subject to more
restrictions in the future, but the banks have actually brought it on themselves
because of their inexorable pursuit of profit.</P>
      <P>During the financial crisis that began in 2008, some banks have instructed their
financial advisers to encourage clients to take out money in deposits to invest
in structured notes or derivatives, which have later incurred great losses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the authorities Tuesday to root out campus
bullies and deal with them quickly and decisively, without fear of exposing any
"skeletons in the closet."</P>
      <P>During a year-end meeting with the media, the president compared campus bullying
to corruption in officialdom, which he said must be fearlessly disclosed.</P>
      <P>Ma put forth four suggestions regarding the growing incidence of campus
bullying: School administrators must take the initiative to identify the
bullies; such incidents must be tackled quickly and decisively;  suspects must
be prosecuted  if crimes have been committed; and such incidents must be
reported to society.</P>
      <P>He particularly advised school authorities "not to delay, hide or cover up"
bullying.</P>
      <P>The president, a former law scholar and justice minister, said it might not be
easy for teachers to decide if criminal acts have been committed in a bullying
case, so "they have to increase their legal knowledge and let their charges
know."</P>
      <P>He cited recent news stories about Bade Junior High School in northern Taiwan's
Taoyuan County, in which students are suspected of detonating firecrackers in a
toilet being used by a teacher. There are also reports of students locking up
classmates in the washrooms.</P>
      <P>Were these actions just mischief, deserving of discipline by the school
authorities, or criminal acts? he asked.</P>
      <P>Ma said some social norms are simple "courtesy, " some are required under school
rules and some are "moral" codes of conduct, while others are better defined
under the criminal code.</P>
      <P>"Kids need to be taught to tell the differences among these areas," he said.</P>
      <P>Outside of the norms of social conduct, he went on, teachers should pay more
attention to what is actually happening in the class under their care.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was told by Education Minister Wu Ching-ji and Interior Minister
Jiang Yi-huah that a mechanism is in place for schools and the police to work
together on campus bullying, although not all schools report such cases to the
police.</P>
      <P>Yuan Tseh Lee, a former president of Academia Sinica, expressed concern about
the development of education in Taiwan in the face of so many reports of campus
bullying and controversial acts by university students.</P>
      <P>In addition to the series of campus bullying incidents, Lee's worry was also
caused by reports that a graduate school student flashed his middle finger at an
ambulance while it was trying to provide emergency assistance to a patient in
danger.</P>
      <P>A former leader of an educational reform task force, Lee said the current system
just teaches students to try to get good scores by writing the "correct and
standard" answers in exams.</P>
      <P>Many things need to be examined, such as moral education, interpersonal
relationships, and interaction among family members, he said.</P>
      <P>"Education must be reformed continuously," he said.</P>

      <P>A team of community rangers was formed Tuesday to help protect wetland areas
around the Shueiwaku community, the second ecotourism attraction of its kind
near Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The community worked with the park's headquarters to set up a ranger team to
investigate and monitor the ecosystem of the two wetlands in the area and to
prevent illegal activities there, said Chen Mei-hui, a Pingtung University of
Science and Technology associate professor who directed the ecotourism
development project.</P>
      <P>The wetlands were abundant in frogs some 20 years ago, as well as butterflies
and fireflies.</P>
      <P>However, the construction of the Erchia Highway in 1979 and later human
development caused the water to dry up, leading to a decrease in wildlife.</P>
      <P>The park began last May to promote ecotourism in Shueiwaku -- about four
kilometers north of Erluanbi -- to restore the wetland ecosystem while helping
boost the local economy, Chen said.</P>
      <P>It also trained the residents as tour guides and taught them how to conserve the
environment.</P>
      <P>The community, with a population of 200, is the second successful example of
ecotourism in the area after a village between Shedin Park and the Kenting
Forest Recreation Area implemented  a similar initiative in 2008.</P>

      <P>The number of influenza A(H1N1) infections in Taiwan might reach peak in mid-
January as the virus is likely to make a comeback this winter, a pediatrician
warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Using the medical history in Taiwan over the past five years as evidence, Huang
Li-min, a pediatrician at National Taiwan University Hospital, said the strains
that cause a major flu outbreak in a given area will stay for two consecutive
years.</P>
      <P>Besides, he forecast, the A(H1N1) onslaught will recur this year since most of
the people who contracted the disease or were inoculated against the virus last
year will have no antibodies or immunity strong enough to combat a new attack.</P>
      <P>This year, few children in Taiwan have acquired immunity against all three major
types of flu viruses -- A(H1N1), A/H3 and influenza B.</P>
      <P>The cases of A(H1N1) and influenza B infections have been rising over the past
week and the two types of viruses are expected to be mainstay of flu infections
in the country by the middle of 2011, Huang estimated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the countries hit by the H1N1 flu virus in 2009. More than 800
people in Taiwan were hospitalized with H1N1 symptoms, 35 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control, 11.33 percent of the people who checked into emergency rooms
around Taiwan over the past week were admitted because of flu infections and
1.27 percent of Taiwan's outpatients in the same period were flu patients.</P>
      <P>Of these patients, 60 percent were infected with A(H1NI) and 30 percent had
influenza B, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also reported one more influenza death last week, he said. The case was a
62-year-old man from China who had never been inoculated and who came down with
flu symptoms after arriving in Taiwan for sightseeing. The man died next day
after checking into a local hospital. He tested positive for A(H1N1), according
to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih suggested that Taiwanese tourists get themselves inoculated before
traveling abroad, as A(H1N1) outbreaks have also been reported in Europe, the
United States, Japan and the United Kingdom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma challenges DPP head to accept '92 consensus'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou challenged Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen Tuesday to accept the "1992 consensus" between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP were to become the ruling party one day, I wonder if Tsai would have
her DPP administration continue the Kuomintang's existing policy (toward
China)," Ma said at a year-end gathering with reporters.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement reached between Taiwan and
China in 1992 that "there is only one China, but Taipei and Beijing are free to
interpret 'one China' as they see fit."</P>
      <P>The term "1992 consensus" was coined in 2000 by then Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Su Chi to summarize the tacit agreement, which has been serving as the
basis for Taiwan-China negotiations since 2008 when President Ma took office.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led opposition camp has refused to accept the 1992 consensus on the
grounds that it could result in China's annexation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during a meeting with former President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP in
April 2006, he had suggested that the government accept the consensus in order
to resume the suspended cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>"After a two-hour discussion, Chen promised to recognize the consensus if China
did so first," Ma said</P>
      <P>Ma said that in a phone call to former U.S. President George W. Bush on March
26, 2008, Chinese President Hu Jintao indicated a willingness to reopen cross-
strait talks on the basis of the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Li Yafei, Vice President of the Beijing-based Associations for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , has said that the 1992 consensus
refers to "both sides each orally interpreting their own concept of 'one China'
principle, " Ma noted.</P>
      <P>ARATS  and its Taiwan  counterpart,  the Straits  Exchange Foundation, are the
semi-official organizations authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>"It would be impractical for the DPP to continue to deny the existence of the
consensus, " Ma said.</P>

      <P>The annual ridership of the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system is expected
to top 500 million passengers Wednesday, marking a new page in Taiwan's MRT
services since the system's inception in 1996, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp.
(TRTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As of the previous day, the Taipei MRT system posted a ridership total of 498
million passengers this year, a number expected to top the 500 million mark Dec.
29, according to the TRTC, operator of the MRT.</P>
      <P>Expanding from one route in its inaugural year in March 1996, the Taipei MRT
system now encompasses 10 routes connecting most districts and townships in the
greater Taipei area, with 93 stations and a service length exceeding 100 km,
according to the TRTC.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of routes, the system's daily ridership has continued to hit
new highs. The average daily ridership exceeded 1.57 million in November and the
figure surged to a record high of 1.86 million Dec. 24, the company said.</P>
      <P>Once the system's annual ridership exceeds 500 million, the Taipei MRT will be
able to enter the Nova International Railway Benchmarking Group and the
Community of Metros (Nova/CoMET) as a CoMET member, qualifying Taipei to conduct
metro technical exchanges with major cities in the world such as London, New
York, Paris and Moscow.</P>
      <P>At present, the Taipei MRT system is a member of Nova, membership of which
requires an annual ridership of under 500 million, according to the TRTC.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's air accident rate has been falling in recent years and if the trend
continues, will drop to the global average level within three years, an aviation
safety official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-hern, chairman of the Council for Aviation Safety (CAS), told a press
conference that there were four aviation accidents in Taiwan this year as the
country's 10-year record continues to fall.</P>
      <P>From 2000 to 2009, Taiwan registered 1.82 air accidents per million take-offs,
higher than the world average of 1.02, he said. "If the current rate can be
maintained, by 2013, our record will have dropped to the world average level of
0.61," he added.</P>
      <P>Council figures show that prior to 2008, Taiwan's 10-year accident record was
above two per million takeoffs. The decade of 1993-2002 saw the highest record
of 3.52, followed by 2.82 for 1994-2003, 2.69 for 1998-2007 and 2.26 for
1999-2008.</P>
      <P>By 2001-2010, the record had fallen to 1.82, the same as 2000-2009, according to
the CAS under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The council said it expects Taiwan's aviation accident rate to continue to fall
to 1.21 for 2003-2012 and to 0.61 for 2004-1013, on par with the world average.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed at a third reading Tuesday a special budget plan for
an infrastructure expansion and economic stimulus package worth NT$158.94
billion (US$5.3 billion) for 2011.</P>
      <P>After land requisition costs are deducted, the spending plan is expected to fuel
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.88 percent for 2011 and generate
more than 50,000 jobs, said Christina Liu, minister of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Also in the resolution, the legislators pointed out that nearly 50 percent of
the public works projects planned under an earlier infrastructure expansion and
economic stimulus package worth over NT$170 billion have not been carried out
over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The legislators therefore demanded that the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission under the Executive Yuan list the execution rate of its special
budgets as an index to gauge the performances of ministerial-level officials.</P>
      <P>Because of a low execution rate of only 5.23 percent posted by the Construction
and Planning Administration for city makeover and industrial zone renewal in
2010, the legislature resolved to freeze 20 percent of the budget for the same
project for the new year.</P>
      <P>The legislators also warned the Ministry of Education (MOE) about the low
execution rate of 34.52 percent in efforts to protect the education
opportunities of youths from disadvantaged families in 2010 and they told the
MOE to come up with a more detailed plan on those efforts for the new year.</P>

      <P>Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest skyscrapers, will feature a 288-second
fireworks display designed by renowned Chinese artist Cai Guo-qiang to mark the
turn of the new year, the organizer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press briefing, Cai described the Taipei 101 building as "a huge
stage" on which he will feature 15 different types of fireworks.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old said he will "turn the building into a red lantern, a waterfall,
a pagoda and a rocket" during the New Year's Eve display.</P>
      <P>There will also be a "big flower" on the skyscraper, after which a "golden
Chinese dragon" will climb up the building, according to the designer.</P>
      <P>"I have tried to include natural and folk custom elements (in my presentation),"
he said.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that there will be "Chinese  characters" appearing in the sky
to reflect the common voice of the public, but he declined to elaborate on what
the characters will be.</P>
      <P>The show will end with "flare bomb" fireworks.</P>
      <P>"These bombs, one after another, will turn the night sky into day. When the sky
returns to dark again, I hope it will create a sentimental atmosphere," Cai
said.</P>
      <P>Cai was the chief fireworks designer for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC) summit in Shanghai in 2001 and a chief visual effects designer for
the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>This year's show will also mark the 100th founding anniversary of the Republic
of China, the Taipei Financial Center Corp., owner of the skyscraper, pointed
out.</P>
      <P>As a result, the fireworks will also show "100" in the sky, the result of one of
the world's top fireworks technologies, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>Various buildings and 18 schools around Taipei 101 will also set off fireworks

      <P>Taiwan has developed a technology to retrieve information from damaged chips in
the global positioning systems (GPS) used by helicopters and other vehicles,
which has been provided to Japan, the Council for Aviation Safety (CAS) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuan Wen-lin, CAS laboratory director, briefed the media on the use of the
technology, noting that Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) sought the
council's help in September to help determine the cause of a helicopter crash.</P>
      <P>The council used the technology to read the information in the Japanese
helicopter's GPS and discovered that it was caught in a heavy fog and crashed
into a mountain, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Chip makers usually are unable to retrieve information from chips that have been
burned, soaked or broken in an accident. Chang's lab, however, uses reverse
engineering to "rebuild" the data on the damaged chips.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with GPS manufacturers, the lab last year designed a device that
can "read" the retrieved data, he noted.</P>
      <P>Kuan presented a paper on the lab's research and the new device at an
international meeting of aviation accident investigators earlier this year,
winning an award for best paper.</P>
      <P>The device was first used to help investigate an accident in Chiayi, southern
Taiwan, in May last year. In August, 2009, the device was again used to read
information from a damaged GPS aboard a helicopter on a rescue mission after a
typhoon.</P>
      <P>Most helicopters and super-light aircraft are not equipped with the "black
boxes" -- flight data recorders -- that are installed on larger aircraft, but
instead have GPS, which records flight times, positions, directions and
velocities, which can be used to help determine the causes of an accident.</P>

      <P>Personal computer vendor Asustek Computer Inc. said Tuesday it expects total
smartphone shipments in Taiwan to grow 50 percent next year, with the company
launching its first own-brand smartphone following a split with Garmin, the No.
1 U.S. maker of personal navigation devices.</P>
      <P>In 2010, smartphones in Taiwan accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of total
mobile phone shipments, lower than the 50 percent in the United States, said
Benson Lin, general manager of Asustek's personal mobile devices unit, at a
product launch conference for the A50, its new Android-based phone.</P>
      <P>Lin said the smartphone penetration rate in Taiwan will surpass that of the U.S.
market and grow to 50 percent-60 percent next year, representing an increase of
50 percent in total smartphone shipments.</P>
      <P>In October, Asustek, which had been selling smartphones under the Garmin-Asus
brand since early 2009, said it would not introduce new co-branded handset
models in the future, but the company will keep using Garmin's navigation
software on its Android-based smartphones such as the A50 for the next few
years.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects shipments of the 3.5-inch A50 to exceed 25,000 units in
Taiwan in 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Far  EasTone  Telecommunications  Co.,  Taiwan's third-largest
telecom operator, forecast a 40 percent growth in smartphone shipments in the
local market in 2011.</P>
      <P>"Even though more than 50 tablet computers are expected to be launched in the
global market next year, prices have not yet decreased to the level of
NT$6,000-7,000 (US$203-237) that will be generally accepted by Taiwanese
consumers. Therefore, there will still be great demand for smartphones, " Far
EasTone President Yvonne Li said at a press conference to introduce new
applications in its online software store.</P>
      <P>Li also noted that the 2010 total shipments of mobile phones in Taiwan is
forecast to reach 7.2 million units, a number that will increase 5 percent to 10
percent next year.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will study law revisions to restrict embedded advertisements
disguised as television programs or news reports, according to a consensus
reached at a high-level meeting Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Participants  at the meeting said the Executive Yuan will immediately embark on
amending the law so that government agencies will no longer be able to buy news
coverage or engage in embedded advertising containing political messages.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus has agreed to work toward
such legislation.</P>
      <P>Until the law is amended, government agencies are required to "practice self-
discipline, " according to the participants, who included Liao Liou-yi, Lin
Join-sane, and King Pu-tsung, secretaries- general of the Presidential Office,
the Executive Yuan and the KMT, respectively, as well as Lin Yi-shih, director
of the KMT's Central Policy Committee and Lin Tsang-min, KMT legislative whip.</P>
      <P>The spokesmen of the Presidential Office, Government Information Office and KMT
-- -Lo Chih-chiang, Johnny Chiang and Su Jun-pin, respectively -- were also
present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) reached
an initial agreement on a proposal that ads publicizing government policies
should not appear on news pages in the form of embedded advertisements.</P>
      <P>Rather, they should be clearly marked as "advertisements."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus proposed that all government agencies while
publicizing their policies should make a distinction between such ads and real
news, and that such ads should not appear as embedded advertisement in the form
of seminars or special reports.</P>
      <P>In addition, they should be clearly marked as policy promotions or
advertisements and the name of the government agencies placing the ad should
also be clearly shown.</P>
      <P>The debate on embedded advertisements has become a hot topic after a former
reporter wrote in his blog about the growing trend of the government to buy news
coverage and a recent decision by the National Communications Commission to not
to renew a licence for a TV channel accused of multiple violations in this

      <P>Negotiations between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition  camps on reforming
the national health insurance (NHI) system broke down Tuesday, creating concern
that the legislation will not be completed this week and that a showdown will be
needed to push the bill through the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)  renewed discussions on the disputed bill to bail out
the cash-strapped NHI program, but the basic stance of each party made it
difficult for them to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus insists on calculating NHI premiums based on household income,
while the KMT caucus's modified version proposes collecting premiums based on
individual income, as is the case at present, along with additional "supplement
premiums" -- premiums to be collected from income on dividends and bonuses.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the KMT for holding back from its original plan to adopt a fairer
system based on household income rather than the existing individual income, the
DPP caucus demanded the Department of Health (DOH) calculate premiums based on
household income next week and to publish its calculations.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the DPP's legislative caucus convener, accused the KMT and the
DOH of having failed to hold substantial negotiations on the bill with the DPP.</P>
      <P>"The DOH has since last week failed to present us with its calculation results
based on household income, " he said, adding that "the DOH's attempts to return
to the first-generation NHI format mean that the long-term effort to build a
fairer NHI system has come to an end."</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT caucus whip, said the KMT will definitely seek to get the
second-generation health insurance bill through the legislature before the
current session ends by the end of January.</P>
      <P>According to DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, if the proposed supplement premium
could be included under the current NHI system to keep its current financial
shortfall of NT$60.4 billion (US$2 billion) from worsening, a regular premium of
6 percent will need to be imposed to keep the system operating for two or three
years.</P>
      <P>"As the KMT's and the DPP's versions vary widely, it will be almost impossible
to have the second-generation national health bill clear the Legislative Yuan in
the next legislative meeting slated for Dec. 31," he said.</P>
      <P>"A vote showdown will be unavoidable in a Jan. 4 legislative meeting if the two
parties are unable to forge a consensus through negotiations by the end of this
month," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>The bill has failed to pass the Legislative Yuan since early December, with
issues related to the premium base, premium scope and the premium rate being the
focus of the row. The two parties have each come up with major changes to the
bill in a bid to gain greater popular support and have their own version rammed
through the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's emissions trading platform set to be completed soon: EPA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first government-recognized carbon emissions trading platform is slowly
becoming a reality,  the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) said
Tuesday, although it did not give a definite timetable.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shen said carbon trading is becoming a global trend, as the
international community is seeking various ways to reduce greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>As an industrial country, Taiwan must not be absent from this movement, he said.</P>
      <P>Emissions trading is a mechanism to encourage companies or countries to go green
by using economic incentives. Also known as "cap and trade," under the scheme,
participants are allowed a certain quota of emissions. When a big polluter maxes
out on its allotted level, it can purchase the unused quota from another firm.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, the establishment of a domestic carbon trading platform
will be divided into three phases but so far, only phase one has been completed,
with the next phase estimated to be completed only after December next year.</P>
      <P>Phase one includes an online registry through which the buyer and the vendor can
find out more information about each other. The second phase will allow the
registered companies to bid on allotted quotas.</P>
      <P>The third phase will allow participants to buy quotas beforehand if it foresees
the need for a bigger allotment in the future, said Shen.</P>
      <P>The EPA said the platform will contain information on the emission levels of
over 300 domestic factories and plants. It will also be the second platform of
its kind to be established in Asia following one in Japan.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, six car makers, including BMW, Ford, Honda Taiwan, China
Motor Corp., Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz signed an agreement with the EPA
promising to import low-emission cars for domestic consumers.</P>
      <P>The goal of the agreement is to cut the country's carbon dioxide emissions by 10
percent to 15 percent by 2015.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih recently applauded the country's carbon reduction efforts,
saying that overall, Taiwan emitted 5.14 million metric tons of greenhouse gases
less than last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Pact,  a binding international agreement
under the United Nations to fight climate change, but despite this, the
government earlier this year set a goal of cutting back carbon emissions by 84
million metric tons by 2020. It is hoped that in 10 years, the country's
emissions will be the same as 2005 levels.</P>

that the photos be put on display.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei-jen praised the agency for the work it has done to preserve news photos
dating as far back to 1924.</P>
      <P>"These photographs are extremely valuable because they bear witness to history,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Just by browsing through the CNA archives, one can gain deep insight into the
harsh times that prevailed during the establishment and development the Republic
of China, he said.</P>
      <P>"One photo is worth a thousand words," he said.</P>
      <P>Hu said he was especially touched to see a picture of his father, the late
General Hu Tsung-nan, in full military dress standing next to then President
Chiang Kai-shek during the war of resistance against Japanese invasion.</P>
      <P>"I don't think even I have these photos," he said.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the CNA to collaborate with the Ministry of National Defense,  the

      <P>Local hardware manufacturer Micro-Star International Co. (MSI) unveiled its
first tablet computer Tuesday amid company plans to launch three to four more
similar devices in the first half of 2011.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 units of The WindPad 100W, with a 10.1-inch screen and Windows 7
operating system, has been ordered by a telecom operator in Japan, and the model
is slated to be shipped worldwide in January, MSI President Joseph Hsu said at
the company's product launch.</P>
      <P>"We will begin sales of the WindPad 100W in the Asian market and then introduce
it to Europe. In 2011, we will launch three to four more tablet devices,
including models that use the Android operating system," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The company's new tablet computers, which are expected to be featured at the
annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next month in the United States, will all
be 10.1-inch models, while the launch of smaller-sized devices will depend on
consumer demand, according to sources familiar with the company's strategy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Android-based tablet PCs, MSI will not begin mass production of
those models until Google Inc. releases the latest version of its operating
system -- Android 3.0 -- in March, the sources said.</P>
      <P>MSI is listed among the world's top 10 notebook brands in 2010, while the
company is also the largest all-in-one PC maker in Taiwan, with a 55.6-percent
market share in the third quarter of this year, higher than the 12 percent of
the second-place Apple Inc., according to Gartner Inc., an electronics industry

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the authorities Tuesday to root out campus
bullies and deal with them quickly and decisively, without fear of exposing any
"skeletons in the closet."</P>
      <P>During a year-end meeting with the media, the president compared campus bullying
to corruption in officialdom, which he said must be fearlessly disclosed.</P>
      <P>Ma put forth four suggestions regarding the growing incidence of campus
bullying: School administrators must take the initiative to identify the
bullies; such incidents must be tackled quickly and decisively;  suspects must
be prosecuted  if crimes have been committed; and such incidents must be
reported to society.</P>
      <P>He particularly advised school authorities "not to delay, hide or cover up"
bullying.</P>
      <P>The president, a former law scholar and justice minister, said it might not be
easy for teachers to decide if criminal acts have been committed in a bullying
case, so "they have to increase their legal knowledge and let their charges
know."</P>
      <P>He cited recent news stories about Bade Junior High School in northern Taiwan's
Taoyuan County, in which students are suspected of detonating firecrackers in a
toilet being used by a teacher. There are also reports of students locking up
classmates in the washrooms.</P>
      <P>Were these actions just mischief, deserving of discipline by the school
authorities, or criminal acts? he asked.</P>
      <P>Ma said some social norms are simple "courtesy, " some are required under school
rules and some are "moral" codes of conduct, while others are better defined
under the criminal code.</P>
      <P>"Kids need to be taught to tell the differences among these areas," he said.</P>
      <P>Outside of the norms of social conduct, he went on, teachers should pay more
attention to what is actually happening in the class under their care.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was told by Education Minister Wu Ching-ji and Interior Minister
Jiang Yi-huah that a mechanism is in place for schools and the police to work
together on campus bullying, although not all schools report such cases to the
police.</P>
      <P>Yuan Tseh Lee, a former president of Academia Sinica, expressed concern about
the development of education in Taiwan in the face of so many reports of campus
bullying and controversial acts by university students.</P>
      <P>In addition to the series of campus bullying incidents, Lee's worry was also
caused by reports that a graduate school student flashed his middle finger at an
ambulance while it was trying to provide emergency assistance to a patient in
danger.</P>
      <P>A former leader of an educational reform task force, Lee said the current system
just teaches students to try to get good scores by writing the "correct and
standard" answers in exams.</P>
      <P>Many things need to be examined, such as moral education, interpersonal
relationships, and interaction among family members, he said.</P>
      <P>"Education must be reformed continuously," he said.</P>

      <P>A team of community rangers was formed Tuesday to help protect wetland areas
around the Shueiwaku community, the second ecotourism attraction of its kind
near Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The community worked with the park's headquarters to set up a ranger team to
investigate and monitor the ecosystem of the two wetlands in the area and to
prevent illegal activities there, said Chen Mei-hui, a Pingtung University of
Science and Technology associate professor who directed the ecotourism
development project.</P>
      <P>The wetlands were abundant in frogs some 20 years ago, as well as butterflies
and fireflies.</P>
      <P>However, the construction of the Erchia Highway in 1979 and later human
development caused the water to dry up, leading to a decrease in wildlife.</P>
      <P>The park began last May to promote ecotourism in Shueiwaku -- about four
kilometers north of Erluanbi -- to restore the wetland ecosystem while helping
boost the local economy, Chen said.</P>
      <P>It also trained the residents as tour guides and taught them how to conserve the
environment.</P>
      <P>The community, with a population of 200, is the second successful example of
ecotourism in the area after a village between Shedin Park and the Kenting
Forest Recreation Area implemented  a similar initiative in 2008.</P>

      <P>The number of influenza A(H1N1) infections in Taiwan might reach peak in mid-
January as the virus is likely to make a comeback this winter, a pediatrician
warned Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Using the medical history in Taiwan over the past five years as evidence, Huang
Li-min, a pediatrician at National Taiwan University Hospital, said the strains
that cause a major flu outbreak in a given area will stay for two consecutive
years.</P>
      <P>Besides, he forecast, the A(H1N1) onslaught will recur this year since most of
the people who contracted the disease or were inoculated against the virus last
year will have no antibodies or immunity strong enough to combat a new attack.</P>
      <P>This year, few children in Taiwan have acquired immunity against all three major
types of flu viruses -- A(H1N1), A/H3 and influenza B.</P>
      <P>The cases of A(H1N1) and influenza B infections have been rising over the past
week and the two types of viruses are expected to be mainstay of flu infections
in the country by the middle of 2011, Huang estimated.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the countries hit by the H1N1 flu virus in 2009. More than 800
people in Taiwan were hospitalized with H1N1 symptoms, 35 of whom died.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for
Disease Control, 11.33 percent of the people who checked into emergency rooms
around Taiwan over the past week were admitted because of flu infections and
1.27 percent of Taiwan's outpatients in the same period were flu patients.</P>
      <P>Of these patients, 60 percent were infected with A(H1NI) and 30 percent had
influenza B, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also reported one more influenza death last week, he said. The case was a
62-year-old man from China who had never been inoculated and who came down with
flu symptoms after arriving in Taiwan for sightseeing. The man died next day
after checking into a local hospital. He tested positive for A(H1N1), according
to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih suggested that Taiwanese tourists get themselves inoculated before
traveling abroad, as A(H1N1) outbreaks have also been reported in Europe, the
United States, Japan and the United Kingdom.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma challenges DPP head to accept '92 consensus'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou challenged Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen Tuesday to accept the "1992 consensus" between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP were to become the ruling party one day, I wonder if Tsai would have
her DPP administration continue the Kuomintang's existing policy (toward
China)," Ma said at a year-end gathering with reporters.</P>
      <P>The "1992 consensus" refers to a tacit agreement reached between Taiwan and
China in 1992 that "there is only one China, but Taipei and Beijing are free to
interpret 'one China' as they see fit."</P>
      <P>The term "1992 consensus" was coined in 2000 by then Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Su Chi to summarize the tacit agreement, which has been serving as the
basis for Taiwan-China negotiations since 2008 when President Ma took office.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led opposition camp has refused to accept the 1992 consensus on the
grounds that it could result in China's annexation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said that during a meeting with former President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP in
April 2006, he had suggested that the government accept the consensus in order
to resume the suspended cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>"After a two-hour discussion, Chen promised to recognize the consensus if China
did so first," Ma said</P>
      <P>Ma said that in a phone call to former U.S. President George W. Bush on March
26, 2008, Chinese President Hu Jintao indicated a willingness to reopen cross-
strait talks on the basis of the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Li Yafei, Vice President of the Beijing-based Associations for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , has said that the 1992 consensus
refers to "both sides each orally interpreting their own concept of 'one China'
principle, " Ma noted.</P>
      <P>ARATS  and its Taiwan  counterpart,  the Straits  Exchange Foundation, are the
semi-official organizations authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>"It would be impractical for the DPP to continue to deny the existence of the
consensus, " Ma said.</P>

      <P>The annual ridership of the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system is expected
to top 500 million passengers Wednesday, marking a new page in Taiwan's MRT
services since the system's inception in 1996, the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp.
(TRTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As of the previous day, the Taipei MRT system posted a ridership total of 498
million passengers this year, a number expected to top the 500 million mark Dec.
29, according to the TRTC, operator of the MRT.</P>
      <P>Expanding from one route in its inaugural year in March 1996, the Taipei MRT
system now encompasses 10 routes connecting most districts and townships in the
greater Taipei area, with 93 stations and a service length exceeding 100 km,
according to the TRTC.</P>
      <P>With the expansion of routes, the system's daily ridership has continued to hit
new highs. The average daily ridership exceeded 1.57 million in November and the
figure surged to a record high of 1.86 million Dec. 24, the company said.</P>
      <P>Once the system's annual ridership exceeds 500 million, the Taipei MRT will be
able to enter the Nova International Railway Benchmarking Group and the
Community of Metros (Nova/CoMET) as a CoMET member, qualifying Taipei to conduct
metro technical exchanges with major cities in the world such as London, New
York, Paris and Moscow.</P>
      <P>At present, the Taipei MRT system is a member of Nova, membership of which
requires an annual ridership of under 500 million, according to the TRTC.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's air accident rate has been falling in recent years and if the trend
continues, will drop to the global average level within three years, an aviation
safety official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yu-hern, chairman of the Council for Aviation Safety (CAS), told a press
conference that there were four aviation accidents in Taiwan this year as the
country's 10-year record continues to fall.</P>
      <P>From 2000 to 2009, Taiwan registered 1.82 air accidents per million take-offs,
higher than the world average of 1.02, he said. "If the current rate can be
maintained, by 2013, our record will have dropped to the world average level of
0.61," he added.</P>
      <P>Council figures show that prior to 2008, Taiwan's 10-year accident record was
above two per million takeoffs. The decade of 1993-2002 saw the highest record
of 3.52, followed by 2.82 for 1994-2003, 2.69 for 1998-2007 and 2.26 for
1999-2008.</P>
      <P>By 2001-2010, the record had fallen to 1.82, the same as 2000-2009, according to
the CAS under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The council said it expects Taiwan's aviation accident rate to continue to fall
to 1.21 for 2003-2012 and to 0.61 for 2004-1013, on par with the world average.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed at a third reading Tuesday a special budget plan for
an infrastructure expansion and economic stimulus package worth NT$158.94
billion (US$5.3 billion) for 2011.</P>
      <P>After land requisition costs are deducted, the spending plan is expected to fuel
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.88 percent for 2011 and generate
more than 50,000 jobs, said Christina Liu, minister of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Also in the resolution, the legislators pointed out that nearly 50 percent of
the public works projects planned under an earlier infrastructure expansion and
economic stimulus package worth over NT$170 billion have not been carried out
over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The legislators therefore demanded that the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission under the Executive Yuan list the execution rate of its special
budgets as an index to gauge the performances of ministerial-level officials.</P>
      <P>Because of a low execution rate of only 5.23 percent posted by the Construction
and Planning Administration for city makeover and industrial zone renewal in
2010, the legislature resolved to freeze 20 percent of the budget for the same
project for the new year.</P>
      <P>The legislators also warned the Ministry of Education (MOE) about the low
execution rate of 34.52 percent in efforts to protect the education
opportunities of youths from disadvantaged families in 2010 and they told the

      <P>Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest skyscrapers, will feature a 288-second
fireworks display designed by renowned Chinese artist Cai Guo-qiang to mark the
turn of the new year, the organizer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press briefing, Cai described the Taipei 101 building as "a huge
stage" on which he will feature 15 different types of fireworks.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old said he will "turn the building into a red lantern, a waterfall,
a pagoda and a rocket" during the New Year's Eve display.</P>
      <P>There will also be a "big flower" on the skyscraper, after which a "golden
Chinese dragon" will climb up the building, according to the designer.</P>
      <P>"I have tried to include natural and folk custom elements (in my presentation),"
he said.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that there will be "Chinese  characters" appearing in the sky
to reflect the common voice of the public, but he declined to elaborate on what
the characters will be.</P>
      <P>The show will end with "flare bomb" fireworks.</P>
      <P>"These bombs, one after another, will turn the night sky into day. When the sky
returns to dark again, I hope it will create a sentimental atmosphere," Cai
said.</P>
      <P>Cai was the chief fireworks designer for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC) summit in Shanghai in 2001 and a chief visual effects designer for
the 2008 Beijing Olympics.</P>
      <P>This year's show will also mark the 100th founding anniversary of the Republic

      <P>As a result, the fireworks will also show "100" in the sky, the result of one of

      <P>Taiwan has developed a technology to retrieve information from damaged chips in
the global positioning systems (GPS) used by helicopters and other vehicles,
which has been provided to Japan, the Council for Aviation Safety (CAS) said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuan Wen-lin, CAS laboratory director, briefed the media on the use of the
technology, noting that Japan's Transportation Safety Board (JTSB) sought the
council's help in September to help determine the cause of a helicopter crash.</P>
      <P>The council used the technology to read the information in the Japanese
helicopter's GPS and discovered that it was caught in a heavy fog and crashed
into a mountain, Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Chip makers usually are unable to retrieve information from chips that have been
burned, soaked or broken in an accident. Chang's lab, however, uses reverse
engineering to "rebuild" the data on the damaged chips.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with GPS manufacturers, the lab last year designed a device that
can "read" the retrieved data, he noted.</P>
      <P>Kuan presented a paper on the lab's research and the new device at an
international meeting of aviation accident investigators earlier this year,
winning an award for best paper.</P>
      <P>The device was first used to help investigate an accident in Chiayi, southern
Taiwan, in May last year. In August, 2009, the device was again used to read
information from a damaged GPS aboard a helicopter on a rescue mission after a
typhoon.</P>
      <P>Most helicopters and super-light aircraft are not equipped with the "black
boxes" -- flight data recorders -- that are installed on larger aircraft, but
instead have GPS, which records flight times, positions, directions and
velocities, which can be used to help determine the causes of an accident.</P>

      <P>Personal computer vendor Asustek Computer Inc. said Tuesday it expects total
smartphone shipments in Taiwan to grow 50 percent next year, with the company
launching its first own-brand smartphone following a split with Garmin, the No.
1 U.S. maker of personal navigation devices.</P>
      <P>In 2010, smartphones in Taiwan accounted for 30 percent to 40 percent of total
mobile phone shipments, lower than the 50 percent in the United States, said
Benson Lin, general manager of Asustek's personal mobile devices unit, at a
product launch conference for the A50, its new Android-based phone.</P>
      <P>Lin said the smartphone penetration rate in Taiwan will surpass that of the U.S.
market and grow to 50 percent-60 percent next year, representing an increase of
50 percent in total smartphone shipments.</P>
      <P>In October, Asustek, which had been selling smartphones under the Garmin-Asus
brand since early 2009, said it would not introduce new co-branded handset
models in the future, but the company will keep using Garmin's navigation
software on its Android-based smartphones such as the A50 for the next few
years.</P>
      <P>Lin said he expects shipments of the 3.5-inch A50 to exceed 25,000 units in
Taiwan in 2011.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Far  EasTone  Telecommunications  Co.,  Taiwan's third-largest
telecom operator, forecast a 40 percent growth in smartphone shipments in the
local market in 2011.</P>
      <P>"Even though more than 50 tablet computers are expected to be launched in the
global market next year, prices have not yet decreased to the level of
NT$6,000-7,000 (US$203-237) that will be generally accepted by Taiwanese
consumers. Therefore, there will still be great demand for smartphones, " Far
EasTone President Yvonne Li said at a press conference to introduce new
applications in its online software store.</P>
      <P>Li also noted that the 2010 total shipments of mobile phones in Taiwan is
forecast to reach 7.2 million units, a number that will increase 5 percent to 10
percent next year.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will study law revisions to restrict embedded advertisements
disguised as television programs or news reports, according to a consensus
reached at a high-level meeting Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Participants  at the meeting said the Executive Yuan will immediately embark on
amending the law so that government agencies will no longer be able to buy news
coverage or engage in embedded advertising containing political messages.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus has agreed to work toward
such legislation.</P>
      <P>Until the law is amended, government agencies are required to "practice self-
discipline, " according to the participants, who included Liao Liou-yi, Lin
Join-sane, and King Pu-tsung, secretaries- general of the Presidential Office,
the Executive Yuan and the KMT, respectively, as well as Lin Yi-shih, director
of the KMT's Central Policy Committee and Lin Tsang-min, KMT legislative whip.</P>
      <P>The spokesmen of the Presidential Office, Government Information Office and KMT
-- -Lo Chih-chiang, Johnny Chiang and Su Jun-pin, respectively -- were also
present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT and the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) reached
an initial agreement on a proposal that ads publicizing government policies
should not appear on news pages in the form of embedded advertisements.</P>
      <P>Rather, they should be clearly marked as "advertisements."</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus proposed that all government agencies while
publicizing their policies should make a distinction between such ads and real
news, and that such ads should not appear as embedded advertisement in the form
of seminars or special reports.</P>
      <P>In addition, they should be clearly marked as policy promotions or
advertisements and the name of the government agencies placing the ad should
also be clearly shown.</P>
      <P>The debate on embedded advertisements has become a hot topic after a former
reporter wrote in his blog about the growing trend of the government to buy news
coverage and a recent decision by the National Communications Commission to not
to renew a licence for a TV channel accused of multiple violations in this
regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Negotiations on health care bill break down, showdown looms</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Negotiations between lawmakers of the ruling and opposition  camps on reforming
the national health insurance (NHI) system broke down Tuesday, creating concern
that the legislation will not be completed this week and that a showdown will be
needed to push the bill through the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)  renewed discussions on the disputed bill to bail out
the cash-strapped NHI program, but the basic stance of each party made it
difficult for them to reach agreement.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus insists on calculating NHI premiums based on household income,
while the KMT caucus's modified version proposes collecting premiums based on
individual income, as is the case at present, along with additional "supplement
premiums" -- premiums to be collected from income on dividends and bonuses.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the KMT for holding back from its original plan to adopt a fairer
system based on household income rather than the existing individual income, the
DPP caucus demanded the Department of Health (DOH) calculate premiums based on
household income next week and to publish its calculations.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, the DPP's legislative caucus convener, accused the KMT and the
DOH of having failed to hold substantial negotiations on the bill with the DPP.</P>
      <P>"The DOH has since last week failed to present us with its calculation results
based on household income, " he said, adding that "the DOH's attempts to return
to the first-generation NHI format mean that the long-term effort to build a
fairer NHI system has come to an end."</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, a KMT caucus whip, said the KMT will definitely seek to get the
second-generation health insurance bill through the legislature before the
current session ends by the end of January.</P>
      <P>According to DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang, if the proposed supplement premium
could be included under the current NHI system to keep its current financial
shortfall of NT$60.4 billion (US$2 billion) from worsening, a regular premium of
6 percent will need to be imposed to keep the system operating for two or three
years.</P>
      <P>"As the KMT's and the DPP's versions vary widely, it will be almost impossible
to have the second-generation national health bill clear the Legislative Yuan in
the next legislative meeting slated for Dec. 31," he said.</P>
      <P>"A vote showdown will be unavoidable in a Jan. 4 legislative meeting if the two
parties are unable to forge a consensus through negotiations by the end of this
month," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>The bill has failed to pass the Legislative Yuan since early December, with
issues related to the premium base, premium scope and the premium rate being the
focus of the row. The two parties have each come up with major changes to the
bill in a bid to gain greater popular support and have their own version rammed
through the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's emissions trading platform set to be completed soon: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first government-recognized carbon emissions trading platform is slowly
becoming a reality,  the Environment Protection Administration (EPA) said
Tuesday, although it did not give a definite timetable.</P>
      <P>EPA Minister Stephen Shen said carbon trading is becoming a global trend, as the
international community is seeking various ways to reduce greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>As an industrial country, Taiwan must not be absent from this movement, he said.</P>
      <P>Emissions trading is a mechanism to encourage companies or countries to go green
by using economic incentives. Also known as "cap and trade," under the scheme,
participants are allowed a certain quota of emissions. When a big polluter maxes
out on its allotted level, it can purchase the unused quota from another firm.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, the establishment of a domestic carbon trading platform
will be divided into three phases but so far, only phase one has been completed,
with the next phase estimated to be completed only after December next year.</P>
      <P>Phase one includes an online registry through which the buyer and the vendor can
find out more information about each other. The second phase will allow the
registered companies to bid on allotted quotas.</P>
      <P>The third phase will allow participants to buy quotas beforehand if it foresees
the need for a bigger allotment in the future, said Shen.</P>
      <P>The EPA said the platform will contain information on the emission levels of
over 300 domestic factories and plants. It will also be the second platform of
its kind to be established in Asia following one in Japan.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, six car makers, including BMW, Ford, Honda Taiwan, China
Motor Corp., Hyundai and Mercedes-Benz signed an agreement with the EPA
promising to import low-emission cars for domestic consumers.</P>
      <P>The goal of the agreement is to cut the country's carbon dioxide emissions by 10
percent to 15 percent by 2015.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih recently applauded the country's carbon reduction efforts,
saying that overall, Taiwan emitted 5.14 million metric tons of greenhouse gases
less than last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not a signatory to the Kyoto Pact,  a binding international agreement
under the United Nations to fight climate change, but despite this, the
government earlier this year set a goal of cutting back carbon emissions by 84
million metric tons by 2020. It is hoped that in 10 years, the country's
emissions will be the same as 2005 levels.</P>

      <P>The secretary general of the National Security Council (NSC) expressed amazement
Tuesday that a collection of photographs documenting the Second Sino-Japanese
War had been so well preserved at the Central News Agency (CNA) and he suggested
that the photos be put on display.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei-jen praised the agency for the work it has done to preserve news photos
dating as far back to 1924.</P>
      <P>"These photographs are extremely valuable because they bear witness to history,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Just by browsing through the CNA archives, one can gain deep insight into the
harsh times that prevailed during the establishment and development the Republic
of China, he said.</P>
      <P>"One photo is worth a thousand words," he said.</P>
      <P>Hu said he was especially touched to see a picture of his father, the late
General Hu Tsung-nan, in full military dress standing next to then President
Chiang Kai-shek during the war of resistance against Japanese invasion.</P>
      <P>"I don't think even I have these photos," he said.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the CNA to collaborate with the Ministry of National Defense,  the
Government Information Office and other government agencies to hold an
exhibition of the historical photos.</P>
      <P>The CNA, the national news agency of the ROC, has been in operation since 1924
when it was founded in Guangzhou, China.</P>
      <P>It has a wide collection of photographs that document historical events such as
the Second Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan Retrocession Day, and the island's Ten

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local hardware manufacturer Micro-Star International Co. (MSI) unveiled its
first tablet computer Tuesday amid company plans to launch three to four more
similar devices in the first half of 2011.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 units of The WindPad 100W, with a 10.1-inch screen and Windows 7
operating system, has been ordered by a telecom operator in Japan, and the model
is slated to be shipped worldwide in January, MSI President Joseph Hsu said at
the company's product launch.</P>
      <P>"We will begin sales of the WindPad 100W in the Asian market and then introduce
it to Europe. In 2011, we will launch three to four more tablet devices,
including models that use the Android operating system," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The company's new tablet computers, which are expected to be featured at the
annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) next month in the United States, will all
be 10.1-inch models, while the launch of smaller-sized devices will depend on
consumer demand, according to sources familiar with the company's strategy.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Android-based tablet PCs, MSI will not begin mass production of
those models until Google Inc. releases the latest version of its operating
system -- Android 3.0 -- in March, the sources said.</P>
      <P>MSI is listed among the world's top 10 notebook brands in 2010, while the
company is also the largest all-in-one PC maker in Taiwan, with a 55.6-percent
market share in the third quarter of this year, higher than the 12 percent of
the second-place Apple Inc., according to Gartner Inc., an electronics industry
and market research firm.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Living in peace and enjoying one's work" has been the most fundamental wish of
people since ancient times. If this standard is used to examine the performance
of President  Ma Ying-jeou's administration, then it clearly still has much room
for improvement.</P>
      <P>People in Taiwan cannot live comfortably because their salaries have long
remained stagnant while housing prices have continued to rise.</P>
      <P>Although the number of self-owned housing units as a percentage of total
households is nearly 90 percent in Taiwan, the ratio is inflated because many
owners possess more than one home. This may be attributed partly to speculative
purchasing, a situation fueled by excess liquidity, low interest rates, the slow
adjustment of the publicly announced land value, and the fact that actual market
value is not used to calculate land value increment taxes.</P>
      <P>People cannot find stability on the job either. Although Taiwan's unemployment
rate has dropped to below 5 percent, the number of workers in unstable jobs,
such as part-timers, temporary workers and contract workers, has hit a record
high of 723,000. Furthermore, 3.6 million employees, or 4.5 percent of the
workforce, earn less than NT$30,000 a month, indicating decreased quality of
employment.</P>
      <P>We earnestly hope that the government can present effective measures to solve
the problems. Otherwise, this will become a serious issue in the 2012
presidential election. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 29, 2010)</P>

      <P>According to media reports, the Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung city governments
experienced a chaotic day on Monday, the first work day following their upgrades
to special municipalities through city-county mergers. The situation in Xinbei
City was much better because  its upgrade  did not involve  a merger with
another administrative region.</P>
      <P>The chaos highlights the lack of proper planning beforehand. In fact, bills
aimed at adjusting revenue allocation and the debt ceilings of local governments
still had not cleared the legislature when the new special municipalities began
operations Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>This inevitably leads to worries over the prospects for the central government's
restructuring project, set to be implemented in 2012, in which the number of
second-level agencies will be reduced from 37 to 29 and third-level agencies
from 279 to 70.</P>
      <P>It is almost certain that the Legislative Yuan will not finish handling all of
the 147 bills related to the restructuring within the coming year.</P>

      <P>Christina  Liu,  minister of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development, has urged enterprises operating in Taiwan to raise wages to match a
strong rebound in the local economy.</P>
      <P>Liu said Tuesday that Taiwan is witnessing a significant increase in private
investment this year, boosting local employment, and she believed that the
improving job market was paving the path for an increase in wages.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, private investment in Taiwan is expected to grow 31.91 percent
in 2010 from a year earlier, the highest growth rate among the four Asian tigers
-- Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The island's jobless rate fell to 4.73 percent in November on an improvement in
the local business environment, largely due to the lowest level of corporate
downsizings and closures in two years.</P>
      <P>In October, the local unemployment rate fell below 5 percent for the first time
since November 2008, down from a high of 6.13 percent in August 2009 following
the global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>Based on these favorable economic factors, "we think it possible for enterprises
to raise wages next year," Liu said.</P>
      <P>A recent local survey showed that almost 80 percent of local companies said they
were planning to raise their employees' salaries next year, by an average of 3.9
percent, but the survey also found that 64 percent of employees polled remained
cautious about the pledge.</P>
      <P>Liu said an increase in wages for next year has become a trend, and she hoped
employers would take notice of it.</P>
      <P>In October, Taiwan's regular salary rose 1.62 percent from a year earlier to a
monthly average of NT$36,480 (US$1,220) , the 12th consecutive increase,
according to the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>In November, the government raised its forecast for 2010 gross domestic product
(GDP) growth to 9.98 percent from a previous estimate of 8.24 percent.</P>

      <P>Tang attributed Yulon's larger market share largely to sales of the popular
upscale Luxgen multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) and sports utility vehicle (SUV)
models at a time when the local economy is staging a strong rebound.</P>
      <P>Luxgen models are produced by Luxgen Motor Co. Ltd., a wholly owned unit of
Yulon Motor. Luxgen Motor, founded in June 2008, first launched its MPV models
in Taiwan in September 2009.</P>
      <P>Market observers said sales of Luxgen models in Taiwan are expected to exceed
10,000 units in 2010 and reach 16,000 units in 2011.</P>
      <P>In addition to the higher sales in the domestic market, Tang said, investors
have high hopes that the Luxgen brand will generate significant revenues for
Yulon Group in the huge China market.</P>
      <P>Yulon Motor and China-based Dongfeng Yulon Motor Co. have set up a joint venture
in Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province to produce Luxgen models for the China market.</P>
      <P>"China's annual auto sales are about 20 million units, compared with Taiwan's
300,000 units. Only a small slice of the Chinese market would be significant to
Yulon," Tang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ministry of Environment and Resources A Milestone in Building Sustainable
Homeland</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/29/10  15:28:16</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan has passed the revised Organic Act of the Executive Yuan in
third reading. Starting on January 1, 2012 the number of Cabinet-level agencies
will be reduced from 37 to 27, including 14 ministries, 8 commissions, 3
independent agencies, the Central Bank, the National Palace Museum, and two
newly added general offices. The Ministry of Environment and Resources will be a
newly established ministry.</P>
      <P>Director Jun-hong Yeh of the EPA Department of Comprehensive Planning said in an
interview that Taiwan's environmental quality has been significantly improved
and upgraded under the joint efforts of all people since the EPA was established
in 1987.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that in response to the new challenge of climate changes caused
by global warming and in line with the international trend of environmental
protection, the establishment of the Ministry of Environment and Resources is
both the realization of President Ma Ying-jeou's policy on environment and an
important milestone in safeguarding Taiwan's quality environment.</P>
      <P>At present environmental protection, water resources, mining industry, geology,
national parks, forest conservation, meteorology, soil and water conservation,
and ecological conservation are under the jurisdiction of different ministries
and commissions. Establishing the Ministry of Environment and Resources will put
the management and protection of water, soil, forest and air resources under its
jurisdiction, and strengthen the protection of environmental resources and
maintain the balance of ecological environment through environmental planning
and management, noted Yeh.</P>
      <P>To be prudent, the EPA has repeatedly revised the drafted structure of the
Ministry of Environment and Resources and the latest proposal is for the new
ministry to govern seven departments: comprehensive planning, climate changes,
atmospheric environment, water and river valley, resource regeneration,
pollution control, and disaster prevention and ecology.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new ministry will have 10 third-level agencies: Bureau of
Pollution Prevention and Sewerage, Weather Bureau, Water Resources Agency, Water
and Soil Conservation and Geology and Mineral Resources Agency, Forest and
Conservation Agency, Environmental Education and Training Institute, Forest and
Natural Resources Research Institute, Institute of Biodiversity, and Taiwan
Water Corporation.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the EPA has a staff of more than 800 at present and the Ministry of
Environment and Resources is expected to have a staff of over 14,000 because of
increased responsibilities. He expressed the hope that the new ministry will
maximize the effectiveness of resources development and environmental protection
with unified powers. Contacts:Environmental Protection Administration, Taiwan</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait negotiating channel will not be replaced: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  29  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) reassured a group of foreign diplomats in
Taipei Wednesday that a proposed cross-Taiwan  Strait committee  will only serve
as a negotiation tool and will not replace the existing communication channels
authorized by both governments.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a briefing set up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on the
sixth round of cross-strait talks held earlier this month,  MAC Deputy Chairman
Chao Chien-min  said the proposed Cross-Strait Economic Cooperation Committee
(ECC) will be responsible for consultations on issues following the signing of
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed in June.</P>
      <P>The effect of the ECC was one of the questions asked by the group of 41
representatives from 36 countries, who were wondering if the committee will
override the existing authorized channels -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) -- as claimed by Taiwan's opposition parties.</P>
      <P>"The SEF is here to stay, " said Chao, pointing out while there will be some
overlapping functions, the joint committee is only a consultation tool and has
no right to sign any agreements on behalf of either government.</P>
      <P>During the most recent round of talks, Taiwan and China also signed a health
cooperation agreement and agreed to open Taiwan further to Chinese tourists.
Moreover, both sides agreed that the long-stalled issue of cross-strait
investment protection will be the main issue in the next round of talks.</P>
      <P>Chao said that unlike the ECFA, the investment protection pact will not be
submitted to the World Trade Organization for reference because it does not
pertain to trade, although it will follow international standards.</P>
      <P>On tourism, both sides earlier this month shook hands on a deal to increase the
daily cap of Chinese tourists from 3,000 to 4,000 and starting next year, a
small number of qualified Chinese tourists will be allowed to travel to Taiwan
individually without being confined to tour groups.</P>
      <P>Answering a question on the effect of Taiwan's national security in relation to
the health agreement, Chao said the pact will only provide further protection
for Taiwan patients and consumers' right to health without affecting the
country's overall security.</P>
      <P>The sixth round of cross-strait talks were held in Taipei in late December,
headed by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The series of meetings, which started in November 2008, is interpreted as an
indication of cross-strait rapprochement since 2008, when President Ma Ying-jeou
took office. Over 14 agreements ranging from non-political topics such as postal
services, joint efforts to combat crime, and direct flights have been forged.</P>
      <P>MOFA holds a briefing for the diplomatic corps the week following each cross-
strait meeting.</P>

      <P>The government will invite Japanese and German manufacturers of sophisticated
machine tools and components to invest in Taiwan and ensure that the machine
tools' controllers are made locally, a Ministry of Economic Affairs official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The origin of the controllers, which link a computer system and the mechanical
components of a CNC (computer numerical control) machine, will decide whether
exports of computer-controlled machine tools from Taiwan remain eligible for
duty-free entry into China in three to five years.</P>
      <P>Seven categories  of sophisticated  machine tools with CNC functions are set to
be given duty-free treatment by China under the early harvest program of the
Taiwan-China Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), set to be launched
on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>But that status will change in a few years unless the machine tools'
controllers, 60 percent of which are currently imported from Germany or Japan,
are made in Taiwan, according to Duh Tyzz-jiun, head of the ministry's
Industrial Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, makers of CNC cutting, stamping and grinding machines will
have a three-year grace period, after which all of the controllers used in
products exported to China will have to be made in Taiwan to retain the
products' zero-tariff status, Duh said.</P>
      <P>For CNC lathes, the adaptation period will be five years, he added.</P>
      <P>At the same time, at least 50 percent of the machine tools' value-added will
also have to originate in Taiwan to retain duty-free eligibility, but that
threshold is already being met and should not pose any problems to local machine
tool manufacturers, the MOEA said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Wednesday as rotational buying in the
financial sector offset the losses suffered by bellwether electronic stocks,
which have been pressured by a rising New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 4.41 points or 0.04 percent to 8,866.35, after moving
between 8,844.67 and 8,893.14, on turnover of NT$145.09 billion (US$4.90
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.08 percent and moved to the day's high before selling in
the high-tech sector set in to weigh on the movement, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>However, interest in the financial sector emerged during the trading session,
helping the broader market fend off the gloomy mood about the harm done by a
stronger local currency to Taiwan's global competitiveness, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,914 stocks closed down, while 1,453 finished up and 298 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector posted the steepest decline, ending down
1.1 percent. Plastics and chemicals fell 0.4 percent, and cement and textile
shares lost 0.3 percent, while the paper and pulp, and construction sectors
closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 3.6 percent and the foodstuff sector added 0.5
percent.</P>
      <P>"Investors were upbeat about increasing financial exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, in particular after five major local banks officially opened branches in
China, " Hua Nan Securities analyst Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Right after securing approval from the China Banking Regulatory Commission
(CBRC) , the branches of First Commercial Bank, Cathay United Bank, Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank, Taiwan Cooperative Bank and Land Bank of Taiwan started
operations last week and this week.</P>
      <P>Miao said that following recent consolidation, financial stocks have appeared
attractive in terms of valuations.</P>
      <P>"Amid adequate liquidity, the financial sector has become a safe haven for many
investors needing a place to park their funds, " Miao said.</P>
      <P>"Due to the strong interest in the sector, the broader market appeared resilient
despite the high-tech losses," he added.</P>
      <P>Miao said that with many foreign  institutional  investors remaining sidelined
for the New Year holiday, the local market is expected to move in a narrow range
until the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Among the financial stocks, Chang Hwa Commercial Bank rose 6.93 percent to close
at NT$24.45 and First Financial, which owns First Commercial Bank, gained 6.83
percent to end at NT$26.60.</P>

      <P>The applications for the sale of three Morgan Stanley investment funds in Taiwan
have been approved by the Financial Supervisory  Commission,  Cathay Securities
Investment Consulting said Wednesday,</P>
      <P>Cathay serves as the master agent for the three funds and is gearing up for
their launch in the domestic market soon.</P>
      <P>The three newly approved investment funds are Morgan Stanley Global Brands Fund,
Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Debt Fund and Morgan Stanley Asian Equity Fund,
according to the master agent.</P>
      <P>The Global Brands Fund, which is currently valued at US$2.2 billion (NT$66
billion), focuses on investments in equity securities of those companies in
developed countries which have earned a reputation in brands, copyrights, or
other intangible assets, Cathay said.</P>
      <P>Cathay said the Global Brands Fund pursues long term returns valued in U.S.
dollars.</P>
      <P>As for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Debt Fund, which is currently valued
at US$407 million, government bonds issued by emerging countries account for 70
percent of its total porfolio, while bonds issued by state-owned companies and
private companies makes up the rest, Cathay said.</P>
      <P>Since the fund is valued in U.S. dollars, investors are expected to avoid
possible foreign exchange risks resulting from volatile fluctuations of local
currencies in the emerging economies, the master agent said.</P>
      <P>In addition, because the fund is denominated in U.S. dollars, it has been
liquid, which means that investors are faced with fewer risks, Cathay said.</P>
      <P>The Morgan Stanley Asian Equity Fund, which is currently valued at US$580
million, holds large equities issued in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Indonesia, according to Cathay.</P>
      <P>The five markets account for 90 percent of the fund's portfolio, with China in
the lead with 33 percent, Cathay said.</P>
      <P>The master agent said the fund is raising investments in Indonesia -- a country
that is emerging as a promising market behind China, Brazil, Russia and India.</P>

Taiwan, Vice Defense Minister Andrew Yang said the ministry is "cautiously
optimistic" about the sales and believes they will not be affected.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, high-ranking U.S. officials have on many occasions told
Beijing that the issue of arms sales to Taiwan does not fall within the scope of

      <P>Turnover totaled US$875 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at NT$30.426 and moved between NT$29.375 and NT$30.430

      <P>Selling in the U.S. dollar by exporters was on the rise amid increasing demand

      <P>The market is expecting the central bank to raise its key interest rates in a

      <P>The Presidential Office asked Democratic Progressive Party Chairwoman Tsai Ing-
wen Wednesday to clarify whether she supports the concept of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>In the latest clash of words between the Presidential Office and the DPP over
Tsai's China policy, Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih- chiang said Tsai
should tell the public what kind of formula she plans to use as a substitute for
the "1992 consensus" in developing relations between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, President Ma Ying-jeou challenged Tsai to accept the "1992
consensus", a tacit agreement between Taipei and Beijing that has been serving
as the basis for warming cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Under the consensus, both sides agree that "there is but one China" but are free
to interpret "one China" as they see fit.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led "pan green" camp has refused to accept the consensus on the grounds
that it could lead to China's annexation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to Ma's comment, the DPP hit back late Tuesday night, saying that
the three key persons involved in the 1992 cross-strait talks --  former
President Lee Teng-hui and Taiwan's top two cross-strait negotiators the late
Koo Chen-fu and his deputy Shi Hwei-yow -- had all denied the existence of such
a consensus.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the Presidential Office picked up the ball again, saying Tsai's
statement that if the DPP returned to power it would retain President Ma's China
policy was contradictory because she had often accused the government of leaning
towards China.</P>
      <P>"Tsai should tell us if she would keep in force the cross-strait Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement if the DPP returns to power," Lo said.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which has been an advocate of Taiwan independence, is set to revise its
anti-China stance by setting up a think tank to map out ways to engage Beijing,
in what is said to be an attempt to increase the party's chances of winning the
2012 presidential election.</P>

      <P>The Hon Hai Group, the world's largest electronics contract manufacturer, will
post better than expected revenue growth this year but is likely to grow at a
slower rate in the future, the group's chairman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The group's consolidated revenue is expected to grow 60 percent this year to
nearly NT$3 trillion (US$102 billion) in 2010, with the group's core company,
Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., accounting for more than NT$2 billion of that,
Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou said at a seminar on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Gou acknowledged, however, that his longstanding goal of 30 percent annual
revenue growth would be "very hard to achieve" next year because of strong sales
in 2010, and he said an annual growth target of 15 percent was more realistic in
the future.</P>
      <P>"We would rather think optimistically but forecast conservatively and be
responsible to our shareholders instead of misleading them with exaggerated
numbers, even though it may hurt our share price, " he said.</P>
      <P>Asked what he thought of the overall prospects for the coming year, Gou said
companies should not worry about the general economic outlook but rather focus
on improving their competitiveness, which is a key to success in any kind of
unfriendly environment.</P>

      <P>Land Bank of Taiwan Chairman Wang Yao-shing said in Shanghai Wednesday that he
expects the bank's Shanghai branch to make profit in 2011, riding the wave of
China's fast-growing economy.</P>
      <P>In an inauguration ceremony for the Shanghai branch, Wang said that once it
starts making a profit, the bank is expected to open more branches in other
Chinese cities, starting from 2012.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as Shanghai is an international financial hub that has attracted
a great number of Taiwanese investors who have relocated to the city, the bank
is very excited to have a branch there.</P>
      <P>He noted that prior to opening the branch, the bank had operated a
representative office in the city for eight years, and he said the expanded
presence is expected to provide a wider range of financial services to Taiwanese
companies operating in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the bank is planning to seek further business cooperation with the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) , one of the leading lenders in
China.</P>
      <P>Wang said that as far back as Land Bank's establishment of its Shanghai
representative office, the Taiwanese bank and ICBC have built up a good
relationship in financial service cooperation.</P>
      <P>Among the Chinese guests at the opening ceremony, ICBC Shanghai branch President
Shen Liqiang said ICBC is also willing to forge even closer business ties with
the Land Bank.</P>
      <P>In Shanghai alone, ICBC has 501 outlets and employs 13,000 people, with a base
of 350,000 corporate customers and 15 million retail clients, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>Shen said he believes Land Bank and ICBC will build a good model on business
cooperation for the financial sectors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also said ICBC is planning to set up a foothold in Taiwan and will send a

      <P>The National Communications Commission (NCC) went ahead Wednesday with a
decision to force ERA TV's entertainment channel to cease broadcasting at
midnight Dec. 30, despite a protest by the channel and a call from lawmakers to
put the decision on hold.</P>
      <P>The independent NCC announced that from that time onward, channel 45, which at
present is allotted to ERA TV, will carry the signals of Star TV's entertainment
channel in northern Taiwan and Top TV's entertainment programs in the south.</P>
      <P>The Taipei High Administrative Court has begun to set up a procedure to hear ERA
TV's complaint about the closure order, a process that might take a while. Any
ruling it hands down can be appealed at the Supreme Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>ERA TV took out a front-page newspaper advertisement Wednesday in which it
accused the NCC of backpedaling on the country's democratic progress by
"revoking its operating license and shuttering its entertainment channel,
seriously damaging freedom of expression."</P>
      <P>However, the NCC pointed out that the decision was made based on the fact that
ERA TV has repeatedly  violated  the Satellite Broadcasting Act and that the
decision "has nothing to do with freedom of expression."</P>
      <P>NCC spokesman Chen Cheng-tsang said that TV broadcasters are reviewed every two
years and that NCC records show that since 2004, ERA TV has been warned of the
possible consequences of its continued and repeated violations of the Satellite
Broadcasting Act.</P>
      <P>In February this year, when ERA TV requested a renewal of its license, the NCC
gave it a one-year grace period, on the condition that it must not break the law
again, Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, within one month, ERA broke its promise not once but several times,
leading to the NCC decision not to renew its license, according to the
spokesman.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sen, a NCC department director, produced evidence of ERA TV's
lawbreaking. Ho showed a video recording of an ERA program in which the host and
the guest touted a commercial product, an act of advertising rather than giving
the audience real information.</P>
      <P>Some of the channel's embedded advertising went as far as exaggerating  the
medical effects of various so-called "health products," in violation of medical
and health products laws, Ho said.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, an absolute majority of the members of the public who called to
comment on the matter took the side of the NCC, with some of them saying the NCC
should  have punished  the law-breaking broadcasters much sooner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEOs predict slowdown in Taiwan's opening to China</HEADLINE>

      <P>Nearly half of the chief executive officers (CEOs) in Taiwan's manufacturing,
service and financial sectors think the pace of Taiwan's deregulation in cross-
strait exchanges will slow down, according to a poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Some 47 percent of the CEOs said the slowdown will be one of the effects of the
recent municipality  elections  on cross-strait relations, the survey by
Taiwan's CommonWealth Magazine showed.</P>
      <P>In the Nov. 27 elections, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) took
two of the five municipality mayoral seats but garnered 5 percent more of the
popular vote than the ruling Kuomintang, which won three seats. The five
municipalities account for 60 percent of Taiwan's population.</P>
      <P>In the public opinion poll that asked CEOs about the possible effects of the
elections on cross-strait relations, 28.11 percent said they did not think there
would be any impact, 24.25 percent forecast that the KMT government would step
up the pace of opening toward China, and 47 percent said the pace of
liberalization would slow down.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-China relations have greatly improved since President Ma Ying-jeou took
office in May 2008. The two sides signed a landmark Economic Cooperation
Framework Agreement (ECFA) in June this year to pave the way for a range of
tariff reductions and eliminations from the start of 2011.</P>
      <P>On the question of the effects of the ECFA on their companies, 4.05 percent of
the executives said their businesses had already benefited from the pact.</P>
      <P>Another 60.98 percent said the trade pact had not yet affected their companies
in any way but they believed it would bring their businesses benefits in the
future.</P>
      <P>The majority of CEOs, 72.16 percent, said that what they wanted most from pacts
between Taiwan and China was an investment protection agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are working to sign such an agreement in the next round of
trade talks, according to the main negotiators on both sides.</P>
      <P>In the poll, the CEOs said what is needed most to improve the business climate
in China is "clean and transparent government" there.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted Nov. 29-Dec. 17 and collected 470 valid questionnaires.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Weather bureau reports record low number of typhoons in 2010</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
12/29/10  20:08:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 14 typhoons formed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 2010, the lowest
number since the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) began keeping typhoon records in
1958, a meteorologist said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The figure shattered all previous records, including the record low of 17 in
1998, " said Lin Hsiu-wen, deputy director of the CWB's Weather Forecast Center.</P>
      <P>Despite the small number of typhoons this year, five of them posed threats to
Taiwan's land and sea areas, which prompted the weather bureau to issue storm
warnings, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The number of storm warnings this year was higher than in 1993, 1999 and 2002,
when the bureau issued three typhoon alerts for each of those three years," Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Last year, when 22 typhoons were reported in the Pacific area, the CWB issued
four storm warnings for Taiwan, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Based on the figure of 22 typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in both
2009 and 2008, the CWB predicted in June that the number this year would be 20
to 23.</P>
      <P>"Although we forecast that there would be fewer typhoons this year, but we did
not expect the number to be so low," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The meteorologist attributed the low number mainly to stronger high-pressure
systems caused in part by global warming.</P>
      <P>"Strong high-pressure systems led to strong eastward winds and larger wind
shears, which together prevented the formation of many typhoons in tropical
areas," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, "this might not necessarily recur," Lin added.</P>
      <P>Based on meteorological data for the past 30 years, Lin said, there should be an
average of 26.6 typhoons in the northwestern Pacific Ocean each year and an
average of 3.1 are likely to hit Taiwan annually.</P>
      <P>However, in the last decade, the actual number of typhoons formed in the area
has fallen below that number, she said, noting that there were only 22 to 24
typhoons per year between 2005 and 2009.</P>
      <P>During that period, an average of three to five typhoons per year hit Taiwan,
she said,  cautioning that fewer typhoons do not necessarily mean less storm-
related damage in the country.</P>
      <P>Despite the record low number of typhoons this year, Typhoon Fanabi caused
serious flooding in the southern port city of Kaohsiung in September. A month
later, Typhoon Megi wreaked havoc in the northeastern county of Yilan, claiming
26 lives, including 20 Chinese tourists, on the Suhua Highway alone.</P>

      <P>Better-off families in Taiwan were found to have used more electricity than
average households in 2010, while central Taiwan residents were the heaviest
users, according to the results of a study released Wednesday by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The average amount of electricity used by families with an annual income above
NT$2 million (US$68,120) was about 1.6 times higher than those with yearly
incomes of between NT$600,000  and 800,000, according to the ministry's
statistics.</P>
      <P>There was also a correlation between the total family energy consumption of all
types, including electricity, natural gas and liquefied natural gas, and annual
incomes.</P>
      <P>The central area topped the country's four regions -- north, south, central and
east -- in terms of average family energy usage, due mainly to generally bigger
floor areas per household, an Bureau of Energy official said.</P>
      <P>Air conditioning accounted for 23.8 percent of electricity consumption, followed
by water heaters at 14.5 percent. Lighting was the third-largest source of
electricity utilization.</P>
      <P>Compared with the last such study, carried out in 2000, the trend toward smaller
families was more obvious, the bureau said. An increase in the number of
families and available housing areas for each family member has led to a higher
demand for electricity, it added.</P>

      <P>A senior Kuomintang (KMT) official said Wednesday that the party and the
government are taking steps to ban the practice of so-called embedded
advertising or the buying of news coverage.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General King Pu-tsung made the remarks during an interview with
radio presenter Cheng Tsun-chi.</P>
      <P>A party-government meeting a day earlier resolved that the budget act should be
amended in such a way that bans the central and local governments from using
government budget to buy media coverage or to run advertorials -- advertisements
that masquerade as real news, King said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the issue has been around for a long time and described it as
"very complicated, " but he added that the KMT is determined to get to the root
of it.</P>
      <P>"This is a problem that must be faced by the central and the local governments,
be they pan-blue or pan-green, " King said, referring to the two major political
camps in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He accused the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of initiating the
practice when it was the ruling party between 2000 and 2008.</P>
      <P>"When the DPP pointed its finger at others, " King said, "it forgot that its
other fingers were pointing at itself. "</P>
      <P>If the government wants to promote its policies or initiatives in future,  such
messages  must be clearly marked as "government messages," he said.</P>

      <P>Evertrust Rehouse Group, one of Taiwan's largest real estate agencies, kicked
off what it boasted is the biggest year-end party in the local property sector
Wednesday to reward its thousands of employees after this year saw a flourishing
property market.</P>
      <P>More than 6,000 real estate agents around the country flocked to the Nankang
Taipei World Trade Exhibition Hall in Taipei to attend the party in which more
than 1,000 prizes including two cars, scooters, flat-screen TVs and iPad tablet
computers were given away.</P>
      <P>The event marked the first of the group's three year-end parties for its more-
than 10,000 employees and their families.</P>
      <P>The group saw a 20-percent growth in this year's sales, valued at NT$300 billion
(US$10.3 billion) , and aims to achieve another 20-percent growth for next year
to total a projected NT$360 billion.</P>
      <P>"We are neutral-to-optimistic on next year's market," the group's president,
Benson Liao, told reporters.</P>
      <P>Liao based his optimism for the market on Taiwan's low interest rates, the
recent Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with China and the inauguration
of four new special municipalities, in addition to the already existing Taipei
City, in late December.</P>
      <P>Soaring property prices have prompted the government to launch cooling measures
earlier this year due to mounting complaints from the public of unaffordable
housing in the nation's capital.</P>
      <P>Liao said the government's efforts have targeted short-term speculative
investors and will not cause a negative impact in the long run.</P>
      <P>"There will be not much impact if the central bank further raises interest rates
by 0.25 or 0.5 percentage points," he added.</P>
      <P>His remarks came as the market waited to see if the central bank will hike
interest rates the following day.</P>
      <P>Evertrust, which has 760 outlets around Taiwan and in Shanghai, has vowed to
boost the number to 900 in 2011.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange said Wednesday it plans to post a "Taiwan Top 99
Employers" index online from Dec. 30 to encourage corporate social
responsibility though the employment of more people.</P>
      <P>The main criteria for selecting the 99 companies include profit per employee and
turnover rate, according to the exchange. Those companies with turnover rates of
one percent or lower will not be selected, it said.</P>
      <P>As for profit-making ability, the exchange said, this will be calculated on the
basis of a company's average net profits over the past five years, divided by
the number of employees in the last year of that period.</P>
      <P>The index will be composed of 18 highest profit-making firms in the banking and
insurance sector, 48 top-earning electronics and technology firms and the 33
most profitable companies in the traditional industries.</P>
      <P>Currently, Cathay Financial Holdings, Chung Hwa Telecom and Nan Ya Plastics are
the leaders in these three sectors, respectively, with Cathay Financial being
the No. 1 contender for the "Top 99" list.</P>
      <P>The exchange said the list will be an indicator of the companies' social
responsibility, which will be mirrored in their stock prices as well as in
public opinion.</P>

      <P>The majority of chief executive officers (CEO) of major Taiwanese companies plan
to raise their employees' pay next year, a survey revealed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Seventy-five percent of the CEOs in the CommonWealth Magazine survey said their
companies will offer higher pay in 2011, with 47 percent estimating raises of
within 3 percent, 25 percent forecasting a 3-5 percent pay hike, and about 3
percent predicting a 5-8 percent pay increase.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 29 and Dec. 17 among CEOs of 1,270
corporations  selected from among Taiwan's top 1,000 manufacturing firms, top
500 service providers, top 100 financial companies and 15 financial holding
groups. A total of 470 valid samples were collected in the survey.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at which the results of the poll were released,
Charles Wang, managing consultant of the Taiwan branch of U.S.-based Towers
Watson Delaware Inc., said Taiwanese companies need to raise salaries to reflect
a rebound in their sales and the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Salary increases have been relatively slow in recent years, Wang noted. If local
companies fail to raise their employees' pay, Taiwan may see a brain drain to
neighboring countries where the salaries of white-collar workers have been
rising much faster, he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the government's top economic planner also urged local companies to
raise employees' pay to help spur private consumption and bolster continued
gross domestic product (GDP) growth.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic  Planning  and Development  Chairwoman Christina Liu said
the government has designated 2011 as a year to promote private consumption to
boost GDP growth.</P>
      <P>Because some companies have offered their employees pay raises in recent months
to match a rebound in sales, private consumption is expected to rise in the
coming year. She also urged other corporate leaders to acknowledge the trend and
follow suit.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two major political parties decided separately Wednesday to revoke the
membership of newly elected municipal council members who failed to toe the
party line in the recent elections for council speakers and deputy speakers.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) King Pu-tsung said the party's
Central Disciplinary Committee's decision to expel 10 Tainan City Council
members must be carried out in order to reassert authority within the party.</P>
      <P>The 10 KMT members, including Chang Shih-hsien and Lee Wen-chun, were found to
have disobeyed the party's directives during the elections for council speakers
and deputy speakers last week.</P>
      <P>The other eight were Lee Kun-huang, Chen Wen-ko, Tseng Pei-ya, Tsai Shu-hui, Lin
Mei-yen, Chen Chin-yi, Huang Li-chao and Tsai Yu-chih.</P>
      <P>With only three KMT members remaining in the city council's KMT caucus, party
workers said, the councilors who have been kicked out of the KMT are expected to
work with the caucus so they could return to the party fold in two years time.</P>
      <P>Some KMT councilors in Taipei City were also reported to have acted
independently during the speaker elections, but King said that without any solid
evidence to prove the reports, he could not discipline them.</P>
      <P>In the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Central Standing
Committee has decided to refer five recalcitrant members to the Central Advisory
Committee, which will confirm their expulsion from the party at a meeting on
Jan. 11.</P>
      <P>The five are Lee Wan-yu of Xinbei City, Hung Ping-lang of Kaohsiung City, and
Liang Shun-fa, Tsai Chiu-lan and Tang Pi-er of Tainan City.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the five had bucked a party resolution to vote
for their fellow party members under the watch of their council caucuses.</P>
      <P>According to DPP regulations, once the councilors have been expelled, they would

    <HEADLINE>75% of major Taiwan companies plan to raise salaries: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of chief executive officers (CEO) of major Taiwanese companies plan
to raise their employees' pay next year, a survey revealed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Seventy-five percent of the CEOs in the CommonWealth Magazine survey said their
companies will offer higher pay in 2011, with 47 percent estimating raises of
within 3 percent, 25 percent forecasting a 3-5 percent pay hike, and about 3
percent predicting a 5-8 percent pay increase.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 29 and Dec. 17 among CEOs of 1,270
corporations  selected from among Taiwan's top 1,000 manufacturing firms, top
500 service providers, top 100 financial companies and 15 financial holding
groups. A total of 470 valid samples were collected in the survey.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at which the results of the poll were released,
Charles Wang, managing consultant of the Taiwan branch of U.S.-based Towers
Watson Delaware Inc., said Taiwanese companies need to raise salaries to reflect
a rebound in their sales and the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Salary increases have been relatively slow in recent years, Wang noted. If local
companies fail to raise their employees' pay, Taiwan may see a brain drain to
neighboring countries where the salaries of white-collar workers have been
rising much faster, he said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the government's top economic planner also urged local companies to
raise employees' pay to help spur private consumption and bolster continued
gross domestic product (GDP) growth.</P>
      <P>Council for Economic  Planning  and Development  Chairwoman Christina Liu said
the government has designated 2011 as a year to promote private consumption to
boost GDP growth.</P>
      <P>Because some companies have offered their employees pay raises in recent months
to match a rebound in sales, private consumption is expected to rise in the
coming year. She also urged other corporate leaders to acknowledge the trend and
follow suit.</P>

      <P>The number of extra flights on cross-Taiwan Strait routes to major Chinese
destinations during the Lunar New Year holidays were announced Wednesday as big
crowds are expected over the four-week period from late January to mid-February.</P>
      <P>According to the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) , from Jan. 20 to
Feb.17, the total extra flights to be operated for Taiwanese  carriers  to
Shanghai and Shenzhen are 32 and 16, respectively.</P>
      <P>Aviation officials from Taiwan and mainland China also agreed that Taiwan
airlines could operate no more than 10 extra flights to each of these Chinese
destinations: Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing and Hangzhou during the period.</P>
      <P>Four more destinations--Wuxi, Xuzhou, Quanzhou and Sanya-- have been added to
the cross-strait routes during the New Year holiday period, with no limits to
the number of flights.</P>
      <P>Some of these extra flights to major cities are expected to depart and arrive
late at night or early in the morning, the CAA warned.</P>
      <P>"Chances are that passengers are more likely to get red-eye flights this time
than a year ago, " said Betty Cheng, CAA's planning division director.</P>
      <P>According to three major Taiwanese carriers, the proposed numbers of extra
flights operated by China Airlines, EVA Air and TransAsia Airways are 66, 33 and
six, respectively.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two major political parties decided separately Wednesday to revoke the
membership of newly elected municipal council members who failed to toe the
party line in the recent elections for council speakers and deputy speakers.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) King Pu-tsung said the party's
Central Disciplinary Committee's decision to expel 10 Tainan City Council
members must be carried out in order to reassert authority within the party.</P>
      <P>The 10 KMT members, including Chang Shih-hsien and Lee Wen-chun, were found to
have disobeyed the party's directives during the elections for council speakers
and deputy speakers last week.</P>
      <P>The other eight were Lee Kun-huang, Chen Wen-ko, Tseng Pei-ya, Tsai Shu-hui, Lin
Mei-yen, Chen Chin-yi, Huang Li-chao and Tsai Yu-chih.</P>
      <P>With only three KMT members remaining in the city council's KMT caucus, party
workers said, the councilors who have been kicked out of the KMT are expected to
work with the caucus so they could return to the party fold in two years time.</P>
      <P>Some KMT councilors in Taipei City were also reported to have acted
independently during the speaker elections, but King said that without any solid
evidence to prove the reports, he could not discipline them.</P>
      <P>In the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the Central Standing
Committee has decided to refer five recalcitrant members to the Central Advisory
Committee, which will confirm their expulsion from the party at a meeting on
Jan. 11.</P>
      <P>The five are Lee Wan-yu of Xinbei City, Hung Ping-lang of Kaohsiung City, and
Liang Shun-fa, Tsai Chiu-lan and Tang Pi-er of Tainan City.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Tsai Chi-chang said the five had bucked a party resolution to vote
for their fellow party members under the watch of their council caucuses.</P>
      <P>According to DPP regulations, once the councilors have been expelled, they would
not be allowed to rejoin the party within five years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>on Wednesday expelled 10 Tainan City Council members who did not vote according
to party decision in the Dec. 25 speaker and deputy speaker elections. The step
should be applauded because it displays the KMT's determination to restore
discipline within the party and rebuild its image.</P>
      <P>There are suspicions that the politicians were paid to vote for an independent
candidate.</P>
      <P>Whenever elections for the speaker of local councils are held, there are reports
of vote-buying. Councilors who are paid for their votes usually acquiesce with
speakers on key issues, turning the council, in practical terms, into a large
gang.</P>
      <P>In the eyes of these votes-for-money politicians, who make personal gains their
top priority, party allegiance counts for nothing, while party discipline is a
joke to them. Although the KMT is an inclusive party, it does not mean that it
should condone the behavior of such politicians.</P>
      <P>The expulsion is a brave step forward for the KMT. A party can win respect only
if it toughens its stance against corruption and overcomes the pressure to win
in elections at any cost. (Editorial abstract -- Dec. 30, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Compal Electronics Inc., one of Taiwan's leading notebook computer ODM service
providers, said Thursday that it would enter the touch panel manufacturing
sector amid optimism about global demand for tablet computers.</P>
      <P>The company said in a statement that its board of directors had approved
aproposal to invest NT$2 billion (US$68.28 million) in Heng Hao Technology Co.
Ltd.</P>
      <P>After the transaction, the statement said, Compal would hold a 100 percent stake
in Heng Hao, which is expected to manufacture glass-type projected-capacitive
touch panels.</P>
      <P>Out of the NT$2 billion, Compal would spend NT$1.4 billion to buy a 4.5th
generation color-filter facility and related production equipment from Chunghuwa
Picture Tubes Ltd., while the rest of the investment would be used as working
capital by Heng Hao.</P>
      <P>The new production plant, which would focus on medium- to large-sized touch
panels, is scheduled to start operations in the fourth quarter of next year,
Compal said.</P>
      <P>"As expected, 'Media Pad' demand will report strong growth in the coming years,
and investing in touch panel production could shorten the product design cycle
and enhance product competitiveness," Compal said in a statement.</P>
      <P>TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said that the move by Compal to enter the
touch panel business is aimed at offsetting the impact of lower profit margins
in the contract notebook computer production business, which is currently
suffering from fierce global competition.</P>
      <P>"As the gross margin has fallen to 4 percent or below in the notebook computer
ODM business, Compal and many of its counterparts are eager to diversify their
operations," Shih said.</P>
      <P>However,  the market remains cautious  about Compal's  new investment, as shares
of the stock fell on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in Thursday morning trade, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>"The most important requirement for the success of a touch panel manufacturer is
the yield rate. Heng Hao has no track record to show how good its technology
is," Shih said.</P>
      <P>"It remains to be seen whether the new investment will pay off for Compal," Shih
added.</P>

(By Jeffrey Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's interest rates will rise slightly in 2011 due to an increase in the
price of commodities, led by crude oil, a local think tank forecast Thursday.</P>
      <P>David Hong, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER), said
inflation, risk, and liquidity preference the three main factors that will drive
interest rates, with inflation being the top one.</P>
      <P>"We haven't seen any sign of inflation based on the increased margin of
commodity prices this year,"  Hong said a media briefing. "But the recent rise
in crude oil and bulk commodity prices will likely lead to an increase of
commodity prices in 2011, which will force interest rates to a slightly higher
level than this year."</P>
      <P>He said that huge consumer demand, which is expected to go up further during the
Lunar New Year holiday, will be another factor that will contribute to higher
commodity prices.</P>
      <P>The market is expecting Taiwan's central bank to raise its key interest rates at
a quarterly policy making meeting scheduled for Thursday, since higher local
interest rates are expected to lure more funds to the country, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the local media reported that the New Taiwan dollar is expected to
continue to gain against the U.S. dollar because the greenback is under downward
pressure as the United States injects funds into its market through treasury
bond purchases to boost its economy.</P>
      <P>Hong said he believes Taiwan's central bank will continue its effort to
influence the exchange rate in a bid to regain a "dynamic balance," which means
a smaller fluctuation decided by the market.</P>
      <P>"With a non-violent fluctuation of the exchange rate, exporters will be more
prepared to avoid the risk of exchange loss," he added.</P>

      <P>A new round of talks under the Taiwan-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) will be held in Taipei in the second half of January, Minister
of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis will travel to Taipei to
hold trade talks with Taiwan's Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Francis Huang,
Shih said during a session of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>Noting that the TIFA is an important platform for high-level Taiwan-U.S.
dialogue in the absence of formal diplomatic ties, Shih said the upcoming
meeting will mark the resumption of such talks after a three-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>Shih said the new round of discussions will focus on major bilateral trade and
economic issues of mutual concern, including partnership in the development of
new energy resources.</P>
      <P>TIFA talks were suspended in 2007 after Taiwan prohibited the importation of
U.S. beef on fears of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, an incurable and fatal
neurological disorder cause by eating beef from cattle infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Taiwan agreed to allow most types of U.S. beef into its market, but
because it retained some restrictions on certain cattle parts, the issue has
remained a bone of contention between the two countries.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwanese officials said recently that Taipei and Washington will not
allow the sensitive beef trade issue to hinder overall progress on a wide range
of other economic matters.</P>
      <P>At the legislative session, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ting Shou-chung
expressed concern about Taiwan's strategic response to South Korea's recent free
trade agreements (FTAs) with the United States and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Shih said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has completed an assessment of
the possible effects on Taiwan of South Korea's FTAs with the U.S. and the EU.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's information technology (IT) products are already tariff-free under
the global Information Technology Agreement (ITA) , Shih said, the two South
Korean pacts will have a limited impact on local IT makers.</P>
      <P>"But Taiwanese petrochemical manufacturers might be adversely affected by the
two FTAs," Shih added.</P>
      <P>The ITA is a multilateral  accord within the World Trade Organization aimed at
expanding world trade in IT products.</P>
      <P>In an effort to avoid marginalization amid a trend of global economic
integration, the minister said, Taiwan is trying hard to start FTA talks with
those of its major trading partners that are not diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>For instance, Taiwan will begin negotiations with Singapore on an economic
partnership agreement early next year, he said.</P>
      <P>"We hope a pact can be signed soon," Shih added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.46 percent Thursday to end the day above 8,900
points as the high-tech sector staged a rebound from recent losses resulting
from the impact of a rising New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 41.56 points to 8,907.91, after moving between 8,871.01
and 8,920.79, on turnover of NT$128.15 billion (US$4.38 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.19 percent after Wall Street hit a fresh two-year high
overnight and interest in the bellwether electronics sector emerged, in
particular in late trade, as investors picked up bargains by taking advantage of
high-tech stocks' low valuations, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,049 stocks closed up, 2,074 finished down and 437 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gains, ending up 0.6
percent. Textile stocks rose 0.5 percent, plastics and chemicals added 0.4
percent and the construction sector closed up 0.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The cement, along with the paper and pulp sector, rose 0.2 percent, while
foodstuffs fell 0.2 percent and financial stocks closed down 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"After recent consolidation, the electronics sector appeared attractive in terms
of valuation," Taiwan Life Group Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Despite the gains, willingness to chase prices remained low amid fears that a
stronger New Taiwan dollar will hurt the high-tech sector's competitiveness,
according to Shih.</P>
      <P>Shih said that as many foreign investors have been away for the New Year
holiday, turnover failed to expand further to lead the market to a breakthrough.</P>
      <P>"Ahead of a central bank quarterly  policy making meeting scheduled for later in
the day, cautious sentiment also kept the market in range trade," Shih said.</P>
      <P>The market expects the central bank to raise its key interest rates by 0.125
percentage points, since the local economy has significantly rebounded in the
first three quarters of this year.</P>
      <P>Among the high-tech stocks, Largan Precision, the world's largest cell phone
camera lens maker, rose 3.26 percent to close at NT$728.00, while smartphone
producer HTC gained 2.05 percent to end at NT$898.00.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Is George Soros behind latest NT$ rise?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The  Central  Bank  of the  Republic  of China  (CBC)
12/30/10  16:48:43
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>said in a statement Wednesday that a few foreign exchange banks have sold off a
large amount of US dollars on the local currency market at a specific time in
recent trading sessions, leading to market disorder and panic trading.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the money all came from several specific
foreign investment institutions, the statement said, adding that the CBC has
transferred the results of its investigation to the Financial Supervisory
Commission (FSC) in hope of getting to the bottom of any behind-the-scenes
currency speculation.</P>
      <P>Banking sources said George Soros, one of the world's most well-known hedge fund
managers, is widely believed to be the mastermind behind the recent "vulture"
attack on the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Foreign exchange banking sources said international "vulture" groups that have
allegedly attacked Taiwan's currency in recent weeks have invariably remitted
large amounts of U.S. dollars through Citibank Taiwan and another large foreign
bank's local branch.</P>
      <P>The funds were immediately used to buy shares in the local stock exchange under
the name of the two custodian banks to avoid CBC scrutiny, the sources said. The
practice has allowed the real beneficiaries to stay behind the scenes while
engaging in speculative currency and stock trading.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 27, the sources said, funds totaling US$500 million (about NT$15
billion) were dumped on the local foreign exchange market in two installments at
11 a.m. and 2: 30 p.m., respectively, driving the local unit up by over NT$1
during the session.</P>
      <P>The two foreign banks used the same strategy to pump nearly US$300 million into
the currency market again Dec. 29, leading the New Taiwan dollar's exchange rate
to hit a high of 29.375 against the greenback at one point, up NT$1.021 from the
previous day's level.</P>
      <P>According to market sources, the local unit's recent dramatic fluctuations could
be attributed to Soros' speculative trading because inbound capital remittances
have mostly come from Hong Kong since his Quantum Fund set up a branch office
there.</P>
      <P>The CBC invited Citibank executives to a meeting earlier this week to get more
information about the use of capital inflow. The CBC's statement underscored its
determination to shield the New Taiwan dollar from fluctuating too drastically
due to speculative trading, banking sources said. (Dec. 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Although the New Taiwan dollar has tended to close above NT$30 against  the
greenback  in recent weeks because of the CBC's intervention late in each
trading session, the currency is likely to appreciate significantly after the
New Year holiday, banking sources forecast.</P>
      <P>The central bank has to keep the local currency from appreciating too fast
before the year's end to help local exporters secure better accounting reports.
After the start of the new year, the sources said, the CBC will have no reason
to continue its late-session interventions.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, they predicted, the local currency might fluctuate more
drastically in the coming weeks. (Dec. 30, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Thursday that it hopes the
recent controversy between a Taiwanese taekwondo athlete and the Seoul-based
World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) will have minimal effect on the new Taiwan-
Korea working holiday program, which will be launched in three days.</P>
      <P>Applications for the bilateral youth exchange program will be accepted starting
Jan. 1, said Ger Bau-shuan, deputy direct-general of the ministry's Department
of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.</P>
      <P>The program will allow up to 400 Taiwanese and South Korean people aged between
18 and 30 to apply for one-year multiple-entry visas. During their stays, they
will be allowed to take part-time jobs to earn money to fund their visits. South
Korea is the sixth country to set up working holiday programs with Taiwan after
New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.</P>
      <P>Ger said judging from the enthusiastic response to the existing programs,
Taiwanese youth are highly interested in taking "workation" in a foreign country
and it is hoped the taekwondo feud will not dampen the public's interest in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>In November, Taiwanese gold medal hopeful Yang Shu-chun was accused of cheating
by the WTF during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China for allegedly using
non-authorized footgear. Her disqualification immediately ignited a strong wave
of anti-Korean sentiment in Taiwan, with Yang's supporters accusing the Seoul-
based organization of making a false accusation.</P>
      <P>Netizens started several online boycotts of Korean goods and even the organizers
of the Asia-Pacific Film Festival decided not to invite Korean pop entertainers
to perform in this year's award ceremony held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We hope the controversy will not affect the program. The government has made it
clear to the Taiwan public that what happened to Yang has nothing to do with the
Korean people or the government," he said.</P>
      <P>To apply for the program, applicants must provide a proof of finance of at least
US$2,5000 and insurance.</P>
      <P>Moreover, only those with no criminal record and a clean bill of health will be
considered, Ger said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der declined to say Thursday whether Taiwan would
consider taxing hot money from abroad, which has reportedly flooded the local
market in recent days on the back of a rising Taiwan currency.</P>
      <P>Lee said during a legislative session that the hot money issue is a matter for
the Central Bank and the Financial  Supervisory Commission, but it can be
discussed among other relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>The government will draw on the experience of other countries before making any
decision on the issue, he said, noting that Brazil is the only country that has
a tax on hot money.</P>
      <P>Lee was responding to a question in the legislature on whether the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) would consider taking measures, such as the imposition of a tax,
to stem the flow of hot money.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lai Shyh-bao said the MOF should make its
stance on the matter known in light of the influx of hot money.</P>
      <P>The finance minister was also asked to expand on Premier Wu Den-yih's recent
statement that civil servants could expect a pay raise next year.</P>
      <P>He said the exact date for the salary increase has not yet been finalized, but
the MOF will ride the wave of economic recovery and make a decision in line with
public expectations.</P>
      <P>On a bill that was passed by the legislative Finance Committee in May to scrap
income tax exemption for military personnel and teachers of public elementary
and junior high schools, Lee said that if the bill is passed soon, it will
generate some NT$11.2 billion (US$373.33 million) in tax revenues a year.</P>
      <P>If the Income Tax Act amendment is passed, it will affect some 370,000 people,
who will begin to pay income tax in 2012, he said.</P>

      <P>The U.S dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Thursday, shedding NT$0.15 to
close at NT$30.217, but higher than a low of NT$29.080 after intervention by the
central bank.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$1.2 billion during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The U.S. currency opened at NT$30.367 and moved between NT$29.080 and NT$30.379
before the close.</P>
      <P>A rising Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar stirred up selling in the
greenback on the local foreign exchange market, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Further inflows of foreign funds added downward pressure on the U.S. dollar,
prompting exporters to dump their greenback positions before closing their 2010
books as the year comes to an end,  they said.</P>
      <P>The gains posted by the local bourse also paved the way for the upswing in the
New Taiwan dollar, they added.</P>
      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 0.46 percent at 8,907.91.</P>
      <P>The dealers said that although the central bank has launched a probe into
possible speculation staged by foreign banks in the local foreign exchange
market, there were no signs that selling in the U.S. dollar would stop anytime
soon.</P>
      <P>Traders were betting on further appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar in the
hope of continued foreign fund entries, as the U.S. is pumping funds into the
market to boost its economy, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>In late trade, the central bank stepped in again to boost the value of the U.S.
dollar above NT$30.00, a level the market believes is acceptable to the central
bank in the near term.</P>

      <P>The Kuokuang Petrochemical Park investment project will be scaled down to
increase the chances of it passing an environmental impact assessment, the
project's largest shareholder, CPC Corporation, Taiwan, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary plan, the investment volume will be cut down from
more than NT$900 billion (US$30.87 billion) to NT$600.5 billion, said CPC
Chairman Chu Shao-hua at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Also, he continued, planned oil refinery output will be decreased from 450,000
barrels to 300,000 barrels per day, while planned ethylene output will be
reduced from 2.4 million tons to 1.2 million tons per year.</P>
      <P>The number of factories in the park will be lowered from 41 to 25, with the
total area decreased from 2,600 hectares to 1,900 hectares, Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, CPC will invest NT$250 billion in the project, accounting for

      <P>The truth behind the Nov. 26 election eve shooting of former Vice President Lien
Chan's son Lien Sheng-wen must be clarified, the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Thursday, calling for an independent commission to
be set up to probe the matter.</P>
      <P>Lien, also known as Sean Lien, a rising star in the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) ,
was shot in the face on the eve of the country's first five special municipality
elections. The shooting is believed by many opposition supporters of costing DPP
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen her chance to win the Xinbei City mayoral seat.</P>
      <P>"The DPP is not a sore loser. We just want the truth. The public deserves to
know the real motive behind the shooting, " said DPP caucus whip Pan Meng-an at
a press conference.</P>
      <P>The proposal for the commission will be pitched during a Dec. 31 DPP Procedural
Committee meeting, and the party has not ruled out the option of taking legal
recourse to appeal against the election result.</P>
      <P>According to the Civil Servants Election and Recall Act, an appeal against an
election result must be made within 30 days of the official result posted by the
Central Election Commission.</P>
      <P>"The DPP can go ahead and sue, " said KMT Legislator Alex Fei, accusing the
opposition party of practicing "double standards."</P>
      <P>Fei said that during the DPP era, the government pulled all the stops to boycott
a KMT effort to set up an investigation team to unveil the facts on the shooting
of former President Chen Shui-bian on the eve of the 2004 presidential election
in which he won a second term.</P>
      <P>George Hsieh, another KMT lawmaker and deputy caucus whip, called on Tsai to
stop "manipulating the public."</P>
      <P>"The KMT is very eager, probably even more so than the DPP, to find out the
truth, but it seems the DPP is only interested in testing the water to see if
the election results can be invalidated," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien was shot while on stage stumping for a KMT candidate in Yonghe, now part of
Xinbei City. The bullet passed through his cheek and killed a bystander.</P>
      <P>Lien was released from the hospital 10 days after surgery. His speedy recovery
prompted many opposition supporters to speculate over whether the shooting was
staged.</P>
      <P>The shooter was apprehended on the spot and has stuck to his claim that he was
targeting the candidate and shot the wrong person.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday that the administration will make a decision on
pay raises for civil servants in 2011 only after checking the country's economic
growth, tax revenues and other conditions, following up on remarks he made a day
earlier that such pay raises are "expectable."</P>
      <P>Although the administration is "prudently optimistic" about hiking salaries for
civil servants next year, it will still take many relevant factors into
consideration  before making a decision, Government Information Office Minister
Johnny Chi-chen Chiang quoted Wu as saying during a regular Executive Yuan
meeting.</P>
      <P>The factors to be examined will include Taiwan's economic performance in the
last quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2011, the overall tax
revenues, trade, and retailer and wholesaler's business, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan spokesman also quoted Wu as saying that the majority of the
public will not support a government plan to raise salaries for civil servants
if it means running up new debts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversy over the lifting of a ban on imports of American beef was the
number one consumer news story in Taiwan in 2010, according to the Consumers'
Foundation, which has compiled a top-10 list.</P>
      <P>Food safety became a major concern among Taiwan consumers because it was
discovered that a rare case of death from suspected human mad-cow disease had
been kept under wraps at a time when the legislature was amending the Act
Governing Food Sanitation to ban imports of U.S. beef brain and marrow, the
foundation said.</P>
      <P>The death of a young man who had lived for years in the United Kingdom was later
confirmed as a case of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, the foundation said, calling
on health authorities to enforce proper food-safety regulations to reassure the
public.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was the Department of Health's (DOH) attempts to reform the
National Health Insurance (NHI) system while ignoring two major issues that
would go a long way toward saving money in the cash-strapped NHI, the foundation
said.</P>
      <P>The DOH's so-called second-generation reform bill, which sought to calculate
premiums on the basis of household income, totally ignored the "black holes" of
pharmaceutical prices and the huge waste from other practices in the health
system,  according to the foundation.</P>
      <P>It noted that the latest version of the DOH reform proposal, which calls for
bonuses and dividends to be included in the calculation of premiums, was also
controversial because many people saw it as case of "robbing the poor to feed
the rich."</P>
      <P>The third most significant consumer news story selected by the foundation was
about the registration of the "true size" of housing units.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan called the Ministry of the Interior's (MOI) attention to the
problem of inflated house measurements  that incorporated outer walls and
awnings -- a practice that has caused disputes between buyers and sellers of the
real estate,  the foundation noted.</P>
      <P>If the MOI continues to take the issue lightly, the foundation said it will ask
the Control Yuan to investigate the ministry for failure to do its job properly.</P>
      <P>Fourth on the list was a story about the low percentage of drivers who have
installed ETC (electronic toll collection) devices on their vehicles, while more
lanes have been allocated for ETC users on the freeway.</P>

April that mobile phone rates will be lowered by about 5 percent.</P>
      <P>Even with that, the foundation said, cell phone rates in Taiwan were still
relatively high compared to major countries of the world.</P>
      <P>The issue of ticket prices for air travel was sixth on the list. One year after
direct flights were launched between Taiwan and China, the airlines still have
not lowered fares to a reasonable level, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Another air travel story about how a series of management and sanitation
problems  have hurt the image  of Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport was next
on the list.</P>
      <P>In eighth spot was Toyota's recall of its cars after a string of safety and
mechanical problems were reported. In ninth place was a series of incidents
caused by botulinus toxin.</P>
      <P>The 10th story on the list was a change in credit card regulations  to absolve
secondary  card  holders  from  legal responsibility for debts incurred by the
main card holder. The new regulations also stipulate that the issuing
institutions should not charge customers more than NT$200 to replace lost or
stolen credit cards.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan government said Thursday it has set a target of 4.82 percent economic
growth and 4.9 percent unemployment for 2011 as part of its national development
plan.</P>
      <P>"Domestic demand and exports will be the main drivers of the economy," said
Premier Wu Den-yih in a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>He called for a restructuring of industries, expansion of emerging businesses
and the service sector, and greater private sector investment to create more
jobs.</P>
      <P>According to the Council for Economic Planning and Development, the broader goal
is to achieve 4.82 percent economic growth, reduce unemployment to 4.9 percent,
and limit the consumer price index to a less than 2 percent rise.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said that in light of the expected slower growth of the global
economy next year, the general economic goal in Taiwan will be a challenge.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, he said, all agencies are urged to do their best to help achieve
the targets.</P>

      <P>The credit worthiness of all business sectors across the island has improved as
the economy showed signs of stability in 2010, Taiwan Ratings said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Ratings is cautiously optimistic  about the credit evolution of its
rated population, including the corporate, financial and structured finance
sectors in 2011, in view of the recovering economy, " Chief Ratings Officer
Susan Chu said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"Our currently moderate positive rating bias in the corporate and finance
sectors suggests the possibility of more positive than negative ratings in the
coming year," Chu added.</P>
      <P>Chu said the agency expects a continuation of the current transaction asset
performance over the next few quarters.</P>
      <P>However, Chu stressed that the global economy and the world's financial markets
are still unsettled.</P>
      <P>Further improvements, in particular in the financial sector, are expected to be
limited due to "significant obstacles that resulted from the competitive local
environment," she said.</P>
      <P>The rating agency forecast that the slowing global economic conditions and other
negative factors, such as rising production costs in China, a stronger New
Taiwan dollar and volatile commodity prices, will bring new challenges to
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan Ratings said, there could be "significant" volatility in the
ratings performance  of the company's rated population on the island.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural exports have grown substantially this year thanks to the
global economic recovery, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, exports of Taiwan-grown agricultural and aquacultural
products had amounted to US$3.626 billion, up 23.6 percent from the year-earlier
level, the council said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Five items -- eels, dancing lady orchids, butterfly orchids, grouper and green
soybeans -- posted the largest year-on-year growth rates at 105 percent, 95
percent, 33 percent, 25 percent and 12 percent, respectively, according to COA
statistics.</P>
      <P>A COA official said local eel farmers have enjoyed thriving business and extra
profit margins this year because of poor elver catches in Japan, South Korea,
China and major Southeast Asian countries earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Increases in grouper exports, meanwhile, can be attributed to the opening of
direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, a measure that has allowed local
aquaculturists to ship live fish to China efficiently and quickly, the official
said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the May 1-Oct. 31 Shanghai World Expo also contributed greatly to
growth in grouper exports to China, as the event helped promote the image of
Taiwan-raised grouper, the official added.</P>

      <P>Ta Yang Group Holdings Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of silicon rubber
devices,  is seeking regulatory approval to issue Taiwan depositary receipts
(TDRs) on the main board, the Taiwan Stock Exchange said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the company's prospectus, Ta Yang, which runs production facilities
mainly in Dongguan, in China's Guangdong Province, is planning to issue 40
million TDRs, each one of which will represent three common shares of the
company, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Ta Yang said it hopes to raise NT$480 million (US$16.39 million) from the TDR
sale and plans to use most of the funds to build a new self-owned  plant in
China's  Guangxi  Province  to boost its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The company's silicon rubber devices are used in consumer electronics devices
such as keypads for computers and notebooks, and mobile phone handsets, as well
as in automotive peripheral products.</P>
      <P>The TDR sale will "increase public awareness of the group and will promote the
group's corporate image internationally, which will enhance its competitiveness
and be beneficial to the group's overall business development," Ta Yang said in

      <P>Local manufacturers expect better business for the next six months led by
better-than-expected sales of electronics products during the Christmas season
and strong demand during the Lunar New Year holiday, according to a survey
released by Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 31.9 percent of manufacturers hold that view, up from
20.1 percent in October, while those who are neutral about business prospects
have dropped to 54.9 percent from 67.5 percent in October.</P>
      <P>In addition, 13.2 percent of the manufacturers said the economic outlook would
worsen, which was a slight increase from the 12.4 percent who made that forecast
in October.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao, director of TIER's macroeconomics forecasting center, told reporters
at a press conference that contract makers of consumer electronic products such
as smartphones and tablet computers have increased their shipments to emerging
countries thanks to strong consumer demand during the Christmas season.</P>
      <P>Chen said large-scale contractors have taken measures to avoid possible foreign
exchange loss on their exports from the steady appreciation of the Taiwan
currency.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the general economic prospects are expected to rise slightly during
the next six months, he said.</P>
      <P>TIER President David Hong added that although the outlook for the first half of
2011 seems to be moderate economic growth, the recent predictions of higher
salaries and year-end bonuses for corporate employees will drive consumer demand
in the Lunar New Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>"With employees receiving more money, private consumption will increase at the

      <P>The newly elected mayors of Taiwan's five special municipalities said at a
Cabinet meeting Thursday they are worried about the fact that their cities are
burdened with a total debt of NT$769.3 billion (US$25.7 billion).</P>
      <P>The mayors of Taipei, Xinbei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung attended a Cabinet
meeting for the first time since they were sworn in on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet spokesman Johnny Chi-chen Chiang, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
and the others expressed concern over the progress of the amendments to the
Public Debt Act and the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and
Expenditures.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, mayor of Xinbei City, was concerned about the source of funding
for economic development next year, and expressed the hope that the central
government would work with the new mayors to help attract investment, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu asked how the government could help her source the
NT$260 billion required for a major development project in her city called the
Southern Taiwan Joint Services Center, Chiang reported.</P>
      <P>Responding to these and other requests, Premier Wu Den-yih asked his staff to
come up with provisional measures to help the cities tide over their financial
difficulties during the transitional period, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is apparent that the amendments to the two laws could not be
completed this year, and he must take into consideration the concerns of the
other 17 county magistrates and city mayors who were not present at Thursday's
meeting.</P>
      <P>He assured the five mayors that the Cabinet, in cooperation with the local
governments, will find a way to fairly allocate government revenues.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said her council will work with the five municipalities to devise strategies for
attracting investment, based on regional features.</P>
      <P>"A regional brand will be designed first, then efforts will be made to market
the product globally, " she said.  She also quoted Public Construction Minister
Fan Liang-shiow as reporting that more than NT$200 billion in private investment
has been thrown into public construction projects this year.</P>

Chinese investors, the head of the country's top cross-Taiwan Strait negotiation
agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Of all the investment opportunities in Taiwan, Chinese investors are most
interested in research and development because they know Taiwan has talent in
the field, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said in
answer to a questions from ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Huang Yi-chiao.</P>
      <P>Chiang was invited to talk during a presentation  at the Legislative Yuan about
the sixth round of talks he had with his Chinese counterpart, Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President Chen Yunlin earlier this month.</P>
      <P>Asked by Ting Shou-chung, another KMT legislator, whether the government should
be more open to Chinese investment, Chiang said that while he favors the idea,
the authorities are still reviewing relevant measures.</P>
      <P>Ting criticized the government for maintaining a cap on Chinese investment while
South Korea, which has exports very similar to those of Taiwan, is ready to sign
or discuss free trade deals with the European Union, the United States and the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</P>

      <P>The Chinese authorities remain the major obstacle to Taiwan's opening to
independent tourists from China, as the Chinese side needs time to sort out
technical and coping measures, Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, minister of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
said during a legislative meeting that the MAC is not to blame for the delay in
Taiwan's opening to Chinese citizens traveling to Taiwan individually without
being confined to tour groups.</P>
      <P>"At present, I cannot guarantee that the opening will take place at around the
Chinese New Year holiday, as many technical problems need to be addressed," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>However, she said it will not require another high-level meeting between the
heads of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to make the opening
plan effective, adding that all that is required is for the two intermediary
bodies to reach a consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>Fears that the opening will cause Taiwan to become over-dependent on Chinese
tourists for the country's tourism development are not a consideration for the
MAC, Lai said.</P>
      <P>On allegations that Taiwan will require prepaid deposits by independent Chinese
tourists as guarantees prior to their arrival, she said that "the issue is being
discussed."</P>
      <P>During the most recent round of SEF-ARATS talks, Taiwan and China agreed to open
Taiwan further to Chinese tourists, increasing the daily cap on Chinese tourist
arrivals from 3,000 to 4,000.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chinese tourists, who are allowed in only as part of organized
groups, make up about 30 percent of the total number of tourists from abroad --
a number that is expected to top 5.5 million this year and exceed 6.5 million in

elected  officials Thursday, with more expected to be sued the following day.</P>

      <P>The four councilors are Tseng Shui-wen, Chang Feng-teng, Yang Jian-fu and Lee
Hung-jun. Chang was charged with bribery through his sponsorship of an eco-tour
of Kaohsiung Harbor, while the other three were charged with vote-buying.</P>
      <P>All of them said they were stunned and that they had no idea why they had been
charged.</P>

ecology tour for which each participant paid NT$100.</P>
      <P>"I told the prosecutors  clearly that this was purely an educational activity. I
cannot comprehend why they're suing me, " he added.</P>
      <P>Yang for his part said that prosecutors searched his campaign office three days

him go if he was a suspect.</P>
      <P>The 12 ward chiefs  were charged  with  various  election irregularities.</P>
      <P>Under the law, lawsuits for invalidating the election of public office holders
must be filed within one month of the election commission making the election
results public.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City's election commission announced the winners of the Nov. 26
municipal elections Dec. 2, so the prosecutors still had two days to file suits

      <P>A Taiwanese taekwondo athlete who has filed an appeal with the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against her disqualification at the 2010 Asian Games
will decide next week whether to go ahead with the appeal or drop the plan, an
insider familiar with the matter said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Yang Shu-chun will discuss the issue with her coach Liu Tsung-ta and is likely
to come up with a final decision on whether she will continue seeking to have
the CAS hear her case or simply withdraw her application for arbitration,"
Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) Chairman Chen Chien-ping said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Yang has taken many factors into consideration and her prime
concern is to avoid undermining other athletes' chances of competing in
international competitions.</P>
      <P>"It is understood that the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) will first suspend
the CTTA once the case enters the CAS arbitration process, and this would hugely
affect other athletes' rights and interests," he said.</P>
      <P>"However, we will fully respect Yang's decision," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang was banned from competition for three months by the WTF Dec. 21 for
refusing to leave the mat after being disqualified in her opening round bout in

    <HEADLINE>3 draft versions unveiled for new health premium calculation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
12/30/10  23:02:23
(By Chen Li-ting and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) unveiled three formulas Thursday for calculating
national health insurance premiums based on a revised package proposed by the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , all of which allow for lower premium rates in the
initial stage.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said all three versions were formulated on the
basis of KMT-initiated revisions to the existing National Health Insurance (NHI)
Act, which suggest differentiating the premium rates on the regular salaries of
the insured and four additional types of income.</P>
      <P>The first version proposes that the premium rate be set at 5 percent of the
insured's regular salary in the first five years of its implementation, with the
government contributing at least 36 percent of the coverage amount. The current
premium rate is 5.1 7 percent.</P>
      <P>This version also calls for an additional NT$20 billion in "supplement premiums"
to be levied from four other types of income -- interest income, stock
dividends, professional practice income and any cash awards that are four times
more than a person's monthly salary. The premium rate for the "supplement
premiums" is tentatively set at 2 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's estimate, this version would allow the NHI system to
remain solvent for five years, with at least a one-month reserve.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yaung said, if the system is put into practice in 2012, the
premium rate will need to be raised to 5.12 percent in 2017 and further adjusted
annually to 6.11 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>As the existing NHI Act caps the premium rate at 6 percent, the law would have
to be revised by then, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has proposed two other premium collection formulas, the
minister said, the first version is most preferable in terms of
"professionalism."</P>
      <P>The second version does not require raising a monthly reserve fund, which would
allow the 5 percent premium rate to remain unchanged in the first six years
until 2017. But the rate would be raised to 5.09 percent in 2018 and would also
exceed the 6 percent ceiling to hit 6.1 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>The third version proposes lowering the premium rate from the current 5.17
percent to 4.61 percent in 2012 and then raising the rate to 4.72 percent in
2013, 4.84 percent in 2014, 4.96 percent in 2015, 5.15 percent in 2016 and 5.31
percent in 2017. The rate would also surge past 6 percent to hit 6.02 percent in
2021 under this formula.</P>
      <P>The differences in the three versions mainly lie in whether the NHI system
should raise reserve funds as a hedge against financial instability, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said earlier in the day that the
legislature will deal with issues surrounding the NHI Act Jan. 4, with the KMT-
proposed revisions as the basis.</P>
      <P>Given the lack of consensus between the ruling and opposition parties on 28 to
29 articles of the draft package, a showdown vote could be inevitable, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>"Legislative caucus whips from both the KMT and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party will be allowed to air their views and positions in the Jan. 4
legislative session before a vote on the package is held," he added.</P>

      <P>The credit worthiness of all business sectors across the island has improved as
the economy showed signs of stability in 2010, Taiwan Ratings said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Ratings is cautiously optimistic  about the credit evolution of its
rated population, including the corporate, financial and structured finance
sectors in 2011, in view of the recovering economy, " Chief Ratings Officer
Susan Chu said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"Our currently moderate positive rating bias in the corporate and finance
sectors suggests the possibility of more positive than negative ratings in the
coming year," Chu added.</P>
      <P>Chu said the agency expects a continuation of the current transaction asset
performance over the next few quarters.</P>
      <P>However, Chu stressed that the global economy and the world's financial markets
are still unsettled.</P>
      <P>Further improvements, in particular in the financial sector, are expected to be
limited due to "significant obstacles that resulted from the competitive local
environment," she said.</P>
      <P>The rating agency forecast that the slowing global economic conditions and other
negative factors, such as rising production costs in China, a stronger New
Taiwan dollar and volatile commodity prices, will bring new challenges to
Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan Ratings said, there could be "significant" volatility in the
ratings performance  of the company's rated population on the island.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's agricultural exports have grown substantially this year thanks to the
global economic recovery, the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of the end of November, exports of Taiwan-grown agricultural and aquacultural
products had amounted to US$3.626 billion, up 23.6 percent from the year-earlier
level, the council said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Five items -- eels, dancing lady orchids, butterfly orchids, grouper and green
soybeans -- posted the largest year-on-year growth rates at 105 percent, 95
percent, 33 percent, 25 percent and 12 percent, respectively, according to COA
statistics.</P>
      <P>A COA official said local eel farmers have enjoyed thriving business and extra
profit margins this year because of poor elver catches in Japan, South Korea,
China and major Southeast Asian countries earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Increases in grouper exports, meanwhile, can be attributed to the opening of
direct shipping links across the Taiwan Strait, a measure that has allowed local
aquaculturists to ship live fish to China efficiently and quickly, the official
said.</P>
      <P>In addition,  the May 1-Oct. 31 Shanghai World Expo also contributed greatly to
growth in grouper exports to China, as the event helped promote the image of
Taiwan-raised grouper, the official added.</P>

      <P>Ta Yang Group Holdings Ltd., a China-based manufacturer of silicon rubber
devices,  is seeking regulatory approval to issue Taiwan depositary receipts
(TDRs) on the main board, the Taiwan Stock Exchange said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the company's prospectus, Ta Yang, which runs production facilities
mainly in Dongguan, in China's Guangdong Province, is planning to issue 40
million TDRs, each one of which will represent three common shares of the
company, which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>Ta Yang said it hopes to raise NT$480 million (US$16.39 million) from the TDR
sale and plans to use most of the funds to build a new self-owned  plant in
China's  Guangxi  Province  to boost its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The company's silicon rubber devices are used in consumer electronics devices
such as keypads for computers and notebooks, and mobile phone handsets, as well
as in automotive peripheral products.</P>
      <P>The TDR sale will "increase public awareness of the group and will promote the
group's corporate image internationally, which will enhance its competitiveness
and be beneficial to the group's overall business development," Ta Yang said in
a statement on its website.</P>
      <P>In the year to July 31, 2010, Ta Yang posted about NT$252 million in net profit,

      <P>Local manufacturers expect better business for the next six months led by
better-than-expected sales of electronics products during the Christmas season
and strong demand during the Lunar New Year holiday, according to a survey
released by Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER).</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 31.9 percent of manufacturers hold that view, up from
20.1 percent in October, while those who are neutral about business prospects
have dropped to 54.9 percent from 67.5 percent in October.</P>
      <P>In addition, 13.2 percent of the manufacturers said the economic outlook would
worsen, which was a slight increase from the 12.4 percent who made that forecast
in October.</P>
      <P>Chen Miao, director of TIER's macroeconomics forecasting center, told reporters
at a press conference that contract makers of consumer electronic products such
as smartphones and tablet computers have increased their shipments to emerging
countries thanks to strong consumer demand during the Christmas season.</P>
      <P>Chen said large-scale contractors have taken measures to avoid possible foreign
exchange loss on their exports from the steady appreciation of the Taiwan
currency.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the general economic prospects are expected to rise slightly during
the next six months, he said.</P>
      <P>TIER President David Hong added that although the outlook for the first half of
2011 seems to be moderate economic growth, the recent predictions of higher
salaries and year-end bonuses for corporate employees will drive consumer demand
in the Lunar New Year's holiday.</P>
      <P>"With employees receiving more money, private consumption will increase at the

      <P>The newly elected mayors of Taiwan's five special municipalities said at a
Cabinet meeting Thursday they are worried about the fact that their cities are
burdened with a total debt of NT$769.3 billion (US$25.7 billion).</P>
      <P>The mayors of Taipei, Xinbei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung attended a Cabinet
meeting for the first time since they were sworn in on Dec. 25.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet spokesman Johnny Chi-chen Chiang, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu
and the others expressed concern over the progress of the amendments to the
Public Debt Act and the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and
Expenditures.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, mayor of Xinbei City, was concerned about the source of funding
for economic development next year, and expressed the hope that the central
government would work with the new mayors to help attract investment, Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu asked how the government could help her source the
NT$260 billion required for a major development project in her city called the
Southern Taiwan Joint Services Center, Chiang reported.</P>
      <P>Responding to these and other requests, Premier Wu Den-yih asked his staff to
come up with provisional measures to help the cities tide over their financial
difficulties during the transitional period, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is apparent that the amendments to the two laws could not be
completed this year, and he must take into consideration the concerns of the
other 17 county magistrates and city mayors who were not present at Thursday's
meeting.</P>
      <P>He assured the five mayors that the Cabinet, in cooperation with the local
governments, will find a way to fairly allocate government revenues.</P>
      <P>Christina Liu, minister of the Council for Economic Planning and Development,
said her council will work with the five municipalities to devise strategies for
attracting investment, based on regional features.</P>
      <P>"A regional brand will be designed first, then efforts will be made to market
the product globally, " she said.  She also quoted Public Construction Minister
Fan Liang-shiow as reporting that more than NT$200 billion in private investment
has been thrown into public construction projects this year.</P>
      <P>Liu said she would ask her staff to provide Chen Chu with a list of investment

      <P>Of all the investment opportunities in Taiwan, Chinese investors are most
interested in research and development because they know Taiwan has talent in

      <P>Asked by Ting Shou-chung, another KMT legislator, whether the government should
be more open to Chinese investment, Chiang said that while he favors the idea,
the authorities are still reviewing relevant measures.</P>
      <P>Ting criticized the government for maintaining a cap on Chinese investment while
South Korea, which has exports very similar to those of Taiwan, is ready to sign
or discuss free trade deals with the European Union, the United States and the

      <P>The Chinese authorities remain the major obstacle to Taiwan's opening to
independent tourists from China, as the Chinese side needs time to sort out
technical and coping measures, Taiwan's top China policy coordinator said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, minister of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
said during a legislative meeting that the MAC is not to blame for the delay in
Taiwan's opening to Chinese citizens traveling to Taiwan individually without
being confined to tour groups.</P>
      <P>"At present, I cannot guarantee that the opening will take place at around the
Chinese New Year holiday, as many technical problems need to be addressed," Lai
said.</P>
      <P>However, she said it will not require another high-level meeting between the
heads of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to make the opening
plan effective, adding that all that is required is for the two intermediary
bodies to reach a consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>Fears that the opening will cause Taiwan to become over-dependent on Chinese
tourists for the country's tourism development are not a consideration for the
MAC, Lai said.</P>
      <P>On allegations that Taiwan will require prepaid deposits by independent Chinese
tourists as guarantees prior to their arrival, she said that "the issue is being
discussed."</P>
      <P>During the most recent round of SEF-ARATS talks, Taiwan and China agreed to open
Taiwan further to Chinese tourists, increasing the daily cap on Chinese tourist
arrivals from 3,000 to 4,000.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Chinese tourists, who are allowed in only as part of organized
groups, make up about 30 percent of the total number of tourists from abroad --
a number that is expected to top 5.5 million this year and exceed 6.5 million in
2011, according to Lai.</P>

      <P>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office filed invalidation  suits against 16
elected  officials Thursday, with more expected to be sued the following day.</P>
      <P>Of the 16, four are city councilors and 12 are ward chiefs.</P>
      <P>The four councilors are Tseng Shui-wen, Chang Feng-teng, Yang Jian-fu and Lee
Hung-jun. Chang was charged with bribery through his sponsorship of an eco-tour
of Kaohsiung Harbor, while the other three were charged with vote-buying.</P>
      <P>All of them said they were stunned and that they had no idea why they had been
charged.</P>
      <P>Chang said his local environmental education association had sponsored a marine
ecology tour for which each participant paid NT$100.</P>
      <P>"I told the prosecutors  clearly that this was purely an educational activity. I
cannot comprehend why they're suing me, " he added.</P>
      <P>Yang for his part said that prosecutors searched his campaign office three days
ago and interviewed him in their office. He questioned why they would have let
him go if he was a suspect.</P>
      <P>The 12 ward chiefs  were charged  with  various  election irregularities.</P>
      <P>Under the law, lawsuits for invalidating the election of public office holders
must be filed within one month of the election commission making the election
results public.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City's election commission announced the winners of the Nov. 26
municipal elections Dec. 2, so the prosecutors still had two days to file suits
against other suspected law-breakers.</P>
      <P>The court will accept invalidation suits Jan. 3 at the latest, as the first two
days of January are holidays.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taekwondo athlete might retract appeal over disqualification</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese taekwondo athlete who has filed an appeal with the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against her disqualification at the 2010 Asian Games
will decide next week whether to go ahead with the appeal or drop the plan, an
insider familiar with the matter said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Yang Shu-chun will discuss the issue with her coach Liu Tsung-ta and is likely
to come up with a final decision on whether she will continue seeking to have
the CAS hear her case or simply withdraw her application for arbitration,"
Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association (CTTA) Chairman Chen Chien-ping said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Yang has taken many factors into consideration and her prime
concern is to avoid undermining other athletes' chances of competing in
international competitions.</P>
      <P>"It is understood that the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) will first suspend
the CTTA once the case enters the CAS arbitration process, and this would hugely
affect other athletes' rights and interests," he said.</P>
      <P>"However, we will fully respect Yang's decision," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang was banned from competition for three months by the WTF Dec. 21 for
refusing to leave the mat after being disqualified in her opening round bout in
the games for allegedly wearing two extra electronic sensors on her socks. Yang
was enjoying a 9-0 lead at that point, and replays of the match show that she
had removed the two extra sensors before entering the ring.</P>
      <P>Liu, who lodged a protest after the disqualification, was punished with a
20-month suspension,  and the CTTA was fined US$50,000.</P>
      <P>The CTTA has until Jan. 31 to pay the fine and will be suspended by the WTF if
it fails to comply, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Yang filed an application Dec. 8 for a CAS ruling on her disqualification. The
Switzerland-based CAS might issue a ruling within three months of its decision
on whether it will hear the appeal.</P>
      <P>"The council will stand firmly behind the athlete and it has been consistent in
this regard, " Sports Affairs Council Deputy Minister Steven Chen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"If Yang decides to retract the appeal, she will have to provide a convincing
explanation to Taiwan's people," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 draft versions unveiled for new health premium calculation</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
12/30/10  23:02:23
(By Chen Li-ting and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) unveiled three formulas Thursday for calculating
national health insurance premiums based on a revised package proposed by the
ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , all of which allow for lower premium rates in the
initial stage.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said all three versions were formulated on the
basis of KMT-initiated revisions to the existing National Health Insurance (NHI)
Act, which suggest differentiating the premium rates on the regular salaries of
the insured and four additional types of income.</P>
      <P>The first version proposes that the premium rate be set at 5 percent of the
insured's regular salary in the first five years of its implementation, with the
government contributing at least 36 percent of the coverage amount. The current
premium rate is 5.1 7 percent.</P>
      <P>This version also calls for an additional NT$20 billion in "supplement premiums"
to be levied from four other types of income -- interest income, stock
dividends, professional practice income and any cash awards that are four times
more than a person's monthly salary. The premium rate for the "supplement
premiums" is tentatively set at 2 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's estimate, this version would allow the NHI system to
remain solvent for five years, with at least a one-month reserve.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yaung said, if the system is put into practice in 2012, the
premium rate will need to be raised to 5.12 percent in 2017 and further adjusted
annually to 6.11 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>As the existing NHI Act caps the premium rate at 6 percent, the law would have
to be revised by then, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has proposed two other premium collection formulas, the
minister said, the first version is most preferable in terms of
"professionalism."</P>
      <P>The second version does not require raising a monthly reserve fund, which would
allow the 5 percent premium rate to remain unchanged in the first six years
until 2017. But the rate would be raised to 5.09 percent in 2018 and would also
exceed the 6 percent ceiling to hit 6.1 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>The third version proposes lowering the premium rate from the current 5.17
percent to 4.61 percent in 2012 and then raising the rate to 4.72 percent in
2013, 4.84 percent in 2014, 4.96 percent in 2015, 5.15 percent in 2016 and 5.31
percent in 2017. The rate would also surge past 6 percent to hit 6.02 percent in
2021 under this formula.</P>
      <P>The differences in the three versions mainly lie in whether the NHI system
should raise reserve funds as a hedge against financial instability, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said earlier in the day that the
legislature will deal with issues surrounding the NHI Act Jan. 4, with the KMT-
proposed revisions as the basis.</P>
      <P>Given the lack of consensus between the ruling and opposition parties on 28 to
29 articles of the draft package, a showdown vote could be inevitable, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>"Legislative caucus whips from both the KMT and the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party will be allowed to air their views and positions in the Jan. 4
legislative session before a vote on the package is held," he added.</P>

      <P>Tomorrow will be the beginning of the second decade of the 21st Century and the
100th year of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>We earnestly hope that in the new year, Taiwan will be able to leave "chaos"
behind and bid farewell to "sluggishness."</P>
      <P>"Chaos" was the word chosen by the Taiwanese people to represent the year 2008,
when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers triggered a global financial crisis. The
word in fact also epitomizes the general state of mind of the Taiwanese people
in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Sluggishness, " meanwhile, was selected to represent 2010, which reflects the
phenomenon of an economic recovery that has not been felt by the majority.</P>
      <P>The economic growth for 2010 is projected at close to 10 percent, but this has
not been felt by average people. The government therefore has a responsibility
to find a reasonable mechanism to spread the gains made by the business sector,
so that everyone can benefit from them.</P>
      <P>In fact, in order to muster a positive force in society, it is important for the
rich to be generous. It would be very helpful if Taiwan's richest man -- Hon Hai
Group Chairman Terry Gou -- could initiate a philanthropic drive similar to the
"The Giving Pledge" promoted by billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.</P>
      <P>The 100th year of the ROC will be the inaugural year for municipal restructuring
and for the cross-Taiwan Strait Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement. It
will also be the homestretch year to the 2012 presidential election. Despite all
this, we hope to see greater "domestic stability" in the coming year. (Editorial

      <P>The Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has officially
initiated an arbitration on the disqualification of Taiwanese taekwondo athlete
Yang Shu-chun at the 2010 Asian Games, a CAS official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Matthieu Reeb, secretary-general of the international arbitration body, told CNA
via e-mail that the procedure will be divided into two phases: filing of written
submissions, followed by hearings.</P>
      <P>"For the moment, we are still in phase one, which will probably last four or
five more weeks," Reeb said.</P>
      <P>However, he declined to offer any further details, on the grounds that
confidentiality is required by the procedural rules.</P>
      <P>The news came just as Yang was considering whether to retract her appeal, which
was filed Dec. 8 with the CAS. There have been concerns that once the case
enters the CAS arbitration process, the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) might
suspend the Chinese Taipei Taekwondo Association, which will affect other
athletes' chances of competing in international competitions.</P>
      <P>Yang was disqualified Nov. 17 for allegedly wearing extra electronic sensors in
her socks at the Asian Games. Yang was enjoying a 9-0 lead at that point, and
replays of the match show that as instructed by games officials, she had removed

      <P>The WTF banned Yang from competition for three months Dec. 21 on the grounds

    <HEADLINE>NCKU To Give Lectures at NQU To Benefit Students from NQU and XMU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/31/10  14:28:30</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Based on the cooperation foundations of the strategic alliance, National Cheng
Kung University will first organize a team of excellent professors to start
giving lectures at National Quemoy University starting February, 2011, and in
the future start giving lectures at Xiamen University as well.</P>
      <P>Similarly, when the time is ripe, Xiamen University will also organize a team of
outstanding professors to give lectures at National Quemoy University, and the
lectures are open to students from National Cheng Kung University, National
Quemoy University and Xiamen University and will allow them to choose credits
freely.</P>
      <P>The participants of the conference call, which took place at 9am, December 30th,
in the offices of each university, include President Chin-Cheng Lee of National
Quemoy University, Vice-President Zhang Ying of Xiamen University, Senior
Executive Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng of National Cheng Kung University,
Director Jiunn-Der Liao of NCKU Department of Materials Science and Engineering,
and other senior heads.</P>
      <P>NCKU Senior Executive Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng expressed,Xiamen University
is one of the top universities in mainland China, and National Cheng Kung
University is also one of the top universities in Taiwan. National Quemoy
University, because of its unique geographical location, is the best cross-
strait exchange platform. Particularly, NCKU is the only university named after
Koxinga Cheng-Kung Cheng with historical elements and culture aspects tracing
back to Southern Fujian Culture. The cooperation mode of the three universities
is the beginning of cross-strait higher education cooperation. In the future, we
can expand the level of cooperation and quicken the development of cross-strait
higher education for the 21st century to become an era of Asia.</P>
      <P>President Chin-Cheng Lee of National Quemoy University revealed,The conference
call with Xiamen University and National Cheng Kung University is a new
undertaking of cross-strait academic exchange. Koxinga Cheng-Kung Cheng landed
at Tainan from Kinmen and Xiamen 400 years ago and National Cheng Kung
University is the only university named after him. Following the route, we are
on our way to success. The strategic alliance formed by NCKU, XMU and NQU
already has many cooperation plans. National Quemoy University is extremely
honored to be part of something great. Step by step, we will contribute to the
road of success and make it worthy of its name.</P>
      <P>NCKU Senior Executive Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng pointed out,National Quemoy
University plays a significant role in Taiwan Strait. It is an important island
in the Xiamen living circle but it is also part of Taiwan and the residence of
overseas Chinese people, embodying the unique characteristics of mainland China,
Taiwan and Southeast Asia. As I grew up in Singapore, I have a strong feeling
toward Xiamen University. I have also attended classes offered by Xiamen
University during middle school. It is truly a historical coincidence.</P>
      <P>NCKU Director Jiunn-Der Liao of the Department of Materials Science and
Engineering said,We have visited National Quemoy University and Xiamen
University and some of the professors in March, 2010, and reached a consensus on
jointly opening programs. NCKU has especially selected 9 renowned professors to
participate in the program starting February, 2011, in National Quemoy
University.</P>
      <P>The 9 professors, including Director Jiunn-Der Liao of NCKU Department of
Materials Science and Engineering, Distinguished Prof. Wen-Ta Tsai of NCKU
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Prof. Lien-Chung Hsu of NCKU
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Prof. Kuan-Zong Fung of NCKU
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Prof. Xiao-Ding Qi of NCKU
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Director Jia-Jin Chen of NCKU
institute of Biomedical Engineering, Prof. Shyh-Hau Wang of NCKU Department of
Computer Science and Information Engineering, Prof. Hsi-Wen Yang of NUU
Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and Prof. Yung-Der Juang of
NUTN Department of Materials Science, have been appointed as Adjunct Professors
at National Quemoy University.</P>
      <P>President Chin-Cheng Lee of National Quemoy University has revealed his sincere
gratitude toward Director Jiunn-Der Liao for his efforts in organizing a
professional team to come to National Quemoy University,The professors are not
only highly educated, their research achievements are also excellent. In the
future, the professors will take turns to give lectures, 6 hours each time, and
NQU will arrange a professor to be responsible for the whole course, so
students' learning can be more smooth and complete.</P>
      <P>In addition, in response to XMU Vice-President Zhang Ying's inquiry about the
programs offered at National Quemoy University by the NCKU professional team,
Director Jiunn-Der Liao mentioned,The 9 professors will give lectures twice per
week on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, and they may also give lectures
at Xiamen University on Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng suggested,We should create a website for the teams
of professors organized by Xiamen University and National Cheng Kung University
to show their information and the lecture information in details and produce a
space for mutual exchange and discussion. This would be absolutely
unprecedented.</P>
      <P>President Chin-Cheng Lee of National Quemoy University also stated,The academic
performance of NCKU Department of Materials Science and Engineering in the world
ranking is extremely well, and it is definitely the world's top team. To become
the first in opening cross-strait cooperation programs, NCKU Department of
Materials Science and Engineering undeniably has the mind of looking
international.</P>
      <P>Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng pointed out, In the current cross-strait political
atmosphere, it is not convenient for professors or students from mainland China
to go to Kinmen. I hope through future academic exchange, cross-strait senior
personnel can understand the academic needs and consider loosening restrictions,
allowing a more convenient come and go for the professors and students. Even
though it is a huge project, I am confident that we will gradually overcome the
difficulties in the future.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Vice-President Feng's thoughts, Vice-President Zhang Ying said,We
welcome NCKU professional team to come to Xiamen University to give lectures. In
the beginning, we can arrange Friday afternoon for the lectures. The lectures
are regular courses with credits. I hope NCKU and NQU can pass the proposal to
XMU as soon as possible, so we can make early planning.</P>
      <P>President Chin-Cheng Lee also said,Kinmen is more than 300 km away from NCKU,
which is a little bit far. However, the distance between Kinmen and XMU is
merely 10 km. Therefore, following the example of National Cheng Kung
University, it is possible in the future that Xiamen University may also
organize a team of professors to give lectures at National Quemoy University and
participate in other academic exchange and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Vice-President Da-Hsuan Feng has praised the macro cooperation under the joint
efforts of the three universities to be a significant step for the development
of cross-strait higher education. Contact Information: Crystal Chen News Center

      <P>Taiwanese right-hander Chien-Ming Wang, who has recently signed a one-year
contract to rejoin the Washington Nationals in U.S. Major League Baseball (MLB),
said at a function in Taipei Friday that he looks forward to returning to the
MLB in the coming year.</P>
      <P>Wang said at a charity drive that he has made a New Year resolution to return to
the MLB next year, hopefully in May.</P>
      <P>He signed with the Nationals in February for one year with a guaranteed US$2
million salary, but has been in rehabilitation for the past 15 months and has
not pitched for the Nationals in any MLB game.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old Wang, who has been on a home visit in Taiwan since November,
said he has spent most of his time training and rehabilitating to prepare for a
comeback.</P>
      <P>He met with the press and children that his foundation -- the Wangderful Kids
Fund -- has sponsored at the event to raise funds and renew the foundation's
commitment for 2011.</P>
      <P>The recipients of Wangderful Kids Fund donations over the past two years include
the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families, the Red Cross Society of the Republic
of China and the Paper Windmill Cultural and Educational Foundation.</P>
      <P>Although Wang will receive only half the guaranteed salary of his previous
contract, he can secure up to US$4 million in incentives next season.</P>
      <P>He will be paid US$250,000 if he stays on the 25-man roster for more than 30
days, a further US$250,000 if he stays for 30 more days and an additional
US$250,000 if he stays for another 30 days after that, according to his new
contract with the Nationals.</P>
      <P>Wang won more games than any other big league pitcher (38) between 2006 and
2007, but his injuries have limited him to just 27 appearances over the past two
years.</P>
      <P>In 2009, when he earned US$5 million with the New York Yankees, Wang was 1-6
with an atrocious 9.64 ERA before being shut down for the season because of his
shoulder injury.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Convenience stores' new focus</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>12/31/10  17:11:42
(Business Weekly 1204)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tough competition among convenience stores in Taiwan has forced them to abandon
the traditional business model that focuses on revenue per ping (3.3 square
meters) and employ new store designs to enter the coffee shop and eatery market.</P>
      <P>"Opening bigger stores is the current trend," said James Hsieh, chief operating
officer at President Chain Store Corp. that operates 7-Elevens in Taiwan. He
noted that 60 percent of the 4,750 7-Eleven stores in Taiwan now have a seating
area.</P>
      <P>In the last three years, expansion in terms of the number of convenience stores
in Taiwan has slowed down. On average, convenience stores are now only about six
minutes walk apart. The challenge therefore is how to increase the chains'
customer base in a crowded market.</P>
      <P>Based on its surveys that showed shoppers at convenience stores like to have a
place to sit, 7-Eleven two years ago began setting up seating areas comprising
counters and stools in its stores -- a move that has been well received.</P>
      <P>Similarly, 80 percent of FamilyMart stores, Taiwan's second largest convenience
store chain, have also been outfitted with seats as part of a goal to increase
sales of fresh food products such as packaged meals and sandwiches, which have a
higher gross margin.</P>
      <P>FamilyMart said the sale of fresh food items currently accounts for only 12
percent of its revenue. In Taiwan, the industry average is 20 percent, while in
Japan and Shanghai it is 30-40 percent.</P>
      <P>While its fresh food prices are not as competitive as at food stands and other
sidewalk eateries, FamilyMart said, it has the advantage of being open around
the clock.</P>
      <P>The changing trend in convenience stores means that smaller 25-ping ones that
serve as modern grocery stores are being expanded to 35-45 pings so they can
also function as coffee shops and small restaurants.</P>
      <P>"In the short term, the revenue-per-ping might appear to be falling, but the
total revenue will increase in the long run, " said Wu Sheng-fu, vice president
of FamilyMart.</P>
      <P>The site preference is changing as well, as the chains are no longer going for
the high-cost corner locations but rather are choosing less expensive but bigger
spaces.</P>
      <P>The trend now is to have more spacious convenience stores with lower shelves and
wider aisles, according to Wu Shih-hao, associate professor of National
Kaohsiung First University of Science and Technology's Marketing and
Distribution Management Department.</P>
      <P>"The layout of the stores is being altered," he noted.</P>
      <P>Hi-Life, the third largest convenience store chain in Taiwan, has gone a step
further and installed bakeries at 175 of its stores, which means fresh bread is
made on-site every day. At some of its shops, fresh sandwiches and burgers are
also made on site.</P>
      <P>Beryl Lee, secretary-general of Taiwan's Association of Service Industries, said
that after a period of rapid expansion, the convenience store business is now in
the process of fine-tuning.</P>
      <P>"Unlike the manufacturing sector that makes specific products, the service
sector has an invisible yet dynamic research and development aspect, " Lee said.
"In fact, convenience stores have innovations every day."</P>

      <P>The passage of the Taiwan-China economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
amid clashes and differences between the ruling and opposition parties in August
was selected as the top legislative news story in 2010, the Citizen Congress
Watch said Friday.</P>
      <P>The story was considered the most edifying, influential and controversial
legislative event of the year, according to the watchdog group, which compiled a
list of the top 10 legislative news items based on an online poll.</P>
      <P>The year's second-biggest  legislative  news story was the obstacle-plagued
efforts to introduce a second-generation National Health Insurance system,
followed by the passage of bills related to the central government's
restructuring project.</P>
      <P>Also, "bluff" was chosen as the word that best represents the performance of the
Legislative Yuan in 2010.</P>
      <P>According to Ho Tzung-hsun, executive director of the group, the word was
selected because the legislature has failed to honor its promises to enact many
important legislation, including a number of sunshine laws.</P>
      <P>The world "selfish" was picked in 2009, while "dark" was chosen in 2008.</P>

      <P>Thousands of people flocked to the Yongkang railway station in Tainan, southern
Taiwan Friday to buy Republic of China Centennial commemorative tickets for the
route between Yongkang and Baoan, according to Yongkang station master Lin Wen-
chin.</P>
      <P>Lin said people started queuing up at the Yongkang railway station on Thursday
night to obtain the Taiwan Railway Administration tickets, which were not due to
go on sale until 8 a.m. Friday.</P>
      <P>At one point, the queue stretched for one kilometer, Lin said, estimating that
it took buyers at least two hours to get to the sales counter.</P>
      <P>In Chinese, a rearrangement of the characters for Yongkang and Baoan produces
the Chinese phrase "Yong Bao An Kang, " which means "peace and health forever."</P>
      <P>The commemorative tickets are being sold in sets of two, with one dated Dec. 31,
2010 and the other Jan. 1, 2011 -- the date when the Republic of China will mark
100th founding anniversary. New Year greetings are printed on the back of each
ticket.</P>
      <P>The TRA issued a total of 50,000 sets of commemorative tickets in red packets
that symbolize good luck and fortune in Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the EasyCard Corp. will release a limited edition of commemorative
cards Saturday, also to mark the 100th anniversary of the ROC.</P>
      <P>In the two-card sets, one of the cards bears the words "ROC Centennial Easy
Card" in Chinese calligraphy, while other features the national flag of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Easy cards are used for payment on the Taipei area mass rapid transit and public

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese fishing boat was feared to have been hijacked by Somali pirates in
waters near Madagascar off the coast of eastern Africa after having been out of
contact since Dec. 25, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a press
release Friday.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung-based longliner Hsiuh Fu No. 1 lost contact with its Taiwanese
owner after being chased by unknown vessels Dec. 25 and the MOFA said it could
have been hijacked in Madagascar's exclusive economic zone, given recent
extensive Somali piracy activities there.</P>
      <P>There were 26 people on board, including the Taiwanese skipper, as well as 12
Chinese and 13 Vietnamese crewmen, according to the Council of Agriculture's
Fishery Agency.</P>
      <P>The MOFA launched an emergency mission upon learning about the vessel's
disappearance, instructing Taiwan's representative office in Cape Town, South
Africa to seek assistance from the government of Madagascar as well as
contacting the Malaysia-based International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting
Center, the ministry said in the press release.</P>
      <P>The maritime watchdog Ecoterra International said on its website that the Shiuh
Fu No. 1, which is licensed by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission to fish in the
waters, had been hijacked and that "on Dec. 28 the vessel maintained a strange,
patrol-like pattern along Latitude 52 on the northeastern side of Madagascar."</P>
      <P>The European Union Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) Somalia reported that there are
"strong indications that FV Shiuh Fu No. 1 has been pirated" and the conditions
of the crew and the vessel are unknown.</P>
      <P>According to the EU NAVFOR, there are 26 vessels and 613 hostages being held by
pirates off the coast of Somalia.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and France have signed an agreement on avoidance of double taxation,
which will take effect on Jan. 1, 2011, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced separately Friday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, Taiwan's representative to France,  and Patrick Bonneville, director
of the French representative office in Taipei, signed the agreement on Dec. 24,
the MOFA said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The agreement was screened and passed by the French Parliament on Dec. 21 and
approved by Taiwan's Executive Yuan on Dec. 23 before the Christmas Eve signing,
according to the MOFA and MOF statements.</P>
      <P>France became the 20th country to sign a double taxation agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said the pact represented a great step forward for economic and
investment relations between Taiwan and France, Taiwan's fifth largest trade
partner in Europe.</P>
      <P>The agreement is expected to be beneficial to businesses of both sides, helping
to attract French investment to Taiwan as well as providing a fair tax
environment for Taiwanese businesses in France, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , Taiwan's
quasi-official trade promotion agency, French exports to Taiwan totaled 1.02
billion euros and imports from Taiwan totaled 2.16 billion euros in 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent case of an 84-year-old man who killed his bedridden wife highlights
the need for greater support for family caregivers, a group of social
organizations said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The tragedy is an indication of a serious problem among long-term caregivers,
many of whom suffer from severe psychological stress as a result of looking
after loved ones around the clock, " said Wang Tseng-yung, president of the
Taiwan Association of Family Caregivers, at a press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The elderly man stabbed his wife in the head with a screwdriver on Dec. 26,
saying he wanted to end the suffering she had long endured because of
Parkinson's disease and two broken legs.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted in 2009 by his association, Wang said family
caregivers, 80 percent of whom are female, work 13.55 hours per day on average
and many do not have a day off. About 20 percent of them are diagnosed with
depression after working like that for one year, he said.</P>
      <P>Family caregivers are classified as people who take care of incapacitated or
elderly family members.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  association's  statistics,  there  are approximately 600,000
people in Taiwan who require long-term home care. About 400,000 of them have
family caregivers, 170,000 have immigrant caregivers, and 30,000 are in homes
for the elderly.</P>
      <P>In this area, Taiwan differs from Western countries in that the rights of its
long-term caregivers are often neglected, Wang said. Since mothers and daughters
are usually the main caregivers in Taiwan, it is taken for granted that they
would work without rest or complaint, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng Chao-yuan, a senior researcher at Awakening Foundation, this
kind of sacrifice by family caregivers is often viewed as "a labor of love."</P>
      <P>"But no one can work 14 hours every day without rest, " Tseng said. "The
government should train more professional caregivers, with the dual goal of
increasing job opportunities and allowing family caregivers to take a break."</P>
      <P>Tang Li-yu, secretary-general of Taiwan Alzheimer's Disease International, said
family caregivers have told her that they rarely sleep well because of the
emotional stress associated with their work.</P>
      <P>"An Alzheimer's patient can repeat the same thing 50 times a day, which is
completely okay if the family caregiver is under no pressure, " Tang said.
"However, when the caregiver is under stress, listening to this kind of
repetition all day could lead to a serious nervous breakdown."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) filed suits Friday to
invalidate the Nov. 27 election results in three of the country's special
municipalities -- Taipei, New Taipei and Taichung cities.</P>
      <P>The DPP said the party decided to file the suits because it wants to respond to
"the public's aspirations" to learn the truth of an election-eve shooting that
the DPP believes boosted the KMT's momentum and helped it win in the three
cities out of five up for grabs. The DPP won in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities.</P>
      <P>Three of the DPP candidates in the Taipei, New Taipei and Taichung elections --
Su Tseng-chang, Tsai Ing-wen, and Su Jia-chyuan, respectively -- instructed
their lawyers to file the suits.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang contended at a news conference later in the day
that the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) used the Nov. 26 shooting to gain public
sympathy and sway the election results.</P>
      <P>"The suits are aimed at getting to the bottom of the incident, " Cheng said,
adding that "it is to safeguard Taiwan's basic rights and wrongs and to avoid
its democracy from being damaged."</P>
      <P>He said the filing of the suits is not intended to incite populism or create
confrontation.</P>
      <P>"If the truth is not unveiled or if the case is rashly closed, it will create
confrontation and the disintegration of society, " Cheng added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had a final discussion with lawyers and staff before
reaching the decision to go ahead with the legal action.</P>
      <P>On hearing the news, the KMT said the move was simply the DPP leadership trying
to find an excuse for the party's election losses.</P>
      <P>"The KMT respects the legal rights of the DPP to file suits to invalidate the
election results, but every political party should take responsibility for its
actions," said Su Jun-pin, a spokesman of the KMT.</P>
      <P>He also questioned why, if the DPP really thinks the shooting affected the
election results, it is not filing suits to invalidate the election results in
all five cities.</P>
      <P>"This is merely the DPP leaders trying to find an excuse for the election losses
and it is ill-befitting of a responsible party leader," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien Sheng-wen, also known as Sean Lien, the son of former Vice President Lien
Chan, was shot in the face while stumping at a campaign rally for Chen Hung-
yuan, a Taipei county councilor bidding for re-election in New Taipei City, an
upgrade of the former Taipei County.</P>
      <P>A lone shooter was arrested on the spot and his gun seized, but the motive for
the assault remains a mystery after more than one month of investigation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien Sheng-wen said through his special assistant that same day that
he welcomes anyone trying to get to the bottom of the shooting, but he also
noted that some DPP politicians have recently used vicious remarks in an attempt
to bully him, for which they should openly apologize.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung District Prosecutors Office filed invalidation suits against 16
more elected officials Friday, following 16 others it charged the previous day.</P>
      <P>The 16 people sued Friday -- three newly elected Kaohsiung city councilors and
13 ward chiefs -- were charged with bribery committed by themselves or vote-
buying carried out by their relatives or campaign aides prior to the Nov. 27
special municipality elections, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the prosecutors office brought invalidation suits against four
city councilors and 12 ward chiefs, also on bribery and vote-buying charges.</P>
      <P>In total, seven newly elected Kaohsiung councilors and 25 ward chiefs were
charged.</P>
      <P>A stunned Sun Ching-lung, one of the three councilors sued Friday, said he had
no idea why he was charged and attributed the development to a frame-up plot
against him by his opponents.</P>
      <P>Under the law, lawsuits for invalidating the election of public office-holders
must be filed within one month of the election commission making the election
results public.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung City's election commission announced the winners of the Nov. 27
special municipality elections Dec. 2, so the prosecutors still  have one day to
file suits  against  other  suspected law-breakers.</P>
      <P>The court will accept invalidation suits Jan. 3 at the latest, as the first two
days of January are holidays.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A raft of new programs and government policies that are expected to bring
benefits to society at large will take effect on New Year's Day.</P>
      <P>Among them is a child welfare program sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior,
which would allow Taiwanese families with an annual household income of less
than NT$1.5 million (US$50,000) and children under 2 years of age to receive a
monthly subsidy of NT$3,000 per child.</P>
      <P>In addition, families in all income brackets will be eligible to receive the
subsidy after the birth of a third child.</P>
      <P>In the capital Taipei City, a campaign to boost the city's birth rate will be
launched at the start of the new year. Couples who have lived in the city for
more than a year will be offered an incentive of NT$20,000 for each newborn,
once at least one of the parents maintains his or her household registration in
the city.</P>
      <P>The campaign also allows for a monthly subsidy of NT$2,500 to be granted to
children under 5, providing that their parents are registered Taipei City
residents who have lived in the city for more than a year and are in an income
tax bracket of below 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Apart from the social welfare programs, there are a number of policy changes and
initiatives that will also become effective Saturday.</P>
      <P>One of them is a decision to increase the country's monthly minimum wage from
NT$17,280 to NT$17,880 and the hourly minimum wage from NT$95 to NT$98.</P>
      <P>In the area of cross-strait trade, the tariffs on a range of goods and services
will be removed or reduced with effect from Jan.1 under the terms of a landmark
Economic Cooperation  Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed in June between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>The special tariff treatment will apply to 539 items on Taiwan's "early harvest"
list and 267 on China's, over an initial two-year period.</P>
      <P>The value of Taiwan's "early harvest" exports to China has been estimated at
US$13.8 billion per year, while China's are expected to amount to an estimated
US$2.86 billion to Taiwan annually.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the European Union visa waiver privilege for Taiwan passport holders
traveling to the Schengen Area and three EU member states will take effect after
the New Year, on Jan. 11, 2011.</P>
      <P>The exemption applies to 25 Schengen Area countries, comprising 22 EU member
states and three non-EU states -- Norway, Iceland and Switzerland -- and three
non-Schengen EU member states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>It also includes seven smaller European countries and territories -- the
Vatican, Monaco, Andorra, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Greenland and the Faroe
Islands.</P>
      <P>The visa waiver allows Taiwanese travelers to enter countries covered under the
exemption for stays of up to 90 days within a six-month period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, DPP head for showdown on health insurance program revision</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
12/31/10  20:36:42
(By Kelven Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of Taiwan's two main political parties appeared poised for a
showdown on a proposed revision to the health insurance system next week after
failing to reach a consensus on the issue on Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), which have been wrangling for a month over an amendment
to the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act to help the debt-ridden system stay
afloat, could no longer discuss the substantive content of the proposal.</P>
      <P>He expected the issue to be resolved during a session of the full legislature on
Jan. 4.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Department of Health (DOH) unveiled three possible versions of
the revision, designed to adjust how national health insurance premiums are
collected.</P>
      <P>But Legislator Lin Yi-shih, who heads the KMT's policy committee, said Friday he
was still trying to forge a consensus within the party over which version it
would support.</P>
      <P>The DOH's three formulas were based on a revised package proposed by the KMT,
all of which allow for premium rates that are lower than the current rate of
5.17 percent of regular salary, at least in the initial stage, Health Minister
Yaung Chih-liang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The KMT's package suggested establishing two different premium rates, one for
regular wages of the insured and one on four additional types of income --
interest income, stock dividends, professional income, and bonuses more than
four times a person's base salary.</P>
      <P>None of those income categories are currently included in the income on which
premiums are calculated.</P>
      <P>In the first of the DOH's three proposed versions, the premium rate would be set
at 5 percent of the insured's regular salary in the plan's first five years,
with the government contributing at least 36 percent of the premiums owed.</P>
      <P>The premium rate on the supplemental income categories would be tentatively set
at 2 percent and would have a goal of raising an additional NT$20 billion in
revenues.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH's estimate, this version would allow the NHI system to
remain solvent for five years, with at least a one-month reserve.</P>
      <P>Yaung cautioned, however, that if the system took effect in 2012, the premium
rate would have to be raised to 5.12 percent in 2017 and further adjusted
annually to 6.11 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>As the existing NHI Act caps the premium rate at 6 percent, the law would have
to be revised at that time, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has proposed two other formulas, the minister said the first
version was the most preferable  in terms of "professionalism."</P>
      <P>The second version would not require preparing a monthly reserve fund, which
would allow the 5 percent premium rate to remain unchanged in the first six
years until 2017.</P>
      <P>But the rate would be raised to 5.09 percent in 2018 and would also exceed the 6
percent ceiling to hit 6.1 percent in 2021.</P>
      <P>The third version proposes lowering the premium rate from the current 5.17
percent to 4.61 percent in 2012 and then raising it to 4.72 percent in 2013,
4.84 percent in 2014, 4.96 percent in 2015, 5.15 percent in 2016 and 5.31
percent in 2017. The rate would also surge past 6 percent to hit 6.02 percent in
2021 under this formula.</P>
      <P>The differences in the three versions mainly lie in whether the NHI system
should prepare a reserve fund as a hedge against financial instability, Yaung
said.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said his party would convene a caucus
meeting on Jan. 3 to determine the party's stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Huang Sue-ying criticized the reform proposals, saying they
failed to address the inherent flaws in the current system, and warned that if
the KMT tried to ram the amendment through on Jan. 4, she would not attend the
session.</P>
      <P>Huang said the system as it currently stands has offered loopholes to wealthy
individuals  to avoid paying high health insurance premiums.</P>

      <P>Taipei city government  transport authorities are deploying extra manpower and
extending the service hours of the city's public transport as record crowds are
expected to throng the city on New Year's Eve.</P>
      <P>A total of 750,000 people, about 150,000 more than last year, are expected to
gather in front of Taipei City Hall for the countdown party, according to the
city's Department of Transportation (TCDOT).</P>
      <P>In response, five additional shuttle bus routes will be added to transfer people
from the concert venue to various mass rapid transport (MRT) stations after the
party, said Liang Guo, division chief of the TCDOT Mass Transit Section.</P>
      <P>Half of the staff of Liang's office have been told to work overtime, and those
50 people "might not be able to finish their work and get home until 3 a.m. or 4
a.m.," he said.</P>
      <P>Evacuating such huge crowds from the area after the party will also be a
challenging task for the MRT, according to Wilson Chiang, a manager with the
Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. (TRTC).</P>
      <P>"We have deployed an extra crew of 125 people at the Taipei City Hall Station
alone," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He said the new Luzhou Line, which opened in November, however, could help ease
traffic at major junctions.</P>
      <P>"The public can now transfer more smoothly to suburban Taipei, as the launch of
the Luzhou Line has created two new transfer stops other than the Taipei Main
Station," he noted.</P>
      <P>The MRT transported nearly 2.16 million passengers between 6 a.m. last Dec. 31
and 6 a.m. last Jan. 1.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecast Friday that total rainfall from
January to March will be near or below average around Taiwan, as the island is
experiencing a La Nina event.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, the probabilities of predicted rainfall in three
categories -- below normal, near normal and above normal -- over the next three
months nationwide are 40 percent, 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>In January, normal rainfall in northern Taiwan is defined as between 60 mm and
100 mm, while in the south it is defined as between 45 mm and 70 mm.</P>
      <P>The CWB noted  that the current  La Nina,  reflected  by below-average sea
surface temperatures across the equatorial Pacific, is a moderate to strong one.</P>
      <P>A moderate La Nina episode tends to be accompanied by less rainfall in spring in
Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, temperatures forecast for January are likely to be slightly lower
than in the past few years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Environmental group selects 'falling' as 2010 word of the year</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>An environmental group on Friday declared "falling" as the word of the year for
2010, while urging the government to fulfill its promise to improve Taiwan's
natural environment in 2011.</P>
      <P>"The word 'falling' clearly resonates with many people this year, " said Wang
Chun-hsiu, president of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union, at a press
conference in Taipei Friday. The union was established in 1987.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's extreme weather conditions in 2010 have led to many climate
refugees, whose quality of life is falling, and that heavy rainfall, typhoons,
and mudslides have seemingly become increasingly prevalent -- or even the new
norm -- on the island.</P>
      <P>Wang attributed the phenomenon of climate change to Taiwan's lack of substantial
progress in cutting carbon emissions and promoting renewable energies, and he
argued there would be more new poor if no action were taken by the government in
2011.</P>
      <P>Gloria Hsu, the former chairwoman of the union, said that according to Carbon
Monitoring for Action (CARMA), Taiwan Power Co.'s coal-fired power plant in
Taichung was ranked as the most polluting power plant in the world in 2010,
producing 39.7 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>
      <P>In addition, Formosa Plastics Group's coal-fired power plant in Mailiao, Yunlin
County, was ranked as the world's fifth biggest emitter, spewing 29.9 million
tons of carbon emissions, she said.</P>
      <P>In May, Hsu said, President Ma Ying-jeou mapped out a vision for a "golden
decade" supported by six pillars of national development -- technological
innovations,  cultural development,  environmental improvement, constitutional
reform, social welfare and peace.</P>
      <P>But environmental groups in Taiwan had yet to see changes in policies regulating
carbon emissions and energy efficiency, Hsu complained.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope 2011 will be a better year for Taiwan's environment," she
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The signing of a historic trade pact with China and fierce competition in the
five special municipality elections were the most significant developments in
Taiwan this year, scholars said in a year-end symposium Friday in which they
also predicted a tumultuous year ahead.</P>
      <P>"The past year has been more about fear than pain for Taiwan. However, 2011 will
be a troublesome year, " political pundit Nanfang Shuo said in the symposium
organized by the Taiwan Competitiveness Forum to examine the domestic political
and economic developments in 2010 and preview the coming year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy in 2010 has shown a strong recovery from the financial crisis
that began in 2008, Nanfang said, but the rebound will not be as robust in 2011
because the global economy is expected to slow.</P>
      <P>Politically, the atmosphere of cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges is expected to cool
off in 2011 as Taiwan will be embroiled in a campaign year ahead of the 2012
presidential election, he said, adding that China will also try to engage in
dialogue with the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The exchanges are expected to slow down because President Ma Ying-jeou, who is
expected to seek re-election, "is always more cautious and tends to appeal to
the opposition electorate more during the campaign season, " according to
Nanfang.</P>
      <P>The scholars lauded the June signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) with China -- designed to liberalize cross-strait  trade ties
--  as the biggest  breakthrough  in Taiwan-China relations of the past six
decades.</P>
      <P>While legislator Lo Shu-lei of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) warned that pinning
Taiwan's economic hopes solely on China could be dangerous and that the long-
term effects of the ECFA remain unknown, George Tsai, a political scientist at
Chinese Culture University, said Taiwan's trade interdependence on China could
also be "healthy" because China will have to have second thoughts on military
action against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also needs to recognize that its trade relations with China "will go from
partnership to competition" because several strategic industries on both sides
overlap with each other, he said.</P>
      <P>On domestic political issues, the streamlining of government agencies from 37 to
29 will begin 12 months from now and the creation of the four new special
municipalities -- bringing to five the total number in the country -- is
expected to solidify the system of two levels of government in Taiwan, said
Thomas Peng, an associate professor at National Taiwan University.</P>
      <P>"The  measures,  if successful,  are  expected  to improve administration
efficiency, " said Peng.</P>
      <P>Former DPP Legislator Lin Cho-shui questioned whether the five municipalities
will be able to function as "regional hubs" to boost the economy in their areas,
saying that the design of the system is purely politically motivated without
sufficient deliberation, because the five cities pale in comparison with true
mega cities like Shanghai and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Looking at the coming year, the scholars agreed that the increasing wealth gap,
the transformation of Taiwan's economy and the continued exodus of local
manufacturing industries will be among the issues at the top of the government's
agenda in 2011.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices threatened to break through the 9,000 point barrier on
Friday before finishing at their highest close of the year, helped by an
appreciating New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 0.73 percent, or 64.59 points, to close at 8,972.5,
after trading between 8,932.64 and 8,990.38 on turnover of NT$152.53 billion

      <P>The items on the list exported from Taiwan to China or vice versa will be given
preferential  import duties,  making  them more competitive in their target

percent, led by Shin Kong Financial Holding Co. and China Development Financial
Holding Corp.</P>
      <P>Construction  shares  rose 1.6 percent,  with Huang Hsiang Construction

      <P>Machinery and electronic shares underperformed the market, rising 0.4 percent,

      <P>The Taipei District Court handed down sentences on Friday to 15 former and
incumbent officials of the National Property Bureau (NPB) under the Ministry of
Finance who were convicted of corruption charges.</P>
      <P>Eleven others,  including  property developers  and a land administration agent,
were also sentenced in the case, which involved the sale of a piece of land
located on Hangzhou South Road in Taipei City's upscale Daan District several
years ago.</P>
      <P>Su Wei-cheng, a former NPB deputy director, was sentenced to 15 years in prison,
fined NT$10 million (US$333,333), and had his civil rights suspended for 10
years for masterminding the illegal sale of the land, formerly owned by the now
defunct Taiwan Provincial Government, while he was in office.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei District Court ruling, Su and his accomplices, including
Chen Kuan-pao, another former NPB deputy director, and Chuang Tsui-yun, an
incumbent NPB deputy director, started organizing the scheme in 2002.</P>
      <P>The land had been held in trust by the NPB since 1999 after the downsizing of
the provincial government, and Su and the 14 other officials  first  arranged
for several  proxies  to rent the Japanese-style wooden residential houses built
before the 1940s on the site.</P>
      <P>That enabled the proxies to be able to enjoy priority rights to purchase the
land, which they later used to acquire the land at prices much lower than
normal.</P>
      <P>Su and the other 14 officials then had the land sold to two property development
companies, costing the government NT$120 million in revenues, according to the
400-page verdict.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuan-pao was sentenced to 13 years in prison, fined NT$5 million, and
deprived of his civil rights for 10 years, and Chuang Tsui-yun got an eight-year
jail term and an NT$3 million fine and had his civil rights suspended for eight
years.</P>
      <P>Twelve other former and incumbent NPB officials got sentences ranging from 10
years to five years and six months, according to the ruling.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-jun, president of a property development company, was given a jail
term of 10 years and four months, along with a fine of NT$20 million, while
Chien Hsing-chi, a vice president of the same company, was sentenced to 10 years
and two months in prison and fined NT$18 million.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-dao, owner of another construction company involved in the scheme, was
sentenced to eight years and six months in prison, while Chan Teh-yu, a land
administration agent, got an eight-year jail term, according to the ruling.</P>

      <P>The New Taiwan dollar appreciated 5.47 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2010,
the second highest annual rise in the past 10 years behind only 6.07 percent in
2003, and it is expected to face similar pressure next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  central  bank believes  that the United  States' expansionist monetary
policy should put pressure on all Asian currencies in the coming year.</P>
      <P>But the impact of Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy on Taiwan's
currency remains uncertain because the central bank has shown its determination
to prevent the country's currency from appreciating too rapidly to avoid hurting
exports.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed at NT$32.030 against the U.S. dollar on the last day of
2009, compared with a close of NT$30.386 Friday, according to Central Bank of
the Republic of China (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>Among Asian currencies, the Taiwan dollar appreciated against the U.S. dollar by
more than the Chinese yuan (3.59 percent) and the Korean won (2.62 percent) but
less than the Japanese yen (13.32 percent) and the Singapore dollar (9.19
percent).</P>
      <P>Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said Friday that many people criticized him
this year for not letting the Taiwan dollar depreciate as much as the Korean
won.</P>
      <P>With the Korean currency only appreciating 2.62 percent this year, the market
share of Taiwan's flat panel sector has lagged behind South Korea's.</P>
      <P>But Perng said he did not think it was possible for the Taiwan Taiwan dollar to
depreciate as rapidly as the South Korean won, referring to the Korean
currency's plunge from 920 to 1,534 to the dollar between the end of November
2007 and the end of March 2009.</P>
      <P>Yang Chia-yen, a director at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said he
believed the central bank would not mind if Taiwan's currency appreciated
against the greenback at the same rate as other Asian currencies.</P>
      <P>But he said the central bank would feel compelled to intervene if the Chinese
yuan and Korean won continued to rise at a slower pace than the Taiwan dollar.</P>
