    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT M'LAND CHINESE MISSILE BUILD-UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, July 31 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington has once again expressed its
concerns about mainland China's increasing deployment of missiles
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We've made it clear that China's rapid build-up of weapons,
particularly missiles opposite Taiwan, is something that is
destabilizing, " White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Thursday
during a routine press briefing.</P>
      <P>McClellan said the White House has always remained committed to
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which calls for the United States to
sell Taiwan the weapons it needs to maintain a self-defense
capability.</P>
      <P>"We have expressed concerns directly to Beijing about their
taking steps to increase their weaponry, " he said.</P>
      <P>"The best way for the two sides (of the Taiwan Strait) to resolve
their differences is through peaceful dialogue, and we encourage the
parties to pursue that dialogue," he added.</P>
      <P>McClellan made the remarks in response to a Pentagon report
released the day before which warns that mainland China's modernizing
military could enable it to carry out a surprise attack on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Answering a reporter's question about whether U.S. President
George W. Bush would be willing to fulfill America's commitments to
Taiwan's security, McClellan said, "Absolutely."</P>
      <P>He added that Washington works closely with Beijing on a number
of issues, including the Taiwan Strait issue and the North Korea
issue.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report said mainland China possesses about 450
short-range ballistic missiles and is expected to add about 75
annually over the next few years.</P>
      <P>All of these missiles are capable of being used against Taiwan
and are believed to be based in the Nanjing Military Region opposite
Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>"The PLA's offensive capabilities improve as each year passes,
providing Beijing, in the absence of an effective response by Taiwan,
with an increasing number of credible military options to intimidate
or actually attack Taiwan," the report indicated.</P>
      <P>"Should China use force, its primary goal likely would be to
compel a negotiated solution on terms favorable to Beijing, " it
continued, adding that "Beijing would most likely seek a rapid
collapse of Taiwan's national will to preclude the United States from
intervening on Taipei's behalf."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATOR URGES U.S. TO SELL OFFENSIVE WEAPONS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party on Friday urged the United States to address the
imbalance in military development between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait and sell offensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang Huo-sheng, a member of the Legislative Yuan's National
Defense Committee, made the appeal after the U.S. Defense Department
unveiled the 2003 Annual Report on the Military Power of the People's
Republic of China Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The report said that Taiwan remains the primary reason behind
Beijing's military modernization which includes the addition each
year of about 75 short-range ballistic missiles targeting the island
to the 450 such missiles already deployed.</P>
      <P>Tang, who visited the United States recently and discussed
related issues with U.S. officials, said that the imbalance in
military development between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is a
reality. He added that with the United States selling only defensive
weapons to Taiwan all these years, it has rendered Taiwan without an
offensive capability.</P>
      <P>He said that as Washington has refused to sell offensive weapons
to Taiwan, "the United States should bear the greatest responsibility
for the imbalance in military development across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Tang said that even if Taiwan spends billions of new Taiwan
dollars on buying such defensive weapons as the early-warning radar
system and Patriot III missiles from the United States over the next
several years, this will not help solve the problem of the imbalance
in cross-strait military development, with Beijing maintaining the
upper hand over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said it would be more useful if the United States sold one or
two Tomahawk cruise missiles to Taiwan instead of selling it so many
defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>He said that if the United States hopes to maintain regional
security in Asia, it should not let Taiwan continue to be deficient
in offensive weapons.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and Panama kicked off
a 10-day round of negotiations on the signing of a free trade
agreement (FTA) in Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>The two sides have already held four rounds of FTA talks and an
extra consultation meeting on agricultural issues. The fifth round in
Taipei is being presided over by officials from the ROC's Bureau of
Foreign Trade.</P>
      <P>Trade officials said that both sides have reached consensus on
the list agricultural items to undergo tariff cuts. Among the 23 or
24 items that are sensitive, only beef and a few others have been
included in the opening list, while rice and cigars have been
excluded from the tariff cut list.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if the talks go smoothly, President Chen
Shui-bian and Panamanian President Mireya Elisa Moscoso will witness
the signing of the FTA when Taiwan holds a sumit meeting with five
Central and Southern American countries at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's FTA talks with Panama have been progressing more rapidly
than those with other countries. If the agreement is signed, Panama
will become the first country with which Taiwan has ever signed an
FTA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MECHANISM NEEDED FOR HANDLING 'RUNAWAY' FOREIGN WIVES: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should pay more heed to
family affairs involving "runaway" foreign wives of local citizens,
an opposition lawmaker said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsu Chung-hsiung made the call after a local man
surnamed Ku asked the Kuomintang lawmaker to help him bring back to
Taiwan his two young children who were taken to Cambodia by his
Cambodian-born more than three months ago.</P>
      <P>With the number of intermarriages increasing rapidly in recent
years, Hsu said the government should forge a comprehensive mechanism
to handle similar cases.</P>
      <P>"Ku's plight is not just an isolated case. Similar disputes have
become increasingly common in local society. The government should
not sit idly by but instead must take active steps to help resolve
issues involving 'runaway' foreign spouses and children born to
intermarried couples," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Ku, a resident of Chungli, Taoyuan County, told Hsu that he and
his Cambodian-born wife, identified as "Wu Li-chu, " had gone to
Cambodia in April along with their two children to visit Wu's
parents. Ku returned to Taiwan alone a week later after his wife
declined to return with him.</P>
      <P>Ku and his parents have since made two visits to the Southeast
Asian country -- one in May and the other in July -- to try to
persuade Wu to return, but to no avail. Wu has also refused to allow
the two children to be taken back to Taiwan. Ku claimed that his wife
would not even let him see their three-year-old daughter and
nine-month-old son.</P>
      <P>Ku said he had sought the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) and the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , but the two
ministries were reluctant to give him any help on the grounds that
the Republic of China doesn't maintain formal diplomatic ties with
Cambodia and cannot seek the "extradition" of his wife.</P>
      <P>Ku said his two children are ROC passport holders. "The
government is obliged to ensure their safety and protect their basic
human rights," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu seconded Ku's views, saying that as Ku's children do not have
household registration or identity cards in Cambodia, their human
rights, education rights and even physical safety could possibly be
compromised there.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC government allows intermarriages, Hsu continued, it
should not turn a deaf ear to calls for assistance in settling issues
involving "runaway" foreign spouses and children born to intermarried
couples.</P>
      <P>"We ought to show more concern for the plight of these
intermarried couples and their children, " Hsu said, adding that the
government ought to craft a legal framework and adopt various
complementary measures to deal with intermarriage-related problems.</P>
      <P>According to rough tallies, Taiwan now has more than 300,000
intermarried couples. "The government should not ignore their
problems," he said.</P>
      <P>"While drafting new immigration regulations, the government
should not just focus on how to manage, supervise or plug loopholes.
Humanitarian principles and cultural diversity should be given more
emphasis when intermarriage issues are dealt with," he added.</P>

      <P>National interest considerations will form
the basis of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA's) efforts in
expanding relations with ROC diplomatic allies and in promoting
substantial relations with countries with which the Republic of China
does not maintain formal diplomatic ties, a MOFA spokesman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih made the remarks following wire reports that said
Nauru had shut down its embassy in mainland China to pave the way for
hte re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Shih said
the MOFA would not comment on the wire reports.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources pointed out that Nauru closed its embassy in
mainland China due to financial difficulties but that it is unlikely
to try to resume diplomatic relations with Taiwan immediately.</P>
      <P>Nauru has a population of nearly 10,000 on a land area of around
21 square kilometers. The ROC established diplomatic relations with
the country in 1980, and then severed them in July 2002.</P>
      <P>The MOFA issued a statement at that time saying that the Nauruan
president had always harbored unrealistic views about mainland China
and that his decision to establish formal diplomatic ties with
Beijing had not been approved by the Nauruan Cabinet. The ROC
government, in view of protecting its national dignity and of not
engaging in "dollar diplomacy" with mainland China, decided to severe
ties with Nauru, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EASTERN TAIWAN UNIVERSITIES HELP BALANCE EDUCATION RESOURCES: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung  County,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of one new
university in each of the three counties in eastern Taiwan Friday
serves as an important milestone in the country's efforts to create a
more balanced distribution of education resources, President Chen
Shui-bian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that for a long time, the Taiwan people have witnessed
imbalanced regional development, with southern Taiwan as a whole
enjoying less resources than northern Taiwan, and the gap between
eastern Taiwan and western Taiwan being even more prominent.</P>
      <P>Taking eastern Taiwan as an example, Chen said that although it
covers about half the area of Taiwan proper, it has been considered a
hinterland for decades, being nicknamed in mandarin Chinese as the
"back mountain."</P>
      <P>He said that if the government does not make efforts to redress
the imbalance, eastern Taiwan will remain as the "back mountain" and
continue to witness a rapid greying of its population and a migration
by the younger generations out of the region.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he addressed a ceremony
marking the upgrading of National Taitung Teachers College to the
status of National Taitung University, making it the first university
in the eastern county of Taitung, where aboriginal citizens make up
nearly one-third of the population.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the increasing number of universities in rural
areas around the island is a manifestation of the government's direct
response to the will of the people. It also demonstrates his
administration's concern for the welfare of those living in
disadvantaged areas, he said.</P>
      <P>Following its upgrading, National Taitung University will not
only continue to be a cradle of teacher nurturing, it will also
become a stronghold of indigenous and Austronesian studies in
Southeast Asia, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that Taitung is Taiwan's most diversified county in
terms of aboriginal groups, including the Puyuma, Amis, Bunun, Dawu,
Paiwan and Rukai tribes.</P>
      <P>Besides, he continued, National Taitung University will also run
a sports school to train professional athletes, particularly baseball
talent, taking advantage of the fact that Taitung County is the home
of the famous Red Leaves baseball team which beat the Japanese World
Little League Series champion decades ago when members of the
Japanese team visited Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen offered his appreciation to the Taitung County government
for offering a scenic piece of land in Chihpeng for the
newly-upgraded university. Chihpeng is known for its natural beauty,
with magnificent mountains, rivers, hot springs and aboriginal
cultures.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, President Chen was in the northern county of Miaoli
where he officiated at a similar ceremony marking the upgrading of
the National Lien-Ho Institute of Technology to the status of a
university. National United University is the first university to
open in the predominantly Hakka county of Miaoli.</P>
      <P>The president spoke at a site of expansion construction on the
institute. The expansion is one of the changes taking place at the
institute which was formally designated a university on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO PROTECT FISHERMEN OPERATING AROUND PRATAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Friday urged the
administration to adopt measures to protect the rights of Taiwan
fishermen operating around the Tungsha (Pratas) islands.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Hsueh-chang of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) said that the waters around Tungsha are rich in marine
resources and are the traditional fishing grounds of Taiwan
fishermen, but that Taiwan fishermen have often been bullied by
neighboring countries while operating in the area.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government demarcate its economic territory
and claim sovereignty over it to ensure the rights of Taiwan
fishermen in pursuing their livelihood.</P>
      <P>To understand the situation in the Pratas, Lu and his colleagues
-- Legislator Tang Chin-chuan of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, and Legislators Cheng Mei-lan and Cheng San-yuan of the PFP --
visited the Pratas Thursday for an inspection tour.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the natural beauty of the coral atoll of Tungsha has
yet to be tapped, pointing out that if the government can efficiently
develop it, it will be a great contribution to Taiwan's tourism.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government plan Tungsha as a national
"marine park" and thereby raise Taiwan's tourism quality
internationally.</P>
      <P>The Tungsha islands are located in a strategically important
position along the major sea route connecting the Pacific and Indian
oceans. It is now under the jurisdiction of Kaohsiung City. Related
business currently under the charge of the Ministry of National
Defense will be turned over to the Coast Guard Administration in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON REPORT HIGHLIGHTS MAINLAND THREAT TO STRAIT SECURITY: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Pentagon's latest annual report to
Congress on mainland Chinese military power has again highlighted the
seriousness of the threat that Beijing poses to Taiwan Strait
security and Asia-Pacific stability, the National Security Council
(NSC) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>NSC spokesman Su Chin-chiang said that although the Pentagon
report has not surprised the council, which has always kept abreast
of mainland China's military development, it indeed serves as a fresh
reminder to the world that Beijing's stepped-up military build-up
increasingly threatens security in the Taiwan Strait as well as
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The report, released Wednesday, has also underlined U.S. concerns
about Taiwan's self-defensive capabilities as Washington has recently
conveyed the hope that Taiwan will increase the quantity and quality
of its weaponry purchases from the United States, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Su added that the Ministry of National Defense will undoubtedly
conduct a comprehensive review on Taiwan's military and defense
structures, as well as its arms procurement plans and related affairs
in the light of the Pentagon report.</P>
      <P>Noting that Presidential Secretary-General Chiou I-jen and NSC
Deputy Secretary-General Ke Cheng-heng traveled to the United States
recently to exchange views with U.S. officials and private
think-tanks on Taiwan's arms procurement and its intentions of
introducing a referendum system, Su stressed that Taiwan and the
United States have maintained smooth communications and dialogue
channels.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon report said mainland China possesses about 450
short-range ballistic missiles and is expected to add about 75
annually over the next few years.</P>
      <P>All of these missiles are capable of being used against Taiwan
and are believed to be based in the Nanjing Military Region opposite
Taiwan, the report said.</P>
      <P>"The PLA's offensive capabilities improve as each year passes,
providing Beijing, in the absence of an effective response by Taiwan,
with an increasing number of credible military options to intimidate
or actually attack Taiwan," the report indicated.</P>
      <P>"Should China use force, its primary goal likely would be to
compel a negotiated solution on terms favorable to Beijing, " it
continued, adding that "Beijing would most likely seek a rapid
collapse of Taiwan's national will to preclude the United States from
intervening on Taipei's behalf."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN'S NAMESAKE FIRST TO APPLY FOR NEW VERSION OF PASSPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's namesake became
the first local citizen to apply for the new version of the ROC
passport Friday --the first day that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) began to accept applications.</P>
      <P>"Chen Shui-bian," who legally changed his name to that of the
president a few years ago, said he feels it is a very meaningful
event for the government to issue the new version of the passport
displaying the word "Taiwan" in addition to the official national
designation of the Republic of China on its cover.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I wanted to be the first to apply for the new version
of the passport, " said Chen, who is a founding member of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's Yungho City chapter in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived at the doors of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs (BCA) at 6: 30 a.m., two hours before the start of the
bureau's regular business hours.</P>
      <P>BCA Director Yang Sheng-chung, anticipating that there might be a
large line that morning, arrived at the office at 6: 20 a.m. He gave
Chen the No. 1 serial number for filing his application later to
spare him from having to wait under the scorching sun for two hours.</P>
      <P>The BCA will conduct a random, computerized drawing of the issued
serial numbers Aug. 15 to decide the first 100 recipients of the new
passport. Those who file applications between Aug. 1 and Aug. 14 have
an equal chance of securing the coveted first new passport.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, many people were still anxious to file their
applications. As of 11: 25 a.m., a total of 239 ROC citizens had
applied, including 163 from the greater Taipei area, 35 from
Taichung, 37 from Kaohsiung and four from Hualien.</P>
      <P>The new version of the passport will be formally issued Sept. 1.
Old passports can be used until their expiry dates.</P>
      <P>In the past, the first copy of a new version of a passport was
traditionally reserved for the nation's head of state. This time,
President Chen Shui-bian has directed that the first copy of the new
version be made available to the people since it is they who will
benefit from the changes.</P>
      <P>The serial number of the new passports will start from
"210000001," Yang said, adding that "21" refers to the 21st century.</P>
      <P>He reminded the public that some countries do not allow their
visa stamps on old versions of passports to be automatically
transferred to new passports.</P>
      <P>"Those wishing to travel abroad should contact the local
representative offices of specific foreign countries prior to filing
an application for a new passport, " he added.</P>
      <P>Some ROC passport holders have complained that they had
encountered unnecessary inconveniences or embarrassment while
traveling abroad because foreign immigration officers mistook them
for mainland Chinese nationals. Mainland China's official title is
the People's Republic of China or the PRC.</P>
      <P>The addition of the word "Taiwan" on the cover of the new ROC
passport will make them more distinguishable from those issued by the
PRC, MOFA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SU-27, MiG-29 FIGHTERS TO BE SHOWN IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Advanced jet fighters Su-27 and MiG-29
from Ukraine will be displayed in Taipei later this month, despite
concerns from mainland Chinese authorities, local aviation sources
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Su-27 and MiG-29 are known as the most sophisticated versions
of warplanes in the former communist bloc. Mainland China has bought
Russian-made Su-27s. It has expressed strong concerns about Ukraine's
plan to send this type of warplanes to Taipei for public exhibition.</P>
      <P>Aviation sources said Ukrainian authorities will uphold their
plan to have four types of aircraft, including the Su-27 and MiG-29,
shown at the upcoming Taipei Aerospace Technology Exhibition because
it wants to promote sales of its fighter jets to Taiwan and other
neighboring Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Ukraine has assured mainland Chinese authorities that the
upcoming exhibition is purely for commercial purposes, with an aim to
tapping business opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region, the source
said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the ROC Air Force once planned to buy
or lease a Su-27 fighter to serve as an enemy aircraft in its
training exercises. Air Force authorities can take advantage of the
Aug. 14-17 aerospace industry trade fair to look into the performance
of this type of fighter plane, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Ukraine's Kharkov State Aircraft Manufacturing Co. and Taipei's
Helicopter Development Association have contributed much to pushing
for a static display of the Su-27 and MiG-29 fighters in Taipei, the
sources said.</P>
      <P>Ukraine will exhibit two other types of aircraft -- the
AN-74TK200 transport and the AN-140 regional commercial airliner. The
two planes will be flown in demonstrations at the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport, some 40 kilometers south of Taipei Aug. 12-14.</P>
      <P>All the Ukrainian planes are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Aug.
10 for the upcoming show.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, media reports said several Ukrainian officials will
come to Taipei along with the planes. They will meet with Taiwan
officials to discuss measures to boost bilateral economic ties, the
reports said.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Ukraine, which maintains formal
diplomatic ties with Beijing, may open a trade office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Among former Soviet Union states, Taiwan has only opened
representative offices in Russia and Belarus. In Ukraine, Taipei has
only employed a Ukrainian to serve as its liaison officer.</P>

      <P>According to the foundation, mainland Chinese immigration
authorities in Shenzhen, Zuhai, Guangzhou and Xiamen have uncovered

      <P>In Zhuhai alone, more than 100 such cases have been discovered,

said the visas were secured through travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong

renminbi (between NT$4,500 to NT$7,000).</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese immigration officers confiscate fake visas and

      <P>Netherlands Trade and Investment Office
representative Menno Goedhart paid a visit to Tainan Mayor Hsu
Tain-tsai Thursday and vowed to step up bilateral exchanges in a wide
range of sectors.</P>
      <P>Praising the ancient city in southern Taiwan as a "suitable place
to settle in" because of its comfortable environment and cultural
atmosphere, Goedhart said he will do his best to strengthen two-way
flows in trade, commerce, investment, technology and tourism between
Tainan and Holland.</P>
      <P>The chief liaison official from Holland in Taiwan revealed that
a delegation from his country is slated to visit Tainan in November.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tainan's cultural areas, Goedhart expressed his
belief that the city will also play a bigger role in Taiwan's
economics and hi-tech development under Hsu's capable leadership.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hsu thanked Holland for helping stage the
exhibition titled: "Formosa: Taiwan, Holland and East Asia in the
17th Century" early this year in Taipei and currently in Tainan by
lending hundreds of world-class historical documents and Taiwanese
artifacts to Taiwan's museums, including the original copy of the
Treaty of Surrender.</P>
      <P>The treaty was signed in 1662 in Tainan by Cheng Chen-kung and
the defeated Dutch rulers. Cheng, also known as Koxinga, was much
respected by the Taiwan people for his restoration of the island from
Dutch rule.</P>

Tainan people for its historical importance and links with Holland,
Hsu said the Tainan City Government is planning to organize a "Dutch

      <P>Accompanied by Deputy Mayor Hsu Yang-ming, Goedhart also visited
the exhibition being held at a local museum.</P>
      <P>Voicing his happiness that the valuable 17th century Taiwanese

people took place -- Goedhart said the exhibition clearly underscores
the importance of Tainan for the city's role in Taiwan's history.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIES WITH NAURU A MATTER OF NATIONAL INTEREST: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
said Friday that whether the Republic of China will resume diplomatic
relations with the Pacific island state of Nauru will hinge on the
assessment of national interests.</P>
      <P>Chien made the remarks in the wake of a Reuters report that said
Nauru has closed its embassy in Beijing to pave the way for the
re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that the nature of Beijing's diplomacy was clear when
Nauru's severed diplomatic ties with the ROC. He said that the
mainland used money to disrupt the ROC's diplomacy.</P>
      <P>On whether Nauru closed its embassy because Beijing didn't
deliver on its promise to give US$130 million in financial aid to the
island state, Chien said, "It is inappropriate for me to comment on
the question," adding that "Nauru would know better."</P>
      <P>In fact, Chien pointed out that a lot of countries have learned
that Beijing often makes a lot of promises, but may not deliver on
them afterwards.</P>
      <P>Regarding the possibility of Taiwan resuming diplomatic relations
with Nauru, Chien said that future relations with Nauru will have to
conform to national interests, as well as on mutually beneficial
principles.</P>
      <P>"If the relationship is to be resumed, it will be after cautious
assessment," Chien said, adding that it is not appropriate for him to
make any comments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and opposition parties unanimously expressed opposition
to the idea of resuming diplomatic relation with Nauru even if the
small island country wishes to.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Trong Chai said that under Beijing's policy to
squeeze Taiwan diplomatically, Nauru was lured to turn its back on
Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should never resume diplomatic relations with a country
that switch sides because of money," Chai said.</P>
      <P>He noted that currently, of the 24 countries that have signed
investment protection agreements, the avoidance of double taxation
agreement, and an ATA agreement for temporary admission of goods with
Taiwan, only five are Taiwan allies. Of the 27 countries that signed
air transportation agreement with Taiwan, only three are Taiwan
allies.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's establishment of diplomatic ties with
various small countries aims at "political recognition and support,
and not reciprocal exchanges."</P>
      <P>Chai said that Taiwan can't afford to play the "dollar diplomacy"
game with mainland China, and that Taiwan should promote rectifying
the island's name, so that the nation can be officially known as
Taiwan internationally.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Parris Chang, who is currently visiting Vienna,
also said via telephone that he is strongly opposed to resuming
diplomatic ties with Nauru.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Nauru is an "opportunist" country, and will tilt
toward any countries that are willing to provide it with the most
resources, which he said is a country "without ideals."</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that countries that Taiwan should establish
diplomatic relations with should be ones that will help Taiwan in the
areas of economy, national defense and the expansion of its
maneuvering room internationally, and that Nauru does not meet any of
these conditions.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin, a whip of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) ,
said that the government has to consider the price it must pay if it
wants to resume ties with Nauru, and should not just do so because it
wants an increase in the number of allies.</P>
      <P>Legislator Sun Ta-chien of the opposition People First Party said
that the government should turn away from the "dollar diplomacy" it
used to employ,</P>
      <P>Sun said that the government should carefully assess the
resumption of ties with Nauru, adding that the top priority should be
given to whether the country can break through the diplomatic
blockade imposed by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chien Lin Whei-jun, whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, said
that the government should be prudent in developing future relations
with Nauru and that the dollar-bought diplomatic ties are always
unstable and do not last for long.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China established diplomatic relations with Nauru
May 4, 1980, and the island nation switched ties to Beijing July 21,
2000, on the day President Chen Shui-bian began concurrently serving
as the chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the severance of
diplomatic ties with the tiny Pacific island state July 23 for the
protection of national dignity and as a way to show its rejection of
engaging in one-upmanship in "dollar diplomacy" with mainland China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has every right to hold a
referendum, but it should first thoroughly examine the necessity and
wisdom of doing so, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Hong Kong's Phoenix Television, Armitage
cited Chiou I-jen, the secretary-general of President Chen
Shui-bian's office, as having pledged during a meeting with him last
week in Washington that Chen's controversial claims that there is one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait won't appear on Taiwan's
proposed referendum.</P>
      <P>He brushed aside the question of whether a referendum in Taiwan
would cross the line for Beijing, saying only that he didn't like to
see the situation framed in such a way since this would limit the
ability to solve problems.</P>
      <P>Armitage admitted that there are serious differences between
mainland China and the United States over the Taiwan issue, but the
administrations of each country have tried to straighten out these
differences in a wise and dignified way and that this process has to
be kept on.</P>
      <P>He said that he has a high opinion of Taiwan, noting that the

    <HEADLINE>HUALIEN VOTERS GO TO POLLS TO ELECT NEW MAGISTRATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien, Taiwan, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Voters in the eastern county of
Hualien went to polls Saturday to elect a new magistrate to serve out
the remainder of a four-year term left vacant by Chang Fu-hsing, who
died in May from lung cancer.</P>
      <P>A total of 256,685 Hualien residents are eligible to vote in the
by-election.</P>
      <P>Polls opened at 8 a.m. and will close at 4 p.m. Voter turnout
is expected to be high as the three-way race hit a fever pitch on the
eve of the election day.</P>
      <P>A large number of voters began making long lines at polling
stations in the county's 13 townships. Voting has so far proceeded
orderly and smoothly. The electoral result is expected to come out by
8 p.m.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, a scholar-turned-politician who is representing
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the race, cast his
ballot in the company of his wife. He then sang a Taiwanese folk song
in honor of his wife who originally opposed her husband's
participation in the by-election, but later devoted her full energies
to helping with his campaign. This is You's third bid for the
Hualien magistrateship.</P>
      <P>Wu Guo-tung, a former Hualien magistrate who was expelled from
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) because of his insistence on
running in the by-election, cast his ballot at around 9 a.m in
the company of his daughters and several supporters. Wu has been
accused of involvement in a corruption scandal which is still pending
a court ruling. There has been speculation that the case might be
the reason behind the KMT's refusal to nominate him for the
by-election.</P>
      <P>Wu, a Hakka political heavyweight in Hualien, has received the
blessing of some politicians from the opposition People First Party
(PFP) in defiance of their party's stance.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance of the KMT and the PFP nominated
Hsieh Shen-shan, a veteran politician who once served as
Cabinet secretary-general during the KMT administration and
as a legislator for seven terms, to run in the Hualien
by-election.</P>
      <P>Hualien, an economic backwater in Taiwan, has traditionally been
a KMT stronghold. But some observers said the split in the
"pan-blue" camp this time might give the DPP a chance.</P>
      <P>As the "pan-blue" alliance's top two leaders -- KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James Soong -- have decided to form a
joint ticket to challenge President Chen Shui-bian's re-election bid
next year, political observers have said the Hualien by-election
provides a good opportunity for the two camps to rehearse their
campaign strategies for the 2004 presidential race. Several analysts
have also said the Hualien race could serve as a litmus test of the
"pan-blue" alliance's solidarity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. STANDS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO TRA: WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By W.H.Kuo and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>White House spokesman Scott McClellan on
Friday said that the United States is concerned about increasing
deployments of weapons in mainland China, adding that Washington
"stands firmly committed to the Taiwan Relations Act" and that it
will help the island.</P>
      <P>The spokesman made the remarks at a daily media briefing while
responding to a question regarding whether President George W. Bush
discussed the Pentagon's recent report during his Wednesday telephone
conversation with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The report, which was released Wednesday, suggests that Beijing
continues to view the United States as a long-term threat and is
continuing rapidly to build ballistic missiles not only capable of
reaching Taiwan, but also a longer-range missile capable of reaching
Japan and U.S. troops stationed in Asia.</P>
      <P>While indicating that the purpose of the two presidents'
conversation was primarily to talk about the situation in North
Korea, McClellan said that Washington's position is very clear on the
issue brought up by the reporter's question.</P>
      <P>"We have made it very clear -- our concerns about Chinese
increasing their weapons. And we've made it very clear that we stand
firmly committed to the Taiwan Relations Act, and we will be there to
help Taiwan," he said.</P>
      <P>"And what we want to emphasize is that those parties, Taiwan and
China, need to have a dialogue on this. They need to talk about these
issues together, to pursue a peaceful resolution to these issues."
McClellan said.</P>
      <P>McClellan had already expressed Washington's concerns Thursday
about mainland Chinese increasing deployment of missiles targeting
Taiwan and said that the White House has always been committed to the
Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>According to the Pentagon's report, mainland China possesses
about 450 short-range ballistic missiles and is expected to add about
75 more annually over the next few years. The report also warns that
mainland China's modernizing military could enable it to carry out a
surprise attack on Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMPHETAMINE PRODUCTION LAB RAIDED IN CHIAYI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An amphetamine production facility was
uncovered in a mountainous township in Chiayi County in southern
Taiwan Saturday, the sixth discovered this year.</P>
      <P>Two men suspected of running the operation were arrested in a
pre-dawn raid at the facility in Chuchi township. Also seized were
more than 90 kilograms of amphetamines and semi-finished products as
well as a variety of production equipment.</P>
      <P>Investigators said the factory originally produced tea. The two
suspects, surnamed Lin and Ku, leased the property earlier this year
allegedly to produce amphetamines. They used tea leaf bags to package
the drugs to evade detection.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off, the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau's (MJIB) southern Taiwan branch, its Chiayi outpost and the
Chiayi County Police Bureau formed a team in late June.</P>
      <P>"Investigators have had difficulty tracking suspected drug
dealers and production labs since the people involved make it their
business to stay one step ahead of us," an MJIB agent said. "They are
continually changing the locations of their operations and switching
vehicles and modes of communication," he added.</P>
      <P>Law enforcement agent took advantage of the current longan
harvest season to dress as farmers to get closer to suspects and
monitor their activities.</P>
      <P>The investigative team arrested Lin and Ku when they came to the
facility early Saturday to pick up their drugs. Investigators said
that they are continuing to cast a dragnet to find others involved in
the operation.</P>
      <P>An MJIB official said the bureau raided seven amphetamine
production labs in Taiwan last year. In the past seven months, 563.4
kilograms of amphetamines have been seized.</P>
      <P>All these figures indicate that drug traffickers have again made
Taiwan a production base, the official said, adding that the trend is
a result of the fact that a mainland Chinese crackdown on amphetamine
production in the past couple of years has prompted many from Taiwan
who were producing the drugs to return home.</P>
      <P>After MJIB agents raided a large-scale amphetamine
production lab in Taipei in 1994 and arrested five
suspects, nearly all of local amphetamine producing rings
relocated to the southeastern mainland province of Fujian which
lies opposite Taiwan. They then used fishing boats to smuggle
amphetamines back to Taiwan for sales or colluded with mainland
drug dealers to sell their products in mainland China or overseas.
With an increasing awareness of amphetamine's health hazrads,
mainland China launched an all-out campaign against the drug in
2001.</P>

      <P>Outstanding senior high school students from
54 countries began arriving in Taiwan Saturday for the 34th
International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) to be held in Taipei Aug. 3-8.</P>
      <P>The competition, jointly organized by the Ministry of Education
and the National Science Council, has been referred to as the "Olympic
Games for Physics."</P>
      <P>The Physics Olympiad was originally scheduled to open in
mid-July, but was postponed because of the outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) , which hit Taiwan hardest in May and
June.</P>
      <P>Although the number of countries participating in the event has
fallen from the original 68 to 54, competition is expected to remain
fierce judging by the number of students pouring over books from the
moment they arrived in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will send five top physics students, selected from some
4,500 students, to the competition, in which a total of 240
competitors will participate.</P>
      <P>Two world-renowned physicists of Chinese origin -- the 1976 Nobel
Prize winner in physics Dr. Samuel C.C. Ting, and the
superconductivity expert Dr. Paul Chu -- have been invited to deliver
speeches Aug. 8.</P>
      <P>This marks the first time that Taiwan will have organized the
International Physics Olympiad. Taiwan teams have performed well in
the Olympiad the last two years by gaining three gold, one silver and
one bronze medal last year, and two gold, one silver and two bronze
medals in 2001, which represented fifth place among participating
countries.</P>

in the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) , will
fly into Washington, D.C. Saturday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>The former Minister of the Department of Health will be in
Washington, D.C. mainly to attend a health seminar sponsored by the
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies.</P>
      <P>Lee will also meet with U.S. health officials and express his
appreciation to overseas Chinese living in the greater Washington,
D.C. area who donated cash or surgical masks to Taiwan people during
the height of SARS in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Learning of Lee's visit, a team of experts from the Atlanta-based
 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will fly to
 Washington, D.C. to meet with Lee and discuss Taiwan's SARS situation
 and experiences.</P>
      <P>The CDC officials said that given the scarcity of negative
pressure hospital wards in the United States, containing outbreaks in
the United States could prove challenging.</P>
      <P>SARS hit Taiwan in mid-March, but only sporadic cases were
reported before a cluster transmission in Taipei Municipal Hoping
Hospital changed the situation. The disease eventually claimed 84
lives and affected 678 people in Taiwan before it was contained in
late June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG TO IMPLEMENT U.S.-INITIATED CONTAINER SECURITY INITIATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 1 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will start talks with
Taiwan for including Kaohsiung Harbor into its Container Security
Initiative (CSI) which is designed to detect and deter terrorists
from exploiting the vulnerabilities of container cargo, customs
sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the United States has invited Kaohsiung
Harbor officials to visit Washington, D.C. later this month for
initial consultations and is scheduled to send a delegation to Taiwan
in September to start formal negotiations.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is the only one of the world's top 20 container ports
that has not yet joined the CSI program. Mainland China's Shanghai
and Shenzhen began implementing the CSI in late July.</P>
      <P>The CSI program allows for targeting and pre-screening of cargo
destined for the United States. Once Kaohsiung joins the program, the
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will deploy a team of
officers to the port to work with host government personnel to target
high-risk cargo containers destined for the United States.</P>
      <P>The CSI consists of four core elements: 1) using intelligence and
automated information to identify and target high-risk containers; 2)
pre-screening those containers identified as high-risk, at the port
of departure, before they arrive at U.S. ports; 3) using detection
technology to quickly pre-screen high-risk containers; and 4) using
smarter, tamper-evident containers.</P>
      <P>The CSI is also a reciprocal program which allows participating
countries to send their customs officers to major U.S. ports to
target cargo that is being exported to their country via ocean
containers.</P>
      <P>The United States adopted the CSI after the "911" terrorist
attacks in New York and Washington in 2001. The world's top 20 ports
are points of passage for about 68 percent of cargo containers
shipped to the United States each year.</P>
      <P>According to data unveiled by the U.S. Homeland Security
Department, the operational CSI ports include Rotterdam, Le Havre,
Bremerhaven, Hamburg, Antwerp, Singapore, Yokohama, Hong Kong,
Gotenborg, Felixstowe, Genoa, Vancouver, Montreal, Halifax, Shanghai
and Shenzhen.</P>

      <P>Chen encouraged the two losers to continue dedicating themselves

    <HEADLINE>CLEARING THE NAMES OF 2-28 INCIDENT VICTIMS A MILESTONE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
clearing the names of the victims of the 2-28 Incident is a milestone
for the nation as its democracy and human rights mature.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he presented rehabilitation
certificates to each of the victims or the representatives of the
victims of the 2-28 Incident in a ceremony held at the Presidential
Office. The certificates were co-signed by Chen and Vice President
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>"The 2-28 Incident was the biggest wound of Taiwan history since
World War II, " the president said. "The people of Taiwan wanted
social justice and democratic reforms, but were relentlessly
suppressed by the Nationalist government, resulting in heavy
casualties of Taiwan elites and average civilians."</P>
      <P>The Nationalist government, trying to cover its actions, labeled
the incident a "mutiny," and the victims "mobsters," he added.</P>
      <P>The president said that a rehabilitation certificate will not
bring back past lives, but he was convinced that the incident was
brought into the public consciousness only after the efforts of so
many democratic forerunners.</P>
      <P>After "scores of years of declassifying files and the
investigation of oral historians, " the president said the 2-28
Incident is no longer just a "violent disturbance, " or described as
"Communist China orchestrating mobsters, " but was "a protest against
social injustice, a demand for democracy, and the advocacy of Taiwan
people ruling Taiwan," which he said has become the "2-28 spirit" and
an "asset of Taiwan's historical culture."</P>
      <P>He stressed that to "right the wrongs, pursue historical truth and
social justice is the root of a nation based on human rights, and the
rehabilitation of names of the 2-28 Incident is the upholding of human
rights, and a milestone for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He extended his apologies again to the victims and their
relatives for their sufferings over the years, hoping that every one
in Taiwan would "learn from the incident, and work toward making
Taiwan a just, peaceful country with dignity."</P>
      <P>Addressing the same occasion, Vice President Lu said that there
should not be only concerts and flowers in memory of the incident
each year, but that all generations should "learn the historical
truth."</P>
      <P>The 2-28 Memorial Foundation has agreed to do more to let the
nation learn about the incident, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that many international figures have asked her who was
the real culprit behind the 2-28 Incident. Finding the truth is the
responsibility of all citizens, she said.</P>
      <P>Ouyang Wen, a representative of the victims, echoed Lu's views,
saying that everyone should be positive about the government's
efforts to clear the names of the victims.</P>
      <P>He also said that education about the 2-28 Incident is
insufficient to allow the younger generation to understand the truth
and reflect on the tragedy, adding that the event should serve as a
major indicator of the future direction of the nation.</P>
      <P>The 2-28 Incident in 1947 was triggered when an elderly Taiwanese
woman selling untaxed cigarettes in Taipei was severely beaten by an
inspector of the Wine and Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. Faced by an angry
mob, the inspector shot dead a bystander and fled to a nearly police
station.</P>
      <P>Faced by massive protests and rioting and unable to control the
Situation, Taiwan Governor Chen Yi appealed for help to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek in mainland China, who sent troops to the northern
port city of Keeling, from where they spread out over the island,
killing along the way.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing period known as "White Terror," thousands of local
people, especially doctors, lawyers and scholars, were murdered or
imprisoned by the Nationalists, and many were not released until the
1980s. Public discussion of the incident was taboo until the early
1990s.</P>

      <P>You said he had adhered to his promise to "campaign in style" and
refrain from any mud-slinging tactics in the run-up to the election.</P>
      <P>Throughout the campaign, You said he had presented many policy

      <P>You said he feels a bit of regret that his policy initiatives

his supporters not to feel bad for his latest defeat.</P>
      <P>"Don't cry for me! My dear supporters, " an emotional You said in

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , said Saturday that the Hualien by-election
indicates "an uphill battle in the next seven months in the run-up to
the presidential election."</P>
      <P>Lien, who will team up with James Soong, chairman of the People
First Party (PFP), for the presidential election on March 20, 2004,
made the remarks after Hsieh Sheng-san, a joint candidate from the
KMT and the PFP, beat You Ying-lung, a ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) candidate, by a wide margin in the election to serve out
the remaining term to the end of 2005 left by late Magistrate Chang
Fu-hsing.</P>
      <P>Lien said that he was convinced that Hsieh "will definitely
deliver on his campaign promises and build Hualien into a happy
county."</P>
      <P>But he also said that "there are so many regrets" after the
election because during the process, the DPP "made good use of its
huge administrative resources," and that their "words and deeds set a
bad example."</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who concurrently serves as the DPP
chairman, Vice President Annette Lu, Premier You Shyi-kun and many
DPP heavyweights stumped for You in the campaign. The Ministry of the
Interior sent in large police force and set up road-side check
points several days prior to the hotly contested election to try to
stop vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Chairman James Soong said, "Hsieh's landslide
victory was a triumph of the people of Hualien and the pride of
Taiwan's democracy. The undemocratic practices of the DPP backfired
as evidenced by the way the people turned their backs to the party'
candidate."</P>
      <P>Soong also phoned Wu Kuo-tung, the former KMT member who ran
independently after failing to get the endorsement of the party and
who was eventually expelled from the KMT, after the election.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's policy center, observed
that Wu still has solid support at the grassroots level and his image
is good. Hualien voters only switched sides after the rivalry of the
ruling and the opposition camps heated up.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that the by-election was the first joint
nomination of the PFP and the KMT, which is strategically
significant, and has proved that the cooperation of the two parties
will be a plus for each party.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The victory of Hsieh Shen-san in the Hualien
magistrate by-election Saturday is a sign of success for the
"pan-blue alliance" of the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First-Party (PFP) in the 2004 presidential election, a KMT
leader said Saturday.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan has selected PFP Chairman James Soong as
his running mate for the presidential election and the two parties
strongly supported Hsieh in Saturday's by-election.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-chin, a leader of the KMT caucus at the Legislative Yuan
said the "pan-blue alliance" has full confidence in its ability to
win the presidential election, as long as the two parties continue to
cooperate.</P>
      <P>Lee said Hsieh's victory is partly attributable to the
dissatisfaction of the general public with the performance of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) over the past three years.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said that the by-election
was a litmus test for the solidarity of the "pan-blue alliance, " and
that Hsieh's victory indicates the cooperation between the KMT and
PFP is successful.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the by-election is a prelude to the upcoming
presidential election. He expressed the hope that the general public
will use their ballots to end the chaotic DPP rule and revive the
economy of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said at a news conference that his victory has
proved that the KMT and PFP can cooperate successfully. He said he
will do his best to fulfill all promises he made during his
by-election campaign.

    <HEADLINE>HUALIEN BY-ELECTION WINNER TO INVITE RIVALS TO BUILD COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsieh Shen-shan, joint candidate of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) and
magistrate-elect in Hualien County, on Saturday urged his formal
rivals to leave the election behind and join him in bettering
Hualien.</P>
      <P>Hsieh shouted "Hsieh Shen-san won, Hualien people won, KMT-PFP
cooperation won" after he learned that he beat You Ying-lung, a
scholar-turned-politician nominated by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , by garnering 51.4 percent of the votes
against You's 28.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The third candidate, Wu Kuo-tung, a former Hualien magistrate and
a veteran KMT member who was expelled from the party after he
insisted on running despite failing to get the endorsement from the
party, received 18.3 percent of the votes. In the five-way race, the
other two candidates were considered also-rans.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed his appreciation for the stumping efforts of the
KMT and PFP, especially KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James
Soong who had "braced the sweltering summer heat to stump" for him
over the past days.</P>
      <P>He said that his election proves that "a clean election can still
win," and highlights the quality of Hualien people as well as serving
as a litmus test for the alliance between the KMT and PFP, a
combination for success.</P>
      <P>Hsieh vowed to deliver on his campaign promises. He also will
call Wu Kuo-tung to learn from his rich experience in Hualien, and
will invite You to help him build up Hualien.</P>
      <P>Hsieh shouted to his supporters: "Taiwan's happiness starts from
Hualien," and "Hualien's happiness starts from us."</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that he never said that he would only serve one
term as Hualien magistrate, saying that the length of his term will
be decided by the Hualien people alone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS SEE NO RELATION BETWEEN HUALIEN ELECTION AND 2004 RACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two scholars said Saturday they see few
links between the just-concluded Hualien County magistrate
by-election and the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Hualien poll, which was aimed at electing a new magistrate to
serve out the remainder of the four-year term left vacant by Chang
Fu-hsing who died from lung cancer in May, was seen by many as the
last chance for rivaling domestic political camps to rehearse their
campaign strategies for next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Two political science professors said the landslide victory of
Hsieh Shen-shan, who represented the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) in the
by-election, was expected to boost the alliance's morale.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they said the Hualien poll was a local election
whose result couldn't serve as a guide for the 2004 presidential
race.</P>
      <P>Prof. Sheng Chih-jen of Soochow University said Hualien voters
account for less than 1.5 percent of the nation's total eligible
voters. Moreover, he said, Hualien's population structure differs
significantly from that of the whole island. In Hualien, the island's
four major ethnic groups -- Hokien, Hakka, aborigines and mainlanders
-- are roughly the same.</P>
      <P>"This structure is seldom seen in other areas of the island, " he
noted, adding that Hualien has traditionally been a "pan-blue"
stronghold where the KMT has controlled its magistrateship
uninterrupted for more than five decades. In contrast, he said, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has a limited power base in
the eastern county.</P>
      <P>Given all these elements, Sheng said, the Hualien outcome is not
expected to have a decisive effect on the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Pro. Wang Yeh-li of Tunghai University, seconded Sheng's
comments, saying that the Hualien poll was a local-level election and
could only be seen as a rehearsal of campaign strategies ahead of
next year's race between the "pan-blue alliance" and the "pan-green"
camp of the DPP and its pro-independence ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan also stressed that the
Hualien by-election was basically not a party-to-party race nor was
it a prelude to the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee acknowledged that the DPP campaigned all out for its
candidate You Ying-lung. "We lost partly because we didn't do enough
over the long term to cultivate our support base in the county, which
contains a large area. Our candidate began campaigning only three
weeks before the vote. We must devote more energies to building our
power base in the region and fine tuning our campaign tactics in the
future," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEADING FIGURE IN TAIWAN'S ANTI-SARS CAMPAIGN VISITING U.S. CAPITAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 2 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of Taiwan's leading figures in its
campaign against SARS, former Department of Health Minister Lee
Ming-liang, arrived in Washington, D.C., Friday to an overwhelming
welcome by members of the Taiwanese communities in the eastern United
States.</P>
      <P>Lee met with members of the Taiwan Benevolence Association in the
U.S. capital Saturday at a discussion that recapped Taiwan's ordeals
and experiences in its battle to contain severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) between April and June.</P>
      <P>Lee, who was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as chief of
the SARS Prevention and Relief Committee and who led the people of
Taiwan in the nearly three-month fight against the flu-like disease,
said SARS has been contained in Taiwan, but added that the war
against the potentially-deadly disease will never end as it could
resurface at anytime and anywhere.</P>
      <P>Noting that he is does not have confidence in the verity of the
information and tallies on SARS epidemic and prevention from mainland
China, Lee said Taiwan should announce "SARS free" or "SARS safe"
only after the disease is rooted out from the Chinese mainland once
and for all.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is in Washington for a week-long visit, is scheduled to
deliver a speech at the United Nations Correspondents Association
Aug. 6 on Taiwan's SARS-fighting experience in his capacity as a
professor at Taiwan's Tzu Zhi University and as an international
public health expert.</P>
      <P>During his stay in the U.S. capital, Lee will meet with officials
from the U.S. Department of Health and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention to convey Taiwan's gratitude to the United
States for its timely assistance in helping the island contain SARS.</P>
      <P>Lee is also scheduled to take part in a symposium on public
health issues to be sponsored by the think tank the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.</P>
      <P>Lee received a standing ovation Saturday when he finished his
speech to the Taiwan Benevolence Association members.</P>
      <P>He said he and the Taiwan people passed through a difficult and
unforgettable ordeal during the most trying two months between May 7
and July 5 after he was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as the
head of the SARS Prevention and Relief Committee. The committee has
served as a supervisory body as well as a driving force in Taiwan's
battle against SARS which originated in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He recalled that he made an announcement on May 24 in which he
told the Taiwan people that they could resume their normal lives from
that day. He said that the announcement was a "big gamble" when the
stakes were high -- namely a time when people were losing faith, the
business sector was in the doldrums, shops and restaurants were
closed, streets were deserted, and the SARS outbreak was showing
little signs of abating.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that the people in Taiwan receive influenza vaccine
shots beginning in October of this year to lower the risk of flu
transmission as one of the ways of preventing the reemergence of
SARS.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that he does not think it is a good idea, as some
Taiwanese have suggested, that Taiwan term SARS as the "Chinese
pneumonia." He said that although calling SARS the "Chinese
pneumonia" may help the Taiwan people vent their anger with mainland
China for under-reporting the epidemic situation there, Taiwanese of
Chinese origin living in non-Chinese societies will inevitably suffer
in the end as a result.</P>
      <P>He pointed to an experience he had as an example, recalling how
one day when he was on a train from Baltimore at a time when the SARS
outbreak in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong was making headlines
around the world, a young American girl sitting not far from him
stared at him nervously and said to her mother: "Look at that Chinese
man, I wonder if he has SARS."</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA ACTIVATES DISASTER CONTINGENCY CENTER AS TYPHOON APPROACHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture
(COA) activated its disaster contingency center Sunday as Typhoon
Morakot approached southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Morakot is expected to bring torrential rainfall and
strong winds to the eastern, southern and southeastern parts of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The COA contingency center is helping the agricultural and
fishery sectors to carry out preparedness and prevention measures
against the typhoon.</P>
      <P>As of 2 p.m. Sunday, Typhoon Morakot was located some 90
kilometers southeast of Oluanpi, the southernmost tip of Taiwan,
moving northwest toward the island at a speed of 19 kilometers per
hour.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stock of fresh vegetables and fruits islandwide totaled
about 4,500 metric tons as of Sunday, enough to meet domestic demand
for about three weeks in the event of natural disasters triggered by
the approaching typhoon, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Central Weather Bureau (CWB) forecasters, Typhoon
Morakot, the ninth tropical storm in the Pacific this year, has
gained momentum since noon Sunday, with the Hengchun Peninsula in
southern Taiwan expected to come under the "skirt" of Morakot by the
evening.</P>
      <P>The forecasters said Typhoon Morakot is expected to pass by
Taiwan's southern tip Sunday night.</P>
      <P>Morakot, originally a low pressure system when it was located
near Luzon Island, Philippines, gained momentum rapidly Saturday
afternoon and was upgraded to a light typhoon.</P>
      <P>Although Morakot is not expected to make landfall directly on
Taiwan, the CWB meteorologists called for ships operating in the
Bashi Channel and along Taiwan's southeastern coast to pay special
attention to high waves and strong winds as the typhoon continued
gaining strength.</P>
      <P>People living in low-lying areas in the Hengchun Peninsula,
Orchid Island, Green Island, Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan and
Penghu should keep on guard against possible floods and landslides as
Typhoon Morakot is expected to bring torrential rains and strong
winds to the eastern, southern and southeastern parts of the island
Monday and Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a low pressure front that had formed near Guam earlier
than Morakot is still moving slowly toward the South Pacific island.
The weather bureau is closely monitoring whether this low pressure
front develops into another typhoon, CWB meteorologists said.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the museum is to educate the people about the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CYCLIST FAMILY COMPLETES GLOBAL TROT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco,  Aug.  2 (CNA)
(By Jiang Ying and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The four-member Taiwan family that
has been on a globe-trotting bicycle journey since last July rode
across the Golden Gate Bridge Saturday to finish the U.S. leg of
their trip, formally completing their year-long around-the-world
adventure.</P>
      <P>Mounting their heavy-duty bicycles, Huang Chin-pao, a welder,
along with his wife and two teenaged sons, were accompanied by 48
bicycle-riding supporters when they began the cross-bridge ride at 9
a.m.</P>
      <P>Among the supporters were Lee Shih-min, representative of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco, and members of
the Taiwanese and Chinese communities in California, including a
nine-year-old cyclist and a 60-year-old rider as the youngest and the
oldest in the group.</P>
      <P>Cycling across the Golden Gate Bridge was probably a piece of
cake for the Huangs, who have been on the road around the world over
the past 12 months. However, the bridge-crossing ride can be a
daunting task for people who seldom or never mount a bicycle. Yeh
Chu-kuo, a consultant to the ROC government in overseas Chinese
affairs, said he would not have dared to attempt it if he had not
practiced cycling over the last two weeks.</P>
      <P>The Huang family, who have been the talk of the town in Taiwanese
communities across America since last year, arrived in San Francisco
July 31 to prepare for their last dash.</P>
      <P>The family is scheduled to fly back to Taiwan Sunday, formally
ending their 14-country, 25,000-kilometer global trek.</P>
      <P>The Huangs are scheduled to be feted later Saturday by the
Chinese-language World Journal -- a spin-off of the United Daily News
in Taiwan -- which is one of the sponsors of the Huang family's
cycling trip.</P>
      <P>On the U.S. leg of their trip, the family biked some 7,000
kilometers across the northern part of the country, beginning in New
York and passing through Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, North Dakota,
Montana and Washington, among other states.</P>
      <P>The family completed their global trip about a month earlier than
expected.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in Spokane, the largest city in eastern
Washington State, the Huang family passed through the rugged Rocky
Mountains -- during which they cycled 170 kilometers in a single day.</P>
      <P>On May 3, during their stay in New York, the father of the
cycling family said that the adventure had made him understand how
immense and wonderful the world is.</P>
      <P>The Huangs flew into New York May 2 from the Netherlands after
having pedaled 18,000 kilometers across the Asian and European
continents on specially designed bicycles.</P>
      <P>"We have endured many hardships since starting our adventurous
journey 10 months ago, but we have also received enormous returns, "
Huang had told a news conference held at the New York Overseas
Chinese Cultural Service Center.</P>
      <P>The Huangs kicked off their global cycling journey from Hong
Kong, first pedaling across mainland China, through the Gobi Desert
and into Pakistan, where they encountered armed strife between
government troops and guerrilla forces.</P>
      <P>They took a month-long break after reaching Turkey via Iran,
during which time they applied for visas to continue their ride
through Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany and the
Netherlands.</P>
      <P>"Along the way, we had to endure frigid winter weather and
sandstorms. However, we also enjoyed marvelous delights, particularly
magnificent natural scenery and the hospitality of strangers. The
trip has brought us unforgettable experiences," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Huang seconded her husband's account, saying that what has
touched her most is the friendship and assistance from strangers. "
Throughout our journey, we have received warm greetings, well wishes
and assistance from numerous people. When we needed help, nobody ever
turned down our request, " an emotional Huang recounted.</P>
      <P>"This saga has further solidified my belief in the goodness of
human nature. Ethnic and cultural differences did not hinder people
from showing us warmth," Mr. Huang said.</P>
      <P>The two sons -- Chien-chia and Chung-fu -- said they feel lucky
to be able to accompany their parents through so many countries, to
see for themselves the everyday lives of people of diverse races and
religions.</P>
      <P>Chien-chia, who will enroll in a medical college after returning
to Taipei this autumn, said he was impressed by the lifestyles in
Islamic countries and in certain East European nations.</P>
      <P>"Much to my surprise, I found many people in those parts of the
world are very poor. I think I'm lucky to have been born in Taiwan,
as I have never experienced a lack of material goods," he said.</P>
      <P>Chung-fu, who will enter a senior high school this fall, said he
was often overwhelmed by the hospitality of the people he met during
their journey. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that he felt "a bit
tired" from all the pedaling.</P>
      <P>The family had to carry a total of 200 kilograms of basic daily
necessities on their heavy-duty bicycles. Mrs. Huang enjoyed the
privilege of carrying less than 50 kilograms as she also cooked and
did the family's laundry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD EXAMINE ITS ELECTION STRATEGIES: V.P. LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  3 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
should thoroughly examine its election strategies and seek
improvements, Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday in the wake of
the DPP's setback in the Hualien magistrate by-election.</P>
      <P>The DPP candidate, Yu Ying-lung, despite receiving all-out
support from the party as well as the administrative branch, lost to
Hsieh Shen-san, the "pan-blue" alliance candidate jointly fielded by
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>This was the third time that Yu has failed in running for
magistrate in the eastern coastal county.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that although the population composition remains an
important factor in Taiwan's elections, Yu said he still hopes that
the presidential election campaign in the coming months will focus on
public policies, adding that the 2004 election must not become
another ideological battlefield.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's election, Yu received 28.9 percent of the 143,511
votes, finishing far behind the KMT-PFP candidate Hsieh, who grabbed
51.4 percent of the votes. Wu Kuo-tung, a former KMT member who ran
as an independent, garnered 18.3 percent of the votes.</P>
      <P>Hsieh had the advantage of the fact that over the past decades,
the remote county has been a stronghold of the KMT, with all of
Hsieh's predecessors coming from the party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although the DPP refrained from discussing the effect
of the KMT-PFP solidarity on the Hualien election and its possible
impact on the upcoming presidential election, some pro-DPP
politicians have reminded the DPP of the importance of reinforcing
its strength among the grass roots.</P>
      <P>Huang Chao-tang, chairman of the Taiwan Independence Alliance,
attributed the pan-blue alliance candidate Hsieh's victory to the
support of PFP Chairman James Soong, who was Taiwan governor from
1993 to 1998 and is believed to have considerable influence among
local politicians and the grass roots in Hualien.</P>
      <P>Professor Chan Chung-yuan of National Chengchi University said
that while drafting campaign strategies for the 2004 presidential
election, political parties can take reference from the Hualien
by-election in terms of grass-roots support.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the population composition in Hualien -- 48
percent Minnan (southern Fukien) , 21 percent Hakka, 18 percent
mainlander (other than from southern Fukien or the Hakka sector in
the Canton provinces) , and 13 percent indigenous people -- is
comparable to that of Taiwan's overall population composition.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling DPP has continuously sought to dissociate the
local election in Hualien from the presidential election set for
March 2004, ranking party officials are also emphasizing the
importance of the grass roots.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Li Ying-yuan said Saturday evening
that the setback in Hualien has taught the DPP to be even more humble
and diligent in cultivating its grass-roots support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Sunday that Taiwan was not singled out for the United States' new
visa application rule which came into force Aug. 1.</P>
      <P>Applications for U.S. visas are now subject to a greater degree
of scrutiny than in the past. For many applicants, a personal
appearance interview is required as a standard part of visa
processing.</P>
      <P>The MOFA pointed out that the new rule is applicable to
passengers from all foreign countries and is part of the global
anti-terrorism campaign. It is not particularly aimed at visa
applicants from Taiwan, the ministry stressed.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said that it understands the position of the United
States in this regard and that it will continue to stay in contact
with U.S. authorities in the hope of reducing the impact on visa
applicants to a minimum.

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL BANK OVERDUE LOAN RATIO DOWN IN JUNE:  FINANCE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   3  (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The overdue loan ratio posted by
Taiwan-based banks fell to 5.68 percent in June, the lowest figure
recorded over the past two and a half years, according to statistics
released recently by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the drop mainly to the increase of loans
granted by domestic banks, which amounted to NT$14.23 trillion
(US$412.5 billion) as of the end of June, up NT$233 billion over the
figure in March.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the officials said, the banks' efforts to improve
their operations and financial structure by writing off overdue loans
and selling their non-performing loans have borne fruit.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, overdue loans owed to the various domestic
banks totaled NT$809 billion, down by NT$460 billion from the first
quarter's level, they noted.</P>
      <P>Along with the recovery in Taiwan's economy, loans granted by

    <HEADLINE>HUALIEN ELECTION PROVIDES VALUABLE LESSONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Saturday's Hualien county magistrate
by-election has provided valuable lessons to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) as well as the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and People First Party (PFP) for the 2004 presidential election,
political analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The election in the eastern Taiwan county has raised questions
among political observers as to why Hsieh Shen-san, the candidate
jointly fielded by the KMT and PFP, defeated the DPP's You Ying-lung
despite the latter receiving the all-out support of the party and
administration.</P>
      <P>Hsieh received 51.4 percent of the ballots cast, finishing far
ahead of You, who received 28.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Political observers are also asking whether the Hualien election
is any measure of what the outcome might be for the 2004 presidential
election in which president Chen Shui-bian is set to square off
against KMT Chairman Lien Chan and his running mate PFP chief James
Soong.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP have repeatedly emphasized that the by-election
in Hualien is a rehearsal of the presidential election and a test of
the unprecedented cooperation between the two parties.</P>
      <P>The two parties urged their supporters to engineer another "power
transfer" like the one in Hualien, although the late Hualien
Magistrate Chang Fu-hsin whose death triggered the by-election was a
KMT member.</P>
      <P>Soong and Lien grabbed 78 percent of votes in Hualien between
them in the 2000 presidential election, with Soong garnering about 60
percent and Lien receiving nearly 20 percent in the five-way race.</P>
      <P>Both Lien and Soong stumped for Hsieh during the campaign in the
hopes that their popularity would help Hsieh win.</P>
      <P>Although Hsieh won only 51.4 percent of votes, Wu Kuo-tung, who
was expelled from the KMT for insisting on running and who vowed to
join the PFP if he won, garnered 18.3 percent of vote in Saturday's
election. Political analysts therefore said that the two parties
together still enjoy the support of roughly 70 percent to 80 percent
of the Hualien voters.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which drafted You to be its candidate only a few days
before the deadline for candidate registration, has tried hard to
play down the significance of the by-election, saying that it is only
a local election and that the results will not have a bearing on the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP was out in full force throwing its support
behind You during the campaign, with DPP heavyweights coming to the
county to stump for him on more than 100 occasions.</P>
      <P>You, who had already failed on four previous occasions in running
for public office in Hualien, had said he was not interested in the
race at all but was forced to bear the party standard after being
asked by President Chen Shui-bian who doubles as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Chen and his chief of staff Chiou I-jen stumped for You and gave
him advice on campaign policy.</P>
      <P>The DPP-run administration seemed to have done its utmost to
canvass support for You. Cabinet members from Premier You Shyi-kun on
down endorsed You's every campaign promise, including a monthly
allowance to leaders of every aboriginal tribe and free dentures for
senior citizens.</P>
      <P>The heavy involvement of DPP leaders in the campaign turned what
they called a local election into a showdown between the ruling party
and the KMT-PFP alliance and vindicated the KMT and PFP's claims that
the by-election is a harbinger of the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior's high-profile crackdown on
vote-buying in Hualien, especially the setting up of road checks and
sentinels outside aboriginal communities, backfired among the
indigenous people who account for one-fourth of the Hualien voters.</P>
      <P>An outspoken prosecutor in Hualien criticized the police's
indiscriminative checks of all cars on the roads as an infringement
on human rights which are enshrined in the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>The controversy surrounding the extreme measures employed by
police to prevent vote-buying played into the hands of the opposition
parties which denounced the government for what they called contempt
for aboriginal citizens.</P>
      <P>What is worse, a suspected vote-buyer caught by police on the eve
of the election day was reported to be a campaign worker for the DPP
candidate, to the detriment of You's campaign.</P>
      <P>The fact that You received fewer votes in all four rural
townships of aboriginal citizens than he did in the 2001 election for
Hualien magistrate seems to bear out critics' claims that Minister of
the Interior You Cheng-hsien's efforts to stop vote-buying did more
harm to the DPP than to the opposition.</P>
      <P>You's defeat also shows that pork barrel politics aimed at wooing
the support of special groups is no-longer a vote-getter for the
ruling party because the middle-class, which makes up the bulk of the
voters, has begun to question the fairness of these policies and has
become tired of them.</P>
      <P>For the KMT and PFP, the victory in Hualien is not a guarantee
that they will win the next presidential election, according to Ge
Youngguan, the president of a pro-Kuomintang association Mirror Club.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a symposium on the Hualien by-election on Sunday, Ge
said the makeup of Hualien's population -- divided roughly evenly
between Hoklos, Hakkas, aboriginal citizens and mainland Chinese who
emigrated to Taiwan after 1949 -- is different from that of Taiwan as
a whole. He said that therefore, the outcome of the Hualien election
might not provide any indication as to the possible outcome of a
national election.</P>
      <P>However, the election result shows that the KMT and PFP have a
chance to win only when they unite, Ge added.</P>
      <P>The reason for You's election failure lies more in the poor
performance of the DPP administration than in You's unpopularity, Ge
said.</P>
      <P>Yang Jih-ching, a professor at National Chengchi University, said
at the same symposium that the Hualien by-election proves that the
voters have learned to vote for candidates based not only on what
they have said but also on what they have done. "Empty campaign
promises can hardly be sold to the voters," he added.</P>
      <P>Yang Taishun, a professor at the Chinese Culture University, said
at the symposium that Hsieh's victory proves that what matters in an
election is a candidate's image, and not age.</P>
      <P>Noting that 52-year-old Chen Shui-bian has claimed that the 2004
presidential race against Lien and Soong, who are both in their
sixties, would be a competition between a young leader and two old
men, Yang said the victory of Hsieh, who is 64, over You, who is 47,
proves that the voters don't judge candidates simply by their age,
adding that being a few years senior in age may not be that much of a
liability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOCK EXCHANGE TAX REVENUES FOR JULY FORECAST TO REACH NT$10 B.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance on Sunday forecast
that stock exchange tax revenues for July could reach NT$10 billion,
an 18-month record high, with Taiwan's stock market showing a marked
recovery over the past few weeks following months of sluggishness.</P>
      <P>Statistics released Sunday by the ministry indicated that since
the weighted index moved above 5,400 points, single-day stock trading
value has reached as high as NT$190 billion. The average daily
trading value of the Taiwan Stock Exchange in July was NT$128.4
billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's depressed stock market was hit hard earlier this year by
the U.S.-led war against Iraq and the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) outbreak.</P>
      <P>The market has shown signs of recovery since late April, and
President Chen Shui-bian's announcement in early July of a relaxation
on restrictions on foreign investment in Taiwan's stock market has
added stimulus to the recovery.</P>
      <P>A market analyst with the Jardine Fleming Investment Consulting
Co. said Sunday that Taiwan's stock market is expected to go up in
the second half of this year, judging from the overall economic
prospects and abundant capital.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development reported
recently that a survey among local manufacturing industries indicated
that most manufacturers consider that the economy has gradually
bottomed out. The CEPD said it expects that economic growth for this

earlier forecast of 3.52 percent made at the end of last year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian opened the 34th
International Physics Olympiad in Taipei Sunday, emphasizing that the
process rather than the results of learning is the focus of
education.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the annual competition in physics for
secondary school students from around the world, the president said
that students should be the center of any education system and that
the purpose of education should be to teach students to be
well-rounded individuals.</P>
      <P>Noting that investment in developing the people's intelligence
and mental abilities is the most valuable investment any country can
make, the president said the question of how to create an education
environment that inspires the student's imagination and creativity is
a challenge to both governments and educators around the world.</P>
      <P>He welcomed the 245 contestants from 54 countries taking part in
the nine-day competition this year, saying that the International
Physics Olympiad provides a valuable chance for students from around
the world to compete against and learn from each other.</P>
      <P>Calling the International Physics Olympiad "the Olympic Games in
physics, " the president said the competition is really an arena of
intelligence, where politics has no role to play.</P>
      <P>He said that although there inevitably are winners and losers in
competition, the friendship fostered in the process is more valuable
than winning or losing.</P>
      <P>The competition was originally scheduled to be held July 12-21
but was postponed to Aug. 2-11 because of the recent severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan. As a result, more
than ten countries, including mainland China, withdrew from the
event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has five members in this year's competition, has

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT-ORIENTED TAIWAN ECONOMY SAID BOTTOMING OUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export-oriented economy is expected
to rebound markedly in the second half of this year in the wake of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the U.S.-led war in
Iraq, according to major economic research institutes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's three leading economic research organizations -- the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) , the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CHIER) and the Institute of
Economics under Academia Sinica -- unanimously made the forecasts in
view of the strong demand from the international market following the
two prominent events during the first half of the year.</P>
      <P>In the domestic market, a series of government incentives,
including two special budgets worth NT$50 billion and NT$57.7 billion
(US$1.68 billion) , respectively, to tackle the negative impact of
SARS and to expand public works projects, also are expected to fuel
Taiwan's economic growth in the second half, they forecast.</P>
      <P>The CHIER predicted that the local economy and the foreign trade
sector will improve in the coming months thanks to the government's
economic stimulus measures despite the possibility of a SARS
comeback.</P>
      <P>It forecast Taiwan's annual economic growth for 2003 at 3.44
percent, up from an earlier estimate of 3.02 percent, and growth for
2004 at 4.62 percent.</P>
      <P>The TIER also adjusted upward its forecast of Taiwan's economic
growth for 2003 from 3.02 percent to 3.53 percent on the grounds that
the negative effects of SARS have been less than expected and because
of the government's pump-priming policy.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Economics under Academia Sinica forecast that
with local business conditions likely to improve in the third and
fourth quarters, government investment may post a 9.11 percent annual
increase for the six-month period -- in stark contrast to the
year-earlier level of a negative 10.87 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the domestic business and industry community
are also optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects for the near
term, evidenced in the fact that sales, led by information
industry-related sectors, are booming.</P>
      <P>An IBM Taiwan executive said that Taiwan's export-oriented
economy will undoubtedly benefit this year from an economic pickup in
the United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Following the SARS epidemic, local demand for personal computers
will also reach a climax in the fourth quarter, leading to an
industrial upgrading in the domestic industry, the IBM executive
said, adding that the information industry will play the role of
locomotive in fueling the expansion of the petrochemical, metal,
rubber and plastics sectors.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan agent of Japan's Toshiba Corp. is also highly upbeat
about the economic outlook for the last two quarters of 2003, saying
that major world-class corporate customers, such as Intel and
Citibank, have been very keen on ordering new telecommunications
equipment, while local demand for new models of Toshiba personal,
notebook and corporate computers has also been extremely robust.</P>
      <P>In the face of the fierce demand for facilities and equipment, a
fresh wave of business takeoffs is already in sight, the source
forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALASKAN COMPLETES AROUND-THE-ISLAND CYCLING JOURNEY OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the scorching sun, an American cyclist
from the cool state of Alaska has just completed his solo,
around-the-island cycling journey of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Robert Bloomfield, also known by his Chinese name Tseng Chen-lin,
had nearly been defeated by the high temperatures -- at times nearly
50 degrees Celsius -- on the road. Fortunately, he said, the hardship
of riding was overwhelmed by the people's warmheartedness and the
natural beauty of eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bloomfield said he came to Taiwan to take home his adult daughter
-- a Taiwan-born Mormon missionary who has been preaching around the
island by riding a bicycle over the past two years -- and decided to
ride around the island because he wanted to have the same experience
of cycling on Taiwan's roads as his daughter has had.</P>
      <P>He said his aim was also to pay gratitude to those people who
have extended help to his daughter, particularly to a bicycle shop
owner in Taitung, eastern Taiwan, for his timely repair for free of
her bicycle after she had an accident.</P>
      <P>The 53-year-old Bloomfield embarked on his 15-day,
around-the-island cycling journey July 3 from the home of his
Taiwan-born wife in Chunan, northern Taiwan. Cycling north, he passed
through Taoyuan, Taipei County and Keelung in some of the hottest
July weather in recent decades.</P>
      <P>Well aware that he might be defeated not by his age or by
fatigue, but by high temperatures, Bloomfield soon changed his riding
strategy.</P>
      <P>He changed his initial "9-to-5" riding schedule to a "dawn and
dusk" schedule, cycling in the early morning hours, then starting
again in the late afternoon after taking a break between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. During the break period, he rested in the shade under big
trees or near temples, churches and schools.</P>
      <P>From Keelung, Bloomfield cycled south, passing through the
eastern counties of Ilan, Hualien and Taitung, before turning right
into the South-bend Highway toward the southern city of Kaohsiung.
From Kaohsiung, he headed north on the west coast highway to arrive
back at his starting point of Chunan.</P>
      <P>During his journey, he met up several times with his wife,
surnamed Tseng, who took buses along roughly the same route as
Bloomfield's cycling route. They came together at churches where they
met with their religious friends.</P>
      <P>Bloomfield said cycling near Taroko Gorge near Tianshiang,
Hualien County, was the best part of his journey. The scenery of the
magnificent rocky gorge cut out by white and green brook water, with
swallows chirping and cool breeze blowing, replaced all the riding
hardships with pleasure and wonder, he said.</P>
      <P>"Many people warned me about trucks passing on the road, "
Bloomfield said. But to his surprise, he said, he found that truck
drivers on the highways in eastern Taiwan were friendly and amusing.
"They would honk three times to say hello or to cheer me up. They
even slowed down to make room for me and my bike," he recalled.</P>
      <P>He recalled how on one occasion when he was looking for a place
to eat and the sun was setting in a coastal village in Fengping,
Hualien, a villager invited him to his home for dinner. The villager
barbecued wild boar meat and served rice wine made by aboriginal
people.</P>
      <P>He said that as a Mormon, he declined the tempting offer of rice
wine, but he spent a great and unforgettable night, with the host
playing guitar and them taking turns belting out songs sung by
eastern Taiwan locals and those sung by people in Alaska.</P>
      <P>Bloomfield said he and his wife, who are the adoptive parents of
four Taiwan-born children, together prepared for his round-the-island
journey for more than a year. He said that by memorizing at least 10
Chinese words each day, he knew several thousand Chinese words and
phrases by the time he was ready to set off on his trip.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Bloomfield said her husband is more Chinese than she is,
pointing out that he likes to read the books of the ancient Chinese
Taoist philosophers Lao Zi and Zhuang Zi, and that he practices
calligraphy and has a black belt in kung fu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB COMPLETES TAIWAN WILDLIFE GENE DATABANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB) has established a Taiwan wildlife gene databank, including
gene maps of some endemic subspecies, to facilitate the nation's
campaign against illegal animal trade, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The bureau began to collate wildlife genetic data in 1993 when
Taiwan came under international pressure to intensify wildlife
protection and crack down on illegal trade in endangered species and
their products.</P>
      <P>At that time, some people were smuggling products made from
protected animals by cutting them into slices or grinding them into
powder. Customs officers had difficulty identifying the protected
animal remains, and the absence of a wildlife gene bank made DNA
tests meaningless.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) then sought the assistance of
the MJIB which is known for its DNA testing technology and equipment
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MJIB first cooperated with Taipei City Zoo which furnished
the bureau with blood or saliva samples of its animals. The bureau
then mapped DNA sequences of various endangered fauna species for
reference.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau managed to secure samples of indigenous
wildlife species from Thailand, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian
countries, including tiger bones, ivory, bear bile and snakes, for
gene mapping work.</P>
      <P>After more than 10 years of hard work, the MJIB has finally set
up a comprehensive wildlife gene databank which includes genetic
blueprints or DNA data of nearly all Taiwan endemic subspecies, such
as the Formosan black bear, the clouded leopard and the Lanyu scops
owl (Otus elegans botelensis).</P>
      <P>With its detailed genetic data concerning Taiwan endemic
subspecies, the MJIB wildlife gene databank has attracted wide
international attention since it was linked up with major world
wildlife gene libraries earlier this year.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials said they have spent much time collecting samples
of Taiwan endemic species, some of which are almost extinct.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes, we have to travel around the island to search for
specimens left from earlier times. We need only a few hairs to sort
out DNA of a subspecies and build up its gene data, " an MJIB
forensic expert said.</P>
      <P>DNA is a kind of genetic fingerprint unique to each individual.
It transmits hereditary characteristics from parents to offspring.</P>
      <P>If no specimens are available, he said, the MJIB will use animal
feces, feathers or skin provided by private wildlife field study
teams, to find the species' DNA data and map out its genetic
blueprints.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the completion of the wildlife gene databank, the MJIB
has unexpectedly discovered that some frozen beef products sold in
the local market might be kangaroo, horse or even sea turtle meat.</P>
      <P>MJIB forensic experts said they have reported the findings to the
Department of Health which has directed city and county health
bureaus to intensify market surveys to detect bogus beef. But so far,
no such cases have been uncovered.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENGINE DEAL NOT YET DECIDED: CAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) management said Monday
that the company has yet to decide which company it will choose to
provide jet engines for its newly-ordered planes.</P>
      <P>CAL, Taiwan's largest air carrier, is going to purchase engines
for 12 A330-300 and six B747-400 jets, worth a total of US$700
million to US$800 million. Several world leading manufacturers,
including General Electric and Pratt and Whitney of the United States
and Rolls Royce of Britain, have expressed keen interest in securing
the deal.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said the company is still conducting an assessment
on which of the three major bidders to grant the purchase order.</P>
      <P>Noting that the decision will be made based on the best interests
of CAL and that the purchase will not be affected by outside
interference, the CAL officials declined to confirm news reports that
GE and Rolls Royce have tried to use political influence to curry
favor.</P>
      <P>They also declined to confirm reports that Rolls Royce, which has
offered a price cut as well as repair and maintenance and spare parts
and components, is likely to get the deal for the 12 A330-300s, while
GE will get the deal for the six B747-400s.</P>
      <P>CAL officials also declined to comment on a newspaper report last
week that British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in an extremely unusual
move, wrote a letter to President Chen Shui-bian to pitch for the CAL
contract on behalf of Rolls Royce.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will base their purchase decision on the
credibility, after-sales technical support service, repair and
maintenance costs, as well as the price of the engines.</P>
      <P>CAL Chairman Lee Yun-ning also has said that the purchase will be
decided by the company alone and that the ROC government will issue
no special instructions on the deal.</P>
      <P>CAL officials reiterated these stances Monday in response to a
spate of accusations made by the CAL Labor Union that CAL management
is being arm-twisted by the government.</P>
      <P>The CAL Labor Union criticized the possible decision by CAL
management, under government influence, to introduce Rolls Royce jet
engines for the new A330-300s, which the union said would lead to a
skyrocketing of the company's engine maintenance costs as the
existing maintenance systems, designed for HP and GE engines, would
be forced to be changed.</P>
      <P>The CAL Labor Union also lambasted CAL management for deciding to
release some 36 percent of the corporation's stocks to "a certain
group" of buyers at low prices.</P>
      <P>Refuting the accusations, CAL officials said it is up to the
China Aviation Development Foundation -- an organization which
controls a majority stake in CAL -- to decide the share-releasing
issue, and that CAL management has no say in the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LAUDS ALTERNATIVE SERVICEMEN SERVING OVERSEAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday praised
the 36 people who recently completed their alternative military
service overseas, saying that they are a testament to what can be
achieved with hard work and dedication.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at a welcome-home celebration
sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the servicemen who
completed their 26-month alternative military service. Also in
attendance were Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien and members
of the diplomatic corps stationed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that "Taiwan reaching out" has long been his
wish, noting that he first broached the idea of alternative military
service when he noticed the dearth of younger agricultural experts
and the fact that older people in the field were retiring from
overseas agricultural missions. He said that this, teamed with the
need for medical assistance in countries that maintain diplomatic
ties with the ROC, made him realize the need for special, technical
emissaries from Taiwan. The alternate military service met these
needs, the president said.</P>
      <P>"I am deeply moved to see these 36 honorably-discharged
servicemen, knowing that they have strengthened their horizons by
doing important work in 21 countries," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said he was impressed to see the strength of mind
and body that was required of them to endure hardships, which he

      <P>The president also said that the alternative military servicemen
have lived up to his ideal of a "volunteer Taiwan and the use of
humanitarian diplomacy, " adding that he felt proud of them on behalf
of the people of Taiwan for "safely completing their work."</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of alternative military servicemen in
diplomatic work has increased by 40 percent from previous years, the
president said that the alternative military service policy has
worked well.</P>
      <P>The president urged the young people to think seriously of
continuing their work to help others by joining the ROC diplomatic
field or with international aid organizations. Chen said their
contributions would be a shot in the arm for Taiwan's humanitarian
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The 36 former servicemen, including the youngest recipient of the
ROC's diplomatic friendship award, Lien Chia-en, who helped Burkina
Faso build an orphanage and helped with environmental problems there;
Wang Hsiang-chih who served in Chad and helped with the
rehabilitation of the mother of the president of Chad; and Huang
Min-nung, who served in Sao Tome and Principe and learned to speak
Portuguese there.</P>
      <P>Many of the 36 servicemen have indicated that they would like to
take the foreign service exam to enter Taiwan's medical or technical
missions for a chance to return to the countries where they served.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several pro-democracy groups in Taiwan urged
Beijing Monday to release the U.S.-based mainland Chinese human
rights fighter, Yang Jianli, after a fair and public trial.</P>
      <P>Chien Shih-chieh, executive director of Peacetime Foundation of
Taiwan, Wang Dan, a mainland Chinese student leader in the 1989
pro-democracy uprising in Tiananmen Square, and representatives of a
lawyers' association, made the appeal while Yang was brought to a
secret trial in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Yang, with doctoral degrees from Harvard and Berkeley, was
arrested by mainland Chinese authorities in April last year while
entering mainland China on a false U.S. passport.</P>
      <P>After being put in jail for more than one year, Yang was accused
of illegally entering mainland China and spying for Taiwan, and was
brought to a secret trial on Aug. 4.</P>
      <P>Yang, 40, who has American permanent residence, participated in
the 1989 pro-democracy protest and offered funds to the event. He was
among the last group of Chinese students to leave the Tiananmen
Square.</P>
      <P>Since then, Beijing has refused Yang's entry into the country and
informed its embassies abroad not to extend the validity of his
Chinese passport.</P>
      <P>According to Yang's wife, Yang visited Taiwan several times in
the 1990s to study the island's democratization, because he thinks
Taiwan's experience in democracy can serve as a good example for
mainland China.</P>
      <P>She went on that Yang had no choice but to use other people's
passports as his passport cannot be extended. She said returning
one's home town is a basic right of a citizen.</P>
      <P>After Yang was imprisoned, support from all over the world,
especially from the United States, flooded in, urging Beijing to
release Yang without any conditions.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan pro-democracy activists said since Beijing
insisted on a secret trial, they worried about Yang's situation.</P>
      <P>They urged Beijing authorities to respect human rights, show
sincerity in reforms, and not to harass dissidents under the guise of
dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait problems.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF PLANS TO REVISE LAW TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BORROW MORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) confirmed
Monday it is considering revising the public debt law to pave the way
for city and county governments to borrow more money.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the ministry said, no details regarding the planned
amendments have been fleshed out.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to media reports that the MOF plans
to raise the cap on city and county governments' combined outstanding
debts from the current 2 percent to 3 percent of the nation's average
annual gross national product (GNP) for the past three years.</P>
      <P>The existing public debt law imposes some restrictions on local
governments' fund-raising activities, including that the annual debt
a city or county government is eligible to borrow should not surpass
15 percent of its annual expenditure and that its accumulated
outstanding loans must fall below 45 percent of its annual spending.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the law stipulates that the aggregate outstanding debts
of all city and county governments must not exceed 2 percent of the
nation's average annual GNP for the past three years.</P>
      <P>By the end of this year, the total debts incurred by the nation's
23 city and county governments will reach more than NT$167 billion,
only NT$35 billion below the legal ceiling.</P>
      <P>Liu Teng-cheng, director of the MOF's Department of National
Treasury, said most local cities and counties have some sort of
financial problems.</P>
      <P>In view of the approaching of their accumulated debts to the
legal cap, Liu said, the ministry is studying the feasibility of
easing their fund-raising restrictions.</P>
      <P>But he added that the ministry has yet to finalize a
comprehensive adjustment plan.</P>
      <P>"We may not necessarily raise the limit to 3 percent of the
nation's annual GNP," Liu explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the current law, the cumulative debts of
governments at all levels ought not to surpass 48 percent of the
nation's average annual GNP for the past three years, with the
central government given the lion's share of 40 percent; the Taipei
City Government, 3.6 percent; the Kaohsiung City Government, 1.8
percent; other city and county governments, 2 percent; and township
governments, 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Liu said the ministry may adjust the eligible borrowing ratios
for various levels of governments to allow city and county
governments to borrow more money while keeping the 48 percent cap
unchanged.</P>
      <P>At the moment, cumulative debts of township governments account
for only 0.1 percent of the nation's GNP, compared to Taipei's 1.7
percent and Kaohsiung's 0.8 percent. Taipei and Kaohsiung are special
municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU EXPELS LAWMAKER FOR FALSE ACCUSATIONS, BAD TEMPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A policy-making body of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) decided to expel Legislator Su Ying-kuei
from the party Monday, accusing him of making false charges against
fellow TSU Legislator Lo Chih-min and tarnishing the party's image.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia told a news conference after
a meeting of the TSU Central Executive Committee that the decision
was made by the committee unanimously.</P>
      <P>The dispute originated from Su's public accusation last week
against Lo, claiming that Lo debased himself and the party by trying
to obstruct the judicial investigation of a scandal involving senior
police officers who allegedly turned a blind eye to illegal video
game parlors in Kaohsiung City.</P>
      <P>A lawyer-turned legislator, Su also accused Lo funding public
events through the use of money obtained by public relations
departments of state-run companies such as Taiwan Power Company,
Chinese Petroleum Corporation and Taiwan Water Supply Corporation.
While not illegal, Su said, this sort of funding is morally incorrect
since legislators should not be using corporate money to pay for
community activities.</P>
      <P>Lo denied the allegations and asked the TSU to discipline Su.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General Lin said a document produced by Su as evidence
failed to support his claims. In the document, three prosecutors at
the Kaohsiung District Court, who have been tasked to investigate the
scandal surrounding video game parlors in Kaohsiung City, said only
that Lo called their superior, urging him to conduct the
investigation fairly and not to infringe on video parlor owners'
legal rights.</P>
      <P>In addition to the damage Su's false accusation has caused to Lo
and to the party, Lin said Su voted against vital bills in defiance
of the TSU's party line many times and is ill-tempered, often
throwing objects at party lawmakers who disagree with him in
discussions of party policies.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, the TSU Central Executive Committee
unanimously decided to expel Su from the party, Lin said.</P>
      <P>It was a difficult decision for the party, which will soon
celebrate its two-year anniversary, but the party will ride out the
crisis and emerge stronger than before, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The TSU is a group consisting of followers of former President
Lee Teng-hui. It had 13 seats in the 224-member Legislative Yuan
before Su was expelled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NTU TOUTS ORGAN DONATIONS BETWEEN MARRIED COUPLES ON LOVER'S DAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital
held a party Monday for five people who donated either a section of
their liver or one of their kidneys to their spouses.</P>
      <P>The party took place in connection with the Chi Hsi Festival or
Chinese Valentine's Day -- the seventh day of the seventh moon on
lunar calendar which fell on Monday this year.</P>
      <P>The nation's most prestigious hospital said the number of live
organ donations between married couples has been increasing in recent
years. Since 1988, the hospital has performed 177 organ transplants
using liver sections and kidneys donated by living persons. Among
them, 20 cases or 11 percent of the total involved married couples.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-kun, an NTU surgeon, said that although married couples
do not have blood ties, they have exchanged low levels of antigens
through their long-term intimate relations which would increase their
immunity to rejection after organ transplants.</P>
      <P>Clinical studies show that the organ transplant rejection rate
between married couples is far lower than that for those performed on
people with no blood relations, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He added that the rejection rate is the lowest in cases where
husbands donate organs to their wives. 'This is because the husbands'
antigens could have long entered their wives' wombs through placentas
during pregnancy."</P>
      <P>Noting that organ donation will not adversely affect the donor's
health nor his or her life span, Tsai said organ donation between
married couples provides a new hope and new way for those who need
organ transplants to sustain their lives.</P>
      <P>Lai Ming-kun, director of the NTU's cancer department, said the
hospital's 20 successful liver and kidney transplants among married
couples provide the best testament to the belief that "love can fight
rejection."</P>
      <P>Among the five couples who attended the NTU party was 49-year-old
Mr. Hsiao, who donated one of his kidneys to his wife in March this
year.</P>
      <P>Hsiao said he is very happy to see his wife return to normal life
after her transplant. Hsiao's wife began to rely on renal dialysis 10
years ago. Although their children met the requirements to donate a
kidney to their mother, Mrs. Hsiao would not accept one for fear of
affecting their marriages. After many rounds of tests, doctors
found that Mr. Hsiao was a fitting donor and performed the
transplant in mid-March.</P>
      <P>Also present was a couple surnamed Wu. The husband contracted an
acute liver disease and lapsed into a coma in early February this
year. As all of their children were younger than 18, Mrs. Wu decided
to donated part of her liver to save her husband's life. A tearful Wu
said at the party he was grateful for his wife's organ donation. "I
want to marry you in my next life," he told her at the party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new alliance grouping the nation's
underprivileged social organizations will be formed Aug. 10,
the chief executive of the Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan (PFT)
announced Monday.</P>
      <P>"We want to pool the strength of the social
activists to influence next year's presidential election," PFT
Executive Director Chien Hsi-chieh said.</P>
      <P>Chien, who once served as an at-large lawmaker representing the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for two terms, said he
began to promote the formation of a new group more than six months
ago.</P>
      <P>Scores of social groups, including labor unions, elderly
rights associations, educationAL reform activists,
associations for the disabled, students' and women's rights activists
as well as environmentalists, have decided to join the new alliance,
Chien said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, the name and the framework of the new
group have yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>"The so-called 'Pan-purple Alliance' proposed by some people
is just one of our choices," Chien said, adding that the group's
formal name will be announced Aug. 10.</P>
      <P>He said the new alliance will not be a political party.
"We'll focus on promoting fair and just social welfare services and
speak for disadvantaged."</P>
      <P>Chien said the new group hopes to become a "third force" in
contrast to the "pan-green" camp of the DPP and its ally -- the
Taiwan Solidarity Union -- and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>But he said the new alliance will not insist on nominating its
own candidate in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chien confirmed media reports that he had tried to persuade
Lin Yi-hsiung, a former DPP chairman, to represent the new alliance
in running for the presidency next year. "However, Lin
turned down my suggestion," he added.</P>
      <P>Chien used to be a member of the DPP's largest "New Tide"
faction. "But I have not paid membership fees for more than two
years. I don't know whether I'm still a DPP member."</P>
      <P>None of his former DPP colleagues in the Legislative Yuan have
 contacted him since he began to push for the formation of
the new alliance.</P>
      <P>Chien said the main purpose of the new alliance is to
provide a third choice for local people. "We'll present new
welfare policy initiatives, spell out the aspirations and
apprehensions of wage earners and the underprivileged, as
well as provide options for the nation's future development,"
he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's jewelry designers have been turning
heads recently in the international market and the president of the

Taiwan jewelry would shine even brighter around the world.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-fu, president of the association, noted that top

showing the creativity of Taiwan's jewelry designers.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in the prestigious Vicenza jewelry fair this year,
more than 5,000 works from 1,700 participants of 52 countries took
part in its Gold Virtuosi Awards. Only 100 works were selected for
the awards, among them works by four Taiwan jewelry designers and Lin
Hsiao-tung and Yang Pao-feng eventually won two prizes.</P>
      <P>The Gold Virtuosi Awards, the Academy Awards of the jewelry
field, were created by the World Gold Council to inspire unrestricted
creativity from gold jewelry designers, to honor excellence in
craftsmanship and ultimately to expand the horizons of gold jewelry
worldwide.</P>
      <P>Lee also cited the example of Taiwan jewelry designer Pei-san
Hsieh, who won the grand prize in the men's first class jewelry
contest in an international trade show in Paris last September,
becoming the first Taiwanese to win such an award.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the association is hoping to have more excellent
designers join and establish a "creative people databank" to support
the government to develop the industry.</P>
      <P>The association is hoping to sponsor international jewelry design
competitions in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks on the eve of a seminar sponsored by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will launch a series of promotional
activities from October to rekindle its tourism, which was hard hit
by the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the
island.</P>
      <P>In a meeting to review the progress of a national development
plan, Premier Yu Shyi-kun instructed the Tourism Bureau to coordinate
the actions of the tourism sector to attract more foreign travelers
and strengthen contacts with European tour operators.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, the number of travelers to
Taiwan stood at 963,882 for the first half of this year, a decrease
of 31.87 percent over the same period of last year, while the hotel
occupancy rate in June also dropped by 27.45 percent over the same
month of 2002.</P>
      <P>After SARS affected Taiwan, a total of 17 hotels shut down,
laying off 2,621 employees.</P>
      <P>For this, the island has readjusted its original plan to achieve
three million visits to Taiwan by foreign travelers this year to 2.1
million.</P>
      <P>Tourism businesses began to recover in late June, when SARS had
been contained, with the business in July recovering to 70 percent of

    <HEADLINE>WHETHER THERE WILL BE FURTHER WATER RATIONING TO BE DECIDED NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Second-stage water rationing in Keelung,
northern Taiwan will begin Aug. 9, and whether further restrictions
will be introduced in northern Taiwan will be decided next week, a
task force under the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming presided over a
contingency task force on drought relief Monday to review the
rainfall from Typhoon Morakot, which brought ample rain to eastern,
central and southern Taiwan, but contribute little to the parched
north.</P>
      <P>First-stage water restrictions will continue in the greater
Taipei area, meaning a reduction of water pressure off peak hours,
 while Keelung will implement second-stage water rationing,
meaning the suspension or restriction on non-household water use.</P>
      <P>It has not rained for 43 days in Keelung. The city's water supply
at night has been decreased since July 29. On Aug. 9, water to large
users, such as swimming pools and car washes will be cut by a total of
20 percent.</P>
      <P>But whether there will be further water rationing for Keelung,
and whether Taipei will impose the next stage of water rationing will
be decided in another meeting Aug. 14.</P>
      <P>Hualien, benefiting from the ample rain brought by the typhoon,
will end its first-stage water rationing and resume normal water
supply.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director of the Water Resources Agency under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that Typhoon Morakot did not help
northern Taiwan. Shihmen Reservoir is still below its minimum of
220.67 meters, while Feitsui Reservoir is just a little higher than
the minimum of 141 meters.</P>
      <P>Statistics by the Water Resources Agency showed that rainfall
collected in Feitsui Reservoir was only 36.5 mm last month, or 14
percent of the average 259.9 mm in July over the past years. Shihmen
Reservoir took on rainfall of 114 mm last month, or 41.67 percent of
the average July rainfall of 273.59 mm.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC National Museum of History has
formed cooperative relations with two overseas museums, one in
Mongolia and one on the West Coast of the United States, an official
of the museum said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Kung-nan, director of National Museum of History, said that
he recently visited Mongolia and met with Sanduin Idshinnorov, the
curator of the National Museum of Mongolian History, and reached
consensus on promoting bilateral cultural exchanges July 30.</P>
      <P>They then signed an agreement on cultural cooperation, hoping to
enhance bilateral understanding and cooperation through the exchanges
of professionals and exhibitions.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Mongolian History was established in 1924,
and serves multiple functions relating to cultural, scientific and
educational purposes.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of History also recently signed an agreement
on cultural cooperation with the Wing Luke Asian Museum of Seattle,
which was established in 1967 in memory of the first Chinese city
councilman on the northwest coast of the United States.</P>
      <P>The main exhibits of the museum depict the life of
Asian-Americans, and the museum is the only Asian-American cultural
museum in the United States.</P>
      <P>The museum started from questions about a pair of shoes. In 1964,
a pair of Chinese shoes from the early 1900s were shown to Wing Luke,
a Seattle city councilman, and Luke then thought about establishing a
museum so that Asian-American could learn more about their past while
trying to integrate into the mainstream society of the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO LEARN FROM HUALIEN ELECTION DEFEAT: LEGISLATIVE WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will learn bitter lessons from its defeat in the weekend
Hualien County magistrate by-election, two influential DPP lawmakers
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chi-mai, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said its
unfair to attribute the defeat to an all-out campaign
against vote-buying initiated by Minister of the Interior Yu
Cheng-hsien.</P>
      <P>In his views, Chen said, many factors had led to the party's loss
in the eastern county's magistrate by-election in which the
opposition "pan-blue alliance's" candidate Hsieh Shen-san won a
landslide.</P>
      <P>"There was ample room for us to improve in publicity and manpower
mobilization," Chen said, adding that both the DPP's headquarters and
its election strategy panel have begun reviewing the
just-concluded by-election and will come up with various adjustment
initiatives.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lan seconded Chen's views saying that
it's not the DPP's tradition to pass bucks one another for an
electoral defeat.</P>
      <P>"We have been accustomed to learning lessons from
failures and growing stronger from hardships," Tsai said, adding that
the party will work even harder in the future to listen to the
"voice of grassroots people" and adjust its campaign strategies for
next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Emile Sheng, a Soochow University associate
professor, said the DPP has gradually lost its appeal to
middle-class and middle-age voters.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), Sheng
said the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
managed to consolidate its support base in the Aug. 2 Hualien
by-election, while the DPP garnered less votes than it secured in
the previous magistrate election. This signaled an alarm to the DPP,
he said.</P>
      <P>Sheng said although the DPP administration made many
welfare service promises in the run-up to the by-election, all
those initiatives didn't seem to sway Hualien voters.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Sheng said he believes that the electoral result will
prompt various political camps to re-evaluate the effectiveness
of welfare benefit promises in the future elections.</P>
      <P>Hualien has traditionally been a KMT stronghold. The voter turnout
was only about 55 percent in the weekend by-election. Sheng said the
voter-turnout may have an impact on the result of next year's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Sheng further said the "pan-blue alliance" should come up with
innovative policy initiatives, project a fresh image and
demonstrate a passion for reform if it wants to win the 2004
presidential race.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has lured domestic and
foreign investments of more than NT$643 billion (US$18.6 billion) in
the first half of this year, officials of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The figure accounts for 50.27 percent of the target of NT$1.281
trillion set by the government for this year, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance tops the list of government agencies in
implementing projects for wooing investments by achieving 78 percent
of its annual target during the Jan.-June period, followed by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs with 55 percent, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications with 43 percent, the Environmental
Protection Administration with 27 percent and the National Science
Council with 23 percent.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that many domestic and foreign businesses
are prepared to increase their investments in Taiwan after severe
acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks were contained in late June, the
CEPD officials predicted that the total amount of investments by the
private sector is expected to set a new record this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT AFFIRMS EXECUTIVE YUAN'S BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian confirmed the
government budget prepared by the Executive Yuan for 2004 Monday,
urging his administration to speed up financial reforms to keep the
country financially healthy over the long term.</P>
      <P>After being briefed by financial officials on the budget, the
president hailed the Executive Yuan's work in compiling the budget
amid limited growth in the government's revenue and ever-increasing
government outlays.</P>
      <P>Chen said the new budget was prepared in a way which accommodates
both the government's important agenda and its goal of promoting
economic growth.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan has done a good job in giving priority
to scientific development, public projects, defense, financial grants
for local governments, pensions for elder farmers, fishermen,
physically- and mentally-challenged, and retirement pensions for
teachers.</P>
      <P>In anticipating an upward turn in the economy next year -- thanks
to the government's huge investment in public construction and the
international economic recovery -- Chen said the Executive Yuan would
take this into account while calculating the budget to make the best
use of the government's limited resources.</P>
      <P>Under the 2004 budget, the central government's revenue was
estimated at NT$1.35 trillion (US$39.2 billion), with an outlay of
NT$1.61 trillion (US$46.75 billion), and a shortfall of NT$259.3
billion (US$7.5 billion) which, combined with NT$56.1 billion
(US$1.62 billion) for service on government's debts, will be covered
through loans and the budget surplus of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLLUTION CAUSED BY OIL SLICK FROM CAPSIZED M'LAND VESSEL NOT SERIOUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pollution caused by the oil slick from a
capsized mainland Chinese vessel is not serious, authorities on the
outlying island group of Kinmen reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen troops stationed on the islet of Mengfu, located between
Tatan and Little Kinmen, found the platform vessel capsized about
0.48 nautical miles southwest of the islet at 11 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>The coast guard then sent rescue vessels two times, but no one
was found aboard the ship. Rescuers later abandoned the rescue
missions due to strong winds and rough seas triggered by Typhoon
Morakot.</P>
      <P>When the mainland vessel capsized, it leaked out a large amount
of light diesel fuel.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Environmental Protection Bureau director Tsai Shih-ming,
braving rough seas, headed to the scene Tuesday. Tsai noted that the
oil slick was about 800 meters long Monday but that it has narrowed
to about 200 meters due to the sweeping sea waves as well as
evaporation.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen coast guard said the mainland vessel is now drifting
in a southwest direction after a night of rough seas and strong
winds, and is about 0.9 nautical miles away from Mengfu Islet and
approaching Xiamen, mainland China. They said the ship poses no
immediate danger.</P>
      <P>The coast guard said that they have contacted Xiamen authorities
and that the latter have promised to tow the capsized vessel back
after the rough seas become calm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HUMAN RIGHTS DELEGATION MEETS FOREIGN EXPERTS IN GENEVA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  4 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of human rights experts and
academics from Taiwan met with senior executives of major
international human rights organizations based in Geneva Monday.</P>
      <P>The two sides remained low-keyed about their meeting and agreed
not to disclose the contents of their 90-minute talks.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-chih, leader of the delegation who concurrently heads
the preparatory office of the Republic of China's national human
rights memorial hall, only told reporters that the sides had
exchanged views on a range of human rights issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>"The meeting lasted longer than scheduled as we passionately
discussed many topics, " Lee said, adding that the meeting proceeded
in an amicable atmosphere.</P>
      <P>The delegation arrived in Geneva on the fourth and last leg of
its current European tour aimed at collecting first-hand information
about the latest world trends in human rights development and
promotion. The group had already visited major human rights museums
in the Netherlands, Belgium and France before coming to Geneva.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, deputy secretary-general to the president who is
serving as honorary leader of the delegation, said education is the
main purpose of the government's plan to set up a national human
rights memorial hall.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the memorial hall will teach the younger
generation the meaning and importance of human rights, " Chen said,
adding that the project is part of the government's efforts to
prevent a recurrence of the tragic 2-28 Incident of 1947.</P>
      <P>The proposed national human rights memorial hall will be located
in the National Institute of Education Resources and Research in the
Nanhai Garden near the Presidential Office in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Presidential Office has earmarked a budget of
NT$200 million for the project and that the memorial hall will be
inaugurated before the next presidential election set for March 20,
2004.</P>
      <P>The new hall will exhibit documents on major international human
rights events, the 2-28 Incident, the White Terror of the 1950s,
indigenous people's rights, education and cultural development, and
labor rights, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the delegation also visited Taiwan's representative
office in Geneva as well as its mission to the World Trade
Organization. It will wrap up its four-leg European tour Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 2-28 Incident, known as the biggest wound in Taiwan history
since World War II, was triggered when an elderly Taiwanese woman
selling untaxed cigarettes in Taipei was severely beaten by an
inspector of the Wine and Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. Faced by an angry
mob, the inspector shot dead a bystander and fled to a nearly police
station.</P>
      <P>Faced by massive protests and rioting and unable to control the
Situation, Taiwan Governor Chen Yi appealed for help to Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek in mainland China, who sent troops to the northern
port city of Keeling, from where they spread out over the island,
killing along the way.</P>
      <P>In the ensuing period known as "White Terror," thousands of local
people, especially doctors, lawyers and scholars, were murdered or
imprisoned by the Nationalists, and many were not released until the
1980s. Public discussion of the incident was taboo until the early
1990s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, DPP CHAIRMEN CALL ON WU AFTER HUALIEN BY-ELECTION TO BURY HATCHET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien, Taiwan,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong on Tuesday called on Wu Kuo-tung, a former Hualien
magistrate who lost in Saturday's by-election, in Chian Township,
Hualien, in a bid to bury the hatchet after the hotly-contested
election.</P>
      <P>Lien told Wu that "an election is only one period of time, while
personal relationships are forever, " expressing the hope that they
could mend the fences after any hard feelings that may have arisen
from the election.</P>
      <P>Soong said that there might have been "unpleasant feelings and
conflicts during the election, " but that their meeting represents "a
respect for each other."</P>
      <P>For his part, Wu said that he would not blame Lien or Soong for
not supporting him during the election, adding that what he was most
dissatisfied with was President Chen Shui-bian's remarks during the
campaign implying that Wu was guilty and awaiting punishment.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was excluded from the KMT's nomination process because of
his alleged involvement in a land development scandal, pointed out
that he was found not guilty by an appeal court and that the case had
not been closed only because of a procedural row between the court
and the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the KMT's regulations governing the nomination of
candidates bars the party from nominating anyone who still has legal
suits pending. He expressed the hope that Wu would understand the
reform mechanism of the party.</P>
      <P>Wu reaffirmed that he "would not blame Lien and Soong" for
failing to provide support.</P>
      <P>Wu was a veteran KMT member before he was expelled from the party
prior to Saturday's election after insisting on running despite
failing to get the KMT's endorsement.</P>
      <P>He finished third in the election, behind Hsieh Shen-san, the
joint candidate of the KMT and PFP, and You Ying-lung, the candidate
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has solid grass-roots support, garnered 18.26 percent of
the vote, compared with Hsieh's 51.36 percent, and You's 28.92
percent.</P>
      <P>Wu said right after the election that he would not blame Lien and
Soong and would still support them in the presidential election next
year. The remarks were generally believed to have paved the way for
Tuesday's meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ketagalan Institute, an academy run by
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), is scheduled to open a
three-month reading class on Taiwanese literature and history in
September.</P>
      <P>Ketagalan Institute president Chen Shih-meng said the Taiwanese
literature and history reading class will serve as a stepping-stone
on the path to deeper, more comprehensive studies of Taiwan history.</P>
      <P>The class will also be a window on Taiwan's unique history --
which is replete with periods of colonial rule; Taiwan's unique
politics -- featuring inextricably entwined political traditions and
phenomena; and Taiwan's unique cultures -- which are diverse and fast
changing, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Studying Taiwanese literature and history will help the Taiwan
people better understand themselves and identify more with the land
and its cultures, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Ketagalan Institute officials, three heavyweight
books which are representative accounts of Taiwanese history and
people during the period of Japanese colonial rule and the early
years of the period of Nationalist rule will be introduced and
studied during the three-month course. The books are "The Silent
Spring, " which is a collection of novels related to the 2-28
Incident; the Collection of Novels by Lai Ho; and The Orphan in Asia
authored by Wu Chuo-liu.</P>
      <P>The Ketagalan officials said all interested people, regardless of
their ethnicity, age, gender, profession or political affiliation,
are welcome to contact the institute, at www.ketagalan.org.tw, for
information about application and registration, between Aug. 6-20.</P>
      <P>The Ketagalan Institute, the brainchild of President Chen
Shui-bian, who doubles as DPP chairman, became operational in early
April this year.</P>
      <P>The academy is aimed at nurturing a new generation of politically
adept professionals for public service, Chen said in his speech made

    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's annual Wan-An civil defense
drill will for the first time include practice in anti-terrorist
operations, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng told a regular news
conference that the Wan-An No. 26 defense exercise will focus on
upgrading city and county governments' response to terrorist attacks
as well as their disaster relief.</P>
      <P>The Wan-An series of civil defense drills will kick off Aug. 28
with a mock anti-terrorist operation at the Formosa Plastics Group's
petrochemical complex in Yunlin County's Mailiao township on Taiwan's
southwestern coast, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Similar anti-terrorist drills at selected areas in northern
Taiwan, including the Shin Kong Building -- a skyscraper near the
Taiwan Railway terminal in downtown Taipei -- and Chinese Petroleum
Corp.'s (CPC's) Taoyuan Refinery, will be conducted Aug. 29.</P>
      <P>Huang said the Wan-An series of drills will cover two parts --
evacuation of civilian people from landmark buildings, including
shopping malls, department stores and public transport stations, as
well as mock anti-terrorist operations to test local government's
command and control abilities.</P>
      <P>Huang said the military police's special service units and
several army units will join the Wan-An series of drills and assist
city and county governments in establishing standard operation
procedures in emergency relief.</P>
      <P>Anti-terrorist exercises will also be held in central and
southern Taiwan in October at selected locations, including Makung
Airport in the offshore island county of Penghu, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, the Wan-An series of civil defense
exercises will also practice in skills to cope with sabotage,
abduction and explosion.</P>
      <P>Anti-sabotage drills will be held at major public utilities,
including Suao oil depot in Ilan County, Hsiehho Power Plant in
Keelung, CPC's Hushi oil depot and Chienshan Power Plan in Penghu.</P>
      <P>"In these drills, we'll suppose that the facilities have been
sabotaged by enemies who have infiltrated the island," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Anti-abduction drills are planned at Hsinchu railway station and

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Southern Taiwan Science Park in Tainan
has become an important bastion for the island's TFT-LCD (thin film
transistor-liquid crystal display) manufacturers, and the cluster
effect among optoelectronics companies will help transform southern
Taiwan's industrial structure, the park's director said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tai Chien pointed out that while Taiwan's optoelectronics
industry has proved its international competitiveness, the Chi Mei
Electronics Corp., with a monthly output of 600,000 TFT-LCDs from its
Tainan factories, has contributed greatly to the development of the
optoelectronics industry in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Established in July 1997, the Southern Taiwan Science Park has
accommodated manufacturers of semiconductors, optical electronics,
and precision machines, as well as biotechnology firms, although the
lion's share of the investments are in the optoelectronics sector.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 30-year-old Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone has
succeeded in attracting some LCD manufacturers to set up production
lines in the industrial zone.</P>
      <P>A report on the export processing zone administration released
Monday indicated that LCD manufacturers invested NT$1.2 billion in
the zone in 2002, and another NT$654 million poured in from three
local LCD manufacturers and one Hong Kong company in the first half
of this year.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the LCD manufacturing industry is
becoming a main force in the industrial zone. It said that last year,
the LCD companies' business turnover amounted to NT$47.7 billion,
accounting for 55 percent of the industrial zone's overall revenues.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou met
with Singaporean Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Tuesday to
exchange views on the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS).</P>
      <P>Ma said after their talks that Singaporean officials, including
Lee, have all expressed sincerity in sharing their experiences in
dealing with SARS.</P>
      <P>"We have agreed to forge a cooperative mechanism to facilitate
future campaigns against SARS, " said Ma, who arrived in Singapore
Monday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>Both Singapore and Taipei were gripped by SARS outbreaks between
March and June. Ma said Taipei has much to learn from Singapore in
SARS prevention.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was also impressed by Singapore's decision not to hold
anyone responsible for in-hospital SARS outbreaks. "Lee had told me
that discipline or punishment would only discourage frontline health
care providers from joining the campaign against communicable
diseases in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>Several senior executives of Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital
have been disciplined or even indicted for a SARS outbreak inside its
complex in late April, which led to a sudden deterioration of the
SARS situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A delegation of Taipei municipal officials and city councilors,
headed by Deputy Mayor Ou Chin-der, arrived in Singapore a day before
Ma's arrival on the third and last leg of its three-city Asian tour
designed to study how other communities handled the SARS problem. The
delegation visited Hong Kong and Hanoi before coming to the
city-state.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Ma and the delegation members visited Tan Tock Seng
Hospital -- Singapore's second-largest hospital with 1,064 beds -- to
see for themselves its SARS precautionary measures and treatment
facilities.</P>
      <P>Tan Tock Seng Hospital was turned into a SARS-only facility in
mid-March and it once housed more than 400 probable and suspected
SARS patients at one point. The hospital now still maintains
temperature-taking and other SARS-prevention measures to ward off any
possible SARS relapse.</P>
      <P>Ma said he is convinced that if SARS stages a comeback this
winter, the Taipei City Government will be able to make a quicker and
more effective response through the experiences learned in the past
few months.</P>
      <P>When the SARS outbreak reached its peak in Taipei in May, Ma
recalled that Singaporean health officials held a teleconference with
Taipei health administrators and medical experts. Moreover, Singapore
donated 100,000 N95 masks and protective garb for Taipei's frontline
health care providers.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate its assistance at our difficult time, " Ma said,
adding that those exchanges have laid a foundation for future
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The Taipei delegation is composed of government officials and
city councilors, including directors from the Department of Health,
the Fire Department, and the Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission of the city government.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma and the municipal government officials are scheduled to

    <DATELINE>Keelung,  Taiwan,  Aug.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Coast Guard Administration
(CGA) said Tuesday it will build wharves and airstrips on two
Taiwan-held islets to better protect fishermen and provide maritime
disaster relief.</P>
      <P>CGA Director-General Wang Chun said the Cabinet has approved the
CGA's plan to build a wharf on Tungsha (Pratas) Islands in the South
China Sea as part of its efforts to strengthen protection of local
fishermen operating in the region.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an inaugural ceremony aboard the 1,951-ton CGA patrol
vessel "Hohsing" for an oceanography student camp, Wang said the
Cabinet has budgeted NT$40 million for the construction project to be
launched in 2004.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang said, the CGA is also planning to build a pier and
an airstrip on Pengchiayu, a small isle off the northern Taiwan port
of Keelung.</P>
      <P>"Once the project is completed, CGA patrol ships and airborne
police helicopters will be able to land on Pengchiayu while carrying
out relief operations in waters farther away from Taiwan," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism that the government has not fulfilled its
duty of protecting fishermen, Wang said the CGA has stepped up
patrols in waters north and south of Taiwan to offer timely
assistance to Taiwan fishermen operating in those regions.</P>
      <P>Since Feb. 15 this year, Wang said, the CGA has conducted two-day
patrols per week in waters off Taiwan's northern coast. Patrols in
waters off the southern Taiwan coast, particularly areas adjacent to
the Philippine economic zone, have also been intensified since April.
Starting last week, the number of patrols in the regions has been
increased to two per week, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPELLED TSU MAVERICK LAWMAKER NOT CONSIDERING JOINING OTHER PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after being expelled from the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), Legislator Su Ying-kuei said Tuesday that he
is not currently thinking of joining any other party.</P>
      <P>Su, an outspoken, maverick legislator, said, "I thank those from
other parties and even independent legislators, but I will not be
considering the matter for the time being."</P>
      <P>Su denied that he threw a tantrum during party consultations
while reviewing a draft bill regarding real estate sales divisions,
saying that he only threw some paper cups and plates. He said that
"when you look at the fist fights of other legislators, it is
preposterous to accuse me of being violent."</P>
      <P>Su described the decision to expel him as "chaotic, " citing a TV
poll Monday evening that indicated that the public overwhelmingly
support him.</P>
      <P>Su said that he wished the TSU the best, expressing the hope that
the party will be "maturer, " adding that any party which wishes to
have long-term development must have rightiousness.</P>
      <P>Su, a lawyer-turned-legislator, has won recognition for his
conscientious efforts in the legislature and was voted one of the top
10 best-performing legislators by Taipei Society, an organization
comprised of scholars. But he was said to have offended more of his
fellow legislators in the pan green camp -- the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the TSU -- than the pan blue camp,
meaning the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP), because he
had targeted individuals close to the party, including Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh and Legislator Cheng Chao-ming, both of the DPP.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which is an ally of the TSU, has kept a low profile
regarding Su.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, DPP party whip, said that he had not discussed
inviting Su to join the DPP, saying that this "will have to wait for
all the flap to die down."</P>
      <P>But Chen said that he believed that Su would still stand by the
pan green camp on political and other issues.</P>
      <P>KMT party whip Lee Chia-chin said Tuesday that if Su can identify
with the ideals of the KMT, the party welcomes him.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Su's performance at the legislature is recognized
by all, and if he, after discussing with his friends and family,
decides to identify with the ideals of the KMT, the party will
welcome him with "open arms."</P>
      <P>PFP party whip Chung Shao-he said that he had "deep talks" with
Su a few days ago, and the expulsion by the TSU is just "stepping on
a talented person, " adding that there is the possibility of
cooperation between the PFP and Su.</P>
      <P>TSU party whip Chien Lin Whei-jun said that the party "respects
Su's freedom to decide his future direction, and will not interfere
with him."</P>
      <P>On speculation that the TSU acted rashly to expel Su, Chien said
that Su had never toed the party line, and his allegations against
fellow legislator Lo Chih-ming had not been substantiated by hard
evidence, and was "the last straw."</P>
      <P>On whether the TSU will accept Su back, Chien said that it all
depends on Su, saying that he had always looked down on his fellow
legislators, believing them to be not conscientious enough.</P>
      <P>The dispute between Su and Lo originated from Su's public
accusation last week against Lo, claiming that Lo tried to obstruct
the judicial investigation of a scandal involving senior police
officers who allegedly turned a blind eye to illegal video game
parlors in Kaohsiung city, southern Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Department of Health Minister Lee
Ming-liang Monday thanked overseas Chinese living in the United
States for their assistance and donations to Taiwan in the fight
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Lee, who was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian to serve as
the chief coordinator of a national task force to tackle the
potentially deadly disease, hailed the compassion of overseas Chinese
during a luncheon with Chinese community representatives from the
greater Washington, D. C. area and Baltimore at the Taipei Economic
and Cultural Representative Office in Washington.</P>
      <P>Representative Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's de-facto ambassador to
the United States, sponsored the gathering.</P>
      <P>Lee also awarded citations to various domestic Chinese community
groups in recognition of their assistance and contributions.</P>
      <P>Lee also said he appreciated the help and care from the United
States authorities after SARS broke out in Taiwan, noting that the
purpose of his current tour is to learn something from the U. S. side
for setting up a safety mechanism in Taiwan in the wake of SARS. He
has met officials from the U.S. Department of Health and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention since his arrival over the
weekend.</P>
      <P>The Chinese community leaders lauded Lee's achievements in
containing SARS in Taiwan and described him as a "SARS killer" and a
"Taiwan savior" for his leadership and work in leading Taiwan through
the difficult times.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee is slated to meet reporters Wednesday at the
United Nations Correspondents Association to talk about Taiwan's
SARS-fighting experience, in his capacity as a public health expert

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Men accepting the role of homemaker is no
longer taboo in Taiwan thanks to the growing awareness of gender
equality, according to the results of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 9999 Pan-Asia Manpower Bank conducted the poll in connection
with Father's Day which falls on Aug. 8 in Taiwan. The manpower bank
distributed questionnaires to local fathers through parents'
associations around the island. A total of 1,768 valid replies were
collected.</P>
      <P>The survey found that 14.25 percent of the respondents said they
manage their households and care for their children while their wives
work.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 33.71 percent said they work while their wives manage
their households; and 41.63 percent said both they and their wives
work and baby sitters or relatives look after their children.</P>
      <P>Asked whether child rearing has affected their work, 72.96
percent said "yes," with 27.04 percent saying "no."</P>
      <P>Just over 65 percent said they have never felt remorse for having
children; 21.72 percent said they felt a bit of regret; and 12.44
percent said they feel remorseful and that if they could make a
choice again, they would not have children.</P>
      <P>As to how children affect their work, 59.07 percent said their
moods at work are affected by their children's situations; 46.82
percent said that they couldn't get to work on time because of taking
children to see doctors or delivering articles to their children at
school; 34.57 percent said children have forced them to cut back on
their work time; 26.51 percent said children have forced them to
reduce their socializing time; and 7.91 percent said children have
affected their career promotions.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 54.41 percent of fathers complained that
day care or baby-sitting charges are too expensive; 42.08 percent
said after-school care fees are too high; 41.63 percent said
skyrocketing tuition fees are a headache; and 31.45 percent said
communication with their children is a problem for them.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the traditional concept that children
must finance their aging parents' living expenses is fading, as 57.8
percent said they don't want their children to support them after
they get old. Only 11.54 percent uphold that concept, while 30.88
percent said if their children want to support them, they will take
pleasure in accepting their aid but will not force them to do so.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Executive Yuan chose not
to attend a meeting of an ad hoc committee of the Legislative Yuan
regarding the budget allocated to prevent severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) since attending such a meeting is not required by the
ROC Constitution, Executive Yuan spokesman Lin Chia-lung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>He said the Constitution, which is the supreme guideline for the
relationship between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan,
obligates officials to attend only meetings of the standing or
special committees of the Legislative Yuan during legislative
sessions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Committee for the Prevention of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is neither a standing nor a special
committee under the Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan, and the
legislature is now in recess, Lin said there is no legal requirement
for officials to answer questions from lawmakers from the SARS
committee.</P>
      <P>The SARS committee, formed by lawmakers to overlook the
government's NT$50 billion budget for the prevention of SARS, met for
the fifth time Tuesday; however, government officials summoned by the
committee failed to show up.</P>
      <P>Angered by what they called contempt for the legislature, members
of the committee blamed the Executive Yuan for evading the
supervision of the legislature and preempting the committee's work.</P>
      <P>Instead of resorting to bad-mouthing, Lin urged the legislators
to engage the Executive Yuan in compliance with the law, saying that
"neither loud voices, nor dramatic action will give you the upper
hand in this case."</P>
      <P>He made the comments after a group of opposition lawmakers from
the SARS committee went to the Executive Yuan to unfurl a banner,
protesting the absence of officials for the third time in a row from
their meetings.</P>
      <P>They went to the Executive Yuan to protest, and were met only by
a staff member of the premier. They then went to the Control Yuan to

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DROPS IN FIRST SEVEN MONTHS OF THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in the
first seven months of this year dropped by 0.28 percent over the same
period last year, officials of the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS statistics, the CPI in July stood at 98.8, a
drop of 0.98 percent over the same month last year, which the DGBAS
attributed to a discount campaign presented by the garment industry.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index in July rose by 0.11 percent
over June, which DGBAS officials said was due to the price hike of
several products, including petroleum, natural gas, steel products
and DRAMs.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed the drop in the CPI in the first seven
months to the country's entry into the World Trade Organization,
which pushed tariff reductions onto many imported products, the
fierce price competition among domestic products, as well as the
economic recession, which was aggravated by the outbreaks of severe
acute respiratory syndrome on the island.</P>
      <P>People doubt whether Taiwan will experience deflation as has been
seen in Japan. Chen Chang-hsiung, a section chief of the DGBAS,
admitted that Taiwan may have a drop in CPI this year, but added that
the rate of fall may slow in the second half of this year as
economists predict better economic prospects during that time.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS statistics, in the first six months, the CPI
in the United States rose by 2.5 percent; South Korea was up by 3.7
percent; Malaysia was up by 1.1 percent; while the CPI in Japan
dropped by 0.2 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of grassroots township and village
leaders asked the central government Tuesday at an annual gathering
to lay a legal basis before holding a national referendum.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the leaders would not hold a government
referendum without a legal framework in place, central Fengyuan Mayor
Chang I-cheng, who is also the chief executive officer of the
National Association of Townships and Village Leaders, said the
motion he introduced was unanimously approved by his counterparts
with a round of applause.</P>
      <P>Members of the association held an annual conference at the
Legislative Yuan, in which opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong were invited to take
part.</P>
      <P>Arguing that the central government should focus their efforts
and attention on issues of major public interest and concern, Chang
said a vast majority of grassroots township and village leaders are
opposed to the government's plan to hold a "consultative referendum"
on issues about the fate of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant and
Taiwan's need to join the World Health Organization as an observer.</P>
      <P>Chang said the association approved a six-point resolution
demanding the central government take concrete measures to improve
Taiwan's rising unemployment and worsening law and order.</P>
      <P>Although the central government claims that holding a referendum
is a normal practice in a democracy in which human rights must be
fully respected, Chang said allowing a public vote without adequate
complementary measures in Taiwan may create chaos because of the
country's delicate political situation.</P>
      <P>Holding a referendum now in Taiwan will only deviate the
government's efforts to improve the economy, further deteriorating
law and order in society, Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>Amid the public's strong expectations that the government should
effectively revive Taiwan's economy, the grassroots authorities could
not abide by the central government's referendum plan if it wishes to
force it into practice with just an administrative decree, while
overlooking the need and justice to forge a legal framework, he
warned.

    <HEADLINE>TWO ALLEGED SPIES BEING HELD INCOMMUNICADO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A middle-rank technician with the
military-run Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) and
the chief executive officer of a private firm were held incommunicado
Wednesday on charges of spying for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-liang, a technician at the CIST's Electronics Research
Institute, and Yeh Yu-chen, a technology firm CEO, were arrested
Tuesday on suspicion of espionage. After questioning the two
overnight, prosecutors applied to have them detained for further
investigations. The Taiwan High Court approved the application early
this morning.</P>
      <P>A third member of the alleged spy ring, Hsu Hsi-tse, a U.S.
citizen of Chinese origin, was also arrested Tuesday when he landed
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The Public Prosecutors'
Office at the Taiwan High Court was still questioning him as of the
press time. He is expected to be held incommunicado like his two
alleged accomplices later in the day.</P>
      <P>The trio were accused of joining up to steal Taiwan's defense
secrets and purchasing strategic high-tech products in the United
States and then sending them to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) claimed that
Yeh, 54, had collected classified information about the CIST's
defense technology research programs through Chen, including the
theater missile defense system, anti-submarine equipment and the
timetable for procurement of P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. Yeh then
allegedly brought the secret data to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, investigators said, Yeh had collected information about
Taiwan's military cooperative projects with the United States through
Hsu, a retired Boeing Co. engineer. Hsu, 57, allegedly had hacked
into the U.S. government's classified files through the Internet to
steal information about F-16 fighters' night-time weaponry system and
strategic data links.</P>
      <P>Worse still, MJIB agents claimed that Yeh had counterfeited the
CIST's "end-user certificates" for Hsu to purchase sophisticated
strategic night-vision equipment for mainland China. Those devices
were sent to Taiwan first and then brought to the mainland by Yeh
himself.</P>
      <P>Investigators said Yeh and Chen, 52, had been under close
surveillance since 2001. They decided to round up the three after
learning that Hsu would arrive at CKS Airport Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>MJIB sources said Chen is a high-school graduate who joined the
CIST in 1979. He handled the application and compilation of general
materials.</P>
      <P>The CIST issued a statement Tuesday evening saying that the
institute has started an evaluation of the possible damage to
national security inflicted by the espionage case. "We have also
adopted countermeasures to contain the possible damage, " it added in
the statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WANTS KAOHSIUNG HARBOR'S INCLUSION IN CSI: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 5 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington is eager about the progress
of its Container Security Initiative (CSI) -- a plan highly conducive
to U.S. national security -- and has already invited Kaohsiung Harbor
to take part, Taiwan's top envoy in the United States said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung is expected to be linked
up to the CSI, a global anti-terrorism seaport network initiated
earlier this year, after mainland China's Shanghai and Shenzhen, said
Chen Chien-jen, representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the United States.</P>
      <P>The CSI was announced by the U.S. Customs Service Feb. 22, 2002,
as a means of strengthening port and maritime security without
interrupting the flow of trade. The plan, initiated after the 9-11
terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., is aimed
mainly at protecting the United States from possible dangers arriving
on the more than 8,000 ships that enter the country from all over the
world each year.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with the press at the Twin Oaks Garden, Chen
said U.S. and Taiwan authorities have agreed on a schedule, within
this month, for bilateral talks on matters pertaining to Kaohsiung's
CSI inclusion. He did not elaborate on the location for such talks.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that as far as he knows, the Taiwan side would have
hoped that the talks could have been held "a little bit later."</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is among the top 20 ports around the world that
have been mapped to be included in the first-phase implementation of
the port safety plan.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau, the U.S.
Customs Service has hoped that Taiwan will sign the CSI agreement as
soon as possible. Failure to do so could jeopardize Taiwan
containers' rights to be processed speedily at U.S. ports, U.S.
Customs Service sources have warned.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor is the world's fifth-largest container port,
handling 8.4 million containers last year. Of that total, 500,000 to
600,000 standard containers headed to the United States, including
some transshipped to other countries, according to Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau officials.</P>
      <P>Of the world's top 20 seaports listed by the U.S. Customs Service
in terms of volume of container traffic destined for the United
States, Kaohsiung Harbor ranks fourth, behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and
Singapore.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decision that Vice President Annette
Lu will not make a stopover in New York on her way to or from Latin
America during her upcoming trip was a consensus reached by
authorities from Taiwan and the United States, Taiwan's top envoy in
the United States said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, representative of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Representative Office in the United States, said the matter
is clear and understandable to authorities from both sides,
discounting allegations that Washington, angered by Taipei's
unilateral disclosure of Lu's planned stopover in New York, had
refused to let her make a transit stop in that city.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied rumors that the decision was made as a result of
Taiwan's plans to hold a referendum next year.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a chat with the media at the Twin Oaks
Garden Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen also confirmed that Lu, who will lead a Taiwan delegation to
Asuncion, Paraguay, as President Chen Shui-bian's envoy to the
inauguration of president-elect Nicanor Duarte on Aug. 15, will make
a short refueling stop in Houston, Texas, on her way back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu and her 43-member entourage are scheduled to leave Taipei on
Aug. 7, and then visit Hawaii, Los Angeles and Panama on her way to
Asuncion.</P>
      <P>During her two-day transit stop in Hawaii, Lu is scheduled to
meet with Hawaiian Governor Linda Lingle and high ranking corporate
officials from Microsoft, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>While in Panama, which maintains formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan, Lu's Panamanian counterpart Dominador Kaiser Bazan Jimenez
will honor Lu by awarding her a medal.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Paraguay, the vice president will give a
speech at the parliament and at Asuncion University.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the vice president will visit Seattle and stay

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Two suspected drug traffickers, identified as Chen Fu-lai and Ho

      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) said it

      <P>Great Britain's top liaison officer
in Taiwan, Derek Marsh, paid a courtesy call on Taipei County chief
Su Chen-chang Wednesday to exchange views on a wide range of topics.</P>
      <P>Marsh and Su exchanged opinions on matters pertaining to the
prospects for the development of Taipei Harbor, as well as a mass
rapid transit system linking the greater Taipei area with Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County, and the Taipei MRT
expansion project.</P>
      <P>Su also helped Marsh gain an insight into the latest political
and economic developments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the defeat of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) candidate in the recent Hualien magistrate by-election, Marsh
asked Su whether the DPP is also having difficulty maintaining
grass-roots support in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Su, a member of the DPP Central Standing Executive Committee,
answered that the Hualien magistrate by-election was only a single
election in a rural area and that it was by no means a litmus test of
the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Taipei magistrate, however, told the British envoy that the
DPP will take the Hualien election as a lesson and modify its
strategies in order to win the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>During the talks, Marsh also asked Su about the prospects for
British companies to win any contracts for Taiwan's major
infrastructure development projects, such as Taipei Harbor, the
airport MRT system and the planned circular Taipei MRT lines.</P>
      <P>It was learned that the Trade Partners U.K. (TPUK) , the United

the U.K. Railway Scoping Mission to visit Taiwan Aug. 4-7 to explore
the railway project opportunities in Taiwan and to find out what else

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan on Wednesday called for unity among members and supporters of
the KMT and its ally the People First Party to win the next
presidential election to be held in March 2004.</P>
      <P>Lien urged KMT members not to be complacent about the KMT's
victory in the recent Hualien magistrate by-election, in which KMT
stalwart Hsieh Shen-shan beat his rival from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), You Ying-lung.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 2004 presidential election will be a much harder
battle, Lien said "all the pan-blue alliance members should be even
more firmly united."</P>
      <P>Lien made the call at the first KMT Central Standing Committee
meeting held after the Hualien magistrate by-election last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the meeting was KMT Vice Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung,
who said that there is no room for complacency for the KMT over the
victory in the Hualien election, which he said has stark differences
in election structure from that of a presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wu, nevertheless, noted that the Hualien magistrate by-election
indeed serves as an inspiration for all members of the opposition
alliance and as an affirmation of the fact that the voters have cool
and clear judgment.</P>
      <P>Wu called for the ruling DPP not to use its administrative
resources as electioneering tools for any party or individual any
longer.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu also pointed out that any party which is conducive
to Taiwan's social and political stability, better cross-Taiwan
Strait relations, and fast-rekindling domestic economy will be able
to win the 2004 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN BRIDES REQUIRED TO RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTARY EDUCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei. Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following Premier Yu Shyi-kun's instruction,
the Ministry of Education (MOE) sponsored a meeting Wednesday on the
topic of compulsory supplementary education for foreign brides.</P>
      <P>The premier asked the MOE to implement the policy of compulsory
education for foreign brides after taking in suggestions from a
women's rights promotion committee of the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Attending the meeting sponsored by the MOE's Social Education
Department were scholars on adult education and representatives of
various cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Education officials said that the budget for the proposal will
not be a problem as it will be financed by the subsidy for adult
learning. But they pointed out a thorny issue will be deciding
whether mainland Chinese brides who have high school education or
above will be required to receive the compulsory education.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that there are around 250,000 foreign
brides in Taiwan, among whom more than 160,000 come from mainland
China. Even if mainland brides have college education, their diplomas
are not recognized in Taiwan, the officials said.</P>
      <P>If they are forced to receive supplementary education, it will be
meaningless and a waste of money, he added.</P>
      <P>The officials said they are therefore in favor of letting some
foreign brides take tests that if they pass will mean they will not
be required to receive the compulsory education before obtaining
their IDs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has drafted countermeasures in
case local governments boycott a planned referendum because of
political interference, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung made the remarks after an
association of local government administrators announced a day
earlier that it will not hold consultative referendums demanded by
the central government unless the Legislative Yuan passes a
referendum bill.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Cabinet has been pushing for the
opposition-controlled legislature to complete referendum legislation
as soon as possible to facilitate the ability of local people to
exercise their legitimate rights.</P>
      <P>But if the legislature continues to stonewall the passage of a
referendum bill, Lin said, the Cabinet is determined to take active
steps to allow citizens to exercise their referendum rights, which is
prescribed in the nation's Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lin said the Cabinet has formed a referendum promotion committee
to prepare for holding a referendum on certain public issues before
or on the next presidential election day on March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Lin said the committee has drafted a comprehensive package of
regulations governing the holding of referendums in case the
legislature fails to pass a referendum bill during its next session
which will open in September.</P>
      <P>The draft proposals authorize the central government to
commission relevant public agencies or private organizations to
handle consultative referendums, Lin said, adding that the Cabinet
will adopt countermeasures to ensure that referendums are carried out
smoothly in case city, county or township governments deliberately
boycott the event for political reasons.</P>
      <P>Stressing that participating in a referendum is a legitimate
right of all ordinary citizens, Lin said any boycott or interference
with holding it would not be supported by the public.</P>
      <P>Since the Constitution clearly states that all ROC citizens have
a right to participate in a referendum, Lin said holding a referendum
based on an administrative decree is not unconstitutional nor is it
illegal.</P>
      <P>"We should not continue denying our people the right to taking
part in a referendum simply because the legislature drags its feet on
relevant legislative work," Lin added.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian announced in June that his
administration would definitely hold a referendum before or on the
next presidential election day to clear up whether construction on a
half-built nuclear power plant should be scrapped or continued.</P>
      <P>During its annual meeting Tuesday, the National Association of
Townships Government Chiefs announced that its members will not
coordinate with the central government in holding such a referendum
if the legislature doesn't pass a bill to flesh out all technical
details. Most of the island's 319 cities and townships under county
governments are controlled by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Both KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James
Soong were present at Tuesday's township government chiefs meeting.
Lien and Soong have decided to team up to challenge President Chen's
re-election bid next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN TO RELAX RULES ON SHORT SALES OF STOCKS: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance at the moment has no
plan to relax the regulations on short sales of stocks when stocks
are priced below the closing prices of the previous transaction day,
Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin said that since President Chen Shui-bian announced last month
to further open Taiwan's stock market to qualified foreign
institutional investors (QFII) , many market observers have been
expecting more market relaxation measures, including those related to
short sales, price fluctuation ranges and trading times.</P>
      <P>Referring to a report that the government is considering allowing
Taiwanese companies in mainland China to become listed companies on
Taiwan's stock exchange, Lin said that before a supervisory mechanism
on the capital outflow is established, the government will not lift
the ceiling of capital flow to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Since the free flow of capital is a prerequisite for Taiwan
businessmen expecting to raise funds from Taiwan's stock market for
their investments on the mainland, Lin said that he doubted that many
Taiwanese companies across the Taiwan Strait would be interested in
issuing their stocks here.</P>
      <P>While cross-strait capital flow remains a rigid area, the
minister said that in recent years, the government has adopted
measures to liberalize the domestic capital market to meet the
requirements of the international market.</P>
      <P>Since the Central Bank of China in Taiwan has agreed to advance
the implementation of the QFII system, which was originally planned
to be realized two years from now, the finance ministry is working on
the timetable of further relaxing stock transactions, Lin added.</P>
      <P>While the management of the Resolution Trust Company (RTC) fund
remains an important task of the ministry, Lin said that the ministry
is determined to tackle the problems of the monetary system, despite
that only NT$40 billion of the NT$140 billion fund is left after
delivering a series of rescue packages to ailing monetary
institutions.</P>
      <P>The minister said that in order to swiftly and effectively help
problem financial institutions and to avoid a crisis of confidence,
the fund should provide guarantee to all depositors as well as other
creditors of the problematic financial institutions handled by the
fund.</P>
      <P>As the government's financial business tax revenue and deposit
insurance premium income received from the financial sector remain
the only resources of the RTC fund, Lin said that with insufficient
funds, the ministry found it difficult to implement its tasks.</P>
      <P>Since the RTC fund was established in June 2001, the government
has been levying a 2 percent tax on business revenues of monetary
institutions. While the originally planned time span for monetary
institutions to pay business taxes is four years, from 2002-2005, the
minister suggested that the time be extended to an unspecified period
in order to boost the amount of the RTC fund to the ministry's target
of NT$1.05 trillion.</P>
      <P>Regarding the structural problems of budget deficits, Lin said
that the finance ministry is planning to draft an amendment of the
Public Debt Law. While the existing law limits the government's debt
to 15 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) , the
minister suggested that the ceiling be lifted.</P>
      <P>The minister said that the nation's budget deficit continued to
accumulate since 1991. While the government's policy to expand public
spendings as a stimulus to the economy has been somewhat effective,
accumulated public debt has put an extra burden on the nation's
finances, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the government has no immediate plan to push a
reform of the taxation system, though the ministry is expecting that
the legislature will discuss the amendments of certain tax
regulations in the autumn session.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO TALK WITH JAPAN ON MANAGEMENT OF TIAOYUTAI FISHERY RESOURCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is hoping to talk with Japan
in the next one or two months on the management of the fishery
resources of the controversial Tiaoyutai Islands, the Fisheries
Administration under the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials said that after a dozen consultations over the
past seven years, Taiwan and Japan reached a tentative understanding
on the Tiaoyutai Islands this June. Both sides agreed that they would
shelve political disputes on sovereignty issues to protect the
interests of the traditional fishing grounds of both countries, and
would only discuss the management of fishery resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now actively contacting the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan, hoping that a new round of talks
can be held in Taipei in August or September, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the Tiaoyutais are the traditional
fishing grounds of Taiwan fishermen who catch around 50,000 to 60,000
tons of fish every year, accounting for one-fourth of the fish haul
caught near the shore.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have disputed the sovereignty of the Tiaoyutais
for years. Taiwan began using naval and coast guard vessels to escort
its fishing ships since major disputes erupted again in 1996.</P>
      <P>To resolve the dispute, the two countries began consultations
through the Interchange Association of Japan, with the ROC's Ministry
of the Interior, the COA and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications all taking part in the consultations with the Japanese
government department in charge of marine resources.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials said that the mutual understanding is that they
would shelve the disputes on sovereignty and would only discuss
issues of fishery resources on which regions should be managed by
Taiwan or Japan. On those regions that are overlapping, if they are
managed by Taiwan, Japanese fishing vessels will have to get prior
approval from Taiwan when entering for operations and vice versa.</P>
      <P>How to demarcate the regions will be high on the agenda on the
new round of talks, with Japan hoping for the establishment of a
medium line, while Taiwan hopes that it will be a balanced point
according to international law and practices, meaning taking into
consideration the fishery population of both countries and historical
factors.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais lie in the East China Sea about 200 kilometers
east of Taiwan and 300 kilometers west of the Japanese island of
Okinawa. The islands, called the Senkakus in Japanese, have been
claimed by Japan since 1895, while Chinese claims are centuries old.</P>
      <P>When the United States returned Okinawa -- along with the
Tiaoyutais -- to Japan in the early 1970s, it sparked a "Baotiao
[protect the Tiaoyutais] movement" in both Taiwan and mainland
China and over the years, sovereignty disputes over the island group
have flared up from time to time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE ALLEGED SPIES BEING HELD INCOMMUNICADO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three men, including a middle-rank
technician with the military-run Chungshan Institute of Science, were
held incommunicado Wednesday on charges of spying for mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-liang, a technician at the CIST's Electronics Research
Institute, and Yeh Yu-chen, a technology firm CEO, were arrested
Tuesday on suspicion of espionage. After questioning the two
overnight, prosecutors applied to have them detained for further
investigations. The Taiwan High Court approved the application early
this morning.</P>
      <P>A third member of the alleged spy ring, Hsu Hsi-tse, a U.S.
citizen of Chinese origin, was also arrested Tuesday when he landed
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The Public Prosecutors'
Office at the Taiwan High Court approved his detention in the
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The trio were accused of joining up to steal Taiwan's defense
secrets and purchasing strategic high-tech products in the United
States and then sending them to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) claimed that
Yeh, 54, had collected classified information about the CIST's
defense technology research programs through Chen, including the
theater missile defense system, anti-submarine equipment and the
timetable for procurement of P-3C anti-submarine aircraft. Yeh then
allegedly brought the secret data to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, investigators said, Yeh had collected information about
Taiwan's military cooperative projects with the United States through
Hsu, a retired Boeing Co. engineer. Hsu, 57, allegedly had hacked
into the U.S. government's classified files through the Internet to
steal information about F-16 fighters' night-time weaponry system and
strategic data links. U.S.-made F-16s along with French-made
Mirages and locally built IDFs form the backbone of Taiwan's air
force fleet.</P>
      <P>Worse still, MJIB agents claimed that Yeh had counterfeited the
CIST's "end-user certificates" for Hsu to purchase sophisticated
strategic night-vision equipment for mainland China. Those devices
were sent to Taiwan first and then brought to the mainland by Yeh
himself.</P>
      <P>Investigators said Yeh and Chen, 52, had been under close
surveillance since 2001. They decided to round up the three after
learning that Hsu would arrive at CKS Airport Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>MJIB sources said Chen is a high-school graduate who joined the
CIST in 1979. He handled the application and compilation of general
materials.</P>
      <P>The CIST issued a statement Tuesday evening saying that the
institute has started an evaluation of the possible damage to
national security inflicted by the espionage case. "We have also
adopted countermeasures to contain the possible damage, " it added in
the statement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER 'COMFORT WOMEN' TRAVEL TO JAPAN TO  PROTEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwanese women who were forced to
serve as sex slaves, euphemistically known as "comfort women," by the
Japanese Imperial Army during World War II, headed for Tokyo
Wednesday to protest Japan's lack of sincerity in taking
responsibility for the cruelty the women suffered.</P>
      <P>Wang Ching-fong, a lawyer and former chairwoman of the
Taipei-based Women's Rescue Foundation, who is accompanying the three
former Taiwanese comfort women during the trip, said that they will
protest together with seven former Korean comfort women Aug. 7 at the
House of Councillors of the National Diet and Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's residence and attempt to present petitions.</P>
      <P>The former comfort women, who are on average 82 years old,
decided to fly to Japan to protest because the Japanese government
has yet to take responsibility for the cruelty they suffered during
World War II, Wang said prior to boarding a plane for Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The former comfort women urged the Japanese government to
publicly apologize and compensate them, Wang added.</P>
      <P>At least 200,000 Asian women, including 1,200 Taiwanese, were
forced to serve as sex slaves by the Japanese Imperial Army during
World War II, according to the Women's Rescue Foundation, which is
helping the Taiwanese comfort women in their fight for an apology and
compensation.</P>
      <P>However, only 43 Taiwanese comfort women were accounted for in
1992, when the foundation started helping them, and only 30 of them
were still alive in 1997.</P>
      <P>Japan's government, which has never admitted its responsibility
for the country's crimes during World War II, set up a private fund
-- the Asian Peace and Friendship Foundation for Women -- in 1995 to
offer compensation of two million yen per person to the surviving
comfort women, but this attempt to heal the wounds of the women was
rejected by the Taiwanese comfort women, who also want an apology
from the Japanese government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Exchanges of working visits between
officials of Taiwan and the United States have become as frequent as
in the past in the wake of outbreaks of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) , Republic of China Representative to the United
States Chen Chien-jen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
during a meeting with the press at the Twin Oaks Estate -- the site
of the ROC's former embassy in the United States and currently a
cultural center after the two nations cut formal diplomatic ties in
1979.</P>
      <P>According to the de facto ambassador from Taiwan to the United
States, exchanges of working visits between officials of the two
countries have remained normal, especially now that the potentially
deadly disease is no longer the threat it was.</P>
      <P>Chen also confirmed a report that Minister of Economic Affairs
Lin Yi-fu and Minister of Finance Lin Chuan will soon visit the
United States to attempt to attract investment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a media report that the U. S. side has banned
ranking trade and economics officials from meeting their Taiwan
counterparts in response to Taiwan's failure to adequately protect
the intellectual property rights (IPR) of U.S. products, Chen said,
"It takes two to tango, " adding that trade and economic issues are
not settled only by officials from the same sector.</P>
      <P>Regarding U. S. concerns about Taiwan's performance in protecting
IPR, Chen said Taiwan has actually made noticeable progress in this
field but pointed out that Taiwan needs to strengthen two-way
communication to allow the United States to have a better
understanding of Taiwan's efforts.</P>
      <P>The United States could be more aware of Taiwan's improvements if
Taipei could settle the IPR issue with Washington as quickly as
possible, he suggested.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND LOSES APPEAL FOR RETURN OF PENSION PAID TO DEFECTOR'S FAMILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense has lost an
appeal for the return of pension funds paid to the family of an ROC
Army officer who defected to mainland China 24 years ago, judicial
sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry filed a lawsuit with the Taipei High
Administrative Court June 2002 against the family of Lin Yifu, who
went "missing" May 16, 1979 when he was serving as an ROC Army
company leader on the frontline island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry said in its appeal that it had paid
NT$475,000 in pension to Lin's family in several installments after
Lin "disappeared" for unknown reasons.</P>
      <P>In May 2002, however, it came to light that Lin had actually fled
to mainland China from Kinmen 24 years ago. Lin, whose original name
was Lin Cheng-yi, filed an application from Beijing in May 2002 to
return to Taiwan to attend his father's funeral. Lin admitted in many
television interviews that he swan across the channel separating
Kinmen and Xiamen in mainland China's Fujian province on May 16, 1979
to seek a new life and new career.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry said Lin's action constituted the offenses
of surrendering to the enemy, treason and desertion from the front
line, all of which carry the maximum penalty of death. It asked the
administrative court to compel Lin's family in the northeastern
county of Ilan to repay the money that the military had paid the
family for Lin's "disappearance" plus interest.</P>
      <P>During the court hearing, Lin's family claimed that the defense
ministry was well aware of the fact that Lin had defected from the
outset. Furthermore, the family said that the defense ministry had
listed Lin as "missing in action" mainly because it was afraid that
the case might affected the morale of Taiwan's troops and the
confidence of ordinary citizens. At that time, Taiwan was still under
martial law.</P>
      <P>Lin's family claimed that the defense ministry had forced Lin's
wife, Chen Yun-ying, to coordinate with it to conceal the truth of
Lin's defection to the mainland. Moreover, Lin's family said the
defense ministry had given it the minimum amount of pension possible
to express its dissatisfaction with Lin's defection.</P>
      <P>After a comprehensive study, the administrative court turned down
the defense ministry's appeal and upheld the payment of the pension
in full. The court said in its verdict that the administrative
litigation system is aimed at providing remedies for individual
persons who deem that their rights or legal interests are violated by
an unlawful administrative action.</P>
      <P>Noting that the administrative court is not supposed to mete out
a decision or take action on behalf of an administrative agency, the
verdict said that since the defense ministry itself gave up its right
to file charges against Lin 24 years ago, the court need not protect
its right to reclaim the pension already paid to Lin's family.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's "two-level and two-instance system" administrative
litigation system, the defense ministry can appeal the case to the
Supreme Administrative Court.</P>
      <P>Lin started a new career as an economist in mainland China after
he fled Kinmen in 1979, eventually becoming the director of Peking
University's China Economic Research Center.</P>
      <P>Taipei authorities approved his application to return to attend
his father's funeral last year but warned that he could face the
legal consequences of his defection. As a result, Lin sent his wife
to Taiwan to attend the funeral on his behalf. Lin's wife established
contact with her husband several years after her husband's flight and
went to the mainland to be reunited with him in the late 1980s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAUSE OF TAA CARGO PLANE CRASH YET TO BE DETERMINED: ASC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's Aviation Safety Council (ASC)
said Wednesday it has yet to determine the cause of the crash of a
Macau-bound TransAsia Airways (TAA) cargo plane last December which
killed two pilots.</P>
      <P>The ASC was responding to media reports that the Civil
Aeronautics Administration's (CAA's) failure to issue a bad weather
warning was to blame for the plane crash Dec. 21, 2002.</P>
      <P>Chou Kuang-tsan, an ASC official in charge of flight mishap
investigations, said the council is still collecting data regarding
the crash and is not expected to come up with a detailed report until
October.</P>
      <P>Noting that a plane crash usually involves a combination of
complex causes, Chou said the time is not yet ripe to reach a
conclusion on the reasons behind the crash of the ATR-72 cargo plane.</P>
      <P>Local media reports quoted a retired CAA official as saying that
both Hong Kong and Japanese aviation authorities had issued SIGMET
warnings to aircraft in the Taiwan Strait both before and after last
December's air tragedy.</P>
      <P>The SIGMET (significant meteorology) reports are designed to
provide information concerning en-route weather phenomena which may
affect an aircraft's safety.</P>
      <P>But the CAA failed to issue similar alerts before the ATR-72
TransAsia Airways cargo aircraft plowed into the Taiwan Strait in bad
weather Dec. 21, the unidentified CAA official claimed.</P>
      <P>The ATR-72 aircraft, powered by twin propellers, left Chiang
Kai-shek Airport in northern Taiwan headed for Macau at 1: 05 a.m.
but disappeared from radar screens at 1:56 a.m.</P>
      <P>Neither the CAA nor TransAsia would make any comment on the
reports. Chou also refrained from divulging whether the CAA had
issued a SIGMET alert.</P>
      <P>Chou said both flawed flight safety control and aircraft
maintenance could lead to a plane crash. "Even if the CAA indeed
didn't issue a SIGMET, we ought to probe why it didn't do so. We
should not lightly reach a conclusion based on a simple or a single
element," he added.

      <P>The effectiveness of Taiwan's electronic

who were detained recently and have been charged with spying for
mainland China, a legislator of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai was referring to the arrest of three people
Tuesday in Taiwan accused of spying. The three are: Chen Shih-liang,
a technician with the Republic of China military-run Chungshan
Institute of Science and Technology's (CIST's) Electronics Research
Institute; Yeh Yu-chen, the CEO of private technology company in
Taiwan and Hsu Hsi-tse, a U.S. citizen of Chinese origin.</P>
      <P>Chai said that people from CIST are very talented and have
contributed to the development of Taiwan's electronics technology.
CIST staff are involved in the ROC military's key electronic warfare
systems, Chai said, adding that if the results of their research and
development have been stolen, it is possible that Taiwan's edge in
electronic warfare could be eroded.</P>
      <P>Chai urged the CIST to safeguard its people and technology so
that the company will not be unknowingly penetrated by mainland
Chinese operatives.</P>
      <P>Chai cited an ROC military general as saying that if the fruits
of the research and development of the CIST have been stolen, the

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR PUBLIC COOPERATION TO TACKLE WATER SHORTAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's typhoon season has so far failed
to bring adequate rains to the north of Taiwan and Premier Yu
Shyi-kun asked the public Wednesday to conserve water at a weekly
Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs reported in the
meeting that a water shortage was possible in northern Taiwan
although the last typhoon to sweep by the island last week, Morakot,
brought plentiful rain to the southern regions.</P>
      <P>The premier demanded that the economics ministry adequately
manage water resources and requested relevant authorities to
compensate within two months farmers who have been forced to leave
their rice paddies fallow.</P>
      <P>According to economics ministry officials, rainfall in July
across Taiwan has been extremely limited. Northern Keelung and
eastern Ilan have received no rain during past 43 days and 42 days,
respectively.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Feitsui Reservoir in northern Taipei
County, which is the major supplier for the greater Taipei area, took
in only 36.4 millimeters of rainfall for the whole of last month, a
record single-month low and a new low for July since its operation.
Southern Chiayi, Tainan and Kaohsiung regions also saw historical
lows of rainfall in July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Central Weather Bureau officials have forecast that
the current high pressure front in the Pacific will remain strong
through this month, curtailing the usual torrential afternoon rains.</P>
      <P>Because of the continued dry spell, residents in northern
Keelung, Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu regions are under the first of a
four-phase set of water limits -- the reduction in water pressure
during off-peak hours -- since March 6. Meanwhile, the island county
of Penghu has been under the second phase of water restrictions since
May 10, with Keelung soon to join its ranks this coming Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the set of water restrictive measures worked out by
a national anti-drought task force in March, the second-phase limit
comprises a 20-percent reduction in water supply to large-volume
consumers such as car washes, saunas and swimming pools.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HAILS SMALL BUSINESS SECTOR AS BACKBONE OF TAIWAN ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun praised Taiwan's small-
and medium-sized businesses Wednesday as the backbone of the
country's economy, which has weathered the impact of the U. S.-led
war in Iraq and the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS).</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks at a conference of the Republic of China
Small and Medium Business Association, in which officials from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the Council
of Labor Affairs also took part. The premier also participated in the
meeting last year.</P>
      <P>Despite the negative effects of the Iraq War and the potentially
deadly epidemic, the premier cited government statistics as saying
that Taiwan exports and imports grew by 7.3 percent and 11.8 percent,
respectively, in the first half of this year as compared to levels
posted in the same period last year.</P>
      <P>At the same time, machinery equipment imports increased by 19.5
percent year-on-year during the January-June period, while orders
placed by foreign buyers with Taiwan companies also rose by 8.4
percent in value, he said.</P>
      <P>In June alone, the value of export orders jumped by 11.7 percent
from a year ago, the largest monthly growth rate in three years,
which he said is an indication that normal trade and economic
activities have gone back to normal since June after SARS had been
effectively controlled.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government pays a greater heed to the needs of
small- and medium-sized businesses, Yu said loans released by banks
to the sector have started to grow recently amid the steady economic
recovery since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>The government has attracted NT$644 billion in investments from
the private sector in the first six months of this year, Yu added and
expressed the hope that the figure for the whole of the year would
amount to NT$1.2 trillion (US$34.8 billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ALLIES AGAIN PUSHES U.N. TO CONSIDER TAIWAN'S MEMBERSHIP BID</HEADLINE>

(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifteen of the Republic of China's
diplomatic allies have again pushed the United Nations to consider
the issue regarding Taiwan's representation in the world body, an
official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ROC allies sent a joint letter recently to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan demanding that the 58th U.N. General
Assembly, which is scheduled to open in September, discuss Taiwan's
membership bid, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kao Ying-mau said.</P>
      <P>It was the 11th consecutive year that Taiwan's diplomatic allies
have urged the United Nations to mull Taiwan's representation at its
annual General Assembly.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the proposal describes that Taiwan desires to join
the United Nations using the name of "the Republic of China (Taiwan),
"the same as a similar proposal sent to the U.N. Secretariat last
year.</P>
      <P>"It is a pragmatic description because it covers both Taiwan's
legal status and its reality, " Kao noted, adding that the official
designation of Taiwan is the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>However, this year's proposal features an explanatory annex in
which the ROC allies pointed out new reasons for which the UN's 1971
Resolution No. 2758 failed to resolve Taiwan's representation issue,
Kao said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.N. resolution gave China's seat in the U.N. to
Beijing and expelled Chiang Kai-shek's representative, Kao stressed
that Chiang Kai-shek died long time ago and is no longer able to send
representatives to the world organization.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, the ROC's diplomatic allies have annually pushed the
U.N. to consider the issue of Taiwan's representation in the world
body.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, mainland China has consistently blocked
the proposal from making the General Assembly's agenda at the U.N.
Steering Committee discussions stage.</P>

there is no timetable for opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait trade,
transport and mail links, but that it will happen sometime in the

      <P>Besides, he went on, the government must take into account every

      <P>Government policies should be based on the overall interests of

    <HEADLINE>ISSUE OF NEW PASSPORT VERSION MAINLY FOR FUNCTIONAL PURPOSES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan, Taiwan, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of the new version of
the ROC passport is mainly for functional purposes, a senior official
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Sheng-chung, director of the MOFA's Bureau of Consular
Affairs, made the remarks while briefing staff members of various
airlines and immigration officers at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport -- Taiwan's main gateway -- on the reasons behind Taiwan's
decision to issue a new version of the passport.</P>
      <P>Yang said the only difference in the new version of the passport
is the addition of the word "TAIWAN" in Roman script to the cover in
order to enable foreign immigration officers to more easily
understand where the passport holder hails from.</P>
      <P>The contents of the passport and the official national
designation of the Republic of China on the cover all remain
unchanged, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Some ROC passport holders have complained that they had
encountered unnecessary inconveniences or embarrassment while
traveling abroad with the old version of the ROC passport because
foreign immigration officers mistook them for mainland Chinese
nationals. Mainland China's official title is the People's Republic
of China, or the PRC.</P>
      <P>The addition of the word "TAIWAN" on the cover of the new ROC
passport will make it more distinguishable from that issued by the
PRC, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the MOFA conducted nine public opinion polls
before deciding to issue the new version of the passport.</P>
      <P>"The results of the polls all showed majority support for the
addition of the word 'TAIWAN' to the passport cover, " Yang said,
adding that the legislative branch has made a similar directive on
the modification of the passport cover.</P>
      <P>Asked whether local citizens should apply for the new version of
the passport, Yang said it's up to them to decide. "All old versions
of the passport will remain valid until their expiry dates, " he
explained.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Yang reminded the public that some countries do not
allow their visa stamps on old versions of passports to be
automatically transferred to new passports.</P>
      <P>"Those wishing to travel abroad should contact the local
representative offices of specific foreign countries prior to filing
an application for a new passport, " he added.</P>
      <P>To help foreign immigration officers understand that the ROC will
issue the new version of the passport, Yang said, the MOFA has
ordered all overseas embassies and representative offices to inform
relevant authorities of their host countries of the event and explain
all details.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Consular Affairs began to accept applications for
the new version of the passport Aug. 1, and many people have already
applied, Yang said.</P>
      <P>The bureau is scheduled to conduct a random, computerized drawing
of the issued serial numbers Aug. 15 to decide the first 100
recipients of the new passport. Those who file applications between
Aug. 1 and Aug. 14 have an equal chance of securing the coveted first
new passport.</P>
      <P>The serial number of the new passports will start from
"210000001," Yang said, adding that "21" refers to the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The new version of the passport will formally begin to be issued
from Sept. 1 of this year.</P>
      <P>In the past, the first copy of a new version of a passport was
traditionally reserved for the nation's head of state. This time,
President Chen Shui-bian has directed that the first copy of the new
version be made available to the people since it is they who will
benefit from the changes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT MILITARY, HIGH-TECH SECTOR INFO LEAKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators on Thursday expressed concerns
that mainland China may have used money and women to infiltrate
Taiwan's military and high-tech industries to obtain valuable
information.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said in a press release that mainland China has collected the
background information of the pilots of Taiwan's new generation of
fighter planes. He added that mainland China has placed the
information on the pilots of Taiwan's Mirage fighters at a Hsinchu
air base as well as that of their family members in a file called
"Flying Dragon."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the source of the information leak, Chai said that in
addition to discharged soldiers and officers, mainland Chinese women
in the sex trade around the base as well as mainland brides are
possible suspects.</P>
      <P>Chai noted that whenever the government catches illegal female
mainland Chinese immigrants, it invariably says they have
come to Taiwan to engage in prostitution. Chai asked whether
infiltrating Taiwan's military to collect intelligence information
for mainland China might be another purpose for some of them coming
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Money and women are commonly used by enemies for infiltration
purposes," Chai added.</P>
      <P>Chai noted that there is a science-based industrial park as well
as an air base that is home to a Mirage fleet in Hsinchu, adding that
the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology is also nearby. As
the sex trade shops in Hsinchu employ mostly mainland Chinese women,
it is suspected that they may represent a potential threat regarding
the leaking of military and technology secrets, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Chai called on the government to be on guard against this
suspected threat and to take substantial action to plug up any holes
in the security system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a subgroup in the Legislature called for heightened
alert against the suspected use by mainland China of woman to entice
Taiwan's newly rich in the technology sector in its attempts to
obtain technology secrets or military information.</P>
      <P>The Alliance Against Selling Out Taiwan noted that Hsinchu has
recently become the hangout of the newly rich in the technology
sector, with night clubs and sex trade shops emerging rapidly in the
city. The alliance called for the government to be on guard against
mainland Chinese brides or illegal immigrants being employed in the
shops for the purpose of gaining access to Taiwan's technology or
military information.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Chao-yi of the DPP and independent Legislator
Lin Chin-hsin said that the government should attach great importance
to the issue.</P>
      <P>Lin said mainland gangsters and Communist Party members were
found to be among the recently rounded up illegal immigrants who had
come to Taiwan to work for a construction company and had sneaked
into military barracks, or had run shops near the military barracks
to try to collect information. Some were even found to have
counterfeit Kinmen or Matsu birth certificates with the purpose of
applying to settle in Taiwan and then enter military service.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's medical system maintains high
standards, but still has room for improvement, despite its success in
containing the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
the head physician to President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Kai-mo made the comments after Lee Ming-liang, the nation's
top SARS coordinator, spoke to foreign media at the United Nations in
his capacity as a public health expert. Lee reported how Taiwan dealt
with SARS, which claimed 84 lives, including several medical staff,
and affected 678 people.</P>
      <P>"It is worthwhile for Lee to share Taiwan's experience in
fighting SARS with the international community, " Lee said, but added
that the country still needed to make improvements in its medical
system or "the sacrifice of those in the battle against SARS will
have been in vain."</P>
      <P>Chen said that the inclusion in a hospital of negative pressure
wards, which are primarily used for communicable tuberculosis
patients, was one of the criteria for assessing the quality of a
medical facility, but that Taiwan generally did not include such
equipment in its assessments of hospitals until after SARS began to
break out on the island.</P>
      <P>Chen, who is the superintendent of Cathay General Hospital, said
that the situation regarding resident doctors and health insurance
payment ought also to be reviewed, saying that since health insurance
payment for pediatricians and surgeons are not high, the number of
people wishing to enter these fields is dwindling.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the department of communicable diseases plays a
vital role in hospitals, but because the pay is low for physicians
and there are few patients, only a few doctors are willing to be a
part of these departments, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that the government will work out
measures so that hospitals will not only focus on increasing
revenues, but will dedicate themselves to attracting more talented
medical personnel.</P>

      <P>Fifteen diplomatic allies of the Republic
of China Wednesday requested the United Nations to include the issue
of the Republic of China's representation in the agenda of the 58th
U.N. General Assembly.</P>
      <P>The 15 countries said in an explanatory memorandum attached to
the request that it is necessary for the U.N. to reconsider the issue
of admitting the Republic of China (Taiwan) to the world body,
because U.N. Resolution No. 2758, adopted during the 26th General
Assembly, did not answer the question of Taiwan people's
representation. The 58th U.N. General Assembly will open in New York
next month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the representatives of Tuvalu, Nicaragua and The
Gambia attended a news conference Wednesday to highlight their
support for Taiwan's bid to join the U.N.</P>
      <P>Sosene Sopoaga, representative of Tuvalu in the U.N., said many
U.N. member countries strongly believe that U.N. Resolution 2758 is
unfair and erroneous, and has not been corrected by the world body.
He stressed that the 23 million people on Taiwan have made great
contributions to the world. If the world recognizes their
contributions, the Republic of China (Taiwan) should be admitted to
the world body. He said Tuvalu will cooperate with other U.N. members
in supporting Taiwan's bid to join the world body.</P>
      <P>The Gambia's representative, Grispin Grey Johnson, said if any
country is excluded from the U.N., the world body is incomplete and
is unable to fully fulfill its responsibilities.</P>
      <P>Johnson said that every country has the right to join the U.N.
and that The Gambia will continue to push the U.N. to accept the
Republic of China (Taiwan) as a member.</P>
      <P>Representative Eduardo Sevilla of Nicaragua said that, although
Taiwan's bid to join the U.N. has been repeatedly shot down, Taiwan
has not been defeated. The world body will be enriched when Taiwan's
hope to join the U.N. is fulfilled, he said.</P>
      <P>Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director-general of the Taipei Economic and

Beijing's "one China" policy cannot block Taiwan people's efforts to

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC HEALTH MINISTER DELIVERS SPEECH AT U.N. HEADQUARTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Aug.  6 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former ROC Department of Health (DOH)
Minister Lee Ming-liang delivered a speech on Taiwan's campaign
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the United
Nations headquarters in New York Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, a medical expert who is now a professor at Tzu Chi
University in the eastern Taiwan county of Hualien, delivered the
speech at the invitation of the United Nations Correspondents
Association (UNCA) which is housed in the U.N. headquarters.</P>
      <P>Andrew L. Y. Hsia, director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in New York, and several other Taiwan officials were present
at the gathering.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time in more than three decades since the
Republic of China's exclusion from the United Nations that former and
incumbent ROC officials were able to attend an event held inside the
U.N. headquarters.</P>
      <P>Some 70 foreign ambassadors and journalists posted at the U.N.
headquarters attended the gathering to listen to Lee's speech on
Taiwan's SARS-fighting experiences.</P>
      <P>Lee, a U.S.-trained physician who once practiced medicine and
conducted research in the United States, served as Taiwan's top
SARS-fighting coordinator when the outbreaks reached a crest in
Taipei in May.</P>
      <P>The soft-spoken scholar said the first lesson Taiwan learned from
its battle against SARS was that flawed management of an outbreak of
a communicable disease could lead to a national disaster. Lee was
referring to cluster SARS transmissions inside the Taipei Municipal
Hoping Hospital in late April that led to a sudden deterioration of
the SARS situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the campaign against SARS requires interdisciplinary
expertise and concerted efforts of both the public and private
sectors, Lee said Taiwan didn't form an inter-ministerial committee
to fight the potentially deadly disease until after the Hoping
outbreak.</P>
      <P>One of the main purposes of his current visit to the United
States is to learn from the U.S. experience in establishing a
comprehensive public health and disease prevention framework, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>He further said health education and social mobilization are
critical in battling communicable diseases like SARS. Moreover, he
said, news media should refrain from giving sensational, speculative
reports about epidemics because such reports could trigger public
misgivings and panic.</P>
      <P>Lee also emphasized the importance of international cooperation
in epidemic prevention and control. He said the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention had offered Taiwan much assistance in
its SARS-fighting campaign.</P>
      <P>He said the World Health Organization's (WHO) assistance to
Taiwan came a bit late. If the WHO had extended a helping hand
earlier, he said, Taiwan's SARS outbreaks could have been contained
more quickly. Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan was still grateful for
the WHO's help.</P>
      <P>Lee said epidemics are public health problems which should never
be "politicized." Politics should not interfere with public health
issues and all countries around the world should work hand-in-hand in
containing outbreaks of communicable diseases, he said, adding that
Taiwan is more than willing to share its SARS-fighting experiences
with other countries, including mainland China.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee said SARS is not as terrible as some imagine.
Its death rate ranges between 10 percent and 15 percent, far lower
than many other diseases. With prudence and confidence, he said, SARS
can be brought under control even if it stages a comeback this
winter.</P>
      <P>After his speech, Lee also fielded questions from his audience.
His professional replies won him much acclaim. Even mainland Chinese
journalists present at the meeting said they were impressed by Lee's
professionalism and modesty.</P>
      <P>UNCA President Tony Jenkins said he was impressed by Lee's
intelligent and informative speech and hoped to invite Lee to give
speeches on other topics in the future.</P>
      <P>Permanent U.N. ambassadors from 10 of the ROC's diplomatic
allies, including The Gambia, Grenada, Tuvalu, Nicaragua, Senegal,
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Commonwealth of Dominica, the
Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, and Sao Tome and Principe attended
the meeting. The audience also included correspondents of major news
media, including CNN, CBS, BBC, the Financial Times, Japan's Asahi
Shimbun and Nihon Keizai Shimbun as well as mainland China's People's
Daily and the Xinhua News Agency.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said in an interview with CNA after the speech
that mainland China should invite Taiwan to attend a SARS seminar to
be held in Beijing in September.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will help the outlying island
of Kinmen develop leisure fishing to give a boost to the declining
fishing industry, an official of the Council of Agriculture said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu Shin-hwa, director of council's Fisheries Administration, made
the remarks while attending a ceremony to mark "fishermen's day" in
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, fishery officials welcomed the government's
decision to end its control of the Tatan and Urtan Islets, which had
been home to major military outposts. The officials said that this
should help improve the climate for leisure fishing, but that the
military should also consider easing its control along coastlines to
help the growth of tourism.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Kinmen used to be under military command with little
money coming in from other sources, but with the change in the
fishing regulations, the government can now help Kinmen map out
strategies to enhance its leisure fishing. The fishing industry will
cooperate with fishing villages and fishermen to work toward
improving the ecology of Kinmen and the livelihood of its residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two more Zodiac-style inflatable boats from the Coast
Guard Administration were sent to Kinmen to help protect the seas
around Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Four similar vessels were sent to Kinmen May 19 to help patrol
the seas and stem the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) by stopping illegal entry into the island. The boats patrol
shallow bays to deter mainland fishing ships from crossing the
Kinmen's boundary or engaging in smuggling or transactions on the
beaches.</P>
      <P>With the reopening of direct trade and transportation between
Kinmen and Xiamen after SARS, the cases of mainland China vessels
crossing the boundary are becoming more frequent, and illegal trade
more rampant, so the two additional inflatable boats were requested
to help maintain the order.</P>

      <P>More than 100 fishermen gathered at the
Legislative Yuan Thursday, appealing for lawmakers' help in doing
away with a government ban on hiring mainland Chinese workers to man
Taiwan vessels.</P>
      <P>Lin Sheng-sheng, the secretary-general of the Fishermen's

forbid local fishermen to hire mainland crews for their boats in late
April when both Taiwan and southern China were dealing with severe
acute respiratory syndrome.</P>
      <P>However, one month after both Taiwan and mainland China have been
cleared by the World Health Organization of the disease in early
July, the ban remains unchanged, Lin complained.</P>
      <P>Since direct trade and transportation links between the country's
two frontline islands and mainland China have been resumed, Lin
complained, he see no reason why the ban on hiring mainland fishing
crews should be kept in place.</P>
      <P>Local fishermen have appealed to the Council of Agriculture for
help, but were told the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) didn't agree
to lift the ban, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with fishermen in southern Taiwan recently, Lin said
President Chen Shui-bian promised to end the ban, but a dozen days
have gone by and there has still been no action from the government,
Lin complained.</P>
      <P>An official from the MAC said mainland Chinese officials, who
refuse to contact their Taiwan counterparts, should be blamed.
However, the MAC will be ready soon to make a decision.</P>

entrepreneurs in small- and medium-sized enterprises, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He said that the number of Taiwan's universities has increased
from 50 in 1991 to 139 in 2002, with the rate of people with higher
education surging from 2.27 percent to 4.88 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is trying to become the entrepreneurship development
center in Asia by helping entrepreneurs to obtain capital.</P>
      <P>The island's idea was supported by other APEC economies in a
forum held in Taipei at the end of last month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in his speech in the opening ceremony, Thai Minister
for Industry and SMEs, Somsak Thepsuthin, indicated that small- and
medium-sized companies play an important role in Asia and the Pacific
region as they account for 98 percent of total enterprises in the
area, offering 30 percent of the total employment and creating 50
percent of the transactions.</P>
      <P>At the sidelines of the SME Ministers meeting, the organizer also
held a SME forum and a Women Leaders' Network meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOCUMENTARY FEATURING LIVES OF ADOPTED TAIWAN CHILDREN TO BE SHOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A preview on a film documenting the lives of
Taiwan children adopted by foreign families will be shown at Rebar
Crowne Plaza in Taipei Friday, Cathwell Service, a Catholic
charitable organization, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A spokeswoman for Cathwell Service, which is dedicated to helping
unwed mothers and other disadvantaged people, said the documentary,
which features the lives of nine Taiwan children in their adoptive
Dutch families, is aimed at promoting "open adoption."</P>
      <P>"Open adoption is the healthiest form of adoption where birth
families and adopted children enjoy an ongoing, personal
relationship, " the spokeswoman said, adding that adoption happens
best in a progressive, non-profit agency setting.</P>
      <P>Over the past 13 years, the spokeswoman said, Cathwell has
cooperated with the Meiling Foundation of the Netherlands in
arranging for Dutch families to adopt a total of 225 Taiwan children,
both healthy ones and those with mental and physical disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Meiling Foundation is the only Dutch organization authorized
by the Netherlands to handle adoption services in Taiwan, the
spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>Cathwell staff visited the Netherlands last year to look into the
lives of Taiwan children adopted by Dutch families. "We have produced
a documentary on their daily lives, " the spokeswoman said, adding
that the preview on the documentary will be shown in connection with
Father's Day, which falls on Aug. 8 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She said all of Cathwell staff members took great delight in
seeing all Taiwan children grow up healthy and happy in their new
families.</P>
      <P>Among those children was Ju-ju, who was born prematurely to an
impoverished family 11 years ago. Worse still, she has extremely
short arms which are almost useless. Through the arrangement
of Cathwell and the Meiling Foundation, a Dutch couple -- Henk
Veldhuizen and Elizabeth Roersen -- adopted Ju-ju when she was eight
months old.</P>
      <P>According to Cathwell staff, the couple live on a noted vacation
island off Holland's northwestern coast. Ju-ju is the only Oriental
child on the island. Neighbors and schoolteachers are all friendly to
her.</P>
      <P>With enormous patience and love, the couple has helped Ju-ju grow
up strong, confident and optimistic. Ju-ju, now 12 years old, can use
her feet to play the piano, write, paint, use a computer and ride a
bicycle.</P>
      <P>With the help of Cathwell, Ju-ju has maintained regular contacts
with her birth family in Taipei County's Sanchih township. In the
company of her adoptive parents and an older brother, Ju-ju returned
to Taiwan for the first time in late July. Ju-ju has had a happy
reunion with her birth family.</P>
      <P>Ju-ju and her adoptive parents and older brother will attend the
preview of the special documentary, the Cathwell spokeswoman said,
adding that they will end their Taiwan trip and return to the
Netherlands Saturday.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's imports stood at US$10.37 billion
in July, a decrease of 2.6 percent over the same month last year,
according to statistics released by the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said the fall in imports was mainly due to fewer

      <P>However, the island's exports in July reached US$11.64 billion,
an increase of 4.5 percent over the same month last year, leaving a
trade surplus of US$1.27 billion -- a growth of 152.4 percent on a
year-to-year base.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the country's foreign trade has
recovered and has been steady since the outbreaks of severe acute
respiratory syndrome were contained in June in light of the figures

      <P>The statistics also show that exports in the first seven months
rose by 6.8 percent over the same period last year, while imports

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has bungled its efforts
to reorganize itself, and must tap the enterprise and ideas of
private businessmen to improve its efficiency, Premier Yu Shyi-kun
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Opening an exposition of governmental projects at Panchao, Taipei
County, the premier said the Executive Yuan's plan before the
Democratic Progressive Party took power in 2000 to turn itself into a
business-like group has fallen through.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are 36 ministries and Cabinet-level councils
and agencies under the Executive Yuan, the premier said, "If the
Executive Yuan is a company and I were the general manager, it would
be impossible for me to command and oversee the work of 36 managers."</P>
      <P>He urged the Cabinet members to rejuvenate the government with
businessmen's creativity and new ideas while encouraging private
businessmen to chip in and help the government's management with
their entrepreneurial flair.</P>
      <P>The exposition put on by the Cabinet-level Public Construction
Commission, was aimed at soliciting private businessmen's bids for
building public projects with their own money and get their
investment back through operating the projects for a certain period
of time.</P>
      <P>At the exposition, the government presented 60 public projects
which need to be invested in by the private sector.</P>
      <P>These projects, with a combined price tag of NT$220 billion
(US$6.39 billion) , will be farmed out to private bidders who will
contribute a total investment of NT$130 billion (US$3.67 billion).</P>
      <P>The investors will be responsible for the building of these
projects and will be rewarded with a franchise to operate the
projects before turning them over to the government.</P>
      <P>Under this program, the government may harness the private

Chairman James Soong came up Thursday with the slogan: "Putting

country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" against those who support
Beijing's claims that there is only one China.</P>

political differences with mainland China over "the content of 'one

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND RESEARCH SHIP SPOTTED AGAIN NEAR TAIWAN'S WATERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese research vessel that has
been detected intruding into Taiwan's economic waters on several
occasions was spotted doing so again near southern Taiwan this week,
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) sources reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The "Xiangyanghong No. 14," a research ship belonging to mainland
China's State Oceanic Administration, was spotted Wednesday night in
waters near Orchid Island located off Taiwan's southeast coast,
gradually approaching the 24-nautical-mile limit of Taiwan's
territorial waters offshore Oluanpi, the southernmost tip of the
island, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>Upon spotting the "Xiangyanghong No. 14, " the Republic of China
Navy immediately dispatched two Perry-class frigates to the adjacent
waters to monitor the mainland Chinese vessel and informed the CGA
about the discovery.</P>
      <P>The CGA dispatched three coastal patrol vessels to follow the
mainland Chinese research ship. Some four hours of cat and mouse
ensued, with the "Xiangyanghong No. 14" being chased some 70 nautical
miles away from Oluanpi before the CGA vessels ceased their pursuit.</P>
      <P>During the pursuit, according to CGA officials, the
"Xiangyanghong No. 14" sent a message to the CGA vessels through an
international telecommunications channel to ask the Taiwan patrol
vessels to "leave" in order to avoid "accidents" from occurring.</P>
      <P>According to Ministry of National Defense (MND) authorities,
mainland Chinese maritime research vessels, including those of the
"Xiangyanghong, " "Yuanwang" and "Haiyang" series, were discovered
operating in areas very close to Taiwan's economic waters on more
than 10 occasions last year, with some technically being incursions
into Taiwan's 12-mile territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Since the mainland research vessels were not military and were on
international research missions, the ROC Navy was not in a position
to interfere, MND officials said. They added that the best Taiwan
could do was to chase them away using the civilian CGA vessels
despite knowing that the mainland vessels were on espionage missions
collecting security-related maritime intelligence.</P>
      <P>The 2,894-ton "Xiangyanghong No. 14" is not armed but is equipped
with various antennas. It operates in the Taiwan Strait all year
round.</P>
      <P>CGA officials said they suspect that the ship has repeatedly
navigated close to Orchid Island not only to conduct oceanic research
but also to intercept Taiwan's communications.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest air
carrier, said Friday that it has yet to come to a decision on which
company it will purchase jet engines from for its newly-ordered
planes.</P>
      <P>CAL was responding to reports by the China Times, a
mass-circulation local newspaper, that General Electric and Pratt and
Whitney of the United States have secured the lucrative deal to
provide engines for 12 A330-300 and six B747-400 jets, respectively,
worth a total of around US$600 million.</P>
      <P>Rolls Royce of Great Britain, which has eyed the deal for the 12
A330-300 engines, was shut out of the deal, according to the reports
which added that political trade-offs were involved in the decision.</P>
      <P>The reports suggested that the recent U.S. visit by Presidential
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen as well as the U.S. transit stops by
Vice President Annette Lu on her current Latin American trip and
those scheduled for President Chen Shui-bian on his overseas trip in
October are linked to the CAL deal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIALS BOARD N. KOREAN FREIGHTER ON U.S. INTELLIGENCE TIP OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern  Taiwan,  Aug.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the
Ministry of Finance Kaohsiung Customs Bureau (MFKCB) boarded a North
Korean freighter on Friday on suspicions that the ship is
transporting illicit and dangerous chemical materials.</P>
      <P>MFKCB officials searched the "Be Gaehung, " which arrived in
Kaohsiung Harbor Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand, to unload some
2,000 metric tons of aluminum powder, after being informed by U.S.
intelligence authorities that the freighter might be carrying a batch
of dangerous chemicals which could be used as materials in the
production of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>If any illicit or dangerous chemicals are discovered, the MFKCB
said, it will then collaborate with authorities from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to jointly
tackle the matter.</P>
      <P>The "Be Gaehung" has already completed unloading of the 2,000
metric tons of aluminum powder, and another much smaller quantity of
goods registered as "commodities only for transit" are the target of
the inspection, according to the MFKCB</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung customs officials said that the harbor is taking a
highly cautious attitude toward the matter. The bureau will act in
accordance with international trade practices if any illicit
chemicals are found which may impair the security and safety of the
port, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to a report by the Chinese-language United Daily News,
the 6,500-ton "Be Gaehung" is suspected by U.S. intelligence
authorities of transporting about one metric ton of hydrafil, or
aluminum hydroxide compound, with North Korea as the final
destination.</P>
      <P>Hydrafil, widely used in aluminum refining, as an additive, or as
a reinforcer in rubber and plastic processing, is not dangerous in
itself. However, if combined with other chemicals, it can be
processed into alumina which can be used in making the outer shells
of missiles and other related materials, according to the daily
report.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu and her entourage arrived in Hawaii Thursday on the first stop of
her "Democratic Pacific" tour, with the main destination being Latin
America.</P>
      <P>Lu was met at the Honolulu International Airport by Taiwan's top
representative in the United States, Chen Chien-jen, and officials
from the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , the de facto U.S.
embassy in the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>At her hotel room, the vice president received Manuel Menendez, a
Honolulu government official in charge of economic development
affairs, who is representing the mayor of Honolulu as the host of Lu
and her entourage during their two-day stay in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Lu then visited Hawaii's East West Center, one of the top
research think tanks in the United States, where Lu was met by acting
center director Nancy Davis Lewis.</P>
      <P>Lu told her host group that she has been actively promoting the
establishment and operations of the Democratic Pacific Union, an
organization that she envisages serving as an international
stronghold upholding and bolstering democratization in the Pacific
Rim.</P>
      <P>The vice president invited the East West Center and Hawaiian
Governor Linda Lingle to take part in the first Democratic Pacific
Assembly slated to be held in Taipei next month, which she said is
expected to usher in the arrival of the genuine "Era of the Pacific."</P>

respectively, Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation is scheduled to depart Hawaii for Los

      <P>A group of young men and women from Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen headed to mainland China's port city of
Xiamen Friday for Chinese Valentine's Day, travel sources said.</P>
      <P>Nine Kinmen unmarried men and women, led by Yang Tsai-ping,
secretary-general of the Kinmen Tourism Development Association,
boarded the Kinmen ferry "Star of Orient" Friday morning for Xiamen,
a port city located opposite Kinmen across a narrow stretch of water
in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The nine young men and women are scheduled to take part in the
"1.000 people hand-holding party" to be held Saturday night in
Xiamen, being sponsored by the Xiamen City Government to mark Chinese
Valentine's Day, or "qixi, " the seventh day of the seventh month on
the lunar calendar, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Yang said the "mini three links" -- an initiative taken by the
Republic of China government in January 2001 to open direct trade and
shipping links between the ROC's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu
and Fujian province's port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou -- has served
as a bridge allowing Kinmen youths to cross the Taiwan Strait to join
other single people on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Xiamen collaborated in a cross-strait fireworks
display last year during Lantern Festival, an important festival
which has been observed by all Chinese people for thousands of

      <P>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Prime
Minister Ralph E. Gonsalves reaffirmed Thursday that relations
between his country and the Republic of China are solid and that
Taiwan has contributed a lot to the development of his country.</P>
      <P>Gonsalves made the remarks while hosting a dinner in honor of ROC
Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien and his delegation, with the
foreign ministers from the four East Caribbean ally nations
attending.</P>
      <P>Gonsalves stressed that friendship between the two countries is
firm, saying that his country is satisfied with all the support
Taiwan has provided the country in the past, including the
cooperation in agricultural technology.</P>
      <P>He also said that Saint Vincent and the Grenadines attaches great
importance to Taiwan, and he will speak for the ROC's rights whenever
there is a chance, whether it is in the United Nations or in the
World Health Organization.</P>

Minister of Foreign Affairs Louis Straker also said that his country
will give full support to Taiwan on any international occasion, as
the ROC is a very friendly ally, and his country has the obligation
to support Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Minister Chien visited ROC agricultural missions in the
afternoon. He said that the mission was quite successful, citing as
an example that under the assistance of the mission, pork supply in
the country is now self-sufficient, instead of having to rely on
imports.</P>
      <P>He said that Saint Vincent and Grenadines also has some
agricultural exports with the assistance of the mission, completely
changing the outlook of local people on agricultural products. The
mission has successfully grown guavas and wax apples, and is now
trying to grow pomelos and starfruits. Many of the fruits grown
there now have added the name "Taiwan" on the produce.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Chien also donated 120 wheelchairs and a check

      <P>Affected by a persistent high pressure front
in the Pacific and the effects of a typhoon north of Taiwan, the
temperature in Taipei rose to a record 38.7 degrees Celsius (101.7
Fahrenheit) Friday, a spokesman for the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
reported.</P>
      <P>The temperature was not only the highest for Taipei, Taiwan's

historical high in more than a century since 1897 in the city, when
the municipal authorities began to monitor temperatures, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>CWB officials attributed the large rise in Taipei's temperature
to Typhoon Etau, which was heading toward Japan and producing a foehn
effect and a robust hot snap because of a subsidence flow in northern
Taiwan while moving north.</P>
      <P>The high temperature was registered at 1: 05 p. m., after a high
of 38.4 degrees Celsius appeared earlier the same day at 11: 53 a. m.
Taipei's second-highest temperature of 38.6 degrees was posted July

reiterating that the government is poised to carry out the plan in

expansion of its products and service in the other's region.</P>
      <P>For his part, Jocome said that this was the second FTA that
Panama has signed. He noted that Taiwan and Panama have good trade
and economic relations, especially because Taiwan has invested
heavily in his country.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the signing of the FTA will strengthen
bilateral trade relations as well as diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>He also said that Panamanian President Mireya Elisa Moscoso is a
good friend with ROC President Chen Shui-bian, and that they share
the same ideals in ruling their countries. Panama will continue to
support the ROC's bid to enter the international community and is
hoping to make inroads into the Asian market with the assistance of
Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Panama began FTA talks last year and have conducted
five rounds and a special session of negotiations on agricultural
issues.</P>
      <P>Working teams from both sides started the fifth round of talks
Aug. 1 in Taipei, verifying the opening list of agricultural products
and service industries. The most sensitive agricultural issues were
addressed in a constructive and pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>The last round of talks were, therefore, able to close Friday,
two days earlier than the scheduled day on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ROC-Panama FTA represents a comprehensive and balanced
supra-WTO agreement that contains chapters covering specific issues,
such as market access, services and investment, telecommunications,
intellectual property rights, competition policy and dispute
settlement mechanisms which are consistent with WTO guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs plans that when Panamanian
President Mireya Elisa Moscoso visits Taiwan later this month to
attend the summit meeting of the leaders of Republic of China,
Central American, the Dominican Republic and Belize, she and
President Chen will co-sign the FTA agreement.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court ordered a retrial of the
"Hsichih Trio, " who were found not guilty and set free on Jan. 13 by
the Taiwan High Court after spending more than 10 years on death row
for the double murder and rape of a couple in Hsichih, Taipei County
in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court threw out the not guilty verdict given by the
three Taiwan High Court judges, saying that they had evaluated
evidence in the case in defiance of time-tested rules, had defied
logic, and had failed to observe legal guidelines and had not done a
thorough investigation into the case before rendering a verdict.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court's determination that the trio's confessions
were inadmissible because of 13 inconsistencies among the suspects'
accounts was inappropriate because the confessions should have been
considered as a whole and should have been examined in reference to
other evidence.</P>
      <P>The three defendants, Su Chien-ho, Liu Bing-lang and Chuang
Lin-hsun, were accused of killing Wu Ming-han and his wife Yeh
Ying-lan, and gang-raping Yeh with an accomplice, Wang Wen-hsiao.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was a soldier when the crime was committed, was
sentenced to death by a military court and executed in 1992.</P>
      <P>The three were tried in civilian court and convicted of robbery,
murder and rape and were sentenced to death. The sentence was upheld
in all subsequent appeals until the Taiwan High Court cleared them of
all charges and set them free in January 2003 to the delight of the
country's human rights advocates. Many observers have claimed that
the three were set up by police in charge of the investigation.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors appealed the not guilty verdict to the Supreme
Court on behalf of the victims' families.</P>
      <P>A lawyer for the three said the new trial, to be conducted by the
Taiwan High Court -- with different judges -- is the beginning of
another ordeal for the defendants, but he vowed to defend the three's
innocence once again.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug. 8 (CNA)
(By  C. C. Huang, C. S. Chang and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A promotion delegation led by Tourism Bureau
Director-General Su Cheng-tien under the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications sponsored a seminar Friday in Tokyo, trying hard
to sell Taiwan as a tour destination to the Japanese public in the
wake of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Nearly 300 representatives from Japan's media and tourism sectors
took part in the activity, in which a movie was showed to represent
the everyday life in post-SARS Taipei streets and to declare 2004 as
a "Taiwan Tourism Year" with a tourist arrival target set at 1.09
million.</P>
      <P>Su expressed his hope that the number of tourists to Taiwan would
rebound to normal levels by the end of this year and that the
promotional efforts made by his bureau would help lure more foreign
visitors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Su, arrivals to Taiwan during the April-June period
totaled about 200,000 when SARS was rampant, a large fall from the
750,000 posted for the first three months of this year.</P>
      <P>Promotional activities offered by the Tourism Bureau include a
cash bonus of NT$3,000 to the first batch of 5,000 Japanese tourists
applying to tour Taiwan and a planned tax-rebate treatment for
foreign visitors.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to Japan Lo Fu-chuan and Su, as
well as two representatives from the Japanese side, drew tickets for
270 pairs of two-night free trips to Taiwan. Another 230 pairs were
already offered the same treatment also through a lucky draw over the
past two days out of a total of more than 130,000 entrants.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
(TECO) in New York, led by director Andrew L Y. Hsia, also hosted a
gathering to advocate Taiwan tourism with representatives from the
local Chinese-language media and tourist agencies, as well as
officials of Taiwan's two largest carriers -- China Airlines (CAL)
and EVA Airways (EVA Air) -- at a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan.</P>
      <P>Announcing that 2004 has been appointed by the Executive Yuan as
the "Taiwan Tourism Year, " Hsia said the Taiwan authorities have
designed a series of promotional activities to court foreign
visitors, such as 30-day visa-free treatment for U. S. passport
holders and a tax-refund privilege, and a string of folk festivals
back at home in cities and townships across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to free fact-finding trips to Taiwan available for
tourist agency operators and reporters attending the gathering, the
Tourism Bureau will also offer a certain number of foreign tourists
from across the globe a free tour of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan-based tourist agencies are cooperating with CAL
and EVA Air to launch economy package tours featuring local
attractions and flavors, such as in-depth tours focusing on food,
ceramics and sailing, a TECO official said.</P>
      <P>As long as Taiwan knows where to move and strike, Taiwan has much
more potential to court foreign tourists than Singapore, which
already is a model of success, an official from the Tourism Bureau
said.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun promised to set up an
industrial park and a cultural park in Pingtung County, in south
Taiwan while traveling there Friday.</P>
      <P>Visiting a farm owned by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation,
the premier said his administration will turn the 250-hectare farm
into Asia's biggest agricultural bio-tech industrial park.</P>
      <P>Yu said he will personally see to it that a proposal to set up a
 preparatory organization for the industrial park to be approved by
 his Cabinet within a week and hopefully the park will begin to take
 in companies in 2006.</P>
      <P>Drawing on the rich experience his administration has in
developing industrial parks, Yu promised that this park will be
completed in an unprecedentedly short period.</P>
      <P>Vice Chairman of the Council of Agriculture Lee Jen-chyuan, who
accompanied Yu on the trip, said in a briefing that the park is the
brainchild of the National Agriculture Conference in March. It will
harness hi-technology to agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Later Friday, Yu visited a site set aside for a Hakka cultural
 park in Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Yu said the park, promised by President Chen Shui-bian during his
2000 presidential campaign, will begin first-stage work on Sept. 20,
and second-stage work on Oct. 20. The whole park will be completed
and opened in 2005.</P>
      <P>Chairperson of the Council of Hakka Affairs Yeh Chu-lan, who
accompanied Yu on the trip, said President Chen attached great
importance to the Hakka culture, and the Pingtung Hakka park will be
the window of Hakka culture in south Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting an analysis made by Yeh's council, Yu Shyi-kun said that
no country in the world except for Taiwan gives this much emphasis to
Hakkas, and no person except for Chen Shui-bian cares this much about
Hakkas.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung Hakka park will be built earlier and much better
than a similar park in north Taiwan. It will be the best Hakka
culture park not only in Taiwan but also in the world, Yu said.</P>

      <P>The northern Taiwan port city of Keelung on
Saturday implemented the second-phase water restrictions due to
scarce rainfall in the last few months.</P>
      <P>With the second-phase water restrictions in place, water usage
for fountains and street cleaning and for sectors where water use is
non-essential is prohibited. At the same time, water supply is

Central University earlier this year indicates his administration's
determination to promote Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>"And our promotional campaign will not stop there. We'll make
continued efforts to help local people understand the essence of
Hakka culture," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president further said he took delight in seeing colorful
Hakka-style floral cloth become main decorative items at the cultural
festival organized by the Taoyuan County Government.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that the success of the Pingchen Hakka
cultural festival will inspire other townships to sponsor similar
activities to showcase their own unique cultural heritage.</P>
      <P>The festival features a wide variety of programs, including
singing, dancing and theatrical performances as well as a Hakka food
trade fair.</P>
      <P>Many senior officials, including Yeh Chu-lan, chairwoman of the
Council for Hakka Affairs and Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun,
were also present at the opening ceremony.</P>

      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, deputy
secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
will preside over a "flag-presentation" ceremony for a support group
for President Chen Shui-bian in San francisco Saturday on behalf of
Chen.</P>
      <P>The group is composed of "pan-green camp" supporters residing in
northern California. The "pan-green camp" refers to the DPP and its
ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The activity in San Francisco is expected to kick off an overseas
campaign of the DPP for President Chen's bid for reelection in March
2004.</P>
      <P>With the presidential election just months away, heavyweights
from the "pan-green camp, " as well as those from the "pan-blue
alliance, " of the opposition Kuomintang and its ally the People
First Party, are expected to converge in cities in California such as
Los Angeles and San Francisco.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lee from the DPP, Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
and Legislator Wu Den-yih from the Kuomintang are also expected to
head to California in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese in northern California have always been
concerned about political developments in Taiwan. In every
presidential election, they have donated generously and organized
groups to return to Taiwan to campaign for their favorite candidates.</P>
      <P>Lee, who served as former Republic of China deputy representative
to the United States, has visited San Francisco several times. He is
expected to attend the DPP solidarity alliance ceremony. He is also

      <P>Republic of China Examination Yuan President
Yao Chia-wen said in London Friday that Taiwan should continue to
strive for making its civil servants maintain neutrality in carrying
out their administrative affairs.</P>
      <P>Yao, who is in London for a five-day visit aimed at studying the
British civil servant training and pension systems, made the remarks
in a symposium held at the University of London's School of Oriental

      <P>"Taiwan is now a free, fair and democratic society, " Yao noted,
adding that the Taiwan people enjoy the freedom of expression and the
right to make speeches and to form political parties.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should try to dump the old tradition in which the
affairs of the ruling party and those of the government are
intertwined, calling for the government system to belong to the
nation and not to any single political party.</P>
      <P>Yao also said that Taiwan should seek the international position
which it deserves, as well as guarantee the island's security and
sovereignty, while maintaining its prosperous economy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC Constitution which was drawn up by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the presidential election only months
away, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has completed a
 "green paper" on the performance of President Chen Shui-bian's
administration over the past three years, DPP sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The performance report details the central government's subsidies
to the local governments and President Chen's delivery on his
campaign promises to voters. Even the central government's subsidies
to local small-scale construction projects are included in the
report.</P>
      <P>DPP sources said that the paper will be distributed to DPP
legislators so that they can clearly explain the government's
performance to the grass-roots voters and solicit their support for
President Chen's bid for re-election in March 2004.</P>
      <P>The 419-page report, prepared by the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, is an analysis of the
government's performance in the cities and counties, stressing the
idea that "the rule of the DPP is the guarantee of quality."</P>
      <P>The "green paper" gives a breakdown of the government's
performance regarding each of the 25 cities and counties in Taiwan,
analyzing the central government's subsidies and the implementation
of projects.</P>
      <P>There are nine major categories -- subsidies, transportation
network, water resources facilities, social welfare, education and
culture, agricultural development, environment and health, tourism
and leisure, and others.</P>
      <P>Taking Taipei County as an example, the report cites the projects
to improve water supply in Panchiao and Hsintien, as well as the
Taipei Harbor development project.</P>
      <P>For the southern city of Kaohsiung, the report cites the
president's promise to make the improvement of water quality a top
priority. In the central county of Nantou, it cites the promotion of
the relocation of villages that are vulnerable to mud slides.</P>
      <P>The legislators received the parts of the report concerning their
respective constituencies so that they will have the "hard evidence"
to back up their rhetoric that the government has indeed attached
great importance to the development of cities and counties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau on
Saturday asked that a North Korean freighter in the harbor in
southern Taiwan be temporarily detained in order to allow for a
thorough check for possible dangerous chemicals on board.</P>
      <P>The 6,500-ton freighter "Be Gae Bong, " arrived in Kaohsiung
Harbor Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand, to unload some 2,000 metric
tons of aluminum powder.</P>
      <P>After being informed by U.S. intelligence authorities that the
freighter might be carrying a batch of dangerous chemicals which
could be used as materials in the production of nuclear weapons,
harbor officials boarded the vessel Friday to conduct a search.</P>
      <P>As the ship is suspected of transporting about one metric ton of
hydrafil, or aluminum hydroxide compound, with North Korea as the
final destination, Kaohsiung Harbor detained the vessel according to
international trade regulations.</P>
      <P>Harbor Bureau officials have asked that approval for the ship's
application to leave the harbor be delayed in order for a thorough
search to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Hydrafil, widely used in aluminum refining, as an additive, or as
a reinforcer in rubber and plastic processing, is not dangerous in
itself. However, if combined with other chemicals, it can be
processed into alumina which can be used in making the outer shells
of missiles and other related materials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSC DEBUNKS MEDIA REPORT ON POTENTIAL HOLE IN NATION'S SECURITY SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Security Council (NSC) on
Saturday debunked a media report that one of its staff members
responsible for mainland China-related intelligence has business
interests on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Apple Daily claimed in a front-page article that NSC
Secretary-General Kang Ning-hsiang's personal aide, Chang Pei-chen,
holds a stake in a Hong Kong-based company which cooperates with a
firm owned by mainland China's Ministry of Railways in operating land
development business in Shanghai. The report said the NSC's
recruitment of Chang could be a potential hole in the nation's
security system.</P>
      <P>The NSC said in a press release that the Apple Daily report was
not true. For one thing, it said, Chang had never dealt with any
classified information about mainland China during her work at the
council.</P>
      <P>The council also noted that it accepted Chang's resignation
earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC statement, Chang had devoted herself to
research on the mainland economy for 20 years at the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research before she joined the NSC April 1
this year. She provided counseling in mainland economic affairs
during her stint at the NSC, the statement said, adding that
Chang's work had nothing to do with intelligence.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the NSC said, Chang had not had any links with the
company mentioned by the newspaper before she was hired by the NSC
to serve as a mainland affairs specialist in April. It stressed that
Chang's work at the NSC had nothing to do with the disputes related
to her husband's business operations in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The NSC further said it has a stringent internal security control
system and has consistently made an immediate response whenever any
security concerns have arisen.</P>
      <P>Chang's husband, Chang Jui-meng, resigned from the chairmanship
of a local security service firm in late July after he returned from
a business trip to Shanghai where he reportedly had trade disputes
with his business partners.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang's legislative caucus
demanded that the NSC investigate whether Chang Pei-chen had ever
leaked national secrets or classified information to mainland Chinese
authorities during her stint at the NSC. It also pushed the
Democratic Progressive Party administration to review its public
functionaries loyalty check mechanism.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An animal protection group on Saturday
launched a program where people can "adopt" a stray dog for NT$20
(US$0.57) a day.</P>
      <P>The Animal Protection Association of the Republic of China said
that the campaign will provide a new option for people who would like
to have a pet dog but cannot because of other considerations.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Chia-fu of the opposition Kuomintang, who
concurrently serves as the president of the association, said that
most people don't have the time or space in their homes to have a pet
dog. He said that for NT$20 a day, or NT$600 a month, they can now
adopt one of the many stray dogs being housed at an animal shelter in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the dog lovers can visit their adopted dogs on weekends
and holidays and take them for a walk or ride. In this way, "they can
have all the pleasures of having a pet dog without the troubles of
raising them," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He noted that the association set up a shelter for stray animals
in 1988 and then later relocated it to Pali, Taipei County, due to
cramped quarters. He said the shelter has at times accommodated more
than 2,000 stray cats and dogs at one time.</P>
      <P>The association decided to kick off the "adoption" program to
provide better care for the stray and abandoned animals.</P>
      <P>Association officials said that those who are interested in
taking part in the program can call (02) 2704-0809 or visit

    <HEADLINE>ROC, PANAMA TO INFORM WTO COMMITTEE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF FTA TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the completion of negotiations
between Taiwan and Panama on the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) Friday, the two sides will inform the Committee on Regional
Trade Agreements (RTA) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) for
further examination.</P>
      <P>According to WTO regulations, every free trade agreement or
regional trade agreement should be examined by the committee to see
whether the contents violate the regulations that govern multilateral
trade agreements.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang, the Republic of China's permanent representative
at the WTO, said that once signed, the free trade agreement between
Taiwan and Panama will be the first of its kind that the island has
achieved under the framework of the WTO.</P>
      <P>Recently, the signing of free trade agreements and regional trade
agreements has become a trend among WTO member economies, with almost
all the WHO members, except for Taiwan and mainland China, having
some form of free trade agreement with other countries.</P>
      <P>If the trend continues, the number of FTAs or RTAs will exceed
300 within two years, WTO sources said.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report from the WTO's Committee on Regional
Trade Agreements, the committee has received 267 notices for
examining RTAs as of June, and the committee is currently examining
138 of those.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether other countries can ask for similar favorable
treatment that Taiwan granted to Panama in their free trade
agreement, Yen said no problems exist in this regard.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that Taiwan had made significant concessions
upon its entry into the WTO, saying that other countries therefore
should not ask for even more concessions from the island because of
its free trade agreement with Panama.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Panamanian government sources, President
Mireya Elisa Moscoso is scheduled to visit Taiwan Aug. 19-22 to sign
the free trade agreement, in addition to attending a summit meeting
of the heads of state of the ROC, the Dominican Republic, Belize and
other Central American countries.</P>

(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu, who is
currently on a transit stop in Hawaii on her way to Panama, met with
influential Hawaiian politicians Friday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Lu exchanged views with Hawaiian State House of Representatives
Speaker Calvin Say and Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) in separate
meetings at her hotel room on matters of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>During her talks with Akaka, Lu briefed her guest on Taiwan's
plan to hold a referendum on certain public issues, including its bid
to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the World Health
Organization's (WHO's) governing body -- as an observer.</P>
      <P>Lu said mainland China has never apologized for the spread of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to Taiwan. Worse still, she
said, mainland delegates publicly humiliated Taiwan during this
year's WHA conference in Geneva in May and spared no efforts to block
Taiwan's observership bid.</P>
      <P>The planned referendum is aimed at letting the world understand
the necessity for Taiwan to be included into the WHO system and the
Taiwan people's determination to realize this goal, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Despite mainland China's perennial military threat, Lu said,
Taiwan has managed to create "an economic miracle and a political
miracle" while maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. With all these
achievements, she said, Taiwan deserves more international support
for its cause. Lu said once Taiwan is admitted to the WHO, it will be
able to make even more contributions to the world health regulatory
body.</P>
      <P>Lu invited Akaka to attend the first Democratic Pacific
Conference to be held in Taipei later this year.</P>
      <P>Akaka whose grandfather moved from mainland China's Fujian
Province to Hawaii in 1850 said he will accept Lu's invitation if his
work schedule permits. Akaka said he has fond memories of his last
visit to Taiwan in 1994. He lauded Lu for her efforts to promote
freedom, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu discussed tourist, foreign labor and
education issues with the Hawaiian State House of Representatives
speaker.</P>
      <P>Hawaii is noted for its tourist industry and is experienced in
handling foreign laborer issues. Lu said Taiwan has much to learn
from Hawaii in promoting tourism, ethnic harmony and globalization.</P>
      <P>Lu, who departed Taipei Thursday, is leading a 43-member
delegation to Asuncion, Paraguay to attend the inauguration of the
new Paraguayan president, Nicanor Duarte, on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>Lu and her entourage will leave Hawaii for Los Angeles Saturday
for a two-day transit stay before heading to Panama.</P>
      <P>While in Panama, Lu will meet with senior Panamanian officials to
discuss measures for further boosting bilateral cooperation.
Panamanian Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan Jimenez will honor
Lu by awarding her a medal.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the presidential inauguration, Lu will
deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and at Asuncion
University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that
stuffing the late Taipei City Zoo elephant "Lin Wang" will
immortalize the Asian elephant that had brought so many fond memories
to the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma made the remarks when he attended a press conference for
the late Lin Wang at the Taipei City Zoo to express his appreciation
to Yulon Motor Co. for financing the preservation project. Lin
Wang died this February at the age of 86.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that "grandpa" Lin Wang was brought to Taiwan half a
century ago and that "while Lin Wang watched zoo visitors grow up,
zoo visitors watched Lin Wang grow old."</P>
      <P>Ma noted that while some people are against the decision to have
the elephant stuffed, he believes the project will "help keep Lin
Wang's memory alive and foster the concept of friendliness toward
animals among the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Zoo officials noted that the legendary elephant, born
in Myanmar, was captured by the Republic of China army from Japanese
troops in the Southeast Asian country at the height of World War II.
The elephant was about 26 yeas old at the time. He was later brought
to southern Taiwan from mainland China in 1947 and then donated to
the Taipei City Zoo by Gen. Sun Li-jen in 1954.</P>
      <P>A fixture at Taipei City Zoo for many years, Lin Wang brought
much joy and happiness to countless visitors to the zoo for almost
half a century before his passing away this February.</P>
      <P>The zoo wanted to preserve the elephant, but did not have enough
money until Yulon Motors donated NT$5 million to make the project
possible, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Yen Kai-tai, deputy chairman of Yulon Motors, said that the
company believes that Lin Wang's specimen will create more happy
memories for many people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yen and the mayor later unveiled a mini-scale wood carving of Lin
Wang to mark the formal start of the preservation project. The wood
carving was produced by a Taiwan sculptor living in Japan with the
same name of Lin Wang. The carving will be placed xxxxxx for visitors
to the zoo to see.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma also presented a footprint woodcut of Lin Wang to Yen to
express his appreciation to Yulon Motors for the donation.</P>

      <P>The nation's arms procurement plans will be
based on defense needs and overall military buildup policy, the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to media reports that two major U.S.

Taiwan legislative group, headed by Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng, to view its "Pave Paw" early warning radar systems now in
service in the U.S. military during the group's recent U.S. visit.
The reports said the arrangement was part of Raytheon's efforts to
court for Taiwan's order for such equipment.</P>
      <P>The reports further said another U.S. weaponry
manufacturing firm Lockheed Martin is planning to send retired

    <HEADLINE>DIGITAL CONTENT INSTITUTE TO TRAIN 900 PEOPLE IN SIX MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CA) The Digital Content Institute (DCI) under
the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) will coordinate with local
universities and multimedia educational centers to sponsor training
programs in the latest technologies, and 900 people are expected to
be ready for the fast-growing digital content industry in the next
six months.</P>
      <P>DCI project manager Huang Wan-hua said that while the highly
promising digital content industry demands increasing numbers of
talented individuals in the fields of games, 3D computer animation,
e-learning, audio-visual applications, digital content, Internet
services, software and digital publications, the industry is facing a
serious shortfall of specialists.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, starting August, the institute will begin a
series of training programs, with the support of National Chiao Tung
University in Hsinchu, Soochow University in Taipei, Southern Taiwan
University of Technology in Tainan, the Education and Training Center
and the Multimedia Experimental Center of the Institute for
Information Industry in Taipei, as well as the Chinese Internet and
Multimedia Association, the NuArt Institute and EC Multimedia
Technology Corp.</P>
      <P>He added that courses offered by the educational establishments
will center on creative design, audio-visual design and program
design in relation to computer games and 3D computer animation, and
marketing and management.</P>
      <P>While local digital content companies are encouraged to use the
program for their on-the-job training, Huang said that the DCI will
cover 60 percent of the tuition for the 900 trainees.</P>
      <P>With such promising prospects, the digital content industry has
been pinpointed as a strategic industry by the Cabinet. In 2002, the
production value of Taiwan's digital content industry amounted to
NT$153.7 billion, an increase of 15.2 percent over the preceding
year, according to IDB statistics.</P>
      <P>The IDB estimated that between 2003 and 2006, the industry may
achieve an annual growth above 20 percent, and by 2006, the
production value will reach NT$370 billion.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 digital content companies in
Taiwan, with overall employment of around 33,000. The IDB forecast
that by 2006, the number of digital content companies will reach
3,000 and the number of employees will total 70,000.</P>
      <P>At the moment, export value only accounts for 12 percent of the
industry's production value. The IDB has set a target of 30 percent
by the year of 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NINE SOCIAL WELFARE GROUPS ALIGN UNDER BANNER OF 'PAN-PURPLE ALLIANCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice, a new
association grouping nine of the country's social welfare
organizations, was formally established Sunday. The alliance hopes to
marshal its resources for the benefit of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>Alliance head Chien Hsi-chieh said at a founding ceremony that
the alliance has chosen purple as its signature color to distinguish
itself from the "pan-green" camp of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- and the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First
Party.</P>
      <P>Chien said the Alliance of Fairness and Justice, which will also
be known as the "pan-purple alliance, " will focus on promoting fair
and just social welfare services and speak for the underprivileged,
including those who are becoming disadvantaged because of social
injustices.</P>
      <P>Noting that the purpose of political democratization is to better
people's lives, Chien called for both the pan-green and the pan-blue
camps to shift their presidential election campaign policies and vow
to rebuilding social welfare and security.</P>
      <P>Chien, who once served as an at-large DPP lawmaker for two terms,
said the new group hopes to become a "third force, " which will
jump-start a new wave of social and civil movements in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged all segments of Taiwan society to do some soul-searching
on the ethics and values of how campaigning is carried out in Taiwan
and push the ruling and the opposition parties to pass responsible
election legislation.</P>
      <P>Chien said if Taiwan society does not capitalize on the
opportunity of the 2004 presidential election to steer politicians in
the right direction, the people of Taiwan will always be the ultimate
losers after petty political squabbles between opposing parties.</P>
      <P>Formerly a member of the DPP's largest faction, the "New Tide, "
Chien said that his association with the DPP will have no impact on
the work of the "pan-purple alliance, " which will seek fairness and
justice for Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>"Pan-purple alliance" officials said it is still too early to
speculate whether the alliance will eventually be transformed into a
political party, and the alliance currently has reached no consensus
on whether it will nominate its own candidate for the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chien confirmed media reports that he had tried to persuade Lin
Yi-hsiung, a former DPP chairman, to represent the new alliance as a
presidential candidate. "However, Lin turned down my suggestion, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Members of the Alliance of Fairness and Justice include the
women's interest group the Awakening Foundation, the National
Teachers' Association, the Taiwan Laborers' Front, the Eden Social
Welfare Foundation, and the Elders' Welfare Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S BRIGHTEST LIGHTS COULD DIM LIEN'S PRESIDENTIAL BID: LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The most charismatic and well-known
Kuomintang (KMT) politicians may in fact be the Achilles's heed for
the presidential bid of KMT Chairman Lien Chan since they are
descendants of mainland Chinese, an issue divisive for Taiwanese
voters, particularly in the south of the island.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung's has warned KMT
Chairman Lien Chan that he should distance himself from three KMT
political luminaries who are descendants of mainland Chinese has
struck a chord with many KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Campaign staffers for Lien have floated the idea, but the idea
was met with skepticism from Wu, who said that this would reinforce
the public impression that the KMT favors those of mainland descent
over those from Taiwan. Wu said that this would go down particularly
poorly among Taiwanese in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three KMT politicians -- Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, Taoyuan
County Magistrate Chu Li-lun and Taichung City Mayor Jason Hu
-command considerable support, but they are also all descendants of
mainlanders who emigrated to Taiwan after 1949. About 17 percent of
the island's population is made up of such people.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is set to pair up with People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong, who is also a descendant of mainlanders, was
himself born on the mainland but of a Taiwanese father.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislative Yuan whip Lee Chia-chin said Ma, Chu and Hu are
all rising stars of the KMT and can help Lien win local support.</P>
      <P>Lee emphasized that the KMT does not discriminate against
mainlanders or their descendants; however, the party should address
Wu's concerns and avoid giving Taiwanese the impression that the
party is skewed toward mainlanders.</P>
      <P>Instead of the party turning its back on its important elected
officials just because of their origins, Lee said the KMT should be
concentrating on grooming Taiwanese politicians.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng is a good example, Lee
said. Elected from a supporter base in Kaohsiung County, Wang is
someone with the potential to be a national political leader and
would be able to significantly expand the KMT's popularity in
southern Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Others legislators such as Lin Yi-shih from Kaohsiung County, Lee
Chuan-chiao from Tainan County and Chuo Poh-yuan from Changhua County
are all young politicians with clean images and could be the vanguard
of the party's new rallying point for the Taiwanese vote, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chao-hsun, who was the first KMT lawmaker to
criticize the mainland Chinese backgrounds of Ma, Chu and Hu,
claiming it would offend Taiwanese in the South, shares Lee's point
of view. He concurred that Legislative Yuan President Wang could be
vital to ensuring a victory for Lien in 2004.</P>
      <P>"Lien should make Wang the director of his presidential campaign
to appeal to voters in the South, " Huang said, adding that two other
KMT vice chairmen, Wu Poh-hsiung and P. K. Chiang, are excellent
native Taiwanese leaders who can canvass Taiwanese voters for Lien.</P>
      <P>Another reason why Lien may wish to reconsider becoming too
involved with the three well-known KMT politicians has more to do
with cross-party mistrust between the KMT and the PFP than ancestry.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Hung-chang said Lien should be very wary of
aligning himself too closely with Ma, Chu and Hu because this is
exactly what the PFP wants: a KMT perceived as catering to the
interests of its own and being seen as becoming a party of mainland
Chinese.</P>
      <P>Besides, Chen pointed out, Ma and Hu are politicians of some
account, but Chu is only a political rookie whose strength is far
from certain and may turn out to be a minnow when it comes to pulling
in votes.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The newly established Alliance of Fairness
and Justice, also known as the "pan-purple alliance, " vowed at its
inauguration Sunday that Taiwan society would say goodbye to
political short-sightedness and instant gratification.</P>
      <P>In its founding declaration, the alliance said that a fair and
just society is not a predator who exploits others financially,
socially and environmentally.</P>
      <P>A fair and just society will not allow the social welfare system
to be reduced to a bank ATM and passbook relationship, the alliance
said.</P>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice was formally established
Sunday aligning nine of Taiwan's social welfare organizations, which
include the Handicapped Union of the Republic of China, the women's
interest group the Awakening Foundation, the National Teachers'
Association, the Taiwan Laborers' Front, the Eden Social Welfare
Foundation, and the Elders' Welfare Union.</P>
      <P>In its founding vows, announced by Wang Jung-chang,
secretary-general of the Handicapped Union of the Republic of China,
the alliance demands the resumption of a "rich man's tax, " and that
presidential candidates should spell out their policies on how
national debts will be repaid as part of their campaign promises.</P>
      <P>The alliance advocates a universal pension system for all elderly
citizens of the country and the repeal of the existing retirement
payment systems, which will in turn be included under the universal
pension system.</P>
      <P>The alliance trumpets the establishment of a national social aid
system, offering social and financial aid to underprivileged people
in the ratio of 3 percent out of the entire population from the
current ratio of 0.75 percent.</P>
      <P>It also suggests that the government improve its welfare policy
toward "new immigrants" to the country, allowing them access to
better work and education opportunities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. STILL UNCONVINCED OF NEED FOR TAIWAN REFERENDUM: KMT AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington remains deeply concerned about
Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum, despite a recent visit by a
ranking government official to the United States to explain the
matter, an official of the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung, deputy director-general of the KMT's Policy
Coordination Committee and head of the Mainland Affairs Department,
said U. S. concern about Taiwan's referendum plan has remained
unchanged following a visit by ROC Presidential Secretary-General
Chiou I-jen to Washington earlier this year to try to clarify
Taiwan's position regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>The United States has not seen enough reasons for Taiwan to hold
a referendum on the fate of the disputed Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
or its need to join the World Health Organization under the framework
of "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" advocated by
President Chen Shui-bian, he said, adding that Washington is even
more worried that a referendum on Taiwan's future will escalate
tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that relations between Taiwan and the United
States have showed signs of souring despite Chiu's U. S. trip, as
evidenced by U. S. authorities claim in late July that the Taiwan
question must be resolved with the consent of the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and that ties between the United States
and mainland China are in their best shape ever.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the statement made by U. S. Deputy Secretary
of State Richard Amitage to Director Chen Yunlin of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council about "the consent of
the people on both sides" represents a big change from the previous
stance of the United States, which had been "with the consent of the
Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>This indicates that Taiwan's space for self-determination has
been squeezed and the administration led by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party must not overlook this significant change or evade
its responsibility in the face of the deterioration in two-way
relations, Chang said.</P>
      <P>As to the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
that U. S.- mainland China ties are in their best-ever shape in
decades, Chang urged the government to pay adequate attention to this
viewpoint, which reflects an upgrading to an official stance from a
purely academic opinion in the past.</P>
      <P>At a time when Washington needs Beijing's coordination and help
to resolve the problems on the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan's use of a
populist approach to deal with its links with the United States will
not benefit Taiwan, he argued, warning that "it in turn will reduce
Taiwan's leverage in the triangular Taipei-Beijing-Washington ties."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOOSTING PUBLIC SPENDING BEST HEDGE AGAINST DEFLATION: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the commodity price index continuing
to fall over the past few months and Taiwan's Central Bank of China's
low-interest rate policy doing little to stimulate the interest of
private investors or consumers, several scholars believe that
boosting public spending might be the only way to ward off deflation.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) under the Cabinet reported Sunday that the commodity price
index in July stood at 98.8 with 1996 as the base year, indicating a
drop of 0.42 percent from that of June. In the first seven months of
this year, the commodity price index dropped by 0.28 percent as
compared with the same period of the preceding year.</P>
      <P>Forecasting negative growth in the consumer price index for this
year, the DGBAS said that Taiwan is still facing the threat of
deflation. In May the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that
Taiwan, Germany and Hong Kong were at risk of deflation.</P>
      <P>When faced with deflationary pressures, many countries seek to
apply a loose monetary policy as a stimulus to private consumption
and investment willingness, Professor Chu Hao-ming of National
Chengchi University said, adding that since the Central Bank of China
over the past few months has lowered the basic interest rates several
times, the low-interest rate monetary policy is losing its
effectiveness as a solution.</P>
      <P>The professor suggested that boosting public spending might be
more effective right now. However, with mounting public debt, the
government must spend the money on projects that can contribute
significantly to the nation, and not on quick-fix social welfare
schemes.</P>
      <P>He added that in the long run, the government needs to improve
the domestic investment environment by ensuring good infrastructure,
including water and electricity supplies, and making further
relaxations on regulations governing cross-Taiwan Strait trade.</P>
      <P>Chen Tien-chih, president of the Chung Hua Institute for Economic
Research, agreed that boosting public spending might be the only
resort for the government to avert deflation.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the worst situation would be that consumers might
speculate upon further price declines as the commodity price index
continues to go down. This would make it even more difficult for the
economy to rebound, he added.</P>
      <P>The scholar suggested that the government consider raising salary
levels of public servants. When the private sector follows suit,
commodity prices might gradually go up, as consumers' purchasing
power would be on the rise.</P>
      <P>As to investment willingness, Chen said that the serious overdue
loan problem of many local banking institutions has led to an ever
more conservative loan policy in Taiwan's banking system, and a rigid
capital market would weaken the interest of private investments.</P>
      <P>He said that the government should implement its monetary reform
and resolve the overdue loan problem as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Referring to the magnitude of public spending, Chen Po-chih,
chairman of the Taiwan ThinkTank, said that using a three-year plan,
at least NT$300 billion would be needed, and a five-year plan, at
least NT$500 billion.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that in case only an additional NT$20 billion to
NT$30 billion is set aside for public reconstruction projects, in
comparison with the annual government budget of NT$1.5 trillion, the
additional budget would be too small to have much effect on the
economy.</P>

(By S. C. Chang and EH)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economy of mainland China will
collapse sooner or later; therefore, it would be wise for businessmen
to stay away, since there will be no escape when the end comes, a
leading Taiwan economist said in New York Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-hsi, professor of economics at National Taiwan
University, made the remarks in his speech titled "Watch the World
Situation and Chinese Economy from Taiwan, " at a meeting of the
Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace in New York.</P>
      <P>He said the economic fundamentals of mainland China point to the
eventual collapse of the economy.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he has no intention of "talking down" the Chinese
economy, and that he has based his observations on the fact that many
big problems in mainland China have been left unresolved for a long
time. These unresolved problems will become even thornier and harmful
in the years to come.</P>
      <P>He said the unresolved problems lie in the rural economy, the
financial system, unemployment, uneven distribution of wealth,
political and institutional corruption, and moral bankruptcy.</P>
      <P>During the first stage of the "reform and openness" campaign
initiated by former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping between 1979 and
1996, China followed the steps of the Soviet Union in developing its
economy. Since then, the Chinese economy has been growing by at least
7 percent every year.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the economic prosperity in mainland China
is only superficial, and that Chinese economic statistics are often
unreliable.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reiterated his
commitment to holding a referendum before 2004 and his belief that
there is one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait in an meeting
with Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officials in Chiayi County,
southern Taiwan, Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as telling DPP officials in Chiayi that his
administration will take into account the opposition parties'
opinions and compromise on some issues, but will never compromise on
its claim that Taiwan and the mainland are separate countries on
different sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>That means the DPP administration will never accept Beijing's
claim that there is only one China made up of both the mainland and
Taiwan, Chen was quoted as saying in the closed-door meeting by DPP
Deputy Secretary-General Lee Chin-yung.</P>
      <P>"It is the bottom line we will stick to, " Chen reportedly told
the DPP officials.</P>
      <P>Citing Hong Kong as an example, Chen said six years after it was
handed back to Beijing, the former "pearl of the Orient" has lost its
luster and its people took to the streets to defend their freedom on
July 1.</P>
      <P>He also reiterated his promise to carry out the country's first
referendum by 2004 on at least two issues; whether the country should
join the World Health Organization and whether the partially built
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should be scraped.</P>
      <P>The president also blamed the country's media for their constant
criticism of his administration, branding it a practice not seen in
any other place in the world, especially the many talk shows on cable
stations, with anchormen "picking holes in everything done by the
government all day long and all week long, even on weekends."</P>
      <P>However, the president remained undaunted. Lee cited him as
telling DPP officials that "as long as we persevere in our pursuit of
democracy and freedom, the people will sympathize with us
eventually."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the
Ministry of Finance Kaohsiung Customs Bureau (MFKCB) have urged the
North Korean freighter "Be Gaehung" to willingly unload the 158
barrels of phosphorus pentasulfide on board before it leaves
Kaohsiung Port, shipping industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The MFKCB has decided to confiscate the chemical materials, which
are believed to be used for military purposes, the sources who asked
not to be identified said.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the phosphorus pentasulfide can be used for
producing rocket fuel.</P>
      <P>However, the agent of the North Korean ship at Kaohsiung argued
that the phosphorus pentasulfide is a general chemical product and
that the chemicals in question are registered as "commodities in
transit." The authorities have no reason to confiscate them, the
agent claimed.</P>
      <P>The 6,500-ton "Be Gaehung, " which arrived in Kaohsiung Harbor
Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand, is in Taiwan to unload some 2,000
metric tons of aluminum powder. It remains berthed in Kaohsiung

    <HEADLINE>NO FURTHER RESTRICTIONS IN WATER USE IN TAIPEI BY END OF AUGUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There will be no further restrictions in
water use for Taipei residents by the end of this month, but the
public should still cooperate in conserving water due to falling
water levels at major local reservoirs, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although rainfall last month registered record lows in northern
Taiwan, Ma said there will be no stiffer restrictions in water use
for residents in the greater Taipei area through August.</P>
      <P>"This year's situation has been a little better than last year's,
" Ma noted, despite the fact that it only rained a record low of 50
millimeters in July -- approximately one tenth of the year-earlier
level, in the water catchment area of the Feitsui Reservoir, the main
water supplier for the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, especially the northern regions, was hit hard by an acute
drought last year -- the worst in Taiwan's history. Amid scarcer
rainfall since the beginning of this year, a restrictive measure has
already been imposed in the greater Taipei area since early March
that consists of a reduction in water pressure during off-peak hours.</P>
      <P>July and August are traditionally rainy months for Taiwan, during
which approaching typhoons usually bring a large amount of rainfall
to the entire island.</P>
      <P>The water level of the Feitsui Reservoir dropped to 138.71 meters
as of 5: 00. p.m., a slide of 0.42 meters from the level posted at
1:00 a. m.</P>
      <P>The level is close to the 137-meter mark, which has been designed
by a national anti-drought task force as the point of which the
second-phase water restrictions begin -- a 20-percent reduction in
water supplies to large-volume users such as car washes, swimming
pools and saunas.</P>
      <P>The water level of the Shipmen Dam in neighboring Taoyuan County
has dipped to 216.07 meters, close to the extremely low level of 210
meters, prompting local authorities to warn the public that water
rationing will be implemented if no rain falls by the middle of this
month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu suggested Beijing Saturday to welcome Taiwan's
participation in the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner party hosted by overseas Chinese and
Taiwanese communities in Los Angeles in her honor, Lu said if Beijing
really cares about the health of the people of Taiwan, it should
openly announce that it welcomes Taiwan's participation in the WHO.</P>
      <P>To hold a referendum on whether Taiwan should join the WHO is to
show the world the determination of the island's people to join the
world's top health body, Lu stressed, expressing the hope that the
United States will support Taiwan's position on the issue.</P>
      <P>It will not be necessary for Taiwan to hold a referendum on the
island's bid to join the WHO if Beijing welcomes Taiwan's
participation in the world body, Lu continued.</P>
      <P>Lu also told the overseas Chinese and Taiwanese who were present
at the dinner party the progress made by President Chen Shui-bian's
administration in the economic, political and social fields over the
past three years although there still exists room for further
improvement.</P>
      <P>She urged the general public to give President Chen and the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party more time to implement their
reform programs and to build a better Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon from Hawaii on her

    <TEXT>
      <P>Through the joint efforts of police,
customs and immigration authorities, 12 stolen new Toyota Camry
sedans were shipped back from Singapore over the weekend, the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The CIB was tipped off in early July that a car theft ring was
planning to ship stolen cars to Thailand and Cambodia via Singapore
for sale.</P>
      <P>After scrutinizing a large pile of container loading documents,
shipping firms data and customs clearance reports, investigators
uncovered two containers holding eight brand new Camry cars at a
container terminal at the Keelung Harbor in late July.</P>
      <P>Through a further analysis of relevant documents, they concluded
that three other containers holding 12 stolen cars had been shipped
to Singapore's Keepel port.</P>
      <P>The CIB asked the Singaporean customs service to assist in
intercepting the containers. CIB and local customs officers then
traveled to Singapore to arrange for shipment of the cars back to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to CIB investigations, the 20 new Camry sedans were
stolen in Tainan, Taichung, Hsinchu and Taoyuan between July 4 and
July 9.</P>
      <P>As the car theft ring adopted a stringent division of labor
system, ring members responsible for stealing, container loading,
shipment and overseas sales didn't know each other. CIB officials
said they will investigate further to gain a better understanding of
the ring's operations and bring all of those involved to justice.</P>

(By Tseng Chun-liang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large Taiwan trade delegation, organized
by the Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI), is currently
in Beijing to push for an early realization of quick and convenient
cross-Taiwan Strait cargo transportation.</P>
      <P>The group, headed by CNFI Chairman Hou Chen-hsiung, arrived in
Beijing Sunday on the first-leg of its market-inspection visit to
mainland China that will also take it to other cities with large
numbers of Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of more than 40 senior industry
executives, is the first Taiwan trade mission to visit the mainland
since the waning of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which
afflicted both sides of the Taiwan Strait between March and June this
year.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to meet with top mainland Chinese leaders
Tuesday afternoon. Hou, who concurrently serves as a national policy
adviser to ROC President Chen Shui-bian, said he will take advantage
of the meeting to ask mainland authorities to adopt measures to pave
the way for speedy and convenient cross-strait cargo transportation.</P>
      <P>Following the containment of SARS, Hou said, cross-strait
commercial exchanges have regained momentum. Mainland China should
coordinate with Taiwan in improving cargo transport services between
the two sides, he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hou said he will urge mainland authorities to take
effective steps to better protect Taiwan businesspeople's property
and property safety. A spate of murders of Taiwan businesspeople
operating on the mainland earlier this year has led to widespread
concerns about mainland China's public order and safety measures.</P>
      <P>Hou's mission met with Beijing Mayor Qishan Monday morning, and
it will pay a courtesy call on Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Office under mainland China's State Council or Cabinet, later
in the day.</P>
      <P>The group will leave for Shanghai Wednesday to meet with Shanghai
municipal officials and Taiwan business community leaders in the
city. The group will also visit Nanjin and Kunshan before returning

    <HEADLINE>VEEP CALLS TAIWAN BEACON FOR MAINLAND CHINA'S DEMOCRATIZATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  Aug. 10 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu said in
Los Angeles Sunday that Taiwan is a beacon of hope for mainland
China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Lu, who arrived in L.A. Saturday for a three-day transit stop on
her way to Asuncion to attend the inauguration of Paraguayan
President-elect Nicanor Duarte on behalf of ROC President Chen
Shui-bian, made the remarks while meeting with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Calif.)</P>
      <P>Rep. Rohrabacher concurrently serves a co-chairman of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus -- a pro-Taiwan group in the U.S.
Congress.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan's existence can exert pressure on mainland China
to move toward democracy. She urged mainland Chinese leaders to
cooperate with Taiwan in pushing for peaceful cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges for the benefit of the people of both sides.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president also asked Beijing not to block
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>"Beijing should instead publicly welcome Taiwan's participation
in the WHO to substantiate its claim that it cares about the Taiwan
people's health and well-being," Lu said.</P>
      <P>She also expressed thanks to Rohrabacher for his staunch support
for Taiwan's cause over past years.</P>
      <P>Rohrabacher said he personally supports Taiwan's plan to hold a
referendum to signify its determination to join the WHO. He said the
U.S. government should offer more support for Taiwan and should not
sit idly by and let Beijing bully Taiwan's democratically elected
government.</P>
      <P>The influential Republican congressman from California's Orange
County said he plans to come up with an initiative urging the Bush
administration to invite Taiwan's president and vice president to
deliver speeches in the United States.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu paid a visit to the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library and Museum in the company of Chen Chien-jen, ROC
representative to the United States, and Therese Shaheen, chairwoman
of the American Institute in Taiwan -- the top U.S. liaison officer
to Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. first lady Nancy Reagan sent a letter to Lu extending
a warm welcome to Lu's visit to the Reagan library and museum.</P>
      <P>Nancy Reagan said in her letter that Taiwan contributed much to
the inauguration of the Reagan library and museum in 1991. She
expressed her heartfelt gratitude for Taiwan's support for the
project in recognition of her husband's career achievements. She
added that she believes Lu's visit will encourage more Taiwan people
to visit the library and museum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan donated funds for construction of the Reagan library and
museum which showcases many documents and photos featuring President
Reagan's eight years in the White House. Over the past decade, many
Taiwan political heavyweights and celebrities in various fields have
visited the library. Among the visitors have been former ROC
President Lee Teng-hui and his wife.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, Lu met with five members of the California
State House of Representatives, including Judy Chu, Mervyn Dymally,
Alan Lowenthal and Ronald S. Calderon. Lu's guests also included
California State House of Representatives Speaker Robert Hertzberg.
Lu exchanged views with Californian state lawmakers on a range of
issues of mutual concern. They also discussed measures to further
boost cooperation between Taiwan and the state of California.</P>
      <P>Lu will visit Irvine which maintains sisterhood ties with
Taiwan's Taoyuan County, of which Lu used to be magistrate, as well
as Broadcom, a California-based high-tech firm.</P>
      <P>Lu will leave for Panama for an official visit after having a
lunch meeting with the Irvine mayor Tuesday noon.</P>
      <P>While in Panama, Lu will meet with senior Panamanian officials to
discuss measures for further boosting bilateral cooperation.
Panamanian Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan Jimenez will honor
Lu by awarding her a medal.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the Paraguayan presidential inauguration
Aug. 15, Lu will deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and at
Asuncion University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <DATELINE>San   Francisco,   Aug.   10   (CNA)
(By Chiang Ying and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, deputy
secretary-general of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) ,
on Sunday reaffirmed that his party is confident about winning the
next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while speaking on the March 2004
presidential election at a summer camp for Taiwan people residing on
the west coast of the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although the DPP candidate lost in the recent
Hualien magistrate by-election, he is confident that the party will
win the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Some people view the Hualien election result as a harbinger of
the presidential election outcome. However, Lee noted that the
Hualien by-election was a local election and different from a
presidential election. He said the issues, electorate, and the
strategies to be employed will all be different.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the DPP needs to double its efforts over the next
seven months, saying that "economic prosperity, democratic
credentials and reform determination will be key points that
influence the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee also stressed that following Taiwan's legislative reform and
implementation of popular presidential elections, referendums are
inevitable in the island's democratization process, adding that a
referendum ought to be held prior to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ming-hsien, deputy Republic of China representative to the
United States, also spoke on the importance of Taiwan holding a
referendum.
He said that faced with mainland China's continuing efforts to
isolate it internationally, Taiwan has to bravely speak out on its
own and solidify its internal strength in order to achieve
international respect.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the Taiwan people could express their desire to
join the World Health Organization via referendum, and "let Beijing
see that its continued obstruction of Taiwan's WHO bid runs counter
to the wish of the Taiwan people."</P>

Monday.</P>
      <P>He said it has not rained for 49 days and the water in the nearby

week. Water supply to the city is already being restricted at night.</P>
      <P>Water supply to heavy users -- such as owners of saunas, swimming
pools, and public bathrooms -- will be reduced by 20 percent in
Taipei, beginning by the end of August. Water supply to industrial
districts will be reduced by 5 percent, but the supply to hospitals

      <P>Water supply to the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park will

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE TO EXCEED 3 PERCENT THIS YEAR: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday his
administration's economic stimulus drive has paid off, with the
domestic economy regaining momentum and expected to register 3
percent to 3.5 percent growth this year.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while presiding over the second meeting of
a presidential economic advisory panel headed by Vincent Siew, a
former premier and an incumbent vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research (CHIER).</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Chen said, all major domestic economic
indicators, ranging from export and import trade, financial market
indexes to private consumption, have shown signs of recovery.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, major local economic think
tanks forecast that this year's economic growth rate will exceed 3
percent and that the rate will be even higher next year.</P>
      <P>Chen said the higher-than-expected growth rate indicates that the
government's efforts to revitalize the economy and overhaul the
financial system have paid off.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Siew delivered a CHIER-prepared report on
Taiwan's agricultural modernization plan and another advisory panel
member, Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, reported on the nation's present economic situation and its
future development prospects.</P>
      <P>After listening to their reports, Chen gave several directives
for future government work, including phasing out unnecessary
restrictions on economic activities and capital flow to buoy the
nation's economic vitality and sharpen its overall competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government should release unused or seldom-used
land and other resources for more efficient use, accelerate
infrastructure construction, step up banking reforms, establish free
trade harbor zones and build high-quality recreational facilities to
boost tourism.</P>
      <P>As for the much-anticipated agricultural modernization, Chen said
Taiwan must pay more heed to "species, quality and brand" in
agricultural and fishery production.</P>
      <P>"The government should help local farmers and aquaculture
operators in selecting high value-added species or strains for
cultivation and breeding and build up unique brand names for their
products," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) has brought both challenges and opportunities, Chen said the
government should pool its resources with farming groups and academic
institutes in developing biotechnologies to upgrade competitiveness
of local agricultural and fishery industries.</P>
      <P>Through joint efforts of county governments, local universities
and agricultural and fishery associations, Chen said, several unique
cluster production areas, such as the Pingtung tropical agricultural
park, the Changhua floral industry park, the Tainan orchid farm and
the Ilan marine resources park, have gradually taken shape.</P>
      <P>"All these clusters are a model for our future agricultural
development, " Chen said, adding that agricultural production must be
associated with research, entrepreneurship and tourism to
reinvigorate rural development.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration will contribute more funds and
energies to helping farmers and fishermen establish computerized
databanks on farm produce and fishery products production and
consumption as well as modernize marketing, warehousing and
distribution services.</P>
      <P>As the first step, Chen said, the government will select orchids,
wax apples and mangoes as "flagship" products to be subject to
intensified export promotion.</P>
      <P>Other members of the advisory panel, including Taiwan Thinktank
Chairman Chen Po-chih and CHIER President Chen Tien-chih, also
attended the meeting. Other participants included Vice Premier Lin
Hsin-i, National Security Council Secretary-General Kang Ning-hsiang,

      <P>The current drought in northern Taiwan will have no bearing on
the park for the time being, Hsu said, but if there is still no rain
by the end of September, then the team will begin to map out plans to
deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>On whether it would be possible to transport water from southern
Taiwan, Hsu said that one water transport vehicle can only carry 30
tons. Judging from the fact that there are 20 eight-inch and 12-inch
wafer plants in the park, that would mean that 3,000 tons of water
would have to be sent daily. This would not be economically feasible,
he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that water shortages have yet to be a problem in the
park, but with the economic rebound and companies in the park
expanding their production capacities, water could be a problem
someday. He urged the government to address the issue by exploring
for new water sources for the park.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUBERCULOSIS MOST SERIOUS COMMUNICABLE DISEASE IN TAIWAN: CDC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The incidence of tuberculosis is declining
in Taiwan, but it is the island's most serious communicable disease
partly because of local people's ignorance of the malady, an official
with the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to tallies released by the DOH's Center for Disease
Control (CDC) , a total of 1,277 local residents died from
tuberculosis last year, making the disease the island's 12th-largest
cause of death for the year.</P>
      <P>In four administrative districts -- Taitung County, Keelung City,
Kaohsiung City and Changhua County, tuberculosis ranked among the top
10 killers for their residents last year.</P>
      <P>CDC statistics also showed that the death rates for tuberculosis
patients were the highest in Taitung County, Hualien County, Pingtung
County and Changhua County, in descending order.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, the CDC's deputy director, said both death and
incidence rates of tuberculosis have fallen steadily in Taiwan in the
past few decades.</P>
      <P>But he acknowledged that the rate of infection of the disease
might increase due to local people's ignorance of the disease and
patients' failure to complete six months of medication required to
beat the disease. Those who stop medication prematurely pose a threat
to tuberculosis prevention and control as they could develop a
resistance to tuberculosis-fighting drugs and spread the disease,
Shih said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a media report that the outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) between March and June this year might
worsen the island's tuberculosis situation as many patients dared not
visit hospitals during the period, Shih said the report was
speculative.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed that the CDC has stepped up efforts to fight
against tuberculosis. "There has not been any delay in our
tuberculosis-fighting programs," he said, adding that the installment
of many negative pressure isolation wards at local hospitals during
the SARS period can now be used to accommodate tuberculosis patients.</P>
      <P>According to CDC tallies, Taiwan's tuberculosis incidence rate
was 10 times higher than that in the United States in 2001 and double
that recorded in Japan in the same year.</P>

whatever decision the Control Yuan may reach about a flight control
mishap at the dual use military-commercial Tainan Airport in southern
Taiwan in March this year, a spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>James Huang, director of the Presidential Office's Public Affairs
Department, was responding to a media report that the nation's
supreme watchdog body will hold a meeting Tuesday to decide whether
to impeach Huang Chai-tien, the incumbent deputy head of the

      <P>Huang Chai-tien was the leader of the Air Force's Tainan-based
443 Wing when the incident took place. The Tainan Airport is under
the jurisdiction of the 443 Wing.</P>
      <P>In March, a TransAsia passenger plane clipped an airport
engineering vehicle after landing at the Tainan Airport. Although the
impact didn't cause serious damage nor casualties, it exposed flaws
in airport safety controls.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan, which overseas government operations, formed an

According to the media report, all the team's six members have
reached a consensus on impeaching Huang Chai-tien for the flawed
airport safety control.</P>
      <P>Huang Chai-tien was promoted to his current post May 1. James
Huang said President Chen Shui-bian didn't give any instruction after

    <HEADLINE>RESERVOIRS TAKE IN LITTLE OR NO WATER DESPITE RAINFALL IN NORTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Much-expected precipitation which fell
Monday afternoon in northern Taiwan did not bring relief to the
parched region since the rain did not add to local reservoirs, a
spokesman for the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said.</P>
      <P>As a result, a national task force under the economics ministry
formed in March to address the drought issue will meet Thursday to
decide whether to mandate stiffer measures in the greater Taipei and
Keelung areas.</P>
      <P>The heavy rain Monday afternoon did not fall on the catchments of
the region's major reservoirs and contribute little or nothing to
their water levels.</P>
      <P>If significant rain does not fall in the coming days, third-phase
restrictions -- water rationing according to districts -- may be
imposed in the Keelung area by Aug. 20, while second-phase measures
may be put in place for the greater Taipei area by the end of this
month. The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park will be spared from
this wave of water conservation efforts.</P>
      <P>Although it rained heavily Monday in the greater Taipei area --
102.5 millimeters in Gunguan in downtown Taipei and 92 millimeters
in Hsintien in Taipei County -- the Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei
County took in only four millimeters, while the Shihmen Dam in
Taoyuan County received a mere 6.6 millimeters. The Hsinshan
Reservoir in Keelung was completely missed by the showers.</P>
      <P>Residents in the greater Taipei, Taoyuan and Hsinchu areas have
been bracing for the first of a four-phase set of water conservation
measures since March 6 -- a reduction in water pressure during
off-peak hours. Keelung residents began the second-phase of measures
last Friday -- a 20-percent reduction in water supply to large-volume
users such as car washes, swimming pools and saunas.</P>
      <P>Northern Taiwan was plagued by an acute drought in the first half
of last year-- the worst in the island's history. However, the dry
spell continues to threaten the northern regions this year, with
Keelung, a port city traditionally famous for its rainy weather,
going through 51 rainless days as of this afternoon.</P>
      <P>As the situation at major local reservoirs has not improved, WRA
officials urged the public to do their part to prevent a water
shortage by cooperating to conserve water.</P>
      <P>As of 10: 00 a. m. Monday, the water level of the Feitsui
Reservoir stood at 138.72 meters, close to the extreme warning level
of 117.5 meters. The Shihmen Dam's level was 215.88 meters, less than
six meters from its dangerously low level of 210 meters.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 24-year-old Indonesian man who
suffered from a severe spinal deformity is able to walk erect again
thanks to a successful operation last month at a military hospital in
Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang Kao-wha, director of the International Spine Center at
Armed Forces Taichung General Hospital, performed the surgery on the
Indonesian man, born of a Indonesian father and a Taiwanese mother.</P>
      <P>Before the surgery, the young man was seriously deformed and
stood 140 cm tall, but after the surgery he was nearly restored to
his previous height of 180 cm, hospital sources said.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the surgery set two world records: the
implant of 26 of the longest (6.5 cm) and widest (0.7 cm) pins and
the greatest improvement in height -- a 38-cm enhancement.</P>
      <P>The patient, from Surabaya, Indonesia, was 180 cm tall before he
got sick and diagnosed six years ago with ankylosing spondylitis (AS)
, which is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by pain and
progressive stiffness. He became more and more hunchbacked until he
stood only 140 cm and could barely walk.</P>
      <P>The patient first went to Singapore to have hip joint surgery,
spending a lot of money without seeing any improvement. He also went
to Beijing and Sichuan for treatment, but all to no avail.</P>
      <P>The patient then learned about the excellent spine correction
techniques at Armed Forces Taichung General Hospital and came to
Taiwan July 7.</P>
      <P>He was operated on for six hours July 11. He was able to leave
his bed and walk three days later. He returned to Indonesia Aug. 5
after making a full recovery. The medical bill came to less than
NT$500,000 (US$14,483).</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang said that AS is a hereditary disease and Chinese are
more prone to the disease than other peoples. Generally speaking, the
rate is about 0.1 percent for Chinese, and men are more likely to
suffer from AS than women.</P>
      <P>As patients usually can't prevent or treat the disease by
drinking milk and food, and the only way to ease the pain is to do a
lot of stretching exercises very often to slow the bone
deterioration, he added.</P>

      <P>Operations of the cross-Taiwan Strait
off-shore transshipment center at the Kaohsiung Port in southern
Taiwan are gradually improving as a result of growing indirect trade
between Taiwan and mainland China, a spokesman for the Kaohsiung
Harbor Bureau said Monday.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait off-shore transshipment center, set up by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications at the port to fuel
two-way exchanges in the lack of direct trade and transportation
links, has dealt with a total of 2.64 million containers since its
operations in April 1997, the spokesman said, adding that it handled
over 362,000 containers in the first seven months of this year, up by
12.5 percentage points from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, Taiwan's largest port, was allowed to conduct the 20
weekly freight runs in connection with the Xiamen and Fuzhou ports in
mainland China's Fujian province to transship products from the
mainland to a third country or area.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwan-based shipping companies, including Evergreen Marine
Corp. (Taiwan) Ltd. and Yangming Marine Transport Corp., are
authorized to exchange services with various mainland-based
counterparts. Taiwan's shipping sector has repeatedly suggested the
mainland authorities to make Guangzhou, Dalian and Shanghai available
for the service.</P>

      <P>The China Times said CAL preferred to purchase Rolls Royce's
engines for its 12 Airbus A330-300s but was told by authorities to
order the engines from U.S. manufacturers General Electric or Pratt

      <P>Economic advisors to President Chen
Shui-bian proposed Monday that the government should take measures to
promote exports of Taiwan's agricultural products, according to
officials of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The officials said after a meeting between Chen and members of
his economic advisory panel that the advisors suggested the
government establish an organization similar to the China External
Trade Development Council (CETRA) to promote exports of the country's
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>They also suggested the government provide credit guarantees for
agricultural products export loans based on export orders and that
credit guarantees be operated by a proposed national agricultural
bank.</P>
      <P>It is a pressing need for Taiwan's agricultural development to
establish an effective marketing and distribution network to solve
the enduring problem of the imbalance between supply and demand
facing the agricultural sector, the officials quoted the advisors as
saying.</P>
      <P>In addition, they said, the modernization of Taiwan's agriculture
should be commercialized, globalized and knowledge-based.</P>
      <P>On commercialization, the advisors proposed that the government
help farmers transform their conventional farming ways and means into
modernized business operations and help them acquire farm lands while
simplifying the application for establishing agricultural production
facilities.</P>
      <P>On globalization, they proposed the establishment of an
export-oriented agricultural production system in which large-scale
agricultural enterprises will be the core of marketing and
distribution of agricultural products.</P>
      <P>On knowledge acquisition, the advisors recommended the government
help farmers conduct research and development into new agricultural
products and to post the latest information on new species and on
related markets on the government's Web site, facilitating farmers to
get new technologies and information they need.</P>
      <P>The presidential economic advisory panel is headed by Vincent
Siew, a former premier and an incumbent vice chairman of the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LABORERS WON'T BENEFIT FROM HIGHER TAXES ON RICH: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Higher taxes on the rich will only lead to
capital flight and will not benefit Taiwan laborers, a legislator of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Cho-hsui made the remarks in the wake of a suggestion by the
Alliance of Fairness and Justice that the government reimpose a
"capital gains" tax on the rich so as to balance the tax burden
between entrepreneurs and average workers.</P>
      <P>The "pan purple alliance," a new association grouping nine social
welfare organizations in Taiwan which was formed Sunday, aims to
speak for the underprivileged, including those who are becoming
disadvantaged because of social injustice.</P>
      <P>Due to globalization, Lin said, enterprises have the ability to
shift to anywhere in the world to obtain the best profits. If Taiwan
imposes higher taxes on the rich, they will flock to other countries,
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization is widening the gap between rich and
poor around the world, Lin said that any country that tries to tackle
this problem single-handedly will face difficulties.</P>
      <P>"The alliance aims to help Taiwan's laborers, but it could end up
making the lives of laborers more miserable," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun, commenting on the suggestion for
hgiher taxes the previous day, also said that it is not "feasible."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU SLAMS 'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' FOR BLOCKING 'LOYALTY CHECK' BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
legislative caucus slammed the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) Tuesday for stonewalling the
passage of a "national loyalty check" bill.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the TSU caucus said the two major opposition parties
pushed for amending the existing civil servant employment law in 2002
to delete the provision requiring loyalty checks for all government
employees.</P>
      <P>The TSU caucus claimed that the "pan-blue alliance's" moves have
created holes in the nation's security system and left room for
mainland Chinese agents to infiltrate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TSU caucus was responding to its KMT and PFP counterparts'
recent criticism of National Security Council (NSC) Secretary-General
Kang Ning-hsiang for employing a person with alleged business
interests in mainland China to serve as his personal aide.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" said Kang's employment of Chang Pei-chen
to provide counseling in mainland economic affairs could lead to the
leaking of Taiwan's classified information to mainland authorities.</P>
      <P>Chang, who had devoted herself to research on the mainland
economy for 20 years at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research before she joined the NSC this April 1, resigned from her
NSC post last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Her resignation came after a local newspaper reported that her
husband had used her name to set up a company in Hong Kong which
cooperated with the business arm of mainland China's Ministry of
Railways in operating land development deals in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Chien-Lin Huei-jyun said at a news
conference Tuesday that Chang's case as well as the alleged
involvement of a middle-rank technician at the military-run Chungshan
Institute of Technology and Science in a ring that spied for mainland
China have exposed problems in the nation's security system.</P>
      <P>Chien-Lin said the "pan-blue alliance" which controls more than
half of the seats in the legislature is to blame for the loose
security checks conducted on the nation's civil servants.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the TSU came up with a basket of draft bills
in May 2002 with a view to tightening protection of military
intelligence and other national secrets. The package included a
national loyalty bill, an intelligence agency neutrality and
supervisory bill, and a national intelligence supervision bill.</P>
      <P>However, Chien-Lin said, the KMT and the PFP had boycotted
screening of these bills. For instance, she said, the two parties had
17 times stonewalled the transfer of the TSU-drafted national loyalty
bill to the legislature's Legal Affairs Committee for deliberation.</P>
      <P>Without the enactment of this bill, Chien-Lin said, government
agencies cannot conduct stringent loyalty checks on would-be civil
servants.</P>
      <P>"It's hypocritical of KMT and PFP lawmakers to criticize the NSC
for its failure to conduct loyalty checks on Chang Pei-chen, "
Chien-Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>She urged the two main opposition parties to support the passage
of the TSU-drafted national loyalty bill in the new legislative
session set to open in September.</P>
      <P>In response, KMT legislative whip Lee Chia-chin said his party
support loyalty checks on officials involved in national security
affairs. "However, we are opposed to loyalty checks on other civil
servants. This stance remains unchanged," Lee said, adding that
security officials must be subject to stringent loyalty checks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOLEN CAR DETECTION SYSTEM TO BE INSTALLED ON ROADS NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new system that detects stolen vehicles
on roads will be installed around the island next month to help stem
the serious problem of car theft.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Police on Tuesday unveiled the "electronic police"
system which will sound an alarm signal whenever the license plate of
a stolen car being driven on the road is spotted.</P>
      <P>Chen Ying-chieh, an information official of Taipei County Police,
said that the system can detect cars driving at speeds of up to 200
km per hour, adding that the system's accuracy rate is up to 95
percent.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the system, which will be installed at road
intersections, will be able to detect within 0.6 seconds the license
plates of cars that are listed in the stolen car data bank of the
National Police Administration.</P>
      <P>Police officer Chang Chia-ming said that the system will operate
in tandem with traffic lights.</P>
      <P>He explained that the license plates of cars passing along the
road will be shown on monitors at police stations. Whenever a plate
that is listed in the stolen car data bank is spotted, an alarm
signal will sound, and the car type, color and license plate number
will be displayed. Traffic lights in the vicinity will then
immediately turn red, giving police time to race to the location and
intercept the car and driver.</P>
      <P>While reviewing the new system, Minister of the Interior Yu
Cheng-hsien said that the problem of car theft and the ensuing
extortion of the original car owners has caused much resentment among
ordinary citizens. He expressed the hope that the new system will
help in the crackdown on car thieves.</P>
      <P>Car and motorcycle theft has become a nightmare for vehicle
owners in Taiwan, with statistics showing that 50,000 cars and more
than 200,000 motorcycles were reported stolen in 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA RULES OUT INTERFERENCE WITH CAL'S PURCHASE OF AIRCRAFT ENGINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs won't
interfere with China Airlines' (CAL's) purchase of engines for its
new aircraft, a senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih said the ministry has conveyed the
concerns and opinions expressed by the British and American
representative offices in Taipei about CAL's aircraft engine
procurement plans to relevant Taiwan government agencies.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Shih said, the MOFA has not meddled in CAL's
decision-making process.</P>
      <P>"We respect CAL's decision based on commercial and professional
evaluations, " Shih said, adding that the MOFA hasn't had any role in
CAL's decision-making process.</P>
      <P>Since CAL's aircraft engine procurement plan was unveiled, Shih
said, the British and U.S. representative offices have on many
occasions expressed their concerns about the plan.</P>
      <P>"They have expressed their hopes that their companies would be
given equal opportunities in a fair and just competition for CAL's
order, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks a day after British representative to
Taipei Derek Marsh and E.U. representative to Taipei Brian McDonald
jointly called on President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff, Chiou
I-jen, to express concerns that British jet engine builder Rolls
Royce was being unfairly shut out of CAL's aircraft engine deal.</P>
      <P>Chiou refused to talk about what transpired in his talks with the
two European officials.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman James Huang said last evening that
the Presidential Office won't interfere with the deal. "CAL can
decide what engines will best serve its interests," he added.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, CAL originally planned to purchase
Rolls Royce's engines for its 12 Airbus A330-300s but later decided
to order engines from U.S. manufacturers General Electric or Pratt
and Whitney because it would have to pay an additional US$20 million
in aircraft airworthiness certification fees should it use Rolls
Royce engines.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Airbus informed CAL last week that it will
have to pay the engine certification fee if it wants to use Rolls
Royce's TREND768 engine. Currently, only Indonesia's national
airlines uses this type of engine. If CAL decides to use the TREND768
engine, it will have to obtain U.S. and E.U. certification, and it
will have to foot the certification bills, Airbus reportedly told
CAL.</P>
      <P>CAL debunked all media reports about its engine deal as
groundless speculation. "The deal is still under discussion, and no
final decision has been reached yet," a spokesman said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said Tuesday
that the current administration has indeed attached greater
importance than the previous administration to the balanced
development of northern and southern Taiwan, but added that it still
falls short of the people's expectations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in the wake of media reports that Tainan
City Mayor Hsu Tien-tsai blasted the central government for only
"paying lip service" to narrowing the gap between northern and
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that compared with the previous administration,
President Chen Shui-bian's administration has indeed paid more
attention to southern Taiwan, but it "still falls short of the
expectations of the people in southern Taiwan, " adding that "it is
also true that we have higher expectations."</P>
      <P>He noted that the central government has talked about a balanced
development of southern and northern Taiwan, but the problem is that
the southern and eastern parts of Taiwan have been ignored for so
long that even if equal treatment is given to all parts of Taiwan, it
still is not fair to some areas.</P>
      <P>Citing the allocation of government revenues as an example, Hsieh
said that Taipei received NT$1.3 billion (US$37.68 million) this
year, while Kaohsiung received NT$900 million. He said that although
this may seem fair on the surface, his city is about to start
construction on a mass rapid transit system and a tap water
improvement project, while other major projects such as shifting part
of the railway system underground and several performing arts center
projects are planned.</P>
      <P>Noting that all these projects will require large amounts of
money, Hsieh said that "overall, the amount of the government

      <P>The MSCI has applied the LIF in Taiwan as an instrument to
reflect market restrictions and obstacles to foreign investment.
Currently, the MSCI applies to LIF of 0.55 to the free float-adjusted
market capitalization of all constituents in the MSCI Taiwan Index.</P>
      <P>While the MSCI is scheduled to announce changes to the MSCI
Standard and Small Cap Index Series, the MSCI Global Value and Growth
Index Series on Wednesday, analysts of the Jih Sun Securities Co.
said that four electronics stocks -- Chunghwa Telecom, Nanker,
Sunplus and EZfone -- are likely to be selected as additional
constituents to the MSCI Taiwan Index.</P>
      <P>Out of the 91 issues included in the MSCI Taiwan Index, 38 are
electronics stocks.</P>
      <P>The analysts said that the MSCI weightings adjustment would
stimulate foreign investors' interest and induce a capital flow into
Taiwan's stock market.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that at the end of 1997 when South Korea
announced its intention to allow foreign investors having higher
percentage of company shares, from 50 percent to 55 percent, MSCI
announced on Feb. 5, 1998 to elevate the weightings of the South
Korea Index constituents and the market capitalization factor (MCF)
applied to the free float-adjusted market capitalization of the
constituents were elevated from 0.5 to 1.</P>
      <P>The South Korea stock market enjoyed a brisk season during the
period between the government announcement of relaxing market
regulations and the MSCI weightings adjustment, according to the
analysts.</P>
      <P>Judging from the comparable development of Taiwan's stock market
and that of South Korea's, the analysts foresee an investment zest in
the issues of the Taiwan Stock Exchange, especially the weighted
stocks in the MSCI Taiwan Index and the newly added constituents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PANAMA VISIT AIMED AT CEMENTING BILATERAL TIES: ROC VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Aug. 11 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu arrived
in Panama City Monday for a three-day official visit aimed at
cementing relations between the Republic of China and Panama.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by a 43-member entourage, Lu flew into the Panamanian
capital from Los Angeles to a warm welcome from senior Panamanian
officials, ROC Embassy staff and executives of major Taiwan trade
associations in Panama.</P>
      <P>Lu said aboard a chartered plane taking her from Los Angeles to
Panama City that she hopes her visit to Panama can help consolidate
bilateral diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>With the number of mainland Chinese immigrants to Panama
increasing rapidly in recent years, Lu said the Chinese community
population structure has undergone significant changes. At the
moment, Panama has about 80,000 mainland Chinese immigrants and
50,000 ethnic Chinese while the number of new immigrants from Taiwan
is only about 300.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lu said, Taiwan must step up efforts to
boost exchanges and cooperation with Panama. President Chen Shui-bian
originally planned to make a state visit to Panama in June, but his
travel plans will be postponed to later this year as Taiwan was
gripped by severe acute respiratory syndrome between March and June.</P>
      <P>With a view to enhancing bilateral ties, Lu said President Chen
asked her to make a brief visit to Panama on her way to Paraguay to
attend its new president's inaugural ceremony on Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>Lu will meet with Panamanian Vice President Dominador Kaiser
Bazan Jimenez Tuesday for wide-ranging talks. Bazan will honor Lu by
awarding her a medal. Lu will also meet with Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso and attend a ceremony marking the completion of a
Taiwan-financed facelift of the building that houses Panama's
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Before coming to Panama, Lu made transit stops in Hawaii and Los
Angeles where she met with American lawmakers and state and city
officials to discuss a range of topics.</P>
      <P>After the Panama visit, Lu will fly to Asuncion to attend the
Paraguayan presidential inauguration Aug. 15. While there, Lu will
deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and at Asuncion
University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

that the mainland fishermen also tried to control his movements.
Huang added that he's now returning to Taiwan for fear of his life.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed the hope that Taiwan would send a rescue vessel.</P>
      <P>The Coast Guard vessel spotted the "Chinhaifu No. 12" at 5: 40
a.m. and found the captain and the crew safe. The military escorted
the ship back to Kaohsiung Harbor for further questioning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST HALF BUSINESS REVENUES OF HI-TECH PARK GROW 11 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.   12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business revenues of the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan -- the country's
Silicon Valley -- hit NT$368.4 billion in the first half of this
year, up by 11 percent over the year-earlier level, the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park Administration reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Despite the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
in March through May, operations of the six industries based in the
park were not affected in the first six months, administration
officials said, adding that the park's business turnover could reach
between NT$800 billion and NT$850 billion (US$24.7 billion) for the
whole of 2003.</P>
      <P>Of the six major hi-tech industries with shops in the complex,
the IC sector registered a business revenue of NT$245.4 billion in
the first six months, accounting for 66.6 percent of the park's total
and representing a 14 percent increase year-on-year. The high
contribution rate made the IC industry the leading driver of the
park's development.</P>
      <P>The optoelectronic industry posted 23.7 percent growth, while the
telecommunications and biotechnology increased by 5.4 percent and 8.9
percent, respectively. Computer peripherals and the precision
machinery sector also expanded by 2.6 percent and 4.4 percent,

    <DATELINE>Tainan,  Taiwan,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has successfully cloned a
dairy cow, which is now five months old, the Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung said at a news conference held at the
COA's Taiwan Livestock Research Institute (TLRI) in Tainan County's
Hsinhua township in southern Taiwan that it marks a step forward in
Taiwan's cloning technology development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has successfully cloned goats and pigs, but this is the
first time the island has succeeded in cloning a dairy cow. In
September 2001, the TLRI cloned a calf with birth defects, which
survived for only six days.</P>
      <P>The newly cloned calf, named Ju-yi, was cloned from ear-derived
somatic cells of an adult Dutch dairy cow raised on a ranch in the
southern county of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Ju-yi was delivered by Caesarian section May 22. At the birth,
the cloned cow had a urinary problem. The situation was corrected
surgically on the 38th day after her birth.</P>
      <P>TLRI researchers said Ju-yi is now more than 140 centimeters tall
and weighs 145 kilograms. The clone eats feed and grass.</P>
      <P>Lee said cloning from somatic cells marks an important milestone
in the development of biotechnology. "It's like a key to a brave new
world," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the technology used in cloning dairy cows could
eventually be applied to improving livestock species, creating
genetically modified livestock, breeding endangered animal species
and even be used in clinical medicine.</P>
      <P>The TLRI successfully cloned twin dairy goats -- Paochi and
Paohsiang -- last year. The clones have been growing well and
celebrated their first birthday last month.</P>

two state-run corporations which have turned from debt-laden

      <P>Huang didn't reveal the names of the two state-run companies.</P>
      <P>The president and his entourage will also visit two private

    <HEADLINE>U.S. LOOKS FORWARD TO SMOOTH ROC 2004 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Aug.  11 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu said
Monday the United States looks forward to seeing the top leaders of
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait exercise self-restraint to ensure
a smooth proceeding of the island's 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks aboard a chartered plane taking her from Los
Angeles to Panama for a three-day official visit.</P>
      <P>During her transit stops in Hawaii and Los Angeles, Lu said, she
had met with a number of American politicians, including Hawaii
Governor Linda Lingle, Sen. Daniel Akaka, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, Rep.
Hilda Solis and Los Angeles Deputy Mayor Joy Chen.</P>
      <P>Lu said she feels that American authorities are rather concerned
about Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum, the Taiwan Strait security
situation, Taiwan's arms procurement plans and its presidential
election next year.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Bush administration is fully aware why President Chen
Shui-bian is determined to hold a referendum on certain public issues
before or on March 20, 2004 -- the next presidential election day.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said, the United States hopes that Taiwan can
abide by the rule of law. Therefore, Lu urged Taiwan's
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to pass a referendum bill as
early as possible to set detailed terms for holding a referendum and
avoiding any possible adverse impact on Taiwan's political stability.</P>
      <P>While the United States calls for self-restraint of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait in the run-up to Taiwan's next presidential
election, Lu said she has taken advantage of her talks with American
officials and lawmakers to push the Bush administration to adopt
"preventive diplomacy" and not to give Beijing any excuse to take
action against Taiwan during the campaign period.</P>
      <P>Lu said she had assured U.S. politicians that both President Chen
and herself will be prudent in dealing with cross-strait affairs.
"Both the president and I have endured hardships in promoting
Taiwan's democratization. We are responsible. We treasure Taiwan's
hard-won democratic achievements," she stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the United States is very concerned about
Taiwan's security and hopes Taiwan can upgrade its defense
capabilities. "They said Taiwan should be more pragmatic in arms
procurement, with the goal of withstanding a first strike by
Beijing," Lu said.</P>
      <P>She went on to say Taiwan-U.S. relations have made significant
progress in the past few years.</P>
      <P>"Since I assumed the vice presidency more than three years ago,
this was the third time that I made transit stops in the United
States. In the past, I could only stay one day in a U.S. city and the
number of ROC expatriates allowed to greet me was restricted to no
more than 30. This time, I was able to stay for two to three days in
each city and hundreds of overseas Chinese were allowed to meet me.
At a dinner party in Los Angeles, our national flag as well as the
U.S. national flag flew at the venue and on the dinner tables. All
these are signs of improvement in our bilateral relations," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu added she believes when President Chen makes transit stops in
the United States on his overseas travel later this year, he will
receive even better treatment.</P>
      <P>Before leaving California for Panama City Monday afternoon, Lu
visited Irvine, California, which maintains sisterhood ties with
Taiwan's Taoyuan County, of which Lu used to be magistrate, as well
as Broadcom, a California-based high-tech company.</P>
      <P>Three U.S. federal congressmen -- Reps. Christopher Cox, Loretta
Sanchez and Marilyn N. Musgrave -- sent representatives to read
welcome letters to greet Lu when she arrived at the Irvine City Hall.
She later held a lunch meeting with the city's mayor.</P>
      <P>While in Panama, Lu will meet with senior Panamanian officials to
discuss measures for further boosting bilateral cooperation.
Panamanian Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan Jimenez will honor
Lu by awarding her a medal.</P>
      <P>After her three-day visit in Panama, Lu will leave for Asuncion
to attend the Paraguayan presidential inauguration Aug. 15. She will
also deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and at Asuncion
University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

      <P>Taiwan authorities' seizure of a batch of
chemicals on board the North Korean freighter "Be Gae Hung" in
Kaohsiung Port, southern Taiwan, was legitimate, officials of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The chemicals have been identified as phosphorus pentasulfide,
which is listed as a strategic high-tech commodity (SHTC) and should
be controlled according to the law, the officials explained.</P>
      <P>North Korea is listed by Taiwan as an area where SHTCs should be
controlled. The consignee of the phosphorus pentasulfide should have
applied with the BOFT in advance for transit permission through
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although the chemicals in question are registered as "commodities
in transit, " Taiwan authorities decided to seize them because the
consignee failed to complete the legal process, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will discuss with various government agencies as soon as
possible to decide how to deal with the detained chemicals, which are
stored in a warehouse at Kaohsiung Harbor, they said.</P>
      <P>The 6,500-ton "Be Gae Hung, " arrived in Kaohsiung Harbor
Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand to unload some 2,000 metric tons of

      <P>He confirmed a report of the Control Yuan, Taiwan's supreme

      <P>Huang explained that during talks with Dassault, the aircraft
manufacturer requested that the ROC Air Force pay the amount as "good

requested by French negotiators in July, 1992, Huang said. He refused

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
never told U.S. authorities that Chen would never again describe the
current state of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as "one side, one
country," a ruling party official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chung-hsin, who concurrently serves as director
of the China affairs department of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , was responding to media reports that Chiou I-jen,
secretary-general to the president, had assured U.S Deputy Secretary
of State Richard L. Armitage that President Chen will not ruffle
Beijing's feathers again by mentioning the "one side, one country."</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, who accompanied Chiou on his recent trip to
Washington, D.C., said Chiou's visit was mainly aimed at exchanging
views with American officials on a range of issues of mutual concern,
including Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on certain public issues
before or on March 20, 2004 -- the next presidential election day.</P>
      <P>"Throughout our meetings with relevant U.S. officials, including
talks with Armitage, we never touched on the so-called 'one side, one
country' topic," said Chen Chung-hsin.</P>
      <P>President Chen used the term "one side, one country" to describe
the current cross-strait relations for the first time in his speech
delivered to the annual meeting of the pro-independence World
Federation of Taiwanese Associations in Tokyo last year via
satellite. His speech drew broadsides from Beijing.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong-based satellite television channel claimed last week
that Armitage said in an interview with its correspondent in
Washington July 31 that Taiwan had assured him that President Chen
will not mention the "one side, one country" statement again.</P>
      <P>According to the transcription of Armitage's interview with the
Hong Kong TV channel provided by the American Institute in Taiwan,
Chen Chung-hsin said, Armitage had not raised the so-called "one
side, one country" issue in the interview.</P>
      <P>"The transcription didn't contain anything regarding 'one side,
one country,'" Chen Chung-hsin stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's official title is the Republic of China and
the other side of the Taiwan Strait calls itself the People's
Republic of China, Chen Chung-hsin said President Chen's description
of "one side, one country" reflects the stark reality of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"As the ROC's head of state, President Chen must defend the ROC's
dignity and status," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STIFFER WATER CONSERVATION MEASURES MULLED FOR NORTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents in Taipei, Keelung and Taoyuan in
northern Taiwan may soon face harsher water conservation measures if
significant rain does not fall in the coming days, Water Resources
Agency Director Chen Shen-hsien said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said a consensus has been reached among relevant government
agencies that the second of a four-phase, anti-drought measures may
begin in the greater Taipei area by the end of this month when the
water level of the Feitsui Reservoir falls to 131 meters, while the
third-stage measure will begin in the Keelung area on Aug. 20, if
rainfall does not contribute to catchments before then.</P>
      <P>The second-phase restriction is also expected to be imposed in
the Taoyuan area when the water level of the Shihmen Reservoir drops
to 210 meters, he added, pointing out that it is only less than six
meters away from this dangerously low level.</P>
      <P>According to the fourth-phase set of measures devised by a
national task force set up in early March by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs to tackle a possible drought, the first-phase measure sees a
reduction in water pressure during off-peak hours, and the second
stage will curtail supply for large-volume users such as car washes
or swimming pools.</P>
      <P>The third phase will see water rationing according to district,
while the fourth phase will provide limited amounts of water only
during certain hours for the general public and industrial use.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the water catchment of the Feitsui Reservoir -- the
main supplier for the greater Taipei area -- took in 30 millimeters
of rainfall Tuesday evening, thanks to torrential afternoon rains the
last two days, especially the precipitation which fell Tuesday
afternoon in the catchment.</P>
      <P>The water level of the Feitsui Reservoir stood at 138 meters as
of 8: 00 p.m. and is holding only 31.9 percent of its total capacity,
the Taipei Feitsui Reservoir Administration Bureau statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Bureau Director Kang Shih-jen said the rainfall contributed to
the largest single-day level increase at the reservoir since June 21.
It helped bring in around six million tons of water for the
reservoir, or about three-day's consumption for the greater Taipei
area.</P>
      <P>The recent sparse rainfall has been useless toward ending the
current dry spell. The only hope left is typhoons, which usually
bring plenty of rain to Taiwan in the June-September rainy season,
Kang added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Water Department announced that water
rationing will start first from Wednesday for Yangmingshan and Peitou
in suburban Taipei, affecting more than 2,700 households in the
neighborhood for a lack of mountain spring and underground water --
the major sources for the two mountainous districts.</P>
      <P>Department Director Kuo Jui-hua said it rained only 37
millimeters in Yangmingshan since June until now, a dramatic slide
from 900 millimeters posted during the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, water supplies for central and southern Taiwan will
remain normal through October after the landing of Typhoon Imbudo
early this month, which brought large amounts of rainfall to the
region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT STICKS TO STATEMENT ABOUT TAIWAN'S SEPARATION FROM CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian stuck to his
assertion that there is one state on each side of the Taiwan Strait
Tuesday, although his view was challenged by a member of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Presiding over a meeting of the DPP, of which Chen is the
chairman, the president said his statement about Taiwan's status
might not be the theme of his presidential campaign in 2004, but it
is the bottom line of the DPP and neither he nor his party would
renounce the concept.</P>
      <P>The president's "one state on each side" is a keynote of his 2004
presidential campaign, whereby Chen has declared that the election
will be a clash between the followers of mainland China's "one China"
principle and those of Chen's ideology.</P>
      <P>His declaration was criticized by his fellow party member,
Legislator Chang Chun-hung, who said the statement will doom Chen's
campaign instead of boosting his popularity.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Tuesday's DPP meeting, Chang said Chen's statement
was out of date and would not appeal to the public because it offers
them no vision.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. LAUDS TAIWAN FOR SEIZURE OF CHEMICALS ABOARD N. KOREAN FREIGHTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department lauded Taiwan
Tuesday for forcing the North Korean freighter "Be Gae Hung" to
unload a batch of a controlled chemical before allowing it to leave a
Taiwan port for North Korea.</P>
      <P>State Department deputy spokesman Philip Reeker said during a
regular press briefing that the chemical, identified as phosphorus
pentasulfide, could have been used to make chemical weapons if
transported to North Korea.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan authorities seized 158 barrels of phosphorus
pentasulfide from the vessel at Kaoshiung Harbor in southern Taiwan
several days ago, adding the case is being investigated.</P>
      <P>Reeker commended Taiwan's efficient action in stopping materials
from being transporting to arms proliferators.</P>
      <P>The 6,500-ton "Be Gae Hung" arrived in Kaohsiung Harbor last
Thursday from Bangkok, Thailand, to unload batches of chemical
materials, including aluminum powder.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Customs Bureau (KCB) officials asked to inspect the "Be
Gae Hung" after being informed by U.S. intelligence authorities that
the North Korean freighter might be carrying a batch of dangerous
chemicals which could be used as materials in the production of
nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The freighter's captain, surnamed Kim, refused the KCB officials'
request, forcing the KCB to detain the "Be Gae Hung" to conduct a
search.</P>
      <P>During their search, KCB officials discovered the 158 barrels of
phosphorus pentasulfide, which had been listed by the ship's captain
as "commodities in transit."</P>
      <P>KCB officials said their seizure of the chemical was legitimate,
noting that phosphorus pentasulfide is listed as a strategic
high-tech commodity (SHTC) subject to controls according to
international law.</P>
      <P>North Korea is listed by Taiwan as an area subject to SHTC
controls. The consignee of the phosphorus pentasulfide should have
applied with the Bureau of Foreign Trade in advance for transit
permission through Taiwan, KCB officials said.</P>
      <P>Although the phosphorus pentasulfide was registered as
"commodities in transit, " the KCB decided to seize the batch because
the consignee failed to complete the legal process, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will discuss the issue with various government agencies
as soon as possible to decide how to deal with the detained
phosphorus pentasulfide, which is being stored in a warehouse at
Kaohsiung Harbor, they said.</P>
      <P>The vessel was allowed to leave for North Korea Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PANAMANIAN PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Aug.  12 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso
reaffirmed her support for the Republic of China Tuesday while
meeting with ROC Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Moscoso told Lu that she had pledged support for the ROC on her
first day in office. "I'll uphold this commitment until the last day
of my term (Aug. 31, 2004)."</P>
      <P>According to the Panamanian Constitution, Moscoso cannot run for
a second consecutive term. But Moscoso said she is convinced that her
successor will continue to maintain formal diplomatic relations with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Moscoso is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Aug. 21 for a state
visit. During her stay, she will sign a free trade agreement with ROC
President Chen Shui-bian to further boost trade and economic
cooperation between Taiwan and Panama.</P>
      <P>Panamanian Second Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan will also
head a delegation to visit Taiwan in September, and President Chen is
scheduled to make an official visit to Panama in early November. All
these exchanges of visits of high-level officials attest to the
cordial ties between the two countries, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu expressed concerns about Panamanian First Vice
President Arturo Vallarino's plan to visit mainland China later this
month.</P>
      <P>In response, Moscoso said it won't be Vallarino's first trip to
mainland China. Moscoso said she had advised Vallarino not to visit
the mainland as he is Panama's vice president.</P>
      <P>"Vallarino told me he will visit the mainland in his private
capacity, " Moscoso said, adding that she has expressed her stance on
Vallarino's travel plan and must respect his personal will.</P>
      <P>Moscoso further said Lu's concern about Vallarino's mainland
travel plan is understandable. But she stressed that Panama has long
been supportive of the ROC and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
      <P>The Panamanian head of state said she will clearly explain her
country's stance on maintaining formal diplomatic ties with the ROC
when she visits Taiwan next week.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Lu came up with a proposal that Taiwan and
Panama jointly operate a farm to tap the international agricultural
market, with Panama providing land and manpower and Taiwan offering
biotechnology and technicians.</P>
      <P>Moscoso threw her full support behind Lu's proposal, saying she
hopes this project can be realized during her tenure.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu gave interviews to Panamanian news media
and toured the Panama Canal and a folk culture center. Panamanian
Vice President Bazan hosted a luncheon in honor of Lu and presented
her with a medal in recognition of her contribution to promoting
Taiwan's democratization and its relations with Panama.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday morning, Lu and Bazan also jointly presided over a
ceremony marking the completion of a Taiwan-financed face lift of the
building that houses Panama's Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by a 43-member entourage, Lu arrived in Panama City
Monday for a three-day official visit after transit stops in Hawaii
and Los Angeles where she had met with many U.S. politicians.</P>
      <P>Lu told Taiwan reporters covering her current overseas journey
that she hopes her visit to Panama can help consolidate bilateral
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>With the number of mainland Chinese immigrants to Panama
increasing rapidly in recent years, Lu said the Chinese community
population structure has undergone significant changes. At the
moment, Panama has about 80,000 mainland Chinese immigrants and
50,000 ethnic Chinese while the number of new immigrants from Taiwan
is only about 300.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lu said, Taiwan must step up efforts to
boost exchanges and cooperation with Panama.</P>
      <P>After the Panama visit, Lu will fly to Asuncion to attend the
Paraguayan presidential inauguration Aug. 15 on behalf of President
Chen. Lu will also deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and
at Asuncion University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese writing format for official
documents in Taiwan will gradually be changed to the standardized
horizontal left-to-right format over the next three years, the
Executive Yuan reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Wednesday passed an amendment to
regulations governing the standard form for official documents,
authorizing the change from the current vertical right-to-left
writing format.</P>
      <P>The change is being made to cope with the increasing prevalence
of computers and to come into line with the international trend in
writing style, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
drafted the official document format alteration plan in May in
response to Premier Yu Shyi-kun's calls early this year for the
government to gauge whether to introduce the horizontal left-to-write
writing style for official documents as he said the style is an
international trend.</P>
      <P>Yu said the question of whether to use the left-to-right or the
right-to-left style in the horizontal format has been an issue in
Taiwan for quite some time. He added that as the government is
promoting the use of English and as some official documents are
written both in Chinese and in English, a standard horizontal Chinese
writing style is necessary.</P>
      <P>A standardized horizontal official writing style is expected to
have an influence on private publications, Executive Yuan officials
said.</P>
      <P>The vertical right-to-left writing style had been the main style

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu flew into
Chicago from Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon for the second leg of his
week-long U.S. visit aimed at attracting more investment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier, while in southern California, Lin and his entourage
visited Gateway Inc., a direct retailer selling its own brand
consumer electronics, in San Diego, as well as Simax Technologies
Inc., a manufacturer of high accuracy electro-optics alignment
components, in Irvine. Both companies have plans to expand their
trade activities with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gateway president Ted Waitt disclosed that the company will boost

Gateway is also planning to set up a product development center in
Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>At the Simax headquarters, Lin was told by a company executive

    <HEADLINE>REFORM HOLDS KEY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
sweeping reform holds the key to economic success.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after heading a delegation of
editors-in-chief of local news media to tour two state-owned
companies in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, both of which have
witnessed a remarkable turnaround in their fortunes over the past
three years through extensive corporate restructuring.</P>
      <P>Noting that reform and economic prosperity were the keynotes of
his campaign platform back in the 2000 presidential election, Chen
said the turnaround of Tang Eng Iron Works Corp. and China
Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) serves to prove that reform is the
cornerstone of economic success.</P>
      <P>Chen said he chose the two state-owned enterprises as the first
stops of his current two-day round-the-island tour mainly to enable
local media executives to see for themselves his administration's
achievements in economic reform over the past three years.</P>
      <P>When he took office in May 2000, Chen recalled, only five of the
nation's 12 state-owned enterprises were in the black. Tang Eng and
the CSBC were the most deeply in debt, with each of them burdened
with a debt of more than NT$11 billion.</P>
      <P>"Through corporate restructuring, overhauling of management,
staff downsizing and productivity upgrading, the two corporations
have turned from debt-laden money losers to profit-making
enterprises, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the CSBC earned more than NT$350 million last
year, and its earnings are expected to exceed NT$360 million this
year, while Tang Eng posted a profit of NT$410 million in 2002, and
its 2003 earnings are forecast to hit NT$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>"All these figures attest to the success of our reform efforts, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The CSBC has received orders for building 42 vessels of various
types for local and overseas customers. Its production line has been
fully booked until the second quarter of 2007.</P>
      <P>The president and his entourage were scheduled to visit two
private companies in central Taiwan in the afternoon -- one from a
labor-intensive industry, and the other employing hi-tech workers --
which have heeded the president's call by keeping their roots in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two-day tour itinerary also includes a visit to Wuji Station
of the high-speed railway in central Taiwan, which is still under
construction, to give journalists a glimpse into the future Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The tour will give the public, through the country's media, a
clear view of the government's achievements, which are often clouded
by partisan politics in the Legislative Yuan, a Presidential Office
spokesman said a day earlier.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND-PHASE WATER RATIONING COULD BE POSTPONED: WATER AGENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The implementation of second-phase water
rationing measures in the greater Taipei area could be postponed to
early September, thanks to torrential afternoon rains over the past
several days, the Water Resources Agency reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Torrential afternoon rain showers on Tuesday allowed the water
catchment of the Feitsui Reservoir -- the main supplier for the
greater Taipei area -- to take in 57.9 millimeters of rainfall in a
single day, greatly easing water shortage pressure in Taipei City,
Water Resources Agency officials said.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's 57.9 millimeters of rainfall -- which brought in some
13 million metric tons of water into the Feitsui Reservoir -- was the
second highest single-day level of rainfall this year, and the
highest since June 15, according to Feitsui Reservoir Administration
Bureau officials.</P>
      <P>The Feitsui Reservoir water catchment is expected to take in
about the same amount of water Wednesday following an afternoon
shower, the bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
reached a consensus with relevant agencies recently that the
second-phase water conservation measures will be imposed in the
greater Taipei area if the water level at the Shihmen Reservoir drops
to 210 meters or the water level at the Feitsui Reservoir falls to
130 meters.</P>
      <P>With limited rainfall in northern Taiwan since mid-June, the
Water Resources Agency had expected that the second-phase water
rationing measures would likely be imposed by the end of August.</P>
      <P>Luckily, the torrential rainfall over the past three days in
northern Taiwan has significantly alleviated water shortage pressure
and thus helped push back the schedule of the second-phase water
rationing measures, Water Resources Agency officials said.</P>
      <P>The water catchment of the Shihmen Reservoir took in 10.3
millimeters of rainfall Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the torrential afternoon rainfall over the past several
days has greatly quenched the dry spell, whether sufficient and
sustainable water levels at the Feitsui Reservoir can be maintained
will depend on whether rains are brought by seasonal typhoons,
Feitsui Reservoir Administration Bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, water supplies for central and southern Taiwan will
remain normal through October after the landing of Typhoon Imbudo
early this month, which brought large amounts of rainfall to the
region.</P>
      <P>The Water Resources Agency temporarily ruled out the possibility
of having water from central Taiwan transported to Taipei, as some
people have suggested, in consideration of distance and other
inconveniences, the Water Resources Agency officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO MANY GRADUATE SCHOOLS OF SUBSTANDARD  QUALITY: LEGISLATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of institutes offering graduate
studies has increased from 841 in 1998 to the current 1,904, and
quite a few of these institutes are under-staffed, Legislator Cheng
Jhen-long said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The legislator also said that the academic standards of many
institutes is questionable. According to his report, 195 graduate
institutes have no more than three full-time teachers each.</P>
      <P>He added that it is not rare to find that an institute with only
two or three full-time teachers has admitted dozens of graduate
students.</P>
      <P>While the tuitions of graduate schools are relatively high, in
comparison with the nation's per capita income, Cheng said there is
no justification for many graduate schools to provide low-quality
education at such high costs.</P>
      <P>Saying that some universities have made their graduate schools
diploma-mills, Cheng called on the Ministry of Education to review

    <HEADLINE>FBI OFFICIALS TO VISIT TAIWAN TO LOOK INTO ESPIONAGE CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) will send staff members to Taiwan to look into an alleged
defense technology espionage case that involved a Chinese-American
engineer, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsui Sheng-hsiang, deputy director of the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB), made the remarks at a public hearing on
national security, organized by opposition People First Party
Legislator Chin Hui-chu.</P>
      <P>Tsui said U.S. authorities are rather concerned about the MJIB's
recent raid on a ring that allegedly spied for mainland China. Three
suspects -- Chen Shih-liang, a technician at the military-run
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology (CIST) in northern
Taiwan; Hsu Hsi-tse, a U.S. citizen of Chinese origin who once worked
at Boeing Co.; and Yen Yu-chen, the owner of a private company --
have been arrested on charges of espionage and treason.</P>
      <P>The ring was suspected of having hacked into a U.S.
government-owned Internet Web site to steal classified military
files, particularly those related to F-16 jet fighter's nighttime
combat equipment and its command and control datalinks. Taiwan has
bought 150 F-16s.</P>
      <P>Worse still, the ring was accused of having counterfeited the
CIST's "end-user certificates" for Hsu to purchase sophisticated
strategic night-vision equipment for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsui said the case is still being investigated. "Investigations
won't be closed until after all suspicious points are clarified and
all relevant data is collected," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States is concerned about the case, Tsui
said FBI headquarters will send at least three staff members to
Taiwan to collect first-hand information. Moreover, he said, the U.S.
Department of Justice may also send officials to Taiwan for similar
purposes.</P>
      <P>According to Tsui, the FBI agents may arrive in Taiwan later this
week.</P>

(By F. C. Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China poses the biggest threat to
peace in the Asia-Pacific region because it is a hegemonic regime
which has no respect for freedom, peace and human rights, Su
Chin-chiang, an advisor of the Repubic of China National Security
Council (NSC) said in Bangkok Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while giving a keynote speech on Taiwan's
values at a forum sponsored by the branch of the Global Alliance for
Democracy and Peace in Bangkok, the last leg of his Southeast Asian
tour, which also brought him to destinations in Indonesia and
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The Chinese communist regime, which possesses a strong military
power, may wage war against Taiwan, posing a great threat to regional
peace, Su said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the people of Taiwan do not look for war, Su said
what lies ahead for the Taiwan people to decide is whether they are
willing to accept mainland Chinese rule. That has nothing to do with
the independence-unification problem, he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan's plans to hold a referendum on the fate of the
disputed Fourth Nuclear Power Plant and the need to join the World
Health Organization, Su said a referendum to allow the people to
decide the course of public polices is a normal practice of human
rights in a democratic society.</P>
      <P>It is immoral to smear the government's referendum plan, Su
criticized, and pointed out what is awful are the factors behind the
opposing side. They are against Taiwan's democratization, he argued.</P>
      <P>Su is slated to leave for Taiwan Thursday.</P>

(By Neil Lu and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's permanent representative to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday reaffirmed the island's
position of supporting the expansion of markets for non-agricultural
products but called for a grace period to new WTO members in lowering
their tariffs.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang made the remarks at a meeting for WTO delegation
chiefs, which formed part of the frequent negotiations held in Geneva
prior to the annual WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in Cancun,
Mexico, in early September.</P>
      <P>WTO member countries are deliberating on a proposal submitted by
the United States, the European Union and Canada for big reductions
in tariffs in the highest tariffs ranges as part of the current round
of trade liberalization negotiations, a suggestion which is said to
be more beneficial to developed countries.</P>
      <P>The U.S. delegation in Geneva is seeking Taiwan's support by
arranging meetings with Taiwan's WTO delegation to explain their
proposal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, a major exporter of industrial products, will generally
benefit from big reductions in tariffs on goods among member
economies.</P>
      <P>Although supporting the expansion of markets for non-agricultural
products in global trade, Yen stressed that any proposal should
consider the special needs of new members; therefore, Taiwan
maintains the position that new members should be given a longer
grace period to implement the results of the new round of trade
talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials of Taiwan's WTO delegation said that the big
 task for Taiwan is to protect its "sensitive industries" while
 expanding its export market.</P>

take wind out of his sails in the campaign.</P>
      <P>As to the Executive Yuan's proposal to give voters two ballots in
the next election for legislators, one for a candidate and one for a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has yet to flesh out all
details regarding a much-anticipated reform of the nation's
Legislative Yuan, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Lin Chia-lung was responding to a newspaper
report that the Cabinet has drafted amendments to the existing
Election and Recall Law which will allow voters to cast two votes in
next year's legislative election while the current constituencies
will not be subject to any adjustment.</P>
      <P>Lin said the report was not correct. "The so-called 'two-votes,
no constituency adjustment' formula is only one of the many options
being discussed," he explained.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Lin said, the Cabinet is still working on an
amendment package to the Election and Recall Law of the "single seat
constituency and two-vote" principle.</P>
      <P>The draft revisions are still subject to discussion by a panel
composed of officials from various ministries and agencies, Lin said,
adding that the draft bill must be approved by the legislature before
it can be implemented.</P>
      <P>As for the proposed 50 percent cut of the number of legislative
seats, Lin said, that would require amendments to the ROC
Constitution.</P>
      <P>"Given all these factors, we simply cannot predict at this moment
whether a new electoral system can be adopted for next year's
legislative election," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) to support a
proposal to hold an extraordinary legislative session to deal with
legislative reform bills and relevant constitutional amendment
proposals.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Chen Chi-mai said the DPP supports the
proposals to halve the number of legislative seats and adopt a
"single seat constituency and two-votes" legislative election
formula.</P>
      <P>According to the Additional Articles of the ROC Constitution, the
Legislative Yuan has 225 members. Any reduction in the number of
seats will require an amendment to the Additional Articles of the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP's call, PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said
the "pan-blue alliance" will come up with a comprehensive legislative
reform package, including to the electoral system, legislative
disciplinary regulations and relevant "sunshine bills, " in September
or early October to improve the legislature's operational efficiency

    <DATELINE>Panama City, Aug. 12 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu said
Tuesday that Panama's ruling and opposition parties have all
promised to further upgrade relations with the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a dinner party hosted by the Panamanian
government in her honor. Panamanian Second Vice President Dominador
Kaiser Bazan, many other Panamanian officials, parliamentarians and
social celebrities, including Ruby Moscoso, the elder sister of
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, attended the party to welcome Lu
and her entourage.</P>
      <P>Lu said the ROC and Panama have a longstanding relationship
because the two countries have shared values in promoting freedom,
democracy, human rights and gender equality.</P>
      <P>During her meeting with the Panamainan president earlier
in the day, Lu said Moscoso has reaffirmed her firm support
for the ROC. "Moscoso told me that she had pledged support
for the ROC on her first day in office and will uphold this
commitment until the last day of her term (Aug. 31, 2004)," Lu
said, adding that Moscoso has also promised to take active steps
to further boost cooperation with Taiwan during her tenure.</P>
      <P>Lu said all of the three hopefuls intending to run for the
Panamanian presidency have also promised to strengthen ties with
Taiwan should they win the election.</P>
      <P>According to the Panamanian Constitution, Moscoso cannot run for
a second consecutive term. Moscoso said she is convinced that her
successor will continue to maintain formal diplomatic relations with
the ROC.</P>
      <P>Moscoso is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Aug. 21 for a state
visit. During her stay, she will sign a free trade agreement with ROC
President Chen Shui-bian to further boost trade and economic
cooperation between Taiwan and Panama.</P>
      <P>Panamanian Second Vice President Bazan will also head a
delegation to visit Taiwan in September, and President Chen is
scheduled to make an official visit to Panama in early November. All
these exchanges of visits of high-level officials attest to the
cordial ties between the two countries, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by a 43-member entourage, Lu arrived in Panama City
Monday for a three-day official visit after transit stops in Hawaii
and Los Angeles where she met with many American politicians.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday morning, Lu gave interviews to Panamanian news media
and toured the Panama Canal and a folk culture center. Panamanian
Vice President Bazan hosted a luncheon in honor of Lu and presented
her with a medal in recognition of her contribution to promoting
Taiwan's democratization and its relations with Panama.</P>
      <P>EArlier in the day, Lu and Bazan also jointly presided over
aceremony marking the completion of a Taiwan-financed face lift of
the building that houses Panama's Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Lu told Taiwan reporters covering her current overseas journey
that she hopes her visit to Panama can help consolidate bilateral
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>With the number of mainland Chinese immigrants to Panama
increasing rapidly in recent years, Lu said the Chinese community
population structure has undergone significant changes. At the
moment, Panama has about 80,000 mainland Chinese immigrants and
50,000 ethnic Chinese while the number of new immigrants from Taiwan
is only about 300.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lu said, Taiwan must step up efforts to
boost exchanges and cooperation with Panama.</P>
      <P>After the Panama visit, Lu will fly to Asuncion to attend the
Paraguayan presidential inauguration Aug. 15 on behalf of President
Chen. Lu will also deliver speeches at the Paraguayan parliament and
at Asuncion University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DIPLOMAT SAYS REFERENDUM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 12 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy representative to the
United States, Tsai Ming-shian, stressed on Tuesday that holding
referendums is one of the basic human rights of the people of Taiwan
and it has nothing to do with Taiwan's independence or possible
unification with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who made the remarks in a radio interview on the "Voice of
America," said Taiwan plans to hold a referendum on or before the day
of the next presidential election -- March 20, 2004 -- on three
topics -- the fate of the island's partially completed Fourth Nuclear
Power Plant, Taiwan's bid to enter the World Health Organization, and
the downsizing of the country's legislature.</P>
      <P>He noted that the referendum is to allow the world, especially
Beijing, to hear the voice of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about media reports from mainland China that criticized
Taiwan's holding of a referendum as only a way to gradual introduce
Taiwan independence, Tsai said the Republic of China on Taiwan is
already an independent country with sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China are two sovereign countries as were
East Germany and West Germany before their unification, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that it is unreasonable and unfair that mainland
China, which has not governed Taiwan for even a single day, has
repeatedly tried to force the island to accept Beijing's definition
of "one China" and its "one country, two systems" formula, which has
been shown to be a failure in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, ROC President Chen Shui-bian has said on many
occasions that Taiwan can open talks on any topic with mainland
China, including cross-strait economic and trade cooperation, or even
political integration, as long as Beijing does not impose
preconditions on the talks.</P>
      <P>After the exclusive interview, Tsai, who also received call-in
questions from mainland Chinese, said he hopes that mainland people
can one day express their opinions through referendums like Taiwan
people will be able to.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Police led by a prosecutor searched an
electronics company in Taipei Wednesday to try to retrieve a batch of
central processing units (CPU) stolen from Intel, but came away
empty-handed.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip-off from U.S. law enforcers, police officers from

and questioned its owner. There was no sign, however, of the 50,000

(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian predicted
Wednesday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will gradually
resume talks and exchanges in all aspects after next March.</P>
      <P>Chen told a group of editors in chief of local media who are
accompanying him on a two-day tour around Taiwan that Beijing's
insistence on its "one China" principle is the reason for the current
cross-strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>Over the past years, he emphasized, many reliable surveys have
showed that an overwhelming majority of the people in Taiwan back the
principles of equality, security and dignity in cross-strait
exchanges and that the "one China" principle is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Noting that his assertion of "one country on each side of the
Taiwan Strait" is a description of cross-strait reality, he explained
that the official designation of Taiwan is the Republic of China and
the other side of the Taiwan Strait calls itself the People's
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>There exists no room for Taiwan to accept the "one China"
principle and "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" will be
an unavoidable topic that every candidate for next year's
presidential election will face in his campaign. Candidates will have
to clearly express a stance on the issue, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Beijing should adjust its position toward Taiwan if it wants to
resume normal cross-strait exchanges, Chen added, saying that he
believes that mainland Chinese leaders will gradually understand
Taiwan's position on this issue and will eventually deal with
cross-strait affairs in a pragmatic manner.</P>

Wednesday the resignation of First Holding Company Chairman Chen

stepping down.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Lin said Chen submitted his

that he had completed his mission at the company and that it was time
to move on to "personal career projects."</P>

resignation has nothing to do with the company's recent issuing of

abroad, which was harshly criticized for allegedly trying to benefit
a vested group at home.</P>
      <P>Lin denied the accusation and hailed Chen's efforts and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday
that he had confidence in the relations between Taiwan and the United
States, saying that relations are the best they have been in more
than two decades.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while speaking with editors in
chief of news media in Changhua, central Taiwan after the first full
day of a two-day trip dubbed "witting the progress of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The president noted that though there are differences between
Taiwan and the U.S., communication channels between the two sides
have been open, although he couldn't elaborate on some points.</P>
      <P>The president cited as an example the recent visits of Chiou
I-jen, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, and other
ranking officials to the U.S, saying such visits are "significant."</P>
      <P>"I'm satisfied with this pattern of contact and dialogue, " he
added.</P>
      <P>He said, "Relations between Taiwan and the U.S. are the best they
have been since 1979, including the exchanges and cooperation in the

the past to imagine that there would be such close relations."</P>
      <P>There is tacit agreement and consensus between Taiwan and the

he said, adding that he has every confidence in the relationship.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, he said, "Though there are criticisms,
many things are not as bad as you may imagine, " adding that Taiwan
has been relentlessly squeezed diplomatically, but "many things that
happened before aren't happening now."</P>
      <P>He said that the government has adopted a "cautious" attitude to
handling cross-strait relations, and the bottom line is to "stand
fast to one's stance and move forward pragmatically."</P>
      <P>He stressed that without the persistent efforts of this

that some have said that the government had no experience in dealing
with cross-strait relations when it was inaugurated in 2000, but he

    <HEADLINE>CHEN UNVEILS THREE STEPS TOWARDS DIRECT TRANSPORTATION LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who has resisted
opening direct transportation links with mainland China on Beijing's
terms, unveiled a three-step program Wednesday towards creating these
links.</P>
      <P>Speaking with a group of editors in chief from local media in
Changhua Wednesday night, the president said the three steps are
preparation, negotiation and realization.</P>
      <P>The first step is already going on, the second step of
negotiation will begin after the presidential election on March 20,
2004; hopefully, the third step will be realized sometime before the
end of 2004, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that surveys show 75 percent of the people in Taiwan
believe direct transportation links should be launched only on the
basis that Taiwan's safety is guaranteed and its dignity is
preserved, the president warned that the government is trying to
prevent any negative impacts from the direct links, such as the
flight of local capital, hi-technology and skilled technicians to the
mainland, and a surge in the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>A detailed assessment of the impacts will be included in a report
to be released by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) in a couple of
days, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the current absence of negotiations between Taiwan and
mainland China, the president said a practical substitute for direct
shipping links is a way to speed up the indirect shipping links
between Taiwan and the mainland which could be done by Taiwan on its
own.</P>
      <P>Details of this measure will also be revealed by the MAC in a
couple of days, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president also reiterated his claims that there is one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait, and that Taiwan is a
country separate from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Changhua Wednesday night for an overnight stop on
his two-day trip around the island with a group of editors in chief
of local media.</P>
      <P>The MAC is slated to make public its report about direct
transportation links with mainland China on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen's direct links declaration immediately drew fire from the
opposition Kuomintang. The party's whip at the Legislative Yuan, Lee
Chia-chin, dismissed Chen's statement as lip service intended to woo
the support of Taiwan businessmen operating in the mainland.</P>
      <P>"If he really believes direct transportation links will serve
Taiwan's interests, he should take action to realize it now.
Otherwise, he should keep resisting it even after the presidential
election," Lee said in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia gave
conditional support to the president's declaration on the links, but
warned that the links should be opened only as international ones
between country and country, and when Taiwan's safety and dignity is
duly preserved.</P>

campaign; rather, he wants to search for one who will be a valuable
member of his future ruling team.</P>
      <P>Although he made no secret of his ambition to run for
re-election, the president said he has not yet been named by his
Democratic Progressive Party as its candidate for the 2004
presidential race, and is not in a position to pick any running-mate.</P>
      <P>"I am not in a hurry; hopefully others will not be in a hurry

that Taiwan's economy has to move toward more liberalization and it

businessmen couldn't have the preferential treatment in the mainland,

    <HEADLINE>PANAMA SHOULD SAY 'NO' TO BEIJING: LU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,  Aug.  13 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu on Wednesday called for the Panamanian government to say
"no" to Beijing whenever the mainland Chinse regime makes
unreasonable requests to Panama.</P>
      <P>Solid and sustainable relations between nations are not based
simply on interests, Lu said, noting that it is more important for
two nations to maintain ties based on common principles and values.</P>
      <P>Panama's maintaining of friendship with the ROC on Taiwan is in
line with the interests of the Panamanian people, Lu said, adding she
believes that whoever is elected the next president of Panama in the
future will value and further strengthen bilateral relations between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks prior to her departure for Paraguay after a
three-day official visit in Panama, during which she met with
Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso and had cordial and pleasant
conversations. Lu said Moscoso told her that she had pledged support
for the ROC on her first day in office. "I'll uphold this commitment
until the last day of my term (Aug. 31, 2004)."</P>
      <P>According to the Panamanian Constitution, Moscoso cannot run for
a second consecutive term. But Lu said Moscoso told her that she is
convinced that her successor will continue to maintain formal
diplomatic relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Moscoso is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Aug. 21 for a state
visit. During her stay, she will sign a free trade agreement with ROC
President Chen Shui-bian to further boost trade and economic
cooperation between Taiwan and Panama, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Panama, Lu also met with her Panamanian
counterpart, Panama's Second Vice President Dominador Kaiser Bazan.
Bazan hosted a luncheon in honor of Lu and presented her with a medal
in recognition of her contribution to promoting Taiwan's
democratization and its relations with Panama.</P>
      <P>The two jointly presided over a ceremony marking the completion
of a Taiwan-financed face lift of the building that houses Panama's
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Bazan will also head a delegation to visit Taiwan in September,
and President Chen is scheduled to make an official visit to Panama
in early November. All these exchanges of visits of high-level
officials attest to the cordial ties between the two countries, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>During a tour of the Taiwan-Panama Cultural Center in Panama
City, Lu appealed to all members of the Taiwan communities in Panama
to throw their support behind President Chen Shui-bian for a second
term in office.</P>
      <P>Lu and her 43-member entourage left Panama City at noon Wednesday
for Asuncion to attend the Paraguayan presidential inauguration Aug.
15 on behalf of President Chen. Lu will also deliver speeches at the
Paraguayan parliament and at Asuncion University.</P>
      <P>On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP PRESIDENTIAL AIDE FORESEES BETTER CROSS-STRAIT TIES NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A top aide to President Chen Shui-bian said
Thursday that relations between Taiwan and mainland China will be
better after the presidential election next year.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, Presidential Office secretary-general, made the
remarks when he elaborated on President Chen's talks on "three steps"
toward direct transportation links with mainland China the previous
day.</P>
      <P>The president said the three steps are "preparation, negotiation
and realization," adding that the first step is already going on, the
second step will begin after the presidential election set for March
20, 2004, and the third step will be realized sometime before the end
of 2004.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that the president, based on four reasons, is sure
about the further development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The first reason is that the president is sure of his re-election
next year, saying that Beijing, regardless of whether it likes a
president from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , which has in
the past advocated a pro-independence stance, will have to deal with
him for another four years, according to Chiou.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the president said that cross-strait relations have
been going on smoothly over the past three years, adding that
although verbal exchanges may be tense, cross-strait relations have
in reality seen more progress during his administration than during
the previous administration of the Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chen noted that his administration has done everything it can
within its power to improve cross-strait relations, saying that it
has implemented 17 related measures, or almost one new measure every
two months, since coming to power. He cited the examples of direct
links between the Taiwan-controlled offshore islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and two ports in the mainland province of Fujian, as well as
working rights for mainland Chinese women married to Taiwan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Chiou said, Beijing and Taipei under the Chen
administration, after more than three years of dealing with each
other, have accumulated some experience in this regard.</P>
      <P>Although the "one country" principle cherished by Beijing has
hindered the development of cross-strait relations, he said, the two
sides have actually had close enough contacts with each other to be
able to see the completion of aviation agreement talks between Taiwan
and Hong Kong and to conduct illegal mainland immigrant repatriation
operations, among other things.</P>
      <P>Lastly, Chiou said, mainland China has also been making some
adjustments in dealing with the DPP-led government in Taiwan. For
example, Beijing originally insisted that the issue of direct
cross-strait transportation links was an "internal matter, " but last
year, the then mainland Chinese vice premier, Qian Qichen, used the
term cross-strait routes in referring to the direct transportation
links.</P>
      <P>Chiou concluded by saying that he is certain Beijing will not do
or say anything in the DPP's favor before the presidential election,
and as a result, it is unlikely there will be any dramatic
improvement in cross-strait relations prior to the election.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that he DPP is confident that after the
presidential election next year, cross-strait relations will only
turn for the better.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT PREPARED FOR OPENING OF DIRECT TRANSPORTATION LINKS: YU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday that the
administration has made the preparations for coping with the opening
of direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the direct cross-strait transportation links plan has been
under consideration by the administration for two years, the
Executive Yuan has mapped out policies and measures for coping with
the needs that are expected to arise once the direct links are
opened, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Major features of the plan include measures to sharpen the Taiwan
business and industrial sectors' competitive edge; ways to enable the
industrial sectors of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to fairly
share their manufacturing niches in a complementary way; and methods
to prevent the Taiwan job market from being compromised under the
impact of the opening of direct links, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Yu's remarks came on the heels of an announcement made by
President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday that he will see to it that direct
cross-strait transportation links are implemented by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Ming-tong, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , the top governmental agency in charge of formulating
Taiwan's mainland China policy, said the MAC will publicize the
timetable for the opening of direct links in two days.</P>
      <P>Describing it as "crucially important, " Chen said the opening of
direct links is a development that will change not only the
cross-strait business and trade structure but also the structure of
Taiwan's economy and society.</P>
      <P>Since the opening of direct links is crucially important in the
development of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chen said, the two
sides should discuss the issue in a rational and peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the seven months between now and the next
presidential election in Taiwan would be a perfect period for the two
sides to conduct bilateral discussions on the opening of direct
links.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing to recognize and accept the reality of "one
country on either side of the Taiwan Strait" in order to contribute
to an acceleration in cross-strait interactions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPLEMENTATION OF 2ND-PHASE WATER RATIONING IN TAIPEI PUT OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The implementation of second-phase water
rationing measures in the greater Taipei area and third-phase
measures in Keelung have been temporarily postponed, the Water
Resources Agency (WRA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Torrential afternoon rains in recent days have allowed the water
catchment of Feitsui Reservoir -- the main supplier of water for the
greater Taipei area -- to take in 82.5 millimeters of rainfall over
the last three days, greatly easing water shortage pressure in Taipei
City, WRA officials said.</P>
      <P>The third-phase water rationing measures for Keelung and the
second-phase measures for the greater Taipei area were originally
expected to be implemented by the end of August and in early
September, respectively.</P>
      <P>The water level at Feitsui Reservoir stood at 138.25 meters at 8
a.m. Thursday, up slightly from the level of 138.16 meters at the
same time the previous day, marking the first rise in the water level
since July 2, the agency officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that the water catchment is expected to take in about
13 million metric tons of water Thursday following an afternoon
shower.</P>
      <P>Although the torrential afternoon rains over the past three days
have helped quench the dry spell, the water level at the Feitsui
Reservoir is still about ten meters lower than the average level seen
over the years, the officials noted.

    <HEADLINE>RAILWAY WORKERS VOTE TO STRIKE ON DAY OF MOON FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway Labor Union voted
Thursday to strike on the day of the upcoming Moon Festival as a
means of protecting railway workers' rights.</P>
      <P>A total of 274 railway labor union representatives from around
the island took part in an extraordinary general meeting Thursday,
during which they vowed to carry out the strike on the day of the
Moon Festival -- one of the three major holidays for Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The railway workers also vowed that the labor union would not
hold any dialogue with the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) before the Moon Festival, which falls on Sept.
11 this year. The Chinese people have for centuries observed the Moon
Festival, also known as the Autumn Festival, on the 15th day of the
eighth month of the lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Railway Labor Union Chairman Chang Wen-cheng said that
12,000 out of the 14,000-odd Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA)
staff have given their signatures to endorse the notion that they
will take a leave on Sept. 11 to take part in a general meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that although the strike may sound radical, Chang said
that the decision has been finalized and that the strike is the only
way to draw the government's attention to their appeals.</P>
      <P>He added that since the TRA Labor Union declared on June 12 that
it would hold its general meeting -- the first of its kind in Taiwan
railway history -- on the day of the Moon Festival, the MOTC has
continuously expressed "goodwill" in an attempt to seek
reconciliation with the railway workers.</P>
      <P>However, Chang said, this "goodwill" has been full of empty
promises, adding that the MOTC even announced unilaterally on Aug. 11
that after useful dialogue with the labor union, the two sides had
reached a consensus that the TRA Labor Union general meeting would be
held on Sept. 11 as scheduled but that railway transportation
services would not be suspended on that day.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOTC announcement was unilateral and was aimed at
splitting the labor union members so that the Sept. 11 strike would
be aborted.</P>
      <P>The labor union members are expected to make known their appeals
once again on the Sept. 11 general meeting day that they are opposed
to the TRA's privatization, to the profiteering plans for the Taiwan
High Speed Rail Corp., and to plans to ultimately put an end to the
TRA, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has asked the TRA management to complete the company's
privatization process before July 1, 2004.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TRA Deputy Director General Hsu Tah-wen said Thursday
that railway services will be maintained at normal levels on, before
and after the day of Sept. 11, in stark contrast to what has been
announced by the TRA labor union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ENTER NEW ERA OF HIGH-SPEED TRAVEL BY 2006: MOTC MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will enter a new era of high-speed
travel by 2006, with the completion of the highway network and the
start of Taiwan High Speed Rail service, Minister of Transportation
and Telecommunications Lin Lin-san said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a briefing on the island's transportation system to President
Chen Shui-bian and media executives, Lin said that since the
inauguration of the 372.7-kilometer First North-South Freeway from
Keelung to Kaohsiung in 1978, the convenience in travel and
transportation has stimulated economic activities along the west
coast.</P>
      <P>In order to establish a highway network to allow people around
the island high-speed travel, the government has undertaken a series
of transportation construction projects over the past decade,
including the Second North-South Freeway from Keelung to Pingtung, 12
east-west highways connecting cities and townships on both sides of
the island, and the West Coast Highway, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He said that while several sections of the Second North-South
Freeway have been opened to traffic since early last year,
construction of the 372.3-kilometer freeway is expected to be fully
completed at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>As to the 12 east-west highways and the West Coast Highway which
have also been partially opened to traffic, people can expect
full-line operations by the end of 2005, the minister said.</P>
      <P>He added that when the Taiwan High Speed Rail becomes operational
at the end of 2005, Taiwan residents' mobility and travel speed will
be further enhanced with the integrated high-speed travel network.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTRY TO RE-ALLOCATE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR OVERSEAS STUDIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education will re-allocate
 government scholarships for overseas studies by offering more
 set-amount scholarships while reducing the quota of full-coverage
 funding for graduate studies, a ministry official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official elaborated that under the new practice, the ministry
will offer 42 graduate students scholarships for their advanced
studies abroad. Instead of taking an examination, the candidates
should submit applications to the ministry.</P>
      <P>The set-amount scholarship for a student in countries which are
tuition-free will be US$10,000, while a student in countries of pay
education will be given US$20,000.</P>
      <P>The official said that a person studying abroad on a government
scholarship is obliged to return to Taiwan after completing his or
her studies. The person is also required to work in Taiwan for the
same period of time as compared with the years he has spent abroad.
These principles remain unchanged, he added.</P>
      <P>Currently, the NT$200 million government scholarship fund managed
by the MOE offers four categories of scholarships for overseas
studies -- three- to four-year full-coverage funding for masters or
doctoral degree programs, two-year funding for post-doctorate
programs, scholarships for short-term research programs, and
scholarships for selected research programs for science and
technology specialists.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the MOE showed that in the past year,
1,464 candidates vied for the 85 first-category scholarships; 89
contested the 20 scholarships for post-doctorate programs; and 39
took the examination for the 10 scholarships for short-term research
programs.</P>
      <P>The official said that under the ministry's plan, only 55
full-coverage scholarships will be offered to the first-category
candidates, with the introduction of the set-amount scholarships. A
student on the full-coverage scholarship is awarded around NT$1
million for tuition and books, board and lodging, air fares, and
health insurance.</P>
      <P>MOE statistics indicate that currently, nearly 40 percent of the
people studying abroad on government scholarships are in the United
States, 30 percent in the United Kingdom, and around 20 percent in
continental Europe.</P>

President Chen Shui-bian, saying that a second four-year term will
give Chen the opportunity to improve upon his work.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while paying a visit to the Republic of
China-Panama Cultural Center. She had met a group of Panamanian elite
woman executives in a breakfast gathering earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that President Chen has done his best to wipe out
corruption since assuming the presidency in May 2000, Lu said she
strongly believes that Chen will do a better job if he is given the
chance to serve a second term. The vice president called for
continued backing for Chen from ROC nationals abroad, and said Taiwan
will have a brighter future under Chen's leadership.</P>
      <P>Despite her staunch campaigning to sell Chen, Lu also said
overseas ROC nationals must have confidence in the government no
matter who is elected head of state next year.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan expatriates should have faith in the choice of their
compatriots at home through an election and continue backing the
government," she said, because "the foundation of the ROC government
is built upon democracy and progress and a transition of power is a
normal practice in a full-fledged democratic society."</P>
      <P>Lu also thanked local ethnic Chinese and people from Taiwan for
their long-standing concern for Taiwan, particularly the donations
they made after the country was devastated by the Sept. 21, 1999
earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen Wu-hu, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in
Panama, pledged firm support for Taiwan and said Lu's visit has
helped consolidate two-way relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
faced with mainland China's continued efforts to box in Taiwan,
Taipei must travel its own path and hold a referendum.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while leading editors in chief of
local media to Miaoli, northern Taiwan on the final day of his
two-day "witnessing the progress of Taiwan" tour.</P>
      <P>The president said that if Taiwan can participate in the World
Health Organization (WHO) as it wishes, then of course there would be
no need to hold a referendum on the issue.</P>
      <P>He stressed that health care should know no borders, and that it
is only natural that Taiwan should participate in the WHO, but
mainland China has used every means to block Taiwan's entry. "We have
to pursue our own road, " Chen said, adding that participation in the
WHO is the right of the 23 million people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president also said that a referendum is a basic human right,
 but that referendums in Taiwan will not include a vote on sovereignty
 -- an issue which the United States has expressed concern over.</P>
      <P>The president said that after Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of

explain the referendum issue, Washington expressed its understanding

natural for Taiwan's people to exercise their basic human rights.
"The United States will not interfere with our internal affairs, "
Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS ACHIEVEMENTS ARE FOR THE PEOPLE, NOT FOR VOTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
projects that his administration has undertaken have been solely for
the good of the people and had nothing to do with winning political
support.</P>
      <P>On the final day of his two-day tour of Taiwan with a group of
journalists, the president disputed his critics' claims that his
political agenda has been aimed more at winning voters' support than
serving the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
      <P>Chen said the central idea of his political philosophy is that
"The majority should take care of the minority and the privileged
should take care of the underprivileged."</P>
      <P>Boasting that he set up the country's first Aboriginal Affairs
Council at the Taipei City Government while he served as mayor, Chen
said, " The Central Government followed suit by setting up a similar
council only nine month later. The Kaohsiung City Government and the
Taiwan Provincial Government also set up similar organization after
that."</P>
      <P>Chen said that these acts did not translate into votes in any
election. The president also cited another example: the establishment
of the Council for Hakka Affairs under the Executive Yuan and the
launch of an all-Hakka television station.</P>
      <P>The president said he is very pleased with the results of the
things that he has done for minorities, regardless of the impact on
the popularity of his party or himself.</P>
      <P>Opening these new agencies went against the basic principle of
the administration to simplify the structure of the government and
improve its efficiency, but taking care of minorities takes
precedence over these considerations on the government's agenda, the
president said.</P>
      <P>The president also gave the efficiency of his administration
glowing reviews, saying that his government has done its best to
ensure the success of the country's first high-speed railway, which
was contracted out to a private company to build and operate with its
own capital, and he is pleased that the project is progressing well
and is on schedule.</P>
      <P>Chen also pointed to the Taipei-Ilan Highway, which he said will
open in 2005 because of the good management of his administration.</P>
      <P>Although neither the high-speed railway project nor the highway
were started during Chen's term as president, he said he was glad his
administration has been doing its part to ensure their timely
completion.</P>
      <P>This, the president said, also highlights the need for his
re-election. Only by continuing on as president can he oversee the
completion of the many important projects that his administration has
begun.</P>
      <P>Citing Su Chen-chang, the magistrate of Taipei County, as an
example, the president said many of Su's best achievements emerged
only during his second term.</P>
      <P>As to the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the
president laid the blame on the changing social structure: the
increasing number of elderly and single parent families, and the
emergence of new hi-tech industries which create a class of nouveaux
riches.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said his government has effectively addressed this
problem in many ways. The president did not elaborate but to say that
education is the best investment to overcome poverty.</P>
      <P>The president, who once lambasted the nation's journalists for
being biased against him, urged the group of editors in chief to pay
more attention to the positive side of all of Taiwan's society and
not simply gather news from the isolation of their Taipei offices.
The editors should be keeping their fingers on the pulse of the
nation to better reflect the views of the public, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president and the chief editors ended their trip late
Thursday afternoon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will talk with Taiwan more
rationally after the next presidential election next year, an
official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin, director of the DPP's Department of Chinese
Affairs, made the remarks while elaborating on President Chen
Shui-bian's statement that his administration will consult with
mainland China on direct transportation links after the presidential
election, and that cross-strait links could be realized by the end of
2004.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin brought up one of the president's "five-noes" as
pronounce in his inaugural speech -- no referendum on the future
status of the nation-- and said that Taiwan has consistently promoted
reconciliation with Beijing. He also said that cross-strait direct
transportation links are a path to be pursued in a national economic
conference, and the president's recent remarks are only a reiteration
of his long-held stance.</P>
      <P>He noted that mainland China is only paying lip service when they
 say that they want direct trade, postal and transportation links.</P>
      <P>He said that this is because mainland China would not want
cross-strait relations to make any progress before the presidential
election in March 20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Chen Chung-hsin said that the president believes that after the
presidential election, Beijing will have to face squarely Taiwan's
leader with a new mandate of the people and will only then adopt a
more rational attitude to consultations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cannot accept that the links be defined as "domestic
routes" under Beijing's "one China" policy, he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP wants to shelve political squabbles now so that
negotiations on direct transportation links can be conducted
smoothly, he said.</P>

5.09 million, an increase of 6.9 percent over the same period last
year, according to statistics released by the Kaohsiung Harbor

      <P>Bureau officials said they believe that the total number of

      <P>The statistics showed that the number of ships arriving at and

the weight of cargo handled at the port reached 247.05 million tons,
a growth of 7 percent over the same period of 2002.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FLAWED EDUCATION REFORM A VESTIGE OF FORMER ADMINISTRATION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
flaws in education reform are a result of the previous administration
over which he had no control, but that the current government has
been making inroads into getting the reforms on track.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the reform program was instigated years before he
took office and that this three-year-old administration has been
examining and reviewing education policies to fine tune where needed
and to revamp when necessary.</P>
      <P>The president also pointed out that his government did not
introduce the reform plans and has been merely trying to patch up a
less-than-perfect system. The public should be aware that laying the
blame for problem areas in the education system should not be laid at
the doorstep of the current administration, Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, his government would not shirk its
responsibility to fix the system.</P>
      <P>The president also mentioned tuition costs, which have been
rising. This, he said, was also a problem inherited from the previous
administration, but that actually over the last three years, tuition
has only increased by an average of 3 percent for public universities
and 0.8 percent for private universities.</P>
      <P>Contrast this with the average rise of 10 percent for public
universities and 3 percent for private universities in the decade
before he took office and the public can see that the current
administration is tackling the issue effectively, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that his administration had not aggravated the
tuition problem; instead, it has gone to great lengths to solve it,
such as persuading banks to offer low-interest loans to students.</P>
      <P>Turning his attention to cross-strait affairs, the president said
that critics were incorrect when they said that his policies toward
mainland China were "zigzagging." He said he has always been both
firm and pragmatic when dealing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that his promise in his inaugural speech that he
would not seek independence for Taiwan hinged on the condition that
mainland China renounce any intention to take the island by force.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Chen said, Beijing has never given up this
attitude and the 350-odd missiles targeting Taiwan across the Strait
is glaring evidence of this. "We should never ignore this," he said.</P>
      <P>The president said his statement that "there is one country on
each side of the Taiwan Strait" is based on the fact that Taiwan -
using whatever name you wish -- is a sovereign state and not a part
of the People's Republic of China. "Why should we be afraid to speak
the truth?" he asked.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, his insistence on Taiwan's
sovereignty should not be misunderstood as reluctance to normalize
the country's ties with mainland China, because his pragmatist view
in terms of dealing with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the market value of Taiwan's stocks fell 40 percent
during his three years in office, Chen said the island has held its
own against other countries, such as the United States, whose stocks
listed on the NASDAQ have given up two-thirds of their value during
the same time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOT TO BE DOWNGRADED IS TAIWAN'S BOTTOM LINE ON CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Not to be downgraded nor marginalized is
Taiwan's bottom line in cross-strait talks on opening transport,
trade and mail links between the two side of the Taiwan Strait,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , made the remarks following an announcement of three
steps toward the opening of these links by President Chen Shui-bian a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, which is the official designation of
Taiwan, is an independent and sovereign nation and is separate from
the People's Republic of China, Tsai said, adding that President
Chen's assertion of one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait is
a description of reality and is aimed at preventing Taiwan from being
downgraded.</P>
      <P>Based on this assertion and the principle of equality, she
continued, Taiwan has actively promoted the opening of direct
cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will never accept the opening of the "three links" under
the "one China" principle set by Beijing, she reiterated.</P>
      <P>She described the three-step program announced by President Chen
as very pragmatic and suggested that if Beijing really wants to open
the links with Taiwan it should first set aside its political
prerequisite to pave the way for holding cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Speaking with a group of editors in chief from local media, Chen
said Wednesday in Changhua, central Taiwan that the three steps are
preparation, negotiation and realization, which will lead to the
opening of the "three links" by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The first step is already going on, the second will begin after
the presidential election on March 20, 2000 and hopefully the third
will be realized sometime by the end of 2004, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The timetable for the three steps may not be as clear cut as the
order in which the president spoke of them, Tsai said, adding that
they may overlap and that opening the links can be done little by
little while cross-strait talks are going on.</P>
      <P>An evaluation report on opening the so-called "three links" in
Chinese and English by the MAC will be made public Friday, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS CLAIM BEIJING USING TAIWAN FISHING VESSELS FOR SPYING</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative subgroup on Friday urged the
government to be on alert against what it called the systematic use
by mainland China of Taiwan fishing vessels to collect military
information.</P>
      <P>The Alliance Against Selling out Taiwan said in a press release
that Beijing has already recruited several Taiwan fishing vessels to
spy on Taiwan's upcoming major military exercises, the Hankuang No.
19 exercise, in Ilan, northeast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , who is a member of the alliance, said that security
authorities, while checking on the activities of fishing and
commercial ships, unexpectedly discovered that some Taiwan fishing
and commercial ships have been bribed and used by mainland
authorities.</P>
      <P>He said that some of the Taiwan ships that have carried out spy
missions for the mainland provide to Beijing such information as the
most vulnerable spots in Taiwan's seashore defenses and the most
easily accesible spots for making landings.</P>
      <P>The ships also engage in such illicit operations as transporting
illegal immigrants and other smuggling activities, he said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiang Chao-yi, another member of the alliance,
said that Beijing registers all Taiwan fishing ships that have
accepted spying missions and allows them to travel freely to any
mainland fishing, commercial or military harbors.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Cheng-nan noted that Taiwan's security
authorities suspect that a lot of Taiwan gangsters have traveled in
and out of Taiwan through this channel.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Lin Chin-hsin urged the government to be
on guard against possible spying activities by some Taiwan fishing
ships during the upcoming Hankuang No. 19 exercise in Ilan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS CHINESE IN DENMARK URGE KOFI ANNAN TO HELP TAIWAN'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,   Aug.   14  (CNA)
(By M.T. Liu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of six overseas Chinese
associations in Denmark recently sent a joint letter to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, urging him to help Taiwan's bid to join
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the associations requested that the U.N. chief use
his influence to manifest the spirit of equality and rights set forth
in the U.N. charter and to support Taiwan's activities for joining
the leading international organization.</P>
      <P>The letter said that Taiwan's 15 diplomatic allies have jointly
requested that the issue of the island's right to representation in
the United Nations should be placed on the provisional agenda of the
organization's 58th general assembly scheduled to kick off in
mid-September.</P>
      <P>The letter also again reminded the world that it should pay
proper attention to the rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and
to the importance of upholding the founding aims of the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>While explaining why Taiwan should be included in the United
Nations, the letter said that according to the U.N. charter's
principle of universality regarding membership, Taiwan has the right
to participate in the organization because it is a democratic and
peace-loving country.</P>
      <P>It also noted that U.N. Resolution 2758 gave Beijing a seat in
the United Nations but that the question of Taiwan's representation
in the organization has still not been dealt, leading to island being
the only country excluded from the organization. It added that this
not only violates the spirit of the U.N. charter, it also deprives
the Taiwan people of their rights.</P>
      <P>The letter stressed that neither Taiwan nor mainland China is
under the jurisdiction of the other. It also noted that Taiwan has
long respected the U.N. idea and has always done it utmost to support
all matters in line with the founding goals of the organization,
adding that the island has also provided many countries with
humanitarian assistance.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can join the United Nations, the island, with its
important strategic position, will certainly contribute to
international peace and security, the letter said.</P>
      <P>The United Nations should not disregard Taiwan's existence and
should not exclude the island from the organization, the leaders of
the associations also said in the letter, expressing the hope that
the U.N. secretary-general would support Taiwan's bid to join the
organization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT TRANSPORT LINKS WILL BE CATALYST FOR 'THREE LINKS': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of direct transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait will be a catalyst for the "direct three
links, " Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The "direct three links" refers to direct cross-strait trade,
postal and transportation links.</P>
      <P>The opening of direct cross-strait transportation links will also
be conducive to an overall normalization of business and trade
relations between the two sides of the strait, Tsai said at a news
conference where the MAC-drafted Assessment Report on the Impact of
Direct Cross-strait Transportation was released. Premier Yu Shyi-kun
presided over the press conference.</P>
      <P>Tsai said, however, that whether and when Taiwan will implement
the direct transportation links will only be decided after
comprehensive and careful assessments on every aspect concerned are
carried out.</P>
      <P>She added that the issue of direct transportation links is not
purely a business problem and that it also involves issues concerning
political and economic security. Technically, she added, the relevant
flag and port usage issues also need to be tackled through
negotiations.</P>
      <P>The opening of direct cross-strait transportation links is a
crucial issue concerning Taiwan's existence and development, and it
is by no means subject to experiment, said the assessment.</P>
      <P>Crucially important as it is, the issue of direct cross-strait
transportation links should thus be handled as carefully and
prudently as possible, according to the assessment report.</P>
      <P>Preparations should continue and actual implementation should be
carried out in a step-by-step manner so that the nation's interests
and the people's welfare can be secured, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report also pointed out the four principles that Taiwan will
uphold while conducting negotiations with the mainland over the
opening of direct transportation links. The four principles are: no
concessions on sovereignty; no depletion of public authority;
securing of the overall national interest and the people's welfare;
and government-directed negotiations only.</P>
      <P>Prominent figures of Yu's team at the press conference also
included Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min; Vice Minister of
Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei; Vice Minister of
Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long; and National Security Bureau Deputy
Director-General Wang Chin-wang.</P>
      <P>The publicizing of the assessment report came on the heels of an
announcement made by President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday that he will
see to it that direct cross-strait transportation links are
implemented by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>President Chen said the MAC has completed an assessment report on
direct cross-strait transportation links, which features a
three-phase implementation plan, including preparation, negotiation
and implementation phases.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, in the "preparation" phase, both sides of the
strait will face squarely the planning for cargo interlinks across
the Taiwan Strait, while the "negotiation" phase is envisaged as
kicking off after the March 20, 2004 presidential election, and the
"implementation" phase will begin by the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Earlier Friday morning, MAC Chairwoman Tsai briefed Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and legislative caucuses of various
political parties on highlights of the assessment reports.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the opening of direct transportation links is not
an issue of "whether or not," but a question of "how."</P>
      <P>She said the president's forecast regarding the implementation of
the direct links by the end of next year is rational and reasonable
as following the 2004 presidential election, there should be less
political overtones surrounding cross-strait negotiations on direct
links and the talks can be expected to be conducted more smoothly.</P>
      <P>She added that Taiwan's four international ports are all included
in the direct transportation links map, while Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan and Hsiaokang International Airport
in Kaohsiung will be the designated airports for handling direct
transportation links affairs.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng commented later that the
assessment report had not provided the legislators or the nation with
details about the "three-phase" implementation plan as President Chen
mentioned Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUPPORTING MEASURES ARE IMPORTANT TO DIRECT TRANSPORTATION: YU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of direct transportation links
across the Taiwan Strait will bring fresh opportunities for Taiwan's
development as long as the program is conducted with well-devised
supporting measures, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Supporting measures will include cross-strait dialogue conducted
under the principles of equality and dignity, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks at a press conference during which the
Executive Yuan publicized the report on the Assessment of the Impact
of Direct Cross-Strait Transportation.</P>
      <P>The chiefs of the relevant ministries were present at the press
conference. They included Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) , which formulates Taiwan's mainland China
policies; Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min; Vice Minister
of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long; Vice Minister of Transportation
and Communications Tsai Duei; National Security Bureau Deputy
Director General Wang Chin-wang; and others.</P>
      <P>Yu said that actively promoting the normalization of cross-strait
relations and the building of a framework for stable and peaceful
exchanges across the strait have been major administrative targets of
President Chen Shui-bian, adding that the president explicitly
spelled out his "direct cross-strait transportation links" policy
last September.</P>
      <P>The targets have since served as a guide for the Cabinet, which
has in turn completed planning and materialized relevant policies
step by step, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Quoting a public opinion poll conducted by the Executive Yuan
earlier this year, Yu said a majority of the people in Taiwan support
"conditional" direct cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>The poll revealed that most of the Taiwan people have a certain
degree of concern about the potential impact of direct cross-strait
transportation, Yu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the poll finding also indicated that it is the
government's duty to conduct a thorough and comprehensive assessment
of every aspect of the issue and to devise coping measures to meet
the people's needs and requests.</P>
      <P>He said preparatory work and transitional measures are crucial to
allow Taiwan to accumulate skills and experience before actually
kicking off the direct cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>For the preparatory work, Yu noted that relevant agencies of the
Cabinet have started to work in five major areas: namely amending
statutes and regulations concerning cross-strait links; solidifying
Taiwan's national security network; stepping up readjustment of
Taiwan's industrial and business structures; building a social
security network; and strengthening quarantine policy and measures.</P>
      <P>Also commenting Thursday on the imminent publicizing of the
Assessment of the Impact of Direct Cross-Strait Transportation, Yu
said that the Executive Yuan has mapped out policies and measures for
coping with the needs that are expected to arise once the direct
links are opened.</P>
      <P>Major features of the plan include measures to sharpen the Taiwan
business and industrial sectors' competitive edge; ways to enable the
industrial sectors of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to fairly
share their manufacturing niches in a complementary way; and methods
to prevent the Taiwan job market from being compromised under the
impact of the opening of direct links, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Yu's remarks came on the heels of an announcement made by
President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday that he will see to it that direct
cross-strait transportation links are implemented by the end of 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STRAIGHT FLIGHT BAN UNDER DIRECT LINKS WON'T HAVE IMPACT: AIRLINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two major Taiwan air carriers said Friday
that the ban on straight flights across the Taiwan Strait after
direct cross-strait transportation links are implemented will not
have a significant impact on their operations.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways made the remarks following
the unveiling of an Executive Yuan assessment report earlier in the
day on the implementing of direct cross-strait transportation links
in which it said straight flights across the strait will be banned
out of national security considerations.</P>
      <P>The two airlines said they are glad to see that the government is
determined to push for the direct cross-strait transportation links
and that the ban on straight cross-strait flights will not be a
problem.</P>
      <P>Han Liang-chung, a CAL public relations official, said that
except for flights to Fuzhou, Fujian Province, where direct
cross-strait flights would be the shortest, all other flights to
destinations in mainland China, such as to Beijing or Guangzhou, have
to head northwards or southwards anyway, and the ban will not make
that much of a difference.</P>
      <P>Nieh Kuo-wei, vice president of EVA Airways, said that direct
cross-strait air links will save more time and fuel than landing on
the third places, while the ban on flying straight across the strait
won't make much difference as there are many air routes from which to
choose.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the choosing of CKS International Airport as the
priority airport for direct cross-strait air links in the assessment
report and the listing of Sungshan and Hsiaokang airports as second
considerations, Nieh said that CKS airport has good facilities, but
that Sungshan Airport in Taipei will be more convenient for
passengers.</P>
      <P>Han said that if CKS airport is designated as the direct air
links airport, it will not only bring benefits to both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, it will also help in efforts to transform the airport
into an Asia-Pacific operations center.</P>
      <P>When air exchanges across the Taiwan Strait become brisk, this is
bound to attract transit stops of passengers and cargo between
mainland China and the United States and Europe, Han added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PUSHES FOR KNOWLEDGE-BASED AGRICULTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday Taiwan
must develop knowledge-based agriculture to survive ever-growing
foreign competition.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the 2003 Taiwan Food Carnival, Chen
said his administration has devoted much energy to promoting the
modernization of local agriculture over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Following Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization,
Chen said, local farmers have faced strong competition from their
foreign counterparts as the domestic food market has been opened
wider to foreign products.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, local governments should
cooperate with research institutions as well as farmers' and fishery
associations in upgrading production technology, marketing,
warehousing and distribution systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that crop types, quality and brand are key to enhancing
added value of agricultural products, Chen said Taiwan must step up
development of biotechnology and environment-friendly agricultural
technology. "Namely, we must develop knowledge-based agriculture to
sharpen our competitive edge," he said, adding that local farmers
should not be afraid of market liberalization and competition.</P>
      <P>Chen further said his administration is determined to invest more
in modernizing agricultural production and developing ecotourism in
rural areas to increase farmers' income.</P>
      <P>The president also said he hopes the current international food
fair can help local farmers tap into overseas markets and expand
domestic sales.</P>
      <P>More than 200 local foodstuff manufacturers are taking part in
the food trade fair, attracting a large number of chain stores
operators from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and mainland
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WILLING TO HOLD DIRECT LINKS TALKS ANYTIME IF M'LAND SINCERE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking mainland affairs official
said Friday that Taiwan is willing to hold consultations with
mainland China at any time as long as Beijing is sincere.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
made the remarks while talking about President Chen Shui-bian's
comments Wednesday that he is confident talks between Taipei and
Beijing regarding direct transportation links will kick off after
next year's presidential election in Taiwan scheduled for March 20.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the president's comments were based on the
observation that holding cross-strait consultations before the
presidential election might be clouded by politics factors and
therefore more difficult to conduct.</P>
      <P>While indicating that the sovereignty dispute across the Taiwan
Strait can hardly be resolved within a short period of time, the MAC
head said that direct transportation links are necessary and should
proceed in the short to medium term.</P>
      <P>She noted that the government has an obligation to find a formula
for direct links consultations and expressed the hope that without
harming Taiwan's sovereignty, a flexible formula can be found in the
future.</P>
      <P>Tsai also expressed the hope that consultations will be held with
Beijing on the principles of direct links before December of next
year and that consultations on the technical aspects will be
conducted after that.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MAC head said that the government has gradually
opened up Taiwan to mainland Chinese tourists and that talks need to
be held with Beijing before Taiwan's tourist market is completely
opened to mainland citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT TRANSPORTATION MUST BE POINT-TO-POINT: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links
must follow the "point-to-point and fixed route" principles, Defense
Minister Tang Yiau-min said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference where the nation's first assessment
report on the impact of direct cross-strait transportation was
unveiled, Tang said straight shipments or flights across the Taiwan
Strait will have a grave impact on Taiwan's security as mainland
China has never forsaken its hostility toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's defense white paper, Tang said, mainland
authorities will never renounce the use of force against Taiwan and
will not allow the current separation of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Tang said, mainland China has adjusted its military
deployment by placing emphasis on its southeastern coastal region
that lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang said mainland China has deployed more guided ballistic
missiles and new types of fighters, warships and submarines in its
southeastern provinces, and the People's Liberation Army has
conducted three-dimensional combined services drills targeting Taiwan
regularly.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's capability to launch an attack on Taiwan has
reached a level that can no longer be overlooked.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taiwan Strait provides a natural shelter to
Taiwan, Tang said straight cross-strait flights will pose a grave
threat to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Tang pointed out that the distance between Taiwan's Hsinchu and
mainland China's Pingtan in Fujian Province is only 70 nautical
miles. It would take only three to five minutes for mainland jet
fighters to reach Taiwan should Beijing launch a surprise air strike
against Taiwan, Tang said.</P>
      <P>For the sake of maintaining national security, Tang said opening
direct cross-strait air links must abide by the "point-to-point and
fixed routes" principles under which cross-strait flights are banned
and detours are required.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of National Defense (MND) officials said
opening direct cross-strait transportation will have a great impact
on national security.</P>
      <P>Initial estimates show that the MND will have to dispatch at
least 1,500 troops to be stationed at Taiwan's airports and harbors
once direct cross-strait shipping and flight services kick off.
Moreover, they said, there will be many other tangible and intangible
security costs.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the officials said, the military must adjust its
overall strategy, combat plans, operational regulations and troop
deployments to cope with the new situation where mainland aircraft
and ships will be able to directly enter Taiwan's territorial waters
and airspace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOOL DROP-OUTS TAKE 'WALK OF REMORSE' AROUND-THE-ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the group of former school drop-outs
who used to be drug abusers and street drag racers, nothing could
be better than plodding under the scorching sun on sizzling highway
roads or in stormy weather on an across-the-island walk of remorse.</P>
      <P>This is what the 25 teenaged boys wanted to do -- to toil on the
road like ancient ascetic monks -- as a means to show remorse for
their past sins and ultimately seek personal rebirth.</P>
      <P>The group, which set off from Taichung in central Taiwan July 30,
has trudged through the Chiayi-Tainan Plain, down to Kaohsiung and
Pingtung before crossing the South-Bend Highway and turning to the
eastern counties of Taitung, Hualien and Ilan on Aug. 15.</P>
      <P>From Ilan City, the group has headed north, aiming to reach
Taipei this weekend before hitting the south-bound roads to return to
the starting point in Taichung, hopefully around Aug. 23.</P>
      <P>During the 25-day journey, all the group members are on
vegetarian diets, walking at least 12 hours a day and seeking
accommodations at road-side temples, according to Hsu Chen-jung, a
temple operator from Taichung, who serves as director and lecturer of
the group.</P>
      <P>No alcohol, no dirty words and no short tempers are allowed
during the journey, Hsu said, adding that even with blisters on their
feet and cramps in their legs, none of them has dropped out.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he has operated the "walk of remorse" for drop-outs for
ninth consecutive years. Over the past years, he has seen defiant,
angry or distressed teenagers rediscover themselves after the 25-day,
laborious around-the-island walking.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who also maintains a Taoist folklore performance troupe,
said many of the young men who took part in the walking journeys also
have learned in his troupe performance arts dedicated to
god-worshipping activities.</P>
      <P>Hsu said his troupe has been invited to travel to Canada at the
end of August to give performances in Toronto and Vancouver to
showcase Taiwan's religious folklore.</P>
      <P>Highly recommending the around-the-island walking journeys, Prof.
Lin Mao-hsien from the Department of Taiwan Literature of Providence
University said the journey is a daunting task challenging the
teenagers' patience and physical capabilities.</P>
      <P>By going beyond what they thought was their limit, the young men
rediscover themselves, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-ming, 19, who dropped out school during his second year
in junior high, was a street drag racer who had a notorious name in
all of central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen was attracted to the performances given by Chen's temple
activity troupe and joined the group three years ago. Since then, he
has become a polite young man and a drummer who plays the troupe's
oriental drums.</P>
      <P>Huang Yung-lun, 17, was a drug abuser who began to use
amphetamines at the age of 13. A frequent visitor to police
departments and jail cells, Huang was expelled from school at 14.</P>
      <P>The first several months were torture without drugs and nothing
to substitute but physical toil, Huang said. But after conquering the
most trying period, the days were happy and rewarding, he said.</P>
      <P>Now also a drummer, Huang said he has been gaining weight,
learning his trade and thinking only about the positive side of life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI RESIDENT SECURES COVETED FIRST NEW 'TAIWAN' PASSPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei resident will secure the coveted
first copy of the new version of the ROC passport to be formally
issued Sept. 1, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's Bureau of Consular Affairs (BCA) conducted a random,
computerized drawing of the issued serial numbers earlier in the day
to decide the first 100 recipients of the new passport. Those who
filed applications between Aug. 1 and Aug. 14 had an equal chance of
securing the coveted first new passport.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,017 Taiwan citizens filed applications during the
14-day period. Along with a number of ardent applicants, MOFA
officials and journalists, the first applicant drawn out by the
computer was Kuo Yi-ming.</P>
      <P>BCA Director Yang Sheng-chung immediately informed Kuo of his
good luck by telephone. Kuo said he was excited to get the very first
new passport. "It came as a surprise to me. I'm more than happy," he
said by phone.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's namesake, who was the first to apply
for the new version of the passport on Aug. 1, secured No. 46.</P>
      <P>"Chen Shui-bian, " who legally changed his name to that of the
president a few years ago, once said he felt it was a very meaningful
event for the government to issue the new version of the passport
displaying the word "TAIWAN" in addition to the official national
designation of the Republic of China on its cover. Therefore, he said
he wanted to be the first to apply for the new version of the
passport.</P>
      <P>A 55-year-old man, identified as Chen Yun-ching, who came to the
BCA office to witness the computerized drawing, said he was
disappointed at failing to secure one of the first 100 copies of the
new passport. "This is the first time that I have ever applied for a
passport," he said.</P>
      <P>Yang said he will present the first copy of the new version of
the passport to Kuo Yi-ming in a formal ceremony Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The serial number of the new passports will start from
"210000001," Yang said, adding that "21" refers to the 21st century.</P>
      <P>In the past, the first copy of a new version of a passport was
traditionally reserved for the nation's head of state. This time,
President Chen directed that the first copy of the new version be
made available to the people since it is they who will benefit from
the changes.</P>
      <P>Some ROC passport holders have complained that they had
encountered unnecessary inconvenience or embarrassment while
traveling abroad because foreign immigration officers often mistook
them for mainland Chinese nationals. Mainland China's official title
is the People's Republic of China or the PRC.</P>
      <P>The addition of the English word "TAIWAN" in capital letters on
the cover of the new ROC passport will make them more distinguishable
from those issued by the PRC, MOFA officials said.
Old passports will remain valid until they expire.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROOM TO ADJUST SHIPPING ROUTES, PORTS CRUCIAL: SHIPPING OPERATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shipping operators expressed the hope
Friday that direct shipping across the Taiwan Strait would be opened
as soon as possible, and that there would be flexibility regarding
what routes and which ports would be available.</P>
      <P>The shipping operators made the comments on the heels of the
Executive Yuan's unveiling of its assessment of direct transportation
links between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for Wan Hai Lines Ltd., a near-sea cargo transport
operator, said that direct cargo transportation links should be based
on a liberal approach, adding that it would not be very worthwhile to
open only fixed shipping routes and ports.</P>
      <P>For cargo transport, it is most important for operators to have
free reign to adjust their shipping routes, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The operators also expressed the hope that direct shipping would
allow them free movement to more shipping points without
restrictions. If the operators are given more leeway in the
adjustment of their shipping lines and points, then the efficiency of
cargo transport will be greatly enhanced, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some Taiwan businessmen operating in the mainland
lauded the government's plan for direct cross-strait transportation
links, believing that it will greatly enhance the government's goal
to upgrade national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>However, the businessmen said that talks with the mainland on the
issue would go nowhere if the government on Taiwan could not find a
way to deal with the situation creatively and avoid getting mired in
political dogma.</P>
      <P>The businessmen were responding to an assessment report released
earlier in the day by the Cabinet that said direct cross-strait
transportation links will have to be negotiated through bilateral
consultations and the signing of agreements that are in the best
interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>The reports stated that the government will insist on "national
sovereignty" and "will never budge on this point." The government
will also preside over the talks and will not fall into the so-called
"united front tactic" of having to accept Beijing's "one China"
principle or accept the links as an "internal affair" of mainland
China's.</P>
      <P>The businessmen said that it was still unclear whether President
Chen Shui-bian's remarks on a three-step approach for the realization
of direct cross-strait transportation links were just "election
rhetoric" prior to the presidential vote in March 2004, or an honest
intention to upgrade national competitiveness.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health of the Executive
Yuan hopes that a medical system for diagnosing severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) in three hours will be established in
early October, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su Yi-jen, director-general of the Center for Disease Control,

of SARS from flu, especially in autumn, when approximately one
million people in Taiwan suffer from colds and flu each year.</P>
      <P>He said the establishment of such a system could help prevent the
recurrence of SARS outbreaks this autumn. Researches are being done
at home and abroad to make an early establishment of the system
possible, he said.</P>
      <P>To prevent any recurrences, the government will encourage people
to stay at home for three days when they have cold symptoms or those
of the flu. They should seek medical treatment if they have symptoms
of pneumonia or have difficulty in breathing. In addition, he said,
feverish travelers to Taiwan may be asked to go into quarantine,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S TOP SPORTS OFFICIAL HONORS CYCLING FAMILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top sports official praised
the sportsmanship of the four members of a Taipei cyclist family
Friday who recently returned to Taiwan after their 13-month,
23,600-kilometer globe-trotting journey.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lin Teh-fu of the National Council on Physical Fitness
and Sports said that the family pedaled their way through countries
in Asia, Europe and America, adding that it would be an amazing feat
even by car, not to mention by bicycle.</P>
      <P>Lin said the family traveled through extremes -- from 50-degree
Celsius heat to sub-freezing 30 below, and from 5,000-meter highlands
to the 150 meters below sea level.</P>
      <P>"Such is the spirit of sportsmanship which dares to face
adversity and venture ahead, " Lin said as he presented them with a
plaque and a check for NT$600,000 (US$17,390).</P>
      <P>Saying that the family's globe-trotting was a form of
trailblazing, Lin said that his council will actively promote cycling
activities and expand the construction of cycling paths in cities
since cycling is an environmental friendly sport.</P>
      <P>In addition, the council will also sponsor an islandwide cycling
activity Sept. 11-21 so that graduate students can learn more about
Taiwan before finding work or continuing their studies, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin also invited the cycling family to take part in the
islandwide cycling activity.</P>
      <P>The family is comprised of Huang Chin-pao, a welder, his wife and
two teenaged sons. The elder son, Huang Chien-chia, wrote a
two-volume book called "Going after your dreams by pedaling around
the world" based on his observations along the way.</P>
      <P>Chien-chia said that the two volumes chronicle their hardships,
laughter and tears during the trip, adding that the close-knit family
had been able to complete the journey by supporting each other.</P>
      <P>He said, "Through my own observations, I was able to get a
glimpse of the immense world and my world vision has been broadened."</P>
      <P>The council bought 3,000 copies of Chien-chia's book as a form of
encouragement.</P>
      <P>The Huangs kicked off their global cycling journey from Hong
Kong, first pedaling across mainland China, through the Gobi Desert
and into Pakistan, where they encountered armed strife between
government troops and guerrilla forces.</P>
      <P>They took a month-long break after reaching Turkey via Iran,
during which time they applied for visas to continue their ride
through Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Belgium, and
the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>The Huangs flew into New York May 2 for their last leg in the
United States after having pedaled 18,000 kilometers across the Asian
and European continents.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Power Company (Taipower)
instructed its various departments Friday to ensure a sufficient and
safe supply of electricity following a power outage that struck
cities in northern United States and Canada Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also suffered a massive blackout that darkened almost the
entire island on July 29, 1999. The widespread power outage was
caused by the collapse of a transmission tower in Tainan County, as a
result of a landslide due to heavy rainfall in the region.</P>
      <P>The transmission tower's collapse triggered a domino effect among
the island's connected transmission systems, causing serious losses
to local industries.</P>
      <P>Taipower spokesman Lee Ching-tien said Friday that the reserve
capacity of the island's electricity supply system has reached 14.7
percent this year, a considerable improvement over last year.</P>
      <P>In addition, with the completion of the company's new power
transmission system around the island, Lee assured that there will be
no shortage of electricity supply this summer as long as no natural
disasters hit the island.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that Taipower's emergency task force is already
ready to face any contingency.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere, Chunghwa Telecom noted that northern America's power
outage has so far not affected the international telephone lines
between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kao
An, said the ROC's diplomats and their relatives are quite safe and
calm for the time being in spite of some panicked calls to Taiwan's
representative offices.</P>
      <P>Kao noted that only the representative offices in New York and
Toronto have been affected by the power outage, with their staff
walking home since traffic was snarled.</P>
      <P>In the air, only a New York-bound domestic flight from Seattle by
EVA Airways suffered a two-hour delay, and a flight from New York to
Taipei by China Airlines is expected to be delayed Friday because of
the disordered airport ground operations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Asuncion,  Aug.  14 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting ROC Vice President Annette Lu
said Thursday that Cuban President Fidel Castro has expressed his
hope for a peaceful settlement of disputes between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu said she had amicable conversations with Castro while
attending a dinner party hosted by outgoing Paraguayan President Luis
Angel Gonzalez in honor of foreign dignitaries who are in Asuncion to
attend the inauguration of the new Paraguayan president Friday.</P>
      <P>"The 77-year-old Cuban leader is friendly and talkative, " Lu
said, adding that Castro was curious about how Lu has managed to
emerge as the ROC's first female vice president from a political
dissident who was imprisoned for six years during Taiwan's martial
law era.</P>
      <P>Lu said they also spoke of relations across the Taiwan Strait.
"Castro repeatedly told me that he is opposed to any military
conflict and hopes to see cross-strait issues be resolved
peacefully, " she said, adding that she has invited Castro to visit
Taiwan and asked him to help advise Beijing to renounce its use of
military threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also present at the gala party were presidents of Argentina,
Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia as well as senior
officials from many other countries.</P>
      <P>Lu, heading a 43-member entourage, arrived in Paraguay Wednesday
after a three-day official visit to Panama. Lu will attend Paraguayan
President-elect Nicanor Duarte Frutos' inaugural ceremony on behalf
of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu addressed the Paraguayan Congress, calling
for enhancing bilateral economic cooperation by forging strategic
alliances.</P>
      <P>Lu said the two countries should cooperate in operating
agricultural farms and industrial parks, with Taiwan providing
technology and technicians while Paraguay offering land and manpower.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan once donated funds for building homes for
impoverished Paraguayan families. In appreciation of Taiwan's
assistance, those Paraguayan people re-designated a major street in
their neighborhood as "Taiwan Street" and their village as "Taiwan
Village."</P>
      <P>If necessary, Lu said, Taiwan is willing to build a "Taiwan town"
in Paraguay in the future.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has donated US$20 million for Paraguay to
build a new building to house its congress. Nearly all members of the
Paraguayan Senate and House of Representatives showed up to listen to
Lu's speech to express their gratitude for Taiwan's generous aid.</P>
      <P>Paraguayan Senate Speaker Carlos Mateo Balmelli said the two
countries have enjoyed a longstanding relationship because they have
shared values in freedom, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Mateo said the Paraguayan government will continue to support
Taiwan's bid to join major international organizations and will also
take concrete measures to boost bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lu had made transit stops in Hawaii and Los Angeles en route to
Panama. On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TECHNICAL ISSUES NOT KEY TO DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS: PROFESSOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Issues pertaining to law enforcement and
public perception, rather than technical problems, are the keys to
opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait transport links, a mainland China
affairs expert said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yueh, a professor with the mainland studies graduate
school at Tamkang University, said technical matters related to law
enforcement and how the public views the situation are the major
barriers to the establishment of direct cross-strait transport links,
because both Taiwan and mainland China are weighing their own
political objectives and considerations.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian reiterated that direct
cross-strait links must be built upon security, reciprocity and
dignity, and the mainland claimed that the two sides can put aside
the 'one China' dispute and other political issues, Chang predicted
that it will be impossible to forge the links if political issues,
such as the crucial law enforcement and sovereignty, are avoided.</P>
      <P>Should mainland China seek to achieve its "one China" goal
through the links or view the links as Taiwan's tool to display
Chen's stance that "there is one country on each side of the Strait,"
neither side will give in to the other to start talks, Chang said,
pointing out that "this is the major thorny point toward setting up
the links."</P>
      <P>If the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are willing to reduce the
political weight they give the issue, all technical issues regarding
the links will not be major problems, Chang said, but he predicted a
long process of bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks came after Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen published earlier the same day a report on
the assessment of the impact of direct cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>President Chen claimed Wednesday that direct transport services
between Taiwan and mainland China will be implemented in three stages
by the end of 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSPORT LINKS WITH MAINLAND, A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct transport links with mainland China
is a double-edged sword in economic terms -- it can both benefit and
hurt the island, Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs
Council said Friday.</P>
      <P>Unveiling a government assessment on the impacts of possible
direct transport links with the mainland, Tsai said the links would
certainly decrease the cost of transporting people and goods to and
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>She estimated that direct transport links would cut cargo
shipping costs by about NT$820 million a year, and cut shipping time
by half. For air traffic, it would cut NT$13.2 billion in costs and
8.6 million hours in time a year for passenger loads. For cargo,
there would be savings of NT$810 million in costs and 260,000 hours
in time each year.</P>
      <P>The reduced costs and time would boost local business's
competitiveness and help the economy, she said.</P>
      <P>However, the links could speed up the outflow of Taiwan's
capital, hi-technology and technicians to the mainland and,
therefore, aggravate the economic slowdown and drive up the
unemployment rate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The flight of local capital as well as the relocation of many
people to the mainland would also dampen the real estate market. Once
the country has lost its edge in ready capital and hi-technology, its
industries will lose their competitiveness and Taiwan will be
marginalized.</P>
      <P>How to preserve the advantage while preventing the disadvantages
is a serious challenge facing the country if it expects to
successfully open direct transport links, Tsai said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPLEXITY OF DIRECT LINKS BEYOND ASSESSMENT: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
has tried its best to outline the pros and cons that direct
cross-Taiwan Strait transport links could have in Taiwan, many
complications are difficult to assess now and must be resolved
through two-way negotiations, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, director of the MAC's Economic Affairs Department,
who was responsible for writing the report about an overall
assessment of the impacts on Taiwan of opening direct transport
services across the Strait, said many problems are hard to evaluate
in advance and that they must be settled at the negotiating table in
the future.</P>
      <P>For instance, direct transport links between the two sides will
fuel the number of mainland-bound tourist and business trips among
the Taiwan people by 1.6-fold over the combined level since 1991 --
the equivalent of an additional 45 million trips worth more than
billions of New Taiwan dollars, Fu pointed out, adding that the
negative impact on Taiwan's economy should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Fu said, proper complementary measures can be
devised through two-way talks to allow the people from mainland China
to enter Taiwan to help balance the trend.</P>
      <P>The MAC stressed in the assessment report that the focal point
for Taiwan now is how to adequately conduct direct cross-strait
transport links. It also said that Taiwan cannot rashly engage in the
links simply out of wishful thinking. The links must be set up under
the principles of dignity, security, prosperity and reciprocality.</P>
      <P>According to MAC officials, "one country on each side" is
Taiwan's bottom line in future negotiations with mainland China on
the links issue. Taiwan will try to be flexible based on this
framework while negotiating with the mainland, they added.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen published earlier the same day a
report on the assessment of the impact of direct cross-strait
transport services on Taiwan at a news conference called by Premier
Yu Shyi-kun, after President Chen Shui-bian said a day earlier that
direct transport links between Taiwan and mainland China would be

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said on Friday that the
government is serious and determined to promote direct transportation
links across the Taiwan Strait, but stressed that it will not
sacrifice the nation's security in exchange for such links.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in a news conference after Cabinet officials
unveiled an official evaluation report on the opening of direct
transportation links between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Also present were high-ranking officials responsible for
technical problems relating to the links, including Mainland Affairs
Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Minister of National Defense Tang
Yiau-min, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-lung, and Vice
Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Tuei.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that the release of the evaluation report
represented his administration's seriousness and determination in
promoting direct transport links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The report was unveiled following the remarks made by President
Chen Shui-bian on Aug. 13 that his administration will promote the
opening of direct cross-strait transportation links under a
three-stage program.</P>
      <P>Regarding the criticism describing Chen's three-stage program as
an empty campaign promise, Yu stressed that the opening of direct
transportation links with mainland China is a serious topic that
should be implemented step by step.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed to Chen's many policies, including a more open
approach toward Taiwan investment in mainland China to replace a
policy of curtailing investment and the opening of direct shipping
links between Taiwan's several offshore islands and mainland Chinese
ports, which he said can demonstrate the government's sincerity in
promoting close relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>In order to show Taiwan's good faith in opening the links with
mainland, Yu said his administration will not set any conditions on
future negotiations with Beijing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economic growth fell to minus 0.08
percent in the second quarter, thanks to the ravages of severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), a statistics official from the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing data compiled by his office, the anonymous official said
SARS drove down the rate by taking a bite out of the island's exports
and dampening consumption in the private sector, which has witnessed
a unprecedented downward growth of 1.8 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, both the production in the sectors of industry and
service dipped and the economic growth fell far short of the 1.2
percent forecast.</P>
      <P>However, he said, the prospects for the second half of this year
 are quiet bright because of the global economic recovery, the
 island's booming exports, and the upturn in private consumption and
 private investment.</P>
      <P>He predicted a growth of 3.96 percent for the third quarter and
4.67 percent for the fourth quarter, which will push the whole year

      <P>Beijing will miss an opportunity if it
ignores Taiwan's appeal for talks on opening transport links across
the Taiwan Strait after next March, Kang Ning-hsiang,
secretary-general of the National Security Council said Friday.</P>
      <P>Kang made the comment after the Executive Yuan unveiled an

mainland earlier in the day and two days after President Chen
Shui-bian said that his administration will begin negotiations with
Beijing over the issue after the next presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>The chief security official said the Executive Yuan's painstaking
assessment was revealed at a time best for Taiwan, the United States

      <P>Kang said Taiwan is slated to hold a presidential election on

November, and the last thing they will see during this period is any
disturbance in Asia, especially across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Beijing leaders will oblige their U.S. counterparts by starting

      <P>Washington would be "very, very nervous" if
the Republic of China were to decide to rename itself, and the United
States would quietly try to persuade it from doing so, although
legally the United States has no say in the matter, Natale Bellocchi,
a former chairman of the American Institute (AIT) in Taiwan said
Friday.</P>
      <P>In a speech to a group of political followers of former President
Lee Teng-hui, Bellocchi said the divisive views among people in
Taiwan about how their country should deal with the sovereignty issue
makes it difficult for Washington to lay down a long-term policy
towards Taiwan.</P>
      <P>From Washington's point of view, Taiwan lacks the willingness to
defend itself. Reports about Taiwan's politicians rubbing shoulders
with Beijing leaders led U.S. political observers to believe they
lack loyalty to their own country, and complicated the U.S.' role in
defending Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Bellocchi said, the administration of U.S. President
George W. Bush is very serious about its obligation to help Taiwan
defend itself, but was puzzled by the fact that Taiwan authorities
have been decreasing the defense budget while mainland China is
aggressively increasing theirs.</P>
      <P>As to the topic of referendums in Taiwan, the former AIT chairman

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPOREAN ENVOY BRIEFS ROC LEGISLATIVE HEAD ON CANCELED MEETINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's representative to Taiwan has
briefed ROC Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on the major
reasons behind Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's decision to
cancel a planned meeting with Wang, legislative sources said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ker Sin Tze, director of the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei,
paid a courtesy call on Wang at the latter's residence Friday to
explain why Goh and Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew had
canceled plans to meet Wang during his planned trip to the Southeast
Asian city-state, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Wang was originally scheduled to visit Singapore and Malaysia
from Aug. 11-15. After Ker informed Wang of the Singaporean leaders'
decision to cancel their planned meetings with Wang last week, Wang
dropped his two-leg overseas travel plan.</P>
      <P>Both Ker and Wang remained low-keyed about their meeting.
According to previous media reports, the Singaporean leaders had
decided to cancel their meeting plans with Wang mainly because of
pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The reports claimed that Beijing was annoyed by President Chen
Shui-bian's repeated describing of the current state of cross-Taiwan
Strait relations as "one state on each side of the strait" and
consequently pressured senior Singaporean officials not to engage any
influential Taiwan politicians like Wang.</P>
      <P>Wang said in private that Beijing's pressure was only one of the
factors that had prompted Singaporean leaders to cancel their plans
to hold talks with Wang. He declined to divulge any details regarding
his talks with Ker a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's diplomatic efforts to isolate Taiwan
internationally, senior Taiwan officials have had difficulties
traveling abroad freely. Early this year, Thailand declined to grant
a visa to Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K. Chiang reportedly due
to pressure from Beijing. Chiang was then forced to cancel his
Southeast Asian travel plan that included a stop in Bangkok.</P>

      <P>According to the online games tournament organizer, Chunghwa

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES MAINLAND LEADERS TO ACCEPT VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the mainland
Chinese leadership Saturday to accept the universal values of
freedom, democracy, peace and human rights.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in his speech delivered at the opening
session of an international seminar on Hong Kong's development under
the Beijing-initiated "one country, two systems" formula. The seminar
was organized by the Taiwan Advocates, a private think tank headed by
former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Since Hong Kong's reversion to mainland Chinese rule in July
1997, Chen said, the former British colony has not seen an economic
boom as many had expected through its integration with the mainland.
On the contrary, he went on, Hong Kong has witnessed an accelerated
industrial "hollowing out" and a significantly higher unemployment
rate over the past six years.</P>
      <P>On the political front, Chen said, Hong Kong is facing a
regression in democracy. Chen said the Hong Kong people's civil
liberties have been restricted to some extent due to Beijing's
concerns. For instance, the Hong Kong people face various kinds of
restrictions in commemorating the Tiananmen Square massacre and
practicing Falun Gong spiritual cultivation due to pressure from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>More than 500,000 Hong Kong citizens took to the streets July 1
to protest the Hong Kong government's plan to enact an
anti-subversion bill which, if passed, would further restrict the
Hong Kong people's civil liberties and rights, Chen said. The massive
protest forced the Hong Kong government to delay the legislation. A
week later, more than 30,000 Hong Kong people staged a sit-in in
front of the territory's Legislative Council calling for political
reform and direct election of its chief executive.</P>
      <P>All these developments caused international concern about the
level of Beijing's sincerity in honoring its "one country, two
systems" promise to maintain Hong Kong's current lifestyle and system
for 50 years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Hong Kong people's protest against the
anti-subversion bill indicated their desire for freedom and full
democracy, Chen said Beijing should respect and protect the Hong Kong
people's right to make choices based on free will.</P>
      <P>Chen said democracy has been the cornerstone of Taiwan's
political and social stability and the island's most precious asset
to ensure its role in the international community.</P>
      <P>"We ought to treasure our hard-won democratic achievements and
throw our full support behind the Hong Kong people's efforts to
safeguard their basic human rights and freedom, " Chen said, adding
that Taiwan must serve as a beacon of hope for Hong Kong's and
mainland China's democratic development.</P>
      <P>More than 700 scholars and experts from home and abroad attended
the seminar.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING, OPPOSITION PARTIES EXCHANGE ACCUSATIONS OF 'VOTE-BUYING'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By LiIian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) and the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) traded attacks
Saturday, accusing each other of offering programs aimed at winning
over voters in the run-up to the presidential election set for March
20, 2004.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chia-chin, the KMT party whip in the Legislature,
noted that the DPP administration has put forward a series of
welfare benefit initiatives totalling around NT$1,700 billion
(US$49.27 billion) since the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Lee and his legislative colleagues Lo Shih-hsiung and Huang
Chien-ting of the KMT released the results of a poll conducted by the
party's think tank the National Policy Foundation Aug. 11-12.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,068 valid responses were collected in the survey
which is said to have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In the poll, 58 percent of the respondents said they believe the
series of programs announced by the administration during the
campaigning for the Aug. 2 Hualien magistrate by-election were put
forward mainly for the purpose of winning more votes. At the same
time, 55 percent of the polled said they think President Chen
Shui-bian's promise to increase pensions for elderly farmers by
NT$1,000 to NT$4,000 is a form of vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 77 percent of the respondents said they believe that
the series of welfare programs recently announced by the president
and the Cabinet were put forward with the next presidential election
in mind, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent said they agree with the notion that the
government should ban the issuing of various kinds of stipends prior
to the presidential election, while 78 percent said they would not
support the ruling party just because of their receiving a stipend or
subsidy.</P>
      <P>Interpreting the results of the survey, Lo said the poll shows
that the people have the wisdom to tell which programs are aimed at
winning over voters. Legislator Huang said that all the political
parties should refrain from using pork-barrel programs to lure voters
and from passing the bill onto future generations.</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT caucus will try to regulate the candidates of
the various parties to keep them from introducing new
welfare programs, unless they are financially feasible, in the
period prior to a presidential election through a revision of the law
or through legislation of a special law to prohibit such
"vote-buying" practices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP official rebutted Lee's accusations, saying
that it is the KMT that is trying to win votes with its own
proposals.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, DPP party whip in the Legislature, said that the
programs alleged by the KMT to be pork-barrel programs include the
Resolution Trust Company (RTC) Fund, the expansion of public
construction and job creation programs. Chen pointed out that these
programs are aimed at reconstructing the nation's financial order,
stimulating the economy and increasing employment, which he said are
goals that will benefit the nation, and not any specific groups.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, Chen said, the opposition parties were opposed to
these programs during the review process simply for opposition's
sake. He added that even after the implementation of the programs,
the opposition parties have tried to smear the DPP by saying the
administration is only trying to win votes.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that it is the KMT that tries to win voters under
the guise of promoting welfare programs, saying that the KMT over the
past 50 years, in order to maintain what he called its authoritarian
rule, had appropriated an exorbitant budget for certain groups of
people. He cited as an example the more than NT$500 billion put
toward the renovation of residential complexes for military personnel
and their dependents.</P>
      <P>He also said that it is "stunning" to see that the KMT has over
the past two months rashly proposed a series of programs, including
stipends for elderly farmers and subsidies for students of NT$5,000
per month, which he claimed would cost the government NT$286 billion
per year.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
he hopes the first group of female graduates from the Ketagalan
Institute, an academy run by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), will become reform pioneers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at the graduation ceremony of the first
group of women leaders to graduate from the Ketagalan Institute. The
aim of the institute, established in April this year, is to cultivate
future leaders of the country.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chen told the women graduates that the
level of a country's gender equality is an indicator of how developed
a country is.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that in the male-dominated Taiwan society of the past,
women were asked to take care of family affairs and were discouraged
from getting involved in public affairs, and without knowing it, were
deprived of the opportunity to strive for their rights. He stressed
that once given a fair chance and equal footing, women can perform as
well as men.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the female graduates to join hands in reforming
society.</P>
      <P>The first group of 45 women leaders to graduate from the
Ketagalan Institute includes lawyers, medical doctors, government
officials, lawmakers and business executives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR NARROWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The average income of Taiwan households has
increased while the gap between the rich and poor has narrowed,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the comments following the release of statistics
on household income by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) the previous day as he visited Taipei County
to inspect the implementation of the government's job creation
initiative.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that the average disposable income of
Taiwan households was NT$73,000 (US$2,116) per month last year. The
average disposable income of the top 20 percent of households, at
NT$1,799,733, was 6.16 times that of the bottom 20 percent of
households, slightly lower than the figure of 6.39 registered for
2001.</P>
      <P>DGBAS Director General Liu San-chi attributed the decline to the
government's job creation initiative, which has helped middle-aged
and older people find jobs, resulting in a decrease in the number of
households where no member is working or earning money.</P>
      <P>The economy has also rebounded from the previous year's
doldrums, and the income of low-income and medium-income families has
increased, while the income of rich families has decreased because of
low interest rates, Liu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu said that the average income of the bottom 20 percent
of households for 2002 was 5.1 percent higher than that of the
preceding year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy registered growth of 3.6 percent for last year,
higher than the U.S. economy's 2.4 percent and the E.U. economy's 0.1
percent, showing that Taiwan's economic performance is above average,
the premier said.</P>
      <P>He also said the gap between the rich and poor in Taiwan based on
a comparison of the top 20 percent of households and the bottom 20
percent was smaller than that of South Korea, Singapore, the United
States or Hong Kong, although it was larger than Japan's.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics showed that higher education also brings
higher income. Those who have graduate school education or above have
a yearly income of more than NT$1 million on average, while those who
have no formal education or are illiterate only earn about NT$110,000
per year. Those who have college or university education have a
yearly income of NT$750,000 on average.</P>
      <P>In terms of cities and counties, Taipei continued to top all
others last year with an average annual household income of NT$1.51
million, followed by Hsinchu City at NT$1.3 million, and Hsinchu
County, Taoyuan County, Taipei County, Taichung City and Kaohsiung
City, in that order.</P>
      <P>The offshore island of Penghu was at the bottom of the list in
2001, but Chiayi County dropped to last place for 2002 with an
average annual household income of NT$730,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ILLEGALS FROM M'LAND COULD THREATEN TAIWAN'S DISEASE CONTROL: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The steady stream of illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants could pose a threat to Taiwan's disease
control system, a local official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lai Hsieh-yi, director of the detention center for illegal
mainland Chinese immigrants that is located in Hsinchu, northern
Taiwan, said medical care for illegal immigrants from the mainland
has become a heavy financial burden for the detention center.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the Hsinchu center specializes in holding
female illegal immigrants from mainland China. Before last week when
129 of the detainees were sent to the frontline island of Matsu for
repatriation, the center held 835 detainees.</P>
      <P>"The vacancies have all been filled over the past few days, " Lai
said, adding that many of the newcomers are sick or suffering from
emotional problems. Some of them had even tried to kill themselves
while being detained at police offices in various parts of the
island, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that repatriation has been hindered by mainland China's
reluctance to cooperate, Lai said 115 detainees have been held at
the center for more than six months and that 15 have been held for
more than a year. "We have always had a packed house," he complained.</P>
      <P>Among the detainees, 52 are venereal disease patients, 32 are
pregnant and 14 have recently given birth. The center now has 15
babies, including a pair of twin boys. Worse still, Lai said, two of
the detainees have been confirmed to be carriers of HIV -- the virus
that causes AIDS.</P>
      <P>"The center doesn't have a medical service office. We have to
rely on the government-owned Hsinchu Hospital to offer outpatient
clinical services for the illegal immigrants," Lai said.</P>
      <P>"The hospital sends staff members to the center twice a week.
Medical care is a heavy financial burden for us," he noted.</P>
      <P>As all medical services for detainees are free of charge, Lai
said some mainland people have allegedly entered Taiwan mainly for
medical reasons. According to Lai, some illegal immigrants from the
mainland surrendered themselves to local police stations immediately
after landing on the island.</P>
      <P>"They are then able to receive free medical treatment at the
detention center and recover before being repatriated," he said,
addign that they don't need to spend a dime and that some of them
gain a lot of weight during their stay at the detention center.</P>
      <P>Lai recalled how two inmates who had to receive insulin
injections each day to treat their diabetes vowed before being
repatriated earlier this year to make every possible effort to
"return" to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In 2001, he said, the center spent more than NT$1 million on
medical treatment for its detainees. "The amount surged to NT$2.04
million last year, and the total medical bill for the first seven
months of this year hit NT$1.5 million."</P>
      <P>Government tallies show that a total of 2,286 illegal immigrants
from mainland China, including 380 males and 1,904 females, are
currently being held at various detention centers around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lai said he is worried that more illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants remain at large in Taiwan. "These people might be carriers
of certain diseases and could pose a threat to the nation's disease
prevention and control system," he added.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) caucus
leader in the Legislative Yuan said Saturday that the party will give
priority in the next legislative session to the revisions to a bill
concerning relations between the two sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chia-chin said the move is to correspond to the
promise made recently by President Chen Shui-bian that his
administration will push for the opening of direct transportation
links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait under a three-stage
program.</P>
      <P>An Executive Yuan assessment report on the impact of opening such
links was unveiled Friday following Chen's promise to show the
determination and sincerity of the administration in pushing for
direct transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, Lee noted that Chen's remarks on the opening of
cross-strait transport links in three stages has caused mixed
reactions among the pro-Taiwan independence faction in the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes that the DPP might support the links with
mainland China openly but oppose it in secret to calm down the
pro-independence faction.</P>
      <P>To test the sincerity of the DPP in pushing for the cross-strait
links, Lee said the KMT, which is still gauging the order of hundreds
of bills, will place the revisions to the statute governing the
relations of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as their
priority in the next legislative session which will open in
September.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks have caused mixed reactions, with businesspeople
with operations in mainland China expressing their support and
opposition parties calling for negotiations for the opening of such
links to start immediately instead of after next year's presidential
election in March as promised by Chen.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties have opined that Chen's three-stage
program for the links, for which he promised to launch negotiations
with Beijing after the presidential election and to implement by the
end of next year, is an empty campaign promise.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese students in the United Kingdom
have been collecting signatures to protest against a British
government decision to charge a fee to foreigners applying to extend
their stay in the country.</P>
      <P>The Home Office of the British government announced in July that
from Aug. 1, foreign nationals living in the United Kingdom that
apply for an extension will have to pay an application processing
fee.</P>
      <P>Postal applications will cost 155 pounds (US$248) , with premium
'same day' service for those applying in person costing 255 pounds,
the office announced.</P>
      <P>After receiving the notice from the Home Office, the Taiwanese
students presented their complaint to the office, arguing that the
tuition paid by foreign students in the United Kingdom is several
times higher than that paid by British nationals, and the visa
extension charge will represent an additional financial burden.</P>
      <P>They expressed the hope that the British government will
reconsider the decision. However, the Home Office has not made any

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD URGES BEIJING TO READ ASSESSMENT REPORT ON DIRECT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Aug.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of
mainland China policy said Saturday that direct cross-strait
transportation links will be mutually beneficial and urged Beijing to
first read Taiwan's assessment report on such links before making a
response.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
made the remarks after Zhang Mingqing, a spokesman for Taiwan Affairs
Office under mainland China's State Council, commented the
previous day that Taiwan is not sincere about implementing the
cross-strait direct transportation links despite the assessment
report.</P>
      <P>Despite President Chen Shui-bian's announcement earlier this week
of wanting to implement the links by the end of 2004, Zhang noted
that Chen had said the same thing three years ago but failed to
deliver. Zhang said that Chen's words are insignificant and lack
sincerity.</P>
      <P>On Zhang's comment that the ban on straight flights across the
Taiwan Strait under the direct links as put forward in the assessment
means the direct flights would not be direct but instead detoured,
Tsai said that the ban was included out of national security
considerations and that the Ministry of National Defense insisted on
this point.</P>
      <P>"The government is serious about the establishment of
cross-strait transportation," Tsai said, asking Beijing "not to have
too much political consideration" and to cast aside considerations of
the presidential election in Taiwan set for March 20, 2004 in order to
get negotiations started as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait transportation links will be beneficial to both
sides," Tsai said, urging Beijing to seriously consider the issue.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks after speaking on cross-strait relations at
 the Ketagalan Academy, a school run by the ruling Democratic
 Progressive Party (DPP) to nurture future leaders of the nation.</P>
      <P>Tsai said at the institute that cross-strait relations have
changed in nature, pointing out that the DPP administration has in
fact renounced the goal upheld by previous KMT administrations of
reclaiming mainland China, and that it is now seeking a new policy.</P>
      <P>She said that the DPP administration is handling cross-strait
relations well and that the relations are basically stable.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that faced with increasing business and trade
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, the administration is focusing on
reasonable exchanges and on revising the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area, as well as working out possible cross-strait developments over
the next five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT CALLS ON BEIJING NOT TO REJECT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Asuncion, Aug. 15 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu urged the
mainland Chinese leadership Friday not to reject Taiwan and instead
to pay more heed to Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>Lu made the call while attending a dinner in Asuncion, Paraguay,
given by the members of the local Chinese community in her honor.</P>
      <P>Noting that she originally planned to visit Boeing Co. during her
upcoming transit stop in Seattle on her way back to Taiwan, Lu said
that to the best of her knowledge, mainland China has pressured
Boeing to refuse her visit.</P>
      <P>Referring to the mainland leadership as "stingy" for such
behavior, Lu said that Beijing's efforts to isolate Taiwan in the
international arena will only alienate the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has consistently spared no effort in pressuring
foreign governments not to accept visits from the ROC's president and
vice president.</P>
      <P>"And now, they have expanded their scope to even private
corporations, " Lu lamented, adding that as a country with a
population of 1.3 billion, mainland China should be more generous and
more broad-minded.</P>
      <P>Lu said the mainland leadership should learn from Cuban President
Fidel Castro who told Lu a day earlier that he is opposed to war and
hopes to see the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resolve their
disputes peacefully.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu signed a joint statement with new
Paraguayan Vice President Luis Alberto Castiglioni reaffirming their
governments' commitment to further boosting bilateral exchanges and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The statement said the two countries will work together to
promote world peace, democracy, human rights and sustainable
development. It further said the two countries will forge a strategic
alliance to facilitate cooperation in various fields.</P>
      <P>The Paraguayan government also pledged continued support for
Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and other major international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Castiglioni accepted Lu's invitation to visit Taiwan
in the near future. The itinerary will be finalized in the next few
weeks, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu, heading a 43-member entourage, arrived in Paraguay Wednesday
after a three-day official visit to Panama. She attended Paraguayan
President Nicanor Duarte Frutos' inaugural ceremony on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian Friday morning. A total of 95 foreign
delegations, including many top leaders of Latin American countries,
attended Duarte's inauguration.</P>
      <P>On Friday afternoon, Lu met with Panamanian First Vice President
Arturo Vallarino for wide-ranging talks. Vallarino was in Argentina
when Lu visited Panama earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Vallarino, who is scheduled to make a private visit to mainland
China later this month, assured Lu that Panama will not switch its
diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Vallarino said his upcoming mainland visit is primarily aimed at
promoting commercial exchanges with the mainland. As Panamanian
businesspeople hope to tap the vast mainland market, Vallarino said
he will travel to the mainland with some Panamanian trade promoters
to inspect the general market trends there.</P>
      <P>Vallarino said his visit will by no means undermine Panama's
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso and Panama Second Vice
President Dominador Kaiser Bazan made similar assurances to Lu during
her visit in Panama.</P>
      <P>Moscoso will visit Taipei next week to sign a free trade
agreement (FTA) with ROC President Chen Shui-bian. Vallarino said he
hopes the two countries will boost cooperation in export processing
zone operations after the FTA is signed.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is more than willing to assist Panama in exporting
agricultural and fishery products to the United States once the FTA
is signed.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu also met with Guatemalan Vice President
Franciso Reyes who assured Lu that his country will continue to
support Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Lu will wrap up her Paraguay visit after giving a news conference
and touring a children's day care center Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>She had made transit stops in Hawaii and Los Angeles en route to
Panama. On her way back to Taiwan Aug. 20, Lu is scheduled to make a
transit stop in Seattle for two days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO COMMERCIALLY UTILIZE DEEP-SEA WATER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has decided to set up an
industrial complex in Taitung in eastern Taiwan to use deep-sea
water in aquaculture and manufacturing of health drinks and
cosmetics, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) oficial said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The official from the MOEA's Water Resource Agency (WRA) said the
ministry will first build a research center in Taitung to study
the sea water 200 meters below the surface and ways to develop
products using deep-sea water.</P>
      <P>According to the official, deep-sea water accounts for 95 percent
of total sea water. "Deep-sea water refers to sea water 200 meters
to 1,000 meters below the surface," the official said, adding that
deep-sea water is clean and rich in nutrients and minerals.</P>
      <P>Deep-sea water is almost bacteria-free and can be used for
multiple purposes, the official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taitung is located near a continental shelf, the
official said the eastern Taiwan county is an ideal location to house
the island's first industrial complex using deep-sea water for
commercial purposes.</P>
      <P>The official said the WRA will come up with a blueprint for
commercially utilizing deep-sea water next March and
unveil a package of regulations governing investment in the new
industrial park and management of companies using deep-sea
water by the end of June next year.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the official said, the deep-sea
water industrial complex will accommodate aquaculture farms,
health drinks and foodstuff processing facilities as well as
cosmetic firms.</P>
      <P>The industrial complex will also cooperate with tourist
operators in developing ecotourism in eastern Taiwan, the
official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' NOT SUITABLE FOR TAIWAN: FORMER AIT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former top U.S. liaison officer with
Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic ties said in Taipei Saturday that
the "one country, two systems" formula cherished by mainland China is
not at all suitable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nat Bellocchi, former chairman of the American Institute in
Taiwan, made the comments at an international seminar on Hong Kong's
development under Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula. The
seminar was sponsored by the Taiwan Advocates, a private think tank
headed by former ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Bellocchi said that there are similarities between Taiwan and
Hong Kong in terms of their relations with mainland China, but he
added that the similarities are only on the economic level, not the
political level.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that both Taiwan and Hong Kong pump production
technology and capital into the mainland, saying both places have
contributed significantly to mainland China's high economic growth.</P>
      <P>But he said that there are more differences than similarities
between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In terms of historical background and political systems, the "one
country, two systems" formula is not suitable for Taiwan, he said,
adding that the Taiwan people have to reflect deeply on the
differences between this system and Taiwan's present system.</P>
      <P>Noting that freedom is the top priority in Taiwan's democratic
system, he said the Hong Kong people want to seek more freedom but
are subjugated by the regime in Beijing which is against democracy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council official and
an economics expert pointed out on the same occasion that the "one
country, two system" formula is unlikely to succeed.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-tong, MAC vice chairman, said that the formula is
contradictory in nature, noting that an authoritarian regime cannot
uphold a free and open society.</P>
      <P>On whether the Hong Kong people will be able to elect their chief
executive someday, Chen said that democracy will not come in a single
day. He expressed the hope that Hong Kong will learn from Taiwan's
experience and that it will adopt a gradual and evolutionary method
in prying open political room and help in the dawning of democracy in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-feng, vice president of the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research, observed that the power of the Hong Kong chief
executive comes from Beijing, and not from Hong Kong people, pointing
out that Beijing is pulling the strings in Hong Kong behind him.</P>
      <P>Chang said that from observing Hong Kong, one can see that even
the most basic freedoms are threatened.</P>
      <P>He concluded by saying that only after Taiwan and Hong Kong move
toward freedom and democracy can they push mainland China to forego
its authoritarian rule.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S METAMORPHOSIS ATTRIBUTABLE TO 'DE-LINKING' WITH CHINA: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday
Taiwan's successful economic reform and political transformation
could be attributed to its forsaking unrealistic links with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech delivered at an international seminar on Hong
Kong's development under the Beijing-initiated "one country, two
systems" formula, Lee said Taiwan has managed to liberalize its
economy and democratize its political system over the past decade
mainly because it has pragmatically developed its own national
identity and based its policy purely on the well-being of the
island's 23 million people.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan had continued claiming itself as the sole
legitimate representative of China in the past decade, Lee
said, Taiwan would not have been able to complete a series
of economic and democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee acknowledged that Taiwan still faces challenges
in developing its independent national identity. While
Beijing continues pressing Taiwan to accept its "one China" principle
which downgrades Taiwan to a province under Beijing's jurisdiction,
Lee said, pro-unification forces inside Taiwan will also hinder the
island's pursuit of a separate national identity.</P>
      <P>Lee further said Taiwan must not solely rely on the mainland
market for its economic growth. "We must instead step up domestic
investment, accelerate industrial upgrading and technology
development as well as globalize business operation in order to
sustain our economic growth," he urged, adding that the mainland
market should serve as only one of local enterprises' overseas
investment destinations.</P>
      <P>Touching on Hong Kong's current economic and political
plights, Lee said, the former British colony has gradually lost its
independent identity and become increasingly reliant on the
mainland since its reversion to Beijing's rule in 1997.</P>
      <P>Under the "one country, two systems" formula, Lee said, Hong Kong
will lose its momentum for pursuing its own goal in the long
run and its current liberal lifestyle will also be at stake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU SUPPORTS IN PRINCIPLE KMT-PFP ABSENTEE VOTING PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) agreed in principle Sunday with a "pan-blue alliance" proposal
to allow Taiwan voters to cast ballots in the upcoming presidential
election even if they are not residing where they were registered to
vote.</P>
      <P>The solidarity ends there, however, as the two disagree about how
to deal with Taiwan residents living in mainland China and dual
passport holders living abroad.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance, " composed of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) , want to include these two
classes of potential voters in the absentee voter plan, but the TSU
wants them excluded.</P>
      <P>Cheng Jhen-long, a TSU party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
all ROC citizens have the right to vote and their rights should not
be taken way because they are away from the places where they
registered.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng pointed out that those potential voters living in
mainland China and those who live elsewhere around the world and are
dual passport holders should be excluded to protect the integrity of
their votes. Cheng said that the exclusion would prevent the absentee
voters from being unduly influenced by outside forces.</P>
      <P>Cheng said dual passport holders should be excluded because of
the questions that could arise surrounding their loyalty to the
country, while mainland-based Taiwanese business people should also
be excluded based on the fact that Taiwan and mainland China are
technically in a hostile state and that Taiwan maintains no
organizations in mainland China that have public credibility.</P>
      <P>Not everyone agreed with the proposal on absentee voting,
however.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a legislative party whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said he was against the idea, saying that
the program would not be viable, at least currently, since there is
no way to know whether the absentee voters were marking and mailing
their own ballots.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP will introduce the proposal in the new
Legislative Yuan session in September.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" lawmakers are also planning to propose
additional legislation in the form of an amendment to the
Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law to allow
different political parties to jointly field one ticket in the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>There is currently nothing on the books prohibiting such a
coalition, but the "pan-blue alliance" hopes to get the amendment
passed to solidify the legitimacy of their bi-party presidential
ticket.</P>
      <P>If the two amendments are passed in the next legislative session,
the mainland China-based Taiwanese business people, numbering about
500,000, would be included in the March 20, 2004 presidential
election.</P>

      <P>Direct transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait will have a grave impact on Taiwan's security since
mainland China has never forsaken its hostility toward Taiwan,
Minister of National Defense Tang Yiau-min said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Tang said direct cross-Taiwan Strait transportation links must
follow the "point-to-point and fixed route" principle to avoid having
Taiwan's national security compromised.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference Friday where the nation's first
assessment report on the impact of direct cross-strait transportation
was unveiled, Tang said the military would face daunting challenges
in talks about opening direct shipping or flights across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>It is, therefore, the military's responsibility to come up with
well-devised measures to meet the needs arise from the opening, Tang
noted.</P>
      <P>According to Beijing's defense white paper, Tang said, mainland
authorities will never renounce the use of force against Taiwan and
will not allow the current separation of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Tang said, mainland China has adjusted its military
deployment by placing emphasis on its southeastern coastal region
that lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang said mainland China has deployed more guided ballistic
missiles and new types of fighters, warships and submarines in its
southeastern provinces, and the People's Liberation Army regularly
conducts combined services drills with Taiwan as the objective.</P>
      <P>Although the Taiwan Strait provides a natural buffer for Taiwan,
Tang said direct cross-strait flights will pose a grave threat to
Taiwan's security as it takes only three to five minutes for mainland
Chinese jet fighters to reach Taiwan should the fighters take off
from Pingtan in Fujian province heading to Hsinchu. The distance
between the two points is only 70 nautical miles, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Ministry of National Defense officials said there were examples
in the West where military fighters camouflaged as civilian passenger
airplanes were used to attack and bomb countries during wartime.</P>
      <P>Officials wondered who would guarantee that mainland Chinese
airplanes or ships crossing the Strait are not equipped with
monitoring equipment for military espionage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many Taiwan academics and scholars who are familiar
with national defense and related affairs said the nation should
attach equal importance to defense preparedness and direct
cross-strait transportation links.</P>
      <P>The scholars said they support increased budgets for the military
to avoid opening direct cross-strait transportation links at the cost
of Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>Prof. Chang Wu-yueh from Tamkang University said the armed forces
should be prepared for any military situation, whether there will be
direct cross-strait transportation links or not.</P>
      <P>The people's psychological defense, which could be reduced once
direct cross-strait transportation links are opened, is a more
important issue to tackle, Chang noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PARTIES RESERVED ABOUT SPECIAL BUDGET FOR ARM PURCHASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense's request
for a special budget of NT$520 billion (US$15.15 billion) next year
to acquire arms already offered from the United States was greeted
with reservation Sunday from the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>The defense ministry will need the funds to acquire six batteries
of Patriot Advance Capability, or PAC-3, missiles, two long-range
radar systems, eight diesel submarines, and 12 P-3 Orion sub-hunting
surveillance aircraft.</P>
      <P>The United States has agreed to sell these weapons to Taiwan, but
Taipei has had difficulty coming up with the funds to buy them all.
It prompted Washington officials to doubt Taiwan's determination to
defend itself.</P>
      <P>The special budget, more than double the current defense budget
of NT$260 billion (US$7.62 billion) for 2003, is expected to be
present to the Legislative Yuan for approval in the next legislative
session beginning September.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said it is better for the Legislative Yuan to approve this
budget before the presidential election in March, 2004.</P>
      <P>Noting that the military balance across the Taiwan Strait will
tilt toward the mainland in the next two to four years, Lee said the
armed forces needs some time to be trained to use any new equipment
and integrate it into the defense system, and that there is no time
to waste.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Taiwan will choose a new president next March, which
is certain to preempt any defense issues in the Legislative Yuan, and
the budget will be further delayed if a new administration emerges
after the election, but the country's security cannot be postponed.</P>
      <P>His view was questioned by PFP Legislator Chiu Yi, who said the
Legislative Yuan should not deal with such a huge budget before the
presidential election.</P>
      <P>If the election results in a new government, it is better to
leave the question to the new government and give it a free hand in
dealing with it.</P>
      <P>PFP whip at the Legislative Yuan Lin Yu-fang said the budget for
arms acquisition would be better prepared as an ordinary budget rather
than a special budget so that the legislature could examine its
details easier.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan should not avoid the legislature's supervision
of the arms purchase by hiding it in a special budget as all budgets
are financed by the government's revenues and should be monitored by
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lee Chia-ching, the KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan,
also questioned the appropriateness of purchasing arms with a special
budget. Lee warning that the country's has already run up a debt of
NT$4.79 trillion (US$139.52 billion) and additional debt of NT$520
billion, which has to be raised through loans, could be crippling for
the government and the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURERS NEED TO ADVANCE R&amp;D AND LOGISTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan electronics manufacturers operating
in mainland China need to advance their research and development
capabilities and logistics to maintain their advantages in that
market, according a survey report released by the National Science
Council Sunday.</P>
      <P>The report says that the electronics industries on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait are closely correlated, with 70 percent of the
mainland electronics manufacturers doing business directly or
indirectly with their Taiwanese counterparts.</P>
      <P>While most Taiwanese electronics manufacturers decided to move
their production lines to the mainland to cut down production costs
and to have easier access to the market, in recent years, increasing
numbers of Taiwanese investors have made the efficiency of local
government and the living environment their major elements of
consideration, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In terms of market strategies, most of the Taiwanese
manufacturers on the mainland delivered their products as OEMs
(original equipment manufacturers) and ODMs (other design and
manufacturers) for international brand companies. The profit margins
of the Taiwanese companies were squeezed whenever these international
corporation engaged in a price war, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The report points out that the Taiwanese manufacturers should
watch closely the market developments on the mainland, as the
electronics industry there has gradually developed its own supply
chain of parts and components.</P>
      <P>For many years, the electronics manufacturers on the mainland,
including Taiwanese investments, purchased the lion's share of parts
and components from Taiwan for their assembly plants. With the
establishment of its own supply chain, electronics manufacturers on
the mainland have reduced their reliance on Taiwan, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that the electronics industry in Taiwan must
advance its capabilities in research and development and maintain its
advantages in logistic management.</P>
      <P>While many Taiwanese electronics manufacturers have kept their
operational headquarters in Taiwan after moving their production
lines to the mainland, logistic expertise, including inventory
management and other backups, remain an advantage for Taiwan's
electronics industry.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain their international competitiveness, the
Taiwan electronics manufacturers must advance their capabilities in
global logistics, the report says.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors suggested
that as Taiwan's monetary market becomes more and more
internationalized and liberalized, the long-term trend will see
authorities allowing hedge funds.</P>
      <P>An executive of a foreign investment and trust company said
Sunday that since the government announced in July that as a
deregulation approach of the capital market, the qualified foreign
institutional investors (QFII) system will be suspended by the end of
this year, foreign institutional investors are very concerned about
the possibilities of offering hedge funds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A hedge fund is a fund that can take both long and short
positions, use arbitrage, buy and sell undervalued securities, trade
options or bonds, and invest in almost any opportunity in any market
where it foresees impressive gains at reduced risk.</P>
      <P>Hedge funds are not approved by authorities in many parts of the
world, including Taiwan, especially after the Asian crisis when hedge
funds were mostly associated with negativity.</P>
      <P>An executive of an European investment and trust company said
that currently, daily buying and selling in the Taiwan stock exchange
by foreign institutional investors amounted to tens of billions of NT
dollars on the average, while at least 10 percent of the money was
managed by hedge funds with detour methods.</P>
      <P>He said that it is anticipated that with the lifting of the QFII
restrictions, hedge funds will become ever more active in Taiwan's
capital market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG SERVES AS A MIRROR FOR TAIWAN: FORMER PRESIDENT LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong serves as a mirror for Taiwan of
the failure of the "one country, two systems" formula that has been
imposed on the former British colony since its reversion to Beijing
rule in 1997, former President Lee Teng-hui said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Through this mirror, Taiwan sees only disillusion and danger in
terms of "one country, two systems, " said Lee during the second day
of an international seminar which opened Saturday on Hong Kong's
development under Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula which.
The seminar was sponsored by Taiwan Advocates, a private think tank
headed by Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee said Hong Kong's political and economic quagmire over the
past six years is a testament to the depletion of Hong Kong's
sovereignty and autonomy that has been caused by the "one country,
two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Under the program, Hong Kong has no other option but to be
controlled under the "one country, " framework, Lee said, adding that
the illusion of "two systems" has contributed nothing to Hong Kongers
but only helped reduce their pursuit of the goal of self
identification.</P>
      <P>From observing Hong Kong, Lee said, one can see the differences
that Taiwan can make for itself.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has managed to liberalize its economy and
democratize its political system over the past decade mainly because
it has pragmatically developed its own national identity and based
its policy purely on the well-being of the island's 23 million
people.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan had continued claiming itself as the sole legitimate
representative of China in the past decade, Lee said, Taiwan would
not have been able to complete a series of economic and democratic
reforms.</P>
      <P>Lee said if Taiwan had not chosen to promote pragmatic diplomacy
and advocated that Taiwan represents the 23 million people living on
the island, Taiwan would have no room for international development.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan continued to rely on the mainland Chinese market for
its economic growth, Taiwan would eventually end up being a satellite
manufacturing plant of China, and would be known as the "world's
factory," Lee said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong Legislative Council Members James
To and Emily Lau were denounced Sunday after they spoke Saturday in
an international seminar on "Hong Kong under 'one country, two
systems'" in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The pro-Beijing Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao reported Sunday that
To, Lau, and three scholars "talked down" Hong Kong and the "one
country, two systems" formula. They said the proposed enactment of
Hong Kong's state security law, also known as Article 23 of the Basic
Law, will have an impact on human rights and freedom of the press and
effectively gag the news media in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The report said Li Gwojiang, a committee member of the mainland
Chinese National People's Consultative Conference, "condemned these
irresponsible remarks for putting a negative label on the "one
country, two systems" formula." They were accused of attempting to
promote Taiwan independence and smear the formula for national
unification.

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES TO BE FOCAL POINT IN 2004 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait issues are set to
become the focal point in the 2004 presidential campaign, as comments
recently made by President Chen Shui-bian on Taiwan-mainland ties
were criticized by the opposition parties, political observers said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chang and People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong have in a low-key fashion
responded to Chen's claims made last week that "there is one country
on either side of the Taiwan Strait" and that "direct cross-strait
transportation ties will be completed in three stages by the end of
2004."</P>
      <P>Criticizing Chen's direct transportation links promise as a
"rubber check, " Lien declared that he would immediately launch
two-way negotiations on the issue as long as he wins the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman said he would work to forge the much-expected
direct transportation links across the Strait without any hesitation
if elected president because it is an issue that is very much in the
interests of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Soong called Chen's claims "sheer election language, " and said
if the president was sincere, why not make the move now instead of
waiting until the end of next year?</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, head of the cross-Taiwan Strait political
affairs task force under the KMT-PFP alliance, said Chen's statements
about "one country on either side" and "direct links" are a
two-pronged strategy with which the president is trying to secure the
support of the traditional pro-independence backers while at the same
time garnering greater backing from "middle of the road" voters.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the KMT and the PFP are working actively on a
"Taiwan development blueprint, " in which the two parties will
clearly outline the goals of bilateral economic relations, the
measures to protect Taiwan business interests on the mainland and a
concrete timetable on the direct transportation links.</P>
      <P>Former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Su Chi said Chen
has launched an ideological strike against the KMT and warned the KMT
not to dance to Chen's tune. He urged Chen to make it clear which
country he was referring to when talking about "one country on either
side."</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Lee Chia-chin said Chen's strategy to tie in
the "one country on either side" concept with the direct links issue
will make the links impossible to be realized, despite an apparent
fact that his direct links promise is aimed at soliciting ballots
from mainland-based Taiwan businessmen and their families.</P>
      <P>Stressing that a legal framework is required to carry out the
direct transportation links, Lee expressed the hope that the MAC
would devise a timetable and include it into the revised draft of the
Statute Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area, which is waiting for approval by the
Legislative Yuan in the next session.</P>
      <P>Echoing the comments by MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung that
national and economic affairs, rather than foreign affairs, will have
greater leverage in a presidential race, analysts said delicate
cross-strait issues will unavoidably become the focus of the debate
between the ruling and opposition camps prior to the coming
presidential poll in March 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VOLUNTEER GROUP ARRIVES IN GAMBIA TO PROVIDE MEDICAL SERVICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A volunteer group organized by the Taiwan
Roots Medical Peace Corps (TRMPC) has kicked off a 10-day tour of
providing free medical service in the West African state of Gambia, a
spokesman for the Taipei-based charity organization said Monday.</P>
      <P>The 21-member group, headed by TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun,
arrived in Banjul, Gambia's capital, early Monday, the spokesman
said, adding that the delegation will begin providing free medical
service in Fatoto, one of the farthest inland villages in Gambia,
after meeting with Gambian Health Minister Yankuba Kassama later in
the day.</P>
      <P>Gambia is a malaria-stricken area and has limited medical
facilities and professional health care staff. Only those who
contract mild ailments can receive treatment in Gambia, while those
afflicted with major diseases are usually sent to European countries
for treatment. Gambia's infant mortality rate is 0.85 percent, and
its life expectancy is only about 44 years.</P>
      <P>During its 10-day tour, the spokesman said, the TRMPC group will
offer free medical services in densely populated townships near
Banjul as well as in remote villages, including one village that
borders Senegal.</P>
      <P>The group includes four physicians, three dentists, two
pharmacists, four nurses and several other volunteer workers. Many of
them have rich experience in offering volunteer medical services in
Liberia, Swaziland, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru. The group is
scheduled to return to Taiwan Aug. 31.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO PUSH FOR ABSENTEE VOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will push
for the implementation of absentee voting to allow Republic of China
voters to cast their ballots in the 2004 presidential election even
if they are away from the places where they registered, the KMT
legislative caucus said Monday.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus will push for the passage of an amendment to the
Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Law so as to
allow the some 1 million ROC voters residing overseas, including
those in mainland China, to cast absentee ballots via correspondence,
said Lee Chia-chin, a KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is hoped that the amendment will be introduced and
passed in September when the new Legislative Yuan session begins.</P>
      <P>Noting that voting is one of the basic rights of ROC citizens
aged 20 and over, Lee said their right to elect the president should
not be compromised because they are away from the place where they
registered.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao, a former party whip, said this is
not the first time that the KMT has proposed the absentee voting
plan. Actually, he said, the KMT has made similar proposals many
times before at the Legislative Yuan, but all have been killed by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>If the absentee voting amendment is again ambushed during the
upcoming legislative session, Lee said, the KMT will demand that the
administration at least allow the opening of "voting chartered
flights" across the Taiwan Strait in the days prior to the
presidential election day, set for March 20, 2004, to facilitate
mainland China-based Taiwan businesspeople voting. Mainland-based
Taiwan businesspeople currently number about 500,000.</P>
      <P>Lee, meanwhile, noted that the KMT will also push for the opening
of faster and more convenient transportation links between Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen and the mainland Chinese port city of
Xiamen in Fujian Province as another channel to facilitate voting by
the mainland-based voters.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wang Chung-yu urged the government to build up an
absentee voting system as quickly as possible to allow the 1 million
ROC citizens who have endeavored to live overseas and have
contributed to Taiwan's economic prosperity, to enjoy their right to
vote.</P>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , an ally of the
ruling DPP, said Sunday that it agrees in principle with the KMT
proposal to allow ROC voters to cast ballots in the upcoming
presidential election via correspondence, but only on the condition
that those living in mainland China and those with dual citizenship
living abroad be excluded.</P>
      <P>Cheng Jhen-long, a TSU party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
these ROC citizens should be excluded in order to protect the
integrity of their voting rights, claiming that their exclusion would
prevent the absentee voters from being unduly influenced by outside
forces.</P>
      <P>Cheng said dual passport holders should be excluded because of
the questions that could arise surrounding their loyalty to the
country, while mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople should also be
excluded based on the fact that Taiwan and mainland China are
technically in a hostile state and that Taiwan maintains no
organizations in mainland China that have public credibility.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a legislative party whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), on Sunday voice his opposition to the idea,
saying that the program would not be viable, at least at the present
time, since there would be no way to verify whether the absentee
voters were marking and mailing their own ballots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANAGEMENT GURU TO PRESENT POLICY INITIATIVES TO PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Wang
Yung-ching said Monday that he cannot understand why the government
will wait until late next year to open direct cross-Taiwan Strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>Wang was referring to President Chen Shui-bian's announcement
last week that his administration has come up with a three-phase plan
to promote direct cross-strait transportation, with the goal of
opening direct shipping and flight services by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Wang, widely known as a management guru, didn't go into detail
about his views on Chen's announcement. Instead, he said he plans to
present a letter to Premier Yu Shyi-kun in the near future offering
some policy initiatives.</P>
      <P>During the previous Kuomintang administration, Wang once
presented a 10,000-word letter to then-President Lee Teng-hui calling
for an overhaul of the cherished "go slow, be patient" policy toward
mainland China and for an early opening of direct cross-strait
transportation links.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Wang said he would urge the current Democratic
Progressive Party administration to halt construction on the
controversial Fourth Nuclear Power Plant and to scrap the state-owned
Taiwan Power Co.'s project to build a natural gas-powered electricity
generation plant in Taoyuan County's Tatan township.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wang said, the cost of building a coal-fueled
thermal power plant is much lower. Moreover, he said turning the
Tatan plant into a coal-fueled power plant will contribute to the
development of Taoyuan's Kuantang into a commercial harbor with
metropolitan Taipei as its service market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YU PROMISES NT 3.2 B. FOR GUGGENHEIM CONSTRUCTION IN TAICHUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun promised Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu Monday that the Executive Yuan will allocate NT$3.2 billion
(US$93 million) to cover part of the costs for the construction of a
Guggenheim Museum in the central Taiwan city.</P>
      <P>Yu said the Executive Yuan has decided to foot the bill for half
of the initial costs for the Guggenheim Museum project in Taichung.</P>
      <P>He added that if more funds are needed, further allocations will
require discussions by the Council of Cultural Affairs, the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, as well as the governments of
several neighboring cities and counties surrounding Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Quoting Premier Yu, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Liu
Shih-fang said at a press conference held after a meeting between Yu
and Hu at the premier's office that the Taichung mayor had asked for
a subsidy of NT$5.2 billion from the central government for the
construction of a Guggenheim museum, an international project.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will make further assessments on the project
before deciding whether the Guggenheim Museum project in Taichung
should be annexed to a sub-project of the three-year, NT$300 billion
infrastructure development plan to develop a cultural park in central
Taiwan. If the Executive Yuan does decide to, the Guggenheim project
may have a chance to be subsidized with more funds from the
government, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu said he would like to offer his appreciation on
behalf of Taichung City to Premier Yu for the subsidy promise, adding
that he and Taichung City would be glad to wait for another three
weeks, as the Executive Yuan promised, to receive an answer as to
whether added funds will be possible for the project.</P>
      <P>Hu said he is equally appreciative toward President Chen
Shui-bian, who said during a recent inspection visit in Taichung that
the Guggenheim Museum is an international development project and
that he will see to it that the Executive Yuan financially supports
the project.</P>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang stalwart, Hu, who has maintained useful
and constructive interactions with President Chen and his ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, said last year that he is dedicated to
building Taichung City into a "city of culture."</P>
      <P>Hu traveled to Spain in July 2002 to sign an agreement with the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao -- where the prestigious New York-based
museum has a branch -- to conduct a feasibility study on setting up a
branch in Taichung.</P>
      <P>He said he has also envisaged building an amphitheater and a
national opera house in Taichung City to enable it to become a "city
of culture."</P>
      <P>The New York-based Guggenheim Museum, a prestigious museum known
for its modern and contemporary international art collections and
related museum activities, also operates affiliated museums in Las
Vegas, as well as Berlin, Germany.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Monday unveiled the
roster of a special committee in preparation for holding a referendum
on several major policy issues before or on March 20, 2004 -- the day
of the next presidential election.</P>
      <P>The new committee comprises 14 members, including eight private
representatives and six government officials, Yu said, adding that
the formation of the committee marks an important step in preparatory
work for the holding of a referendum.</P>
      <P>The eight private representatives include Tai Sheng-tung,
president of the ROC National Association of Small and Medium
Enterprises, three lawyers and four university professors.</P>
      <P>The six government representatives are Minister-without-Portfolio
Hsu Chih-hsiung; Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien; Central
Personnel Administration Director-General Lee Yi-yang; Government
Information Office Director-General Huang Huei-chen; Director-General
Liu San-chi of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

      <P>Yu said Hsu, who played a leading role in the drafting of a
comprehensive package of regulations governing the holding of
referendums in the event that the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan continues stonewalling the passage of a referendum bill, will
serve as chairman of the new committee.</P>
      <P>The committee will hold its first meeting next Monday to set a
detailed work agenda, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The package of referendum regulations, released July 17,
authorizes the Cabinet to hold referendums and set up a special
committee to screen topics to be subject to referendums and relevant
technical details.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, the committee can comprise 11 to 15
members, with each serving a two-year term. The premier is authorized
to name one of them to serve as committee chairman. The number of
members from any one political party should not exceed 50 percent of
the total number of members.</P>
      <P>Four of the committee members belong to the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, while the remaining 12 are independents. The three
major opposition parties -- the Kuomintang, the People First Party
and the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- do not have any representatives in

      <P>Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Wang Yung-ching on Sunday said
that using natural gas to generate electricity is too expensive and
will seriously affect the nation's industrial competitiveness. He
suggested that the government scrap natural gas power plants and
replace them with ones that use coal.</P>
      <P>However, Wang Yun-ming, deputy secretary-general of the economics
ministry's Energy Commission said the commission welcomes any
suggestions, but noted that current energy policy is based on
resolutions reached at a national energy conference in 1998, and that
the construction of all power plants has been carried out considering
the features of each kind of energy source. The nation's power
production does not center on coal or natural gas exclusively, he
said.</P>
      <P>The 1998 conference decided that natural gas plants would
generate between 27 and 29 percent of the nation's total electricity.</P>
      <P>Currently, natural gas plants generate only 20 percent of the
total, but after a major power plant in Tatan, Taoyuan, is completed,
the percentage of natural gas generated electricity will fall within
the range agreed upon in 1998.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE REFORM ALLIANCE CALLS FOR TWO-VOTE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative reform action alliance urged
the Legislative Yuan Monday to complete revisions to the election and
recall law during its next session to pave the way for implementing a
two-vote balloting system in future legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The alliance, composed of major women's and labor rights groups,
also demanded that the deposit each presidential hopeful is required
to pay for entering the race be lowered to enable underprivileged
aspirants to run for the presidency.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the current election and recall law, each
presidential hopeful must pay a deposit of NT$17 million
(US$492,753.6) while registering his or her candidacy. The amount
will be retained in case the hopeful fails to garner a specified
percentage of the vote cast in the election.</P>
      <P>The alliance said the high deposit has discouraged competent
people with limited financial resources from joining the race.</P>
      <P>"This 'wealthy president' provision should be abolished," said Ku
Chung-hua, the convener of the action alliance who is also a senior
executive of the Taipei Society -- a self-proclaimed watchdog group
overseeing government operations.</P>
      <P>Ku said at a news conference that the alliance hopes to see a
state-funded electoral system be installed as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Ku said the amendment of the election and recall law to allow for
a two-vote legislative electoral system will only mark the start of
the nation's long-delayed legislative reform.</P>
      <P>"We need many other reform measures that require amendments to
our Constitution, such as halving the number of legislative seats and
lowering the minimum suffrage age from the current 20 to 18, " Ku
said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, the alliance is demanding that the
legislature form a special committee during its next legislative
session set to open in September to begin preparations for necessary
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>"Even though constitutional amendments require complex and
difficult procedures, we should not dodge our duties, " Ku said,
adding that the alliance will continually push major domestic
political parties to come up with amendment proposals for discussion
and comparison.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chien Hsi-chieh, convener of the
newly formed Alliance of Fairness and Justice, said Taiwan's current
electoral system has not only impinged on underprivileged people's
political participation but has also nurtured a money-polluted
election culture.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a survey of candidates in the last
legislative session, Chien said many respondents acknowledged that
their campaign fees reached NT$100 million and that only a few of
them said they spent about NT$20 million on campaign activities. On
average, he said, each candidate had to spend at least NT$42 million
on campaign bills.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we cannot expect competent and virtuous
people to emerge as victors in those hotly contested elections," said
Chien, who one served as an at-large legislator representing the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chien said the legislative reform action alliance will push for
elimination of vote-buying and other bad campaign practices, such as
offering banquets to woo voters, displaying lots of campaign banners
and distributing large numbers of publicity leaflets.</P>
      <P>"We'll advocate state-funded elections, with the government
integrating print and electronic media resources for campaign forums
and policy debates among candidates in all of the nation's political
elections," Chien said.

    <HEADLINE>DPP HAS MUCH FAITH IN NEXT YEAR'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Aug.  18  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking official of ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday that since the
government has done well in the fields of diplomacy and economy, the
party is confident of winning next year's presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, the DPP's deputy secretary-general, made the
remarks at a gathering of veteran members of the party, where he
hailed the contributions of DPP supporters in helping the
democratization of Taiwan and encouraged them to have faith in next
year's election.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that President Chen Shui-bian's claim that there is one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait has gained the support of
many.</P>
      <P>Based on this principle, Taiwan has scored well in its diplomacy,
Lee said, citing as examples the first lady's visits to the United
States and Europe in recent years, Vice President Annette Lu's
current visit to Latin America, as well as the upcoming 2003
Democratic Pacific Conference to be held in Taipei in September with
the purpose of establishing an alliance to unite Pacific Rim
democratic countries.</P>
      <P>Regarding economy, Lee said the DPP government has helped several
state-run companies that were in the red to begin making a profit --
such as China Shipbuilding Corp. and Tang Eng Iron Works Corp.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth has outperformed that of many countries,
the stock and real estate markets are booming, and foreign reserves
will reach US$180 billion at the end of this year, an increase of
US$70 billion over that of the previous government, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee said, the DPP government will push for the
downsizing of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee also stressed that in the past, the topic of referendum was a
taboo, while now more than 50 percent of the people support the idea.</P>
      <P>The DPP government plans to hold a referendum on several major
policies, including the fate of the country's Fourth Nuclear Power
Plant, Taiwan's bid to participate in the World Health Organization
and the reduction of the number of legislators, before or on the day
of next year's presidential election -- March 20, 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT SLAMS BOEING OVER CANCELLATION OF VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Seattle,  Aug. 17 (CNA)
(By Tsai Su-jung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Vice President Annette Lu lashed out
at Boeing Co. in Seattle Sunday for canceling her visit to their
company due to pressure from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lu, who wrapped up her two-leg Latin American visit Saturday and
is currently on a two-day transit stop in Seattle on her way back to
Taipei, was originally scheduled to tour Boeing Co. Sunday. However,
Boeing yielded to Beijing's pressure and canceled Lu's visit.</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner banquet hosted by major local Chinese
community groups in her honor, Lu said it was shameful for a
world-renowned company like Boeing to kowtow to Beijing's
unreasonable demand against Taiwan, one of America's best partners.</P>
      <P>Lu, the Republic of China's first female vice president, said
Boeing's cancellation of her visit was tantamount to snubbing the ROC.
"It's an insult to Taiwan. We must defend our national dignity and
express our indignation over this snub," she said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Boeing won a lucrative aircraft order from Taiwan's
China Airlines (CAL) last year, Lu said it was disheartening to see
Boeing collaborate with mainland China to bully Taiwan. "Do you think
Boeing will announce a decision to give up its contract with CAL? "
she asked.</P>
      <P>Lu further said Boeing's action has undermined America's image in
the world arena. She said she has expressed the ROC's stance on the
issue to U.S. authorities.</P>
      <P>Barbara Schrage, deputy managing director of the American
Institute in Taiwan, which handles U.S.-ROC relations in the absence
of diplomatic ties, was present at the dinner party.</P>
      <P>Touching on her official visits to Panama and Paraguay, Lu said
Taiwan should devote even more efforts to cementing its diplomatic
ties with Latin American countries. Fourteen of the ROC's diplomatic
allies are located in Central and South America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan can use its "soft power" of love and technological
expertise to forge a democratic Pacific alliance with its Latin
American allies. Moreover, Lu said she will encourage Taiwan people
to sponsor children from impoverished families in Latin American
countries or build homes for them. Taiwan can also invite Latin
American troupes to perform on the island to boost cultural
exchanges, she added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lu met with Washington State Lieutenant
Governor Brad Owen for wide-ranging talks. Owen said mainland China
is not in a position to oppose Taiwan's plan to hold a referendum on
some major policy issues because it is an internal issue.</P>
      <P>Owen, who concurrently serves as speaker of the Washington State
Senate, told Lu that he will head a state congressional delegation to
visit Taiwan in September to boost exchanges and cooperation in
trade, education and cultural development.</P>
      <P>Lu will meet with Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels and several other
Washington state officials as well as visit Microsoft Corp.
headquarters and the Seattle harbor bureau Monday. She is scheduled
to leave for home at midnight.</P>
      <P>Lu, heading a 43-member entourage, attended Paraguayan President
Nicanor Duarte Frutos' inaugural ceremony on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in Paraguay, Lu made a three-day official visit
to Panama where Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso assured Lu that
her country will continue maintaining diplomatic relations with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>On her way to Panama, Lu made transit stops in Hawaii and Los
Angeles where she met with many American political figures for

    <HEADLINE>RULING PARTY LAWMAKER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST ABSENTEE VOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing citizens of the ROC to vote even
if they are not residing where they registered cannot be considered
because of constitutional issues, and so the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has ruled out such a move for the time being.</P>
      <P>Secretary of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan Chen Chi-mai
said Monday he could not agree with a Kuomintang (KMT) proposal to
allow absentee balloting - including giving the right to vote to
Taiwan citizens living in mainland China and those living overseas
with dual passports.</P>
      <P>The KMT proposed a day earlier doing away with the requirement
that people must vote in the districts or areas where they were
originally registered and allowing citizens to mail in ballots.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that an article in the Additional Articles of
the Constitution provides that Republic of China citizens who live
overseas "must return to the country" to cast their votes.</P>
      <P>Unless this phrase is deleted, Taiwanese businessmen who live in
the mainland or overseas Chinese could not be allowed to vote by
post.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, current law requires that voting be done in secret
to ensure that voters act out of their own free will. How this
principle would be preserved in absentee voting needs to be carefully
considered, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The DPP cannot support the KMT's idea of bringing in an absentee
ballot system before these questions can be straightened out, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Chen dismissed as a whim the KMT's another proposal of using
charter planes that would fly nonstop from the mainland to Taiwan to
ferry Taiwan businessmen back to vote in the forthcoming presidential
election.
Chen said the KMT is trying to use the excuse of the
presidential election to make direct transportation links across the
Taiwan Strait a fait accompli, although the legal framework for such
links is not yet in place.</P>
      <P>The DPP's political ally in the legislature, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), was reserved about the KMT's idea.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Chien Lin Hui-chun said her party believes there is
no hurry to introduce absentee voting as more careful studies about
ways to prevent vote-buying via the mail are needed.</P>
      <P>Citizens who are absent from their voting districts are likely to
be tempted or threatened to mark their ballots in such a way that
does not reflect their true intent, she said, adding that only a well
though out bill can prevent these kind of problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien
returned to southwestern Taiwan Monday after visiting the Nansha
(Spratly) Islands in the South China Sea over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Minister Yu, on behalf of Premier Yu Shyi-kun, led government
officials to land on Taiping Island, the biggest island of the Nansha
group, Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yu said that his major purpose in going to Nansha was to reaffirm
the nation's sovereignty over the Nansha Islands, cheer up the
personnel stationed on the islands, increase the voice of Taiwan in
issues related to the South China Sea, and establish a location for
global satellite positioning measurements.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that various countries have claimed that they own
part or all of the Nansha, and that Nansha is now a potential
flashpoint in Asia.</P>
      <P>But he added that the government's consistent stance on the
conflict in the South China Sea has been to solve conflicts through
peaceful consultations and that countries should jointly develop the
natural resources in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Using this principle, Yu said that the work should start with
transportation construction, and move toward developing tourism
resources to turn Taiping Island and the Tungsha (Pratas) Islands
into national marine parks and tourist destinations.</P>
      <P>After Taiping Island, Yu traveled to Chungchou Island, which is
near a sand bar controlled by Vietnam and a sensitive sea area. Yu
planted the national flag of the Republic of China there.</P>
      <P>Chungchou is about two nautical miles from Taiping and 4.5
nautical miles from Vietnam's controlled sand bar. Coast Guard
officials said that Vietnam had troops stationed on the spit who are
ready to shoot anyone that approaches them.</P>
      <P>Yu led ranking officials from the Council For Economic Planning
and Development, Research, Development and Evaluation Commission, and
Coast Guard Administration to board a military vessel from the
Tsoying Navy Harbor in southern Taiwan last Thursday. Another ROC
Navy vessel and vessels from the Coast Guard Administration escorted
them to the Nansha Islands. After 45 hours of journey on sea, Yu and
other officials took rubber boats to land on Taiping Island
because the wharf is too dilapidated to allow big ships to dock.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense considered the trip a kind of
military mission amid the tense situation in the South China Sea, and
Yu's trip was conducted throughout in tight security.</P>
      <P>Upon their returning to the southwestern part of Taiwan, the ROC
Navy also had four navy vessels, including three Lafayette-class
ships, conduct anti-submarine exercises Monday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Given the competition between different
political parties, it is inappropriate for Kuomintang (KMT) public
officials to participate in the celebration of the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) founding anniversary, KMT spokesman Tsai
Cheng-yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Monday's reports that the DPP, which will
celebrate its 17th founding anniversary in Taichung City on Sept. 28,
is trying to invite KMT Taichung Mayor Jason Hu to attend the
political gala as chief of the host city, the spokesman said it would
be somewhat inappropriate for a KMT public official to attend a
celebration of the KMT's political rivals.</P>
      <P>"If invited, KMT officials would be better to turn the offer
down," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As to Hu's recent calls on DPP government leaders to appeal for
more central government funds for Taichung City, Tsai said this was
business rather than politics, and since the KMT is not concerned
about it, outsiders should follow suit.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day in Taichung City, Hu shrugged off questions
about whether he will attend the DPP's anniversary celebration,
saying that it would be begging the question to comment since he has
not even been invited.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Lee Ying-yuan said in Taipei that
his party usually invites the administrative chief of the place where
the celebration takes place to their annual get-together.</P>
      <P>Hu was seen associating closely with DPP leaders recently. He
called on President Chen Shui-bian at Chen's office last week to talk
about the development of Taichung City, and was present at a dinner
given by Chen to a group of journalists in Taichung City when the
president stopped there on a trip around the island.</P>
      <P>Hu called on Premier Yu Shyi-kun at the premier's office in
Taipei earlier in the day and was given a promise from the Executive
Yuan that it would share part of the costs of an art gallery in
Taichung City.</P>
      <P>It raised speculation in political circles that the DPP is trying
to win over the KMT mayor's support in the 2004 presidential

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will soon start a collect-a-million-signature campaign to
promote legislative reforms by cutting one-third of the Legislative
Yuan seats, a DPP official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, DPP deputy secretary-general, said that the party
will use a series of major events, including the party's anniversary,
in September, to launch the campaign.</P>
      <P>The DPP is hoping to collect the signatures and easily pass the
threshold for proposing to revise the ROC Constitution under a DPP
version of the referendum draft bill. About 780,000 signatures would
be required to start the procedure, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said that the "call Taiwan, Taiwan" movement will sponsor a
big rally in Taipei Sept. 6, the DPP will be celebrating its party
anniversary in Taichung Sept. 28, and DPP Legislator Trong Chai is
organizing a rally in Kaohsiung Oct. 28 to build up momentum for a
referendum in Taiwan. The DPP will collect signatures during all of
these occasions, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the DPP reaffirmed in a Central Standing Committee
meeting Feb. 25 that the party would push for legislative reform by
cutting the seats from the current 225 to 150, and DPP Chairman Chen
Shui-bian said at the time that the reform should be a national
campaign, and would require support from all quarters and across the
political spectrum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>23 FEMALE MAINLANDERS NABBED OFF KEELUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-three mainland Chinese citizens
suspected of attempting to illegally enter Taiwan were discovered
hiding onboard a Taiwan fishing vessel and arrested off Keelung by
Taiwan coast guard forces early Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>The coast guard reported that they had been tipped off that a
smuggling ring was trying to use Taiwan fishing vessels to transport
mainland Chinese citizens to Taiwan illegally. The coast guard then
sent three cutters to patrol the northern sea area.</P>
      <P>The coast guard officers spotted the suspicious fishing vessel,
the Taipei County-registered "Tayi No. 168, " off Pitou, Keelung, and
then boarded it at 2 a.m. to conduct a thorough search. They
discovered the mainlanders, all of them women, hiding in a secret
compartment of the vessel.</P>
      <P>They then escorted the vessel back to Shenao Harbor, Keelung, and
questioned Han Chung-hua, captain of the vessel, as well as a
Vietnamese fisherman and the 23 mainlanders.</P>
      <P>In the questioning, the coast guard forces discovered that the
mainland women had boarded a mainland fishing vessel Sunday night and
then later transferred to the Taiwan vessel. The women, most of them
minors, with the youngest being 15 years old, were chic in
appearance.</P>
      <P>Most of them came from Pingtan, Fujian Province, but some came
from as far away as Harbin city in northeast mainland China. They
said they had been introduced by mainland Chinese men to "work" in
Taiwan, paying fees ranging from 20,000 renminbi to 75,000 renminbi
(US$2,416-US$9,060) that they were expected to repay after landing on
Taiwan and engaging in prostitution.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued a press
release Tuesday denying that Vice President Annette Lu has ever
promised to consider delaying the loan repayment schedule for
Paraguay.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued the press statement at the request
of Lu who is now on a transit stop in Seattle after a two-leg Latin
American tour to Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Some local media claimed Monday that Lu said during an
international news conference held in the Paraguayan capital of
Asuncion last Saturday that Taiwan would consider extending the
interest-free period for loans to Paraguay and delaying its loan
repayments schedule.</P>
      <P>The media report was not true, the press statement said, adding
that Lu regrets that such an irresponsible, misleading report was
made.</P>
      <P>During the Asuncion press conference, the statement said, some
Paraguayan journalists asked Lu whether the Republic of China
government is likely to extend a helping hand as the new Paraguayan
government is unable to repay its debts to the ROC.</P>
      <P>In response, the statement said, Lu clearly stated that the loans
in question were purely commercial deals between the Paraguayan
government and two private Taiwan banks -- the International
Commercial Bank of China and Chinatrust Commercial Bank. "I'm
convinced that the two Taiwan banks will handle the repayment issue
properly," Lu was quoted as having said at the news conference.</P>
      <P>The statement stressed that Lu did not make any comment regarding
the ROC government's possible response to the loan issue, as some
local media had reported,</P>
      <P>Lu attended the inauguration of new Paraguayan President Nicanor
Duarte last Friday on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian. She is

    <HEADLINE>EMPLOYERS, BROKERS URGED NOT TO HIRE RUNAWAY FOREIGN LABORERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central  Taiwan,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taichung County
government on Tuesday asked that employers and brokers in the county
not hire runaway foreign laborers, or else face steep fines.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Government officials issued the warning after the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , out of concerns that
runaway foreign laborers may pose a threat to social order, notified
local city and county governments to conduct a three-month campaign
against runaway foreign laborers starting Sept. 1. The aim of the
campaign is to locate and repatriate runaway foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>To encourage the reporting of runaway foreign laborers, CLA
officials also said that they will award informers NT$3,000 (US$87)
for each case reported.</P>
      <P>Taichung County labor officials noted that the number of foreign
laborers in the county amounts to nearly 25,000, with caregivers
accounting for more than one-third of that total.</P>
      <P>According to Taichung County police statistics, 488 foreign
laborers ran away in the county between January 1 and Aug. 16 of this
year.</P>
      <P>Labor officials urged employers not to hire run-away foreign
laborers, or else be subject to fines of between NT$150,000 and
NT$750,000. Foreign laborer brokers should also not introduce
run-away foreign laborers to potential employers, or else they will
face fines of between NT$300,000 and NT$1.5 million, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>They said that foreign laborers on the run have a hard life and
that they mostly just want to return home to their own countries, but
they continue hiding in Taiwan because they are not familiar with the
channels of assistance open to them or because they are afraid of
possible trouble.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, currently
visiting Toronto, Canada, called on a health official Monday and
visited a community hospital where a SARS cluster transmission was
reported earlier this year, Taipei City Government's Information
Department said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma met with Phil Hassen, Ontario's deputy minister of health and
long-term care, and other health officials over breakfast, and
exchanged views on the battle against severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Ma broached the idea of Toronto and Taipei, both hit hard by SARS
between March and June of this year, joining hands to inform each
other on the latest SARS information. His proposal was positively
received by the Canadian health officials.</P>
      <P>Ma said while discussing the SARS issue with the health officials
that the important things to think about are how to respond quickly
if the disease resurfaces, whether to handle the disease in a
different way than the first time it appeared, whether it is
necessary to impose large-scale quarantine measures, and whether
communications between the various levels of governments can be
improved.</P>
      <P>Ma later on Monday visited Scarborough Grace Hospital, which was
the first hospital to report a SARS cluster transmission, in early
March.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma departed Taipei Sunday for a 11-day visit to six major
cities in Canada and the United States.</P>
      <P>After his stay in Toronto, Ma will visit Boston, Washington,
Atlanta, Phoenix and San Francisco. While in these cities, he will
visit hospitals and disease control institutions to study their SARS

    <HEADLINE>MOFA EXPRESSES REGRET OVER BOEING'S CANCELLATION OF LU'S VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
expressed its regret Tuesday over Boeing Co.'s abrupt cancellation of
ROC Vice President Annette Lu's visit to its Seattle office under
pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih said a visit to Boeing Co., one of
Taiwan's longtime trade partners, was included in Lu's itinerary
before she left Taipei Aug. 7 for her current overseas tour.</P>
      <P>Unexpectedly, Shih said, Boeing Co. informed the MOFA Aug. 11
that the itinerary of Lu's visit had to be changed. After difficult
negotiations, Shih said, Boeing still would not maintain the original
plan, resulting in the cancellation of Lu's visit to the giant
aircraft company.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, Lu was originally scheduled to visit Boeing's
factory, with its vice president to brief Lu on the details of the
company's operations. However, the company backed out of its original
promise and asked Lu to visit its downtown office instead. The
company also canceled its promise to have its vice president receive
Lu personally.</P>
      <P>Shih said it is regrettable that Boeing has failed to honor its
promise.</P>
      <P>Apart from the "Boeing incident, " Shih said, the ROC government
is grateful for the Bush administration's handling of Lu's transit
stops in Hawaii, Los Angeles and Seattle on her way to and from Latin
America based on the principles of "safety, comfort, convenience and
dignity."</P>
      <P>As to whether the MOFA will force China Airlines (CAL) to cancel
its aircraft purchase contract with Boeing Co., Shih said the
government will respect CAL's decision based on commercial
requirements and professional assessments. Boeing won a big contract
with CAL last year.</P>
      <P>Asked whether President Chen Shui-bian's overseas travel plan
later this year will be affected by the "Boeing incident, " Shih said
the president's travel plan has yet to be fleshed out.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in Seattle Sunday for a two-day transit stop on her
way back to Taipei after a two-leg Latin American tour to Panama and
Paraguay. She is scheduled to return to Taipei early Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner banquest hosted by major Chinese community
groups in Seattle Sunday, Lu upbraided Boeing for its crude manner
in snubbing her request to visit a company office.</P>
      <P>"Shame on Boeing! Rejecting me is rejecting the ROC and Taiwan.
We need to guard our dignity and express our anger and give Boeing a
warning," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu went on to say that during her transit stops in the United
States, there are at least 100 corporations that have welcome her as
the representative of the ROC. "But Boeing bowed to pressure from
Beijing and bullied Taiwan, a close a U.S. ally," she regretted.</P>
      <P>Lu, heading a 43-member entourage, attended Paraguayan President
Nicanor Duarte Frutos' inaugural ceremony on behalf of President Chen
Shui-bian Aug. 15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE COUNCILOR DECORATED FOR PROMOTING TIES WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian decorated Motoo
Shiina, a member of the Japanese House of Councilors, Tuesday with
the Order of Brilliant Star with Violet Grand Cordon in recognition
of his efforts to promote Taiwan-Japan ties over the past decades.</P>
      <P>Chen said he took great pleasure in decorating Shiina on behalf
of the Republic of China government and people as the Japanese Diet
member has contributed much to the crafting of a framework to
maintain peace and stability in Asia and to the promotion of
substantive Taipei-Tokyo relations.</P>
      <P>With far-sightedness and a strong conviction, Chen said, Shiina
overcame many difficulties in the 1980s in pushing for consolidation
of a U.S.-Japanese defense alliance to help lay a solid foundation
for peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region over the past two
decades.</P>
      <P>More admiringly, Chen said, Shiina has spared no efforts to help
pave the way for Taiwan to take part in the U.S.-Japanese defense
cooperative mechanism, which has in turn helped safeguard peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Praising Shiina as a generous and modest man, Chen said, Shiina
had declined to receive any decoration during former President Lee
Teng-hui's administration. Over the years, Chen said Shiina has made
remarkable contributions to cross-strait peace and regional security
and prosperity through his quiet, selfless efforts.</P>
      <P>For his part, Shiina said it's a great honor for him to receive
an ROC government decoration. Despite the absence of official
diplomatic ties, he said, substantive Taiwan-Japanese relations have
continued to grow through concerted efforts of the quasi-official
Japanese Interchange Association (JIA) and Taiwan's Association of
East Asian Relations.</P>
      <P>While U.S.-Japan defense cooperation is growing steadily, Shiina
said he is hopeful that Taiwan can expand its participation within
this mechanism and that triangular Taipei-Tokyo-Washington relations
will be further upgraded on the current basis.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee and his wife attended the decoration
ceremony. It was the first time since he finished his presidency in
May 2000 that Lee has made a visit to the Presidential Office. Also
present at the occasion was Katsuhisa Uchida, director of the
JIA Taipei Office, which represents Japanese interests in Taiwan in
the absence of diplomatic ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By EH)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching, chairman of the Formosa
Plastics Group, said Tuesday that he will soon urge the government to
use coal instead of natural gas as fuel in power generation.</P>
      <P>He said it is not sustainable for Taiwan to use natural gas as
fuel in power generation because natural gas is very expensive and is
limited in supply. Natural gas is good for household use, not for
use in power plants.</P>
      <P>Wang said coal-fired power generators may release large
quantities of carbon dioxide to pollute the air, but this negative
effect on the environment may be neutralized by forestation.</P>
      <P>He said that Kuan Tang, a coastal town in the northern Taiwan
county of Taoyuan, can be developed into an international harbor, and
that a four million kilowatt coal-fired power plant can be built at
low cost in the area.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, Aug. 19 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's security chief, Ambrose Lee,
said Tuesday that Hong Kong people enjoy freedom of expression and
that the comments made by Hong Kong Legislative Council members Amily
Lau and James To Saturday in Taipei do not constitute a crime.</P>
      <P>The two legislators said Saturday in an international seminar on
"Hong Kong under One Country, Two Systems" in Taipei that the
proposed enactment of Hong Kong's state security law, also known as
Article 23 of the Basic Law, will have an impact on the human rights
and freedom of the press and effectively gag the news media in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after the English-language China Daily
carried a signed article Monday accusing the two legislators of
publicly advocating Taiwan independence in their capacity as members
of the Legislative Council.</P>
      <P>The article said Amily Lau may even go so far as to advocate a
referendum on Hong Kong's independence from mainland China. If so,
she may commit the crime of separating the country, the article said.
For this reason, the article called for the early enactment of
Article 23 to nip the crime in the bud.

      <P>The job market remains tight, with 68
percent of newly graduated university and college students this
summer having yet to find work, according to the results of an
Internet survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Internet opinion poll, conducted by www.9999.com.tw -- a

mainly from university and college students who graduated this

      <P>The survey found that 58.2 percent thought that it was extremely
difficult to find a job this year, while only 2.56 percent said they
could easily find work.</P>
      <P>Just over 44 percent said they are not working because they have
not found a job they like; the same percentage thought they were not
qualified for available work.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei municipal authorities will
publish an overall assessment next week of the impact on the city of
the central government's option to use an airport to serve as the
direct air link across the Taiwan Strait, Information Department
Director Wu Yu-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has instructed the Bureau of
Transportation and the Bureau of Commerce and Economy to study the
impact on the city's economy, trade, investment and tourism of the
central government's choice of Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
in Taoyuan County to conduct cross-strait air travel should Taiwan
and mainland China agree on opening direct transport links.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed last week after learning of the development that he
will continue to ask the central government to include Taipei
Sungshan Airport in the initial stage of direct cross-strait air
travel to help sharpen the city's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma is currently on a tour of the United States and Canada to seek
inter-city cooperation on the prevention of a reoccurrence of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the coming autumn or winter.</P>
      <P>A public opinion survey made by the Bureau of Transportation in
January on cross-strait charter service showed that 51.53 percent of
the respondents thought CKS International Airport to be the most
suitable airport to ply direct cross-strait flights, while 47.85
percent preferred Sungshan airport to open the service.</P>
      <P>However, the public's choice is closely linked to their residence
locations, as the poll indicated that 63 percent of the respondents
living in Taipei City and Taipei County were in favor of Sungshan
Airport, while as many as 89 percent of the citizens living in the
rest areas of Taiwan backed the CKS airport.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) made public Aug. 15 an
assessment report on Taiwan's establishment of direct transport links
with mainland China, in which it designed CKS airport as Taiwan's top
choice to conduct direct air links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC report came after President Chen Shui-bian unveiled his
blueprint early this month that direct cross-strait transport links
will be forged in three stages by the end of 2004.</P>

(By sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
still working on its arms procurement package and therefore has yet
to come up with any relevant budget plan, a Cabinet spokeswoman said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang was responding to
opposition lawmakers' claim that the MND will propose a NT$520
billion special budget plan for pruchasing conventional submarines,
early warning radar systems and Patriot missile defense systems from
the United States.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang said earlier
in the day that the MND's special budget plan violates major arms
procurement procedures and the prices offered by the United States
are unreasonably high.</P>
      <P>In response, Liu said Lin's comments are sheer speculation. At
the moment, she said, the MND is still carefully evaluating the
nation's defense needs in terms of mainland China's military threats.</P>
      <P>"The MND has yet to finalize a comprehensive procurement
package, not to mention a budget plan to finance the
procurement," Liu said, adding that the MND has on many occasions
declared that it will work out a phased arms procurement project
based on defense demands and the nation's financial situation.</P>
      <P>At present, Liu said, the Cabinet has no plan to present a
special arms procurement budget proposal to the Legislative Yuan for
scrrening in its next legislative session set to open in September.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Liu said, she would not rule out the possibility of
presenting such a budget plan in the future. "Anyway, we must follow
legal procedures. When the MND finalizes the procurement plan,
we'll seek the legislature's approval of relevant budget
proposals," she explained.</P>
      <P>Liu further said since the Democratic Progressive Party
adminsitration was inaugurated more than three years ago, it has

    <TEXT>
      <P>It would be in the national interest for
China Airlines (CAL) to put aside business considerations and lodge a
strong protest to the Boeing Company for its eleventh-hour
cancellation of a planned visit by Vice President Annette Lu to the
company's Seattle, Washington plant, Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Boeing's breach of promise to receive Lu was a snub, said Lin. As
the nation's flag carrier, CAL should defend the country's dignity.</P>
      <P>Lin, who doubles as chairman of a government fundation which is
the largest stockholder in CAL, stopped short of saying that CAL
should protest against Boeing's flip-flop on Lu's visit to its
Seattle plant by cancelling a 2002 contract to buy 10 jet planes from
Boeing. He said instead that Boeing at least owes Taiwan an
explanation.</P>
      <P>Lu was in the United States on her way back to Taiwan from a trip
to Paraguay and was scheduled to visit Boeing in Seattle Sunday.
However, Boeing refused to let her into the facility without giving a
reason.</P>
      <P>Angered at being turned away, Lu said that Boeing should be
ashamed of itself, and dared the aircraft builder to abandon CAL's
order for 10 airplanes.</P>
      <P>The incident caused political shock waves in Taipei Tuesday, with
lawmakers across the political spectrum criticizing Boeing.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chih-mai of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) urged CAL to divert its order from Boeing to another
aircraft builder.</P>
      <P>He also blamed Beijing for twisting Boeing's arm behind the
scene.</P>
      <P>The DPP's political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), had
similar sentiments. TSU Secretary-General Lin Chih-chia said the
incident should drive home to the people in Taiwan that Beijing will
stop at nothing to isolated the country.</P>
      <P>Beijing blocks Taiwan's engagement with not only foreign
governments but also foreign private companies, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang said either
Boeing should be blamed for backpedaling on its promise to receive
Lu, or the Ministry of the Foreign Affairs should be blamed for
believing by mistake that Boeing agreed to receive the vice
president.</P>
      <P>Lin said the DPP administration should learn a lesson from this
incident -- money cannot buy friendship, and don't curry favor with
U.S. private companies at the cost of the country.</P>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) was conspicuously low key
Tuesday. An AIT spokeswoman in Taipei said that Lu's activities in
the United States were private and unofficial in nature. Her dealing
should be disclosed by Taiwan authorities or Boeing and not by AIT.</P>

game of money.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang made the remarks following reports that Panama's

sitting on the cross-strait fence.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that Taiwan has been offering considerable
economic aid to Panama for years; however, by sending its vice

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN PUBLIC MANDATE TO MAKE BEIJING MORE FLEXIBLE: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's new public mandate following next
year's presidential election will steer Beijing into being more
flexible and pragmatic in its dealings with Taiwan, creating a
mutually beneficial "win-win" situation for both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a weekly policy-making meeting of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen gave a keynote speech regarding
an MAC assessment of direct cross-strait transport links and its
impact on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait ties have long been a grave concern for
the international community and a vital relationship for Taiwan's 23
million people, Chen said the administration has been working on
arrangements and preparations, including revising the law, enhancing
national security and law and order mechanisms, and improving
quarantine control since he took power May 20, 2000.</P>
      <P>The DPP-led administration has also made many adjustments and
revisions on the financial and economic fronts in respect to mainland
China in the hope of achieving the ultimate goal of sharpening
Taiwan's competitiveness, Chen said, adding that the direct
cross-strait transport links he proposed early this month are aimed
at building a favorable climate for the two sides.</P>
      <P>"The DPP now has a greater confidence and a soldier foundation to
handle the many cross-strait issues, including direct links, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government has remained firm on its pragmatic
and progressive basic stance toward mainland China over the past more
than three years, Chen said Taiwan's security, dignity and interests
are the most important guidelines for the government in its handling
of the direct links issue.</P>
      <P>The president said he strongly believes that only the DPP will
make Beijing fully realize that the Taiwan people will never accept
its "one China" principle and that the two sides will be able to
reach a mutually beneficial agreement on the direct links only when
Beijing is willing to forswear its dogma.</P>
      <P>Commenting on next year's presidential race, a confident Chen
said that the new public mandate in Taiwan will undoubtedly force
Beijing to make better and prospective adjustments in its dealings
with Taiwan due to fresh political situations in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Boeing had in fact agreed to host Vice
President Annette Lu on a visit to its plant but reneged on its
promise because of political pressure from Beijing, an official at
the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The anonymous official who was in charge of arranging Lu's trip
said the ministry's Seattle office approached Boeing July 18 over
Lu's possible visit to the company and was told on July 21 that
Boeing would welcome Lu's visit and that one of its vice presidents
would greet Lu when she arrived.</P>
      <P>However, the Boeing plant was to be closed for the Aug. 16-17
weekend, the two dates first proposed by Lu's staff. The visit was
rescheduled for Aug. 18, between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m., according to the
official.</P>
      <P>The ministry's representative in Seattle, Chiang Kuo-chian,
reconfirmed the details of the visit with two Boeing executives by
phone on Aug. 7 and agreed to call up the two on Aug. 11 to see in
person the receiving line they were arranging for the vice president.</P>
      <P>However, one of Chiang's Boeing contacts called him on Aug. 11
asking to change Lu's visit because the vice president who was to
greet Lu was going to be preoccupied with other business on Aug. 18
and the plant would be busy working on a batch of 747 airplanes. The
contact offered, on the following day, a substitute plan for Lu to
visit the company's headquarters in downtown Seattle.</P>
      <P>Stunned by the sudden change, Chiang called Boeing on Aug. 12.
His contact apologized for the unexpected change, but shrugged off
Chiang's question of whether the cancellation was because of
Beijing's interference, saying only, "You know better than I."</P>
      <P>Since Lu's planned visit to Boeing had the blessing of the State
Department, Chiang asked his contact if the State Department ever
urged the company not to cancel Lu's trip. The answer was yes, but
"The decision had been made, " according to the official at the
foreign ministry.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu
urged the Taiwan people Wednesday to pay attention to Beijing's
obstruction that she said led to Boeing Co.'s recent refusal of her
visit, pointing out that this is an alarm signal to Taiwan's
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks after returning to Taipei
early Wednesday after a two-leg Latin American visit to Panama and
Paraguay, during which she made transit stops in Hawaii, Los Angeles
and Seattle.</P>
      <P>Lu, at the head of a 43-member delegation, attended the
inauguration of new Paraguayan President Nicanor Duarte in Asuncion
Aug. 15 on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>She said while receiving greetings from people of Taoyuan County
at CKS International Airport upon her return to Taiwan that her
mission to represent President Chen in attending the new Paraguayan
president's inauguration was accomplished and that she was well
received during her transit stops in the United States.</P>
      <P>Noting that she had met with officials and council members of the
local governments during her short stays in the U.S. cities, the vice
president said that she also met with overseas Chinese and
representatives from leading U.S. enterprises.</P>
      <P>Talking about Boeing's refusal of her visit, Lu said that it was
only a small episode and did not affect her overall journey which she
said was well arranged.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu warned that the Taiwan people should pay
attention to what she said was Boeing's giving in to pressure from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the target of Beijing's attempts to isolate
Taiwan internationally seems to have spread beyond governments to
private companies, Lu said Boeing's refusal should be seen as a
warning signal to Taiwan's diplomacy. She cautioned that if the
Taiwan people don't pay heed and take preventative measures, it will
result in an endless flow of disasters for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also stressed that the aircraft manufacturer's refusal of her
visit was also an insult to the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>

Washington, D.C., Tuesday on the second leg of his current
Canada-U.S. visit aimed at promoting cooperation in the campaign
against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>Ma paid a visit to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency

      <P>Ma exchanged views with FEMA officials on emergency response,
including measures to cope with terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Ma visited the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services to collect information about its health care and
disease control systems.</P>
      <P>In the evening, major Chinese community groups in the greater

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has asked overseas
Chinese to help in its efforts to locate the whereabouts of a couple
wanted in Taiwan, the Republic of China representative office in
Los Angeles said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles said that
Liu Kuan-chun, former chief accountant of the National Security
Bureau, is wanted on charges of embezzling more than NT$192 million
(US$5.565 million), while his wife, Meng Wen-hua, is wanted for
allegedly assisting Liu in embezzling the money and in engaging in
money laundering.</P>
      <P>Liu and his wife sneaked out of Taiwan on Sept. 3 and Sept. 4,
2000, respectively. Sources said that Liu first went to mainland
China and hid in Shanghai, with his whereabouts later becoming a
mystery. Meanwhile, Meng took their two children to Toronto, Canada,
with the trio cutting off contact with the outside world in January
2002.</P>
      <P>Recent overseas media reports said that the Lius could be hiding
in North America, possibly in southern California. The Investigation
Bureau of the ROC Ministry of Justice then activated its alert
mechanism and asked overseas Chinese to help in tracking down the
couple.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Vamco failed to bring the
much-expected large amounts of rainfall to northern Taiwan after
slightly skirting eastern Ilan at 2: 30 a.m., a Central Weather
Bureau spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei County -- the major water
supplier for the greater Taipei area -- took in just a combined 33
millimeters of rain Tuesday through Wednesday morning, with its water
level rising slightly from 137.23 meters at 4 p.m. Tuesday to 137.5
meters 10:00 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The current water level at the reservoir is more than 10 meters
lower than the average level of about 150 meters for this time of
year.</P>
      <P>The Shihmen Dam in neighboring Taoyuan County received only 4.6
millimeters of rain as of 10: 00 a.m. Wednesday, with its water level
falling to 214.66 meters, only less than five meters above the
210-meter serious warning level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the bureau lifted its sea warning at 5:30 a.m. and its
land warning at 11:30 a. m. for Vamco, which was losing momentum and
downgrading to a tropical storm while moving northwest off Ilan at a
speed of 28 kilometers per hour toward Fujian Province in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The little rainfall produced by Vamco was far from sufficient to
ease the lingering water shortage problem in the Keelung, Taipei,
Taoyuan and Hsinchu areas in northern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED TO ADDRESS TRADEMARK REGISTRATION PROBLEM IN MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng on Wednesday
asked the government to address the problem of rogue Taiwan
businessmen trying to register similar names of popular Taiwan
products first in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after Kinmen Kaoliang (sorghum) Liquor, one
of the most popular Kinmen products of the outlying island, passed
the initial review of mainland China's Trademark Bureau of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, and is expected to be
launched in the mainland by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that mainland authorities passed the initial review
Aug. 7 of Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor produced by the company of the same
name for registration. It is now undergoing a public announcement
period and if no one comes forward to contest the name in the next
three months, it could become the first Taiwan tobacco and wine
product to be registered in the mainland that has the name of a
Taiwan location on it.</P>
      <P>Lee, as well as Legislator Wu Cheng-dian of the opposition New
Party, and Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. Chairman Lee Jung-wen held a
press conference to announce the passing of the initial review of the
registration.</P>
      <P>But they also urged the government to come up with measures to
deal with rogue Taiwan businessmen trying to register similar names
of popular Taiwan products in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that to have Kinmen Kaoliang making inroads into
mainland China has been one of his major goals, adding that the
company has been applying to register with the mainland since July 7,
1999, but was rejected three times, with one of the reasons being
that mainland Chinese trademark law prohibits the use of the name of
county-level administration regions as a trademark.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, Lee said, after four years of efforts, mainland
China finally concluded that Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor has "already been
used for some time, " and is a brand name with "a certain influence,
" in passing the initial review.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor's registration in the
mainland was also delayed because some rouge Taiwan businessmen had
maliciously registered similar names, such as "Kinmen King" and
"Kinmen" liquors that were not even produced in Kinmen to fool
consumers.</P>
      <P>Lee said that "Kinmen King" trademark was revoked, but some rogue
Taiwan businessmen are still trying to block the registration work of
Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor, with even Taiwan Beer possibly falling victim
to such malicious intentions.</P>
      <P>Lee said that since relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait are unique, and authorities in charge with trademark matters
across the Taiwan Strait have not been able to effectively protect
intellectual property rights and other information through exchanges,
the rogue Taiwan businessmen have the chance to reap profits from
registering a similar trademark.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the effective management of rogue Taiwan businessmen's
illegal practice in the mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that after the successful launch of
Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor in the mainland, passing bogus Kinmen liquor
will stop, and will pave the way for Taiwan's Beer to enter the
mainland.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Sun Kuo-hua of the opposition
Kuomintang on Wednesday criticized Austria for not treating Taiwan
nationals fairly in issuing visas.</P>
      <P>Sun said that the Republic of China has already provided all
members of the Schengen Agreement, which includes Austria, the
convenience of visa-free stay of 30 days in Taiwan, and he wondered
why Taiwan people have to produce documents to show financial status
when applying for a visa from the Austrian office in Taiwan, which he
termed as "strikingly unfair."</P>
      <P>Sun said that when he and legislators Parris Chang and Hung
Chi-chang of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party applied to the
Austrian Trade Delegation to attend a major overseas Chinese
conference in Austria in July, they were asked to provide copies of
their credit cards.</P>
      <P>The application of Chang Fu-mei, chairwoman of the Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission, was even rejected because she was
suspected of trying to engage in political activities, according to
Sun.</P>
      <P>Sun said that this was when he realized how unfairly Austria had
been treating Taiwan nationals.</P>
      <P>Sun said that compared with the convenience provided by Taiwan to
all Schengen Agreement members, Austria has not reciprocated.</P>
      <P>Sun later went to the Austrian Trade Delegation to lodge a
protest and urge Austria and other Schengen Agreement members to
revoke the regulations on providing credit card copies to prove the
applicants' financial status.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHANG GUNG HOSPITAL COMPLETES TAIWAN'S FIRST SPLIT-LIVER TRANSPLANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A brain-dead donor liver was split
between two critical patients at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Linko, Taipei County last month, saving the lives of both patients in
only the 36th successful operation of its kind in the world, a
hospital spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Gung chief surgeon Lee Wei-chen said his team split a donor
liver from a brain-dead woman, which was transplanted into the bodies
of two men whose livers were seriously diseased.</P>
      <P>Lee said split-liver transplants where one donor liver is used to
transplant to two recipients can help save the lives of more
patients. But he said precise evaluation is needed before the surgery
to ensure that the donor liver is big enough to support two
recipients.</P>
      <P>In the Chang Gung case, the donor weighed about 55 kilograms,
while the two male recipients weighed 61 kilograms and 58 kilograms,
respectively. After a careful assessment, Lee said his team decided
to perform the split-liver transplants in operations that lasted 10
hours.</P>
      <P>Lee said the pieces of liver transplanted into the two recipients
have regenerated to several times their original sizes and are
functioning normally.</P>
      <P>"The donor family's selflessness has helped save the lives of
these two people," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The two recipients, identified as Lin Ching-piao and Hsiung
Chen-hsing, were discharged from the hospital last week in good
health.</P>
      <P>They returned to the hospital Wednesday for physical checkups and
to attend a news conference along with the medical team to make
public the new domestic medical achievement.</P>
      <P>Lin, 52, said he lapsed into a coma shortly after he checked into
Chang Gung in June because of acute liver disease.</P>
      <P>"After I regained consciousness, I found I was lying beside a
stranger in an isolation ward. Later on, a doctor told me that I had
undergone a liver transplant with a piece of liver from a brain-dead
woman and that my 'neighbor' had also received a transplant with a
piece of liver from the same donor," Lin recalled.</P>
      <P>Hsiung, 39, who was also critically ill with cirrhosis before the
transplant, said he has developed a close friendship with Lin as they
shared the same donor liver and had both endured the discomfort of
surgery and the risks of complications and rejection.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Hsiung expressed their heartfelt gratitude to the
donor and pledged to do volunteer work during their leisure time for
the rest of their lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WEALTH GAP TO BE FURTHER NARROWED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said the government has
successfully narrowed the income gap between the rich and the poor
through a combination of measures, including boosting economic
growth, creating jobs and improving welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks at a weekly Cabinet meeting after listening
to an analytical report on local hosuehold incomes in 2002,
jointly prepared by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) and the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>According to the report, the average disposable income of the top
20 percent of households, at NT$1,799,733, was 6.16 times that of the
bottom 20 percent of households, slightly lower than the figure of
6.39 registered in 2001.</P>
      <P>Yu said the government has consistently given priority to
enhancing economic growth, creating jobs and increasing
welfare services for the disadvantageous.</P>
      <P>"These efforts have paid off as the income gap has been narrowed
and the average income of local households has increased over the
past year," Yu said, adding that the government will continue its
efforts to promote equitable distribution of wealth and sustain
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD predicted that the income gap between the
richest 20 percent of local families and the poorest 20 percent can
be further narrowed to 6.05 times in 2003 in case the nation's
economic growth rate reaches 3.06 percent, social welfare
expenditure accounts for 3.8 percent of GDP and the
unemployment rate drops to 4.8 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUNGSHAN UNLIKELY TO BE PART OF DIRECT AIR LINKS WITH MAINLAND: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the Executive Yuan prefers to
start direct flights with the mainland from Hsiaokang Airport in
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan and Chiang Kai-shek Airport in Taoyuan, at
first, other airports have not been ruled out, Tsai Ing-wen,
chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs Council said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said Taipei's Sungshan Airport, which cannot
accommodate Boeing 747 cargo flights, would not help the country's
efforts to develop itself into a business hub in the region even if
it was opened for direct links.</P>
      <P>She made the comment in response to a request made by Liu
Pao-kui, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei City Government, at a
weekly Cabinet meeting. Liu urged the Cabinet to make Sungshan one of
the airports linked with the mainland by direct flights.</P>
      <P>Liu said that metropolitan Taipei has more than 900,000 people
 flying to and from the mainland every month, and the Sungshan
 Airport, which is used for domestic flights, still can take in 157
 more flights a day, and even more after the island's high-speed
 railway is completed in 2005. All these make Sungshan an appropriate
 airport for direct flights to and from the mainland.</P>
      <P>In addition to economic considerations, an official from the
Ministry of National Defense opposed the idea of making Sungshan a
direct-flights airport.</P>
      <P>The officer argued that it will open the capital's many
government office buildings to possible terrorist attacks such as the
one that took place in New York on Sept. 11, 2001 when hijackers
commandeered airplanes and rammed them into the World Trade Center
towers.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou made direct flight links from the
Sungshan Airport to the mainland one of his promises while
campaigning for reelection in 2002.</P>

      <P>Belize Prime Minister Said W. Musa said
Wednesday that his country supports the decision of the people of
Taiwan on their own fate as well as the Republic of China's attempts
to enter international organizations.</P>
      <P>Musa made the remarks at a meeting with President Chen Shui-bian
on the eve of a summit of heads of state of the ROC and Central
American countries to be held Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Musa, who has visited Taiwan several times, said he can see the
progress on the island every time he visits.</P>
      <P>Expressing gratitude for the ROC's contributions to economic
cooperation projects and its agricultural technology assistance to
his country, Musa said he looks forward to President Chen's visit to
Belize.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked the government of Belize for its long-term support
for the ROC's bids to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>The president added that his original plan to visit several
Central American countries in June was interrupted due to outbreaks
of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the island earlier
this year, and he hopes that he can visit Belize some time after
October.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan, an island country, has been through many
earthquakes and typhoons, including a devastating 7.6-magnitude
temblor in 1999, Chen said it is now working hard to recover from the
aftereffects of SARS.</P>
      <P>The disease affected Taiwan seriously by making numerous
commercial activities stop and by shrinking consumption, with the
island registering a negative economic growth of 0.08 percent in the
second quarter, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>However, the president added, with SARS contained, the country
recovered very rapidly. "We have faith that economic growth will
reach 3.9 percent and 4.6 percent in the third and fourth quarters,
respectively, and the growth for the whole year will be maintained at
more than 3 percent," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Musa hailed Chen's leadership and the ROC government's efficient
measures in controlling the disease, saying that he hopes the summit
among ROC and Central American leaders can find remedies and ideas on

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun condemned Boeing's
cancellation of a planned visit to the company's factory in the
United States by the ROC vice president, but said Wednesday that
whether to negate a contract with the airliner manufacturer to
purchase a number of aircraft would be up to the government
foundation that owns China Airlines (CAL).</P>
      <P>Although all companies, both private and state-owned, should give
the nation's interests priority over their profit margins, Yu said
that the government- owned China Aviation Development Foundation, the
largest stockholder of CAL, will decide whether to terminate CAL's
purchase contract with Boeing to protest the airliner manufacturer's
behavior toward Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>"Business should be separate from politics," Yu said, adding that
it was regrettable that Boeing impolitely turned the country's vice
president away because of "political reasons."</P>
      <P>He dismissed opposition parties' criticism that Lu's bungled
visit to Boeing was a diplomatic set-back for the administration,
saying that critics should speak out against Boeing and, more
specifically, Beijing, who forced Boeing to spurn Lu.</P>
      <P>Lu was scheduled to visit Boeing's plant in Seattle on Aug. 18
but Boeing canceled the visit six days earlier. Angered by what was
perceived as a snub, Lu said in a public speech in Seattle on Monday
that Boeing should be ashamed of itself.</P>
      <P>In related developments Wednesday, a lawmaker from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Lee Chun-yi, said he and his DPP
colleagues will ask CAL to terminate its contract with Boeing in the
next legislative session unless Boeing apologizes.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which seldom see eye to eye with
the DPP on anything, showed their sympathy for Lu. However, KMT whip
at the Legislative Yuan Lee Chia-chin said Taipei's diplomatic
struggles with Beijing date back five decades, and the DPP
administration should not be caught off guard by Beijing's
underhanded dealings.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes similar incidents will not happen when
President Chen Shui-bian makes a transit stop in the United States in
October on his way to visit Central America.</P>

(By Lillian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Filipino pair of conjoined twins joined
at the chest and abdomen returned to the Philippines Thursday after
undergoing successful separation surgery in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The infant girl twins, accompanied by their mother and a
volunteer from the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation,
boarded a Philippine Airlines flight to Manila in the morning.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation, the largest
charity organization in Taiwan, had arranged for the operation in its
hospital.</P>
      <P>While boarding the plane back home, the mother of the twins,
Marieta Awel, held one of the baby girls in her arms, while the Tzu
Chi volunteer held the other girl. The mother said she was full of
happiness and gratitude for Tzu Chi's help in giving her daughters
the opportunity to have independent lives.</P>
      <P>The two infant girls, Lea and Rachel, were born July 1, 2000, in
the province of Kalinga in the northern Philippines. The father works
on a farm, earning only about NT$32 (US$0.92) a day, while the
mother is a housewife. The two girls are their first children. As the
family was too poor to afford to care for the twins and had to solicit
the assistance of their local government.</P>
      <P>The babies were sent to a children's hospital in Manila, where
Tzu Chi volunteers first met them in January this year and reported
to Master Cheng Yen, founder of the Tzu Chi foundation, who expressed
great concern.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi Buddhist General Hospital then took over the matter
and performed the separation surgery June 28. Doctors reported that
the most difficult part of the procedure was dealing with the
conjoined liver.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT RESURGENCE OF SARS: HEALTH OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has taken the initiative in
guarding against the possible reemergence of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), and the public can rest easy, a Department of Health
(DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director general of the DOH's Center for
Disease Control, made the remarks in the wake of wire service reports
that a SARS-like disease had swept through a nursing home in
Vancouver, Canada, killing six residents so far.</P>
      <P>The Associated Press reports said that the disease looks like
SARS and acts like a milder version of SARS, which has killed 44
people in Canada, but officials doubt the respiratory illness is
SARS.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan has already taken the initiative in implementing
SARS detection and prevention measures, and he assured the public
that they need not be concerned about a resurgence of SARS in Taiwan,
adding that the likelihood of the SARS-like disease seen in Canada
appearing in Taiwan is low.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that if SARS does hit Taiwan again, it will most
likely first strike those who are older and more frail. He said
nursing homes in Taiwan kicked off a health self-management mechanism
July 15 to prevent the reemergence of SARS. Any of the nursing home
residents who are found to have the symptoms of fever will be sent to
hospital immediately to avoid any transmissions.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the DOH has also taken the initiative to begin
random checks on 50 patients per week in Taiwan hospitals, taking
blood samples of those with fever to test for possible dengue fever,
Japanese encephalitis or SARS.</P>
      <P>Starting from November 15, the checks will increase in frequency,
with the DOH staff checking 50 patients with fever each day,
targeting influenza and SARS especially, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there have been no suspected SARS cases registered
so far and that the public can rest assured because of the
government's series of stringent preventive measures.</P>
      <P>SARS hit Taiwan hard between March and late June this year,
claiming 84 lives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT INTEGRATION AIMED AT PEACE, DEMOCRACY: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday his
appeal for economic and cultural integration between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait is mainly aimed at creating peace, democracy and
prosperity on both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening session of the fourth summit meeting of
top leaders of the Republic of China and its diplomatic allies in
Central America and the Caribbean, Chen said he hopes to resolve
cross-strait political disputes through increased economic and
cultural exchanges and integration.</P>
      <P>Chen urged mainland China to renounce the option of military
force in resolving disputes and to work together with Taiwan in
creating peace, democracy and prosperity for the benefit of the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He added that this is also the basis of the ROC's thinking in
actively participating in the process of Central American
integration.</P>
      <P>"We are more than willing to work with our Central American
allies in boosting democracy, prosperity, peace and equitable
distribution of wealth in the region," he said.</P>
      <P>Since the first ROC-Central America summit meeting was held in
1997, Chen said, the event has laid clear direction for bilateral and
multilateral cooperation between the ROC and its allies in the
region.</P>
      <P>"With co-prosperity, cooperation and development as the main
themes, I'm convinced that the current meeting will further
consolidate the foundation for our future cooperation and sustainable
development," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also took advantage of the occasion to thank the Central
American and Caribbean diplomatic allies for their firm support for
Taiwan's cause in the international community over the years.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate your unswerving support for our bid to join major
international organizations, including the United Nations and the
World Health Organization (WHO)," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) earlier this year has signified the importance of
international cooperation in disease control and prevention, Chen
said Taiwan's bid to join the WHO has thus received more sympathy and
support this year.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's opposition, Chen said, Taiwan is still shut
out of the WHO. Chen said the ROC will not be daunted by the setback
and will make continued efforts to realize its goal to join the world
health body for the sake of enhancing health care for its people and
making a greater contribution to world health.</P>
      <P>Thanks to a series of pump-priming projects adopted by his
administration, Chen said, Taiwan has gradually recovered from the
adverse impact brought by the SARS outbreak between March and June
this year.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, Chen said,
Taiwan is by no means an isolated island. On the contrary, he said,
Taiwan is a "global island" with extensive ties with the rest of the
world.</P>
      <P>While diligently developing its economy and carrying out
democratic reforms, Chen said, Taiwan has also spared no efforts in
fulfilling it obligations as a member of the global community.</P>
      <P>Through its democratic reforms, human rights protection, and
active participation in international humanitarian relief programs
and the global anti-terrorist campaign, Chen said Taiwan has received
ever-increasing world recognition. Countries around the world can no
longer ignore Taiwan's existence and must face up to its presence in
the international community, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also reaffirmed the consistency and continuity of the ROC's
diplomatic policy, saying that his administration will abide by all
the country's agreements and treaties with other countries and will
honor its promises to its allies.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the current summit meeting will chart concrete
programs and measures to further boost cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he is scheduled to make his third
state visits to Central American countries in November to bring
Taiwan people's love and frienship to ROC allies in the region.
He added he believes that "heads of state diplomacy" or "summit
diplomacy" is an effective way to promote international relations.</P>
      <P>A joint communique will be signed at the end of the summit.
Moreover, President Chen and Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso will
sign a free trade agreement (FTA) on behalf of their two governments,
with other summit attendees witnessing. It will be the first FTA that
Taiwan has ever signed with any of its major trading partners.</P>
      <P>Attendees at the summit nclude Costa Rica President Abel
Pacheco, Nicaragua President Enrique Bolanos, El Salvador President
Francisco Flores, Guatemala President Alfonso Portillo, Panama
President Mireya Moscoso, Honduras Vice President Alberto Diaz,
Belize Prime Minister Said Musa, and Sergio Grullo, secretary-general
to the president of the Dominican Republic.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A parade and an evening party will be held
in downtown Taipei Friday to commemorate "the Battle of the Taiwan
Straits," which started on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>The commemorating activities will be sponsored by the major
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the "Confederation of Veterans
of the Aug. 23 Battle."</P>
      <P>On Aug. 23, 1958, Communist Chinese troops began to shell the
Kinmen island (Quemoy). In the first 36 hours, the island was
battered by 94,000 rounds of gunfire. In the following 42 days, some
400,000 additional shells rained down on the island, which is only
131 square kilometers in area. The Communist attack was finally
repulsed. The situation in the Taiwan Strait became stable
after the battle.</P>
      <P>A KMT spokesman said the battle symbolizes an honor to serve in
the armed forces to defend Taiwan. He said the battle has a very
important meaning, but the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has
ignored it.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the activities said some 8,000 veterans of the
battle and a few legislators of the KMT and the People First Party
will participate in the parade from Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD LET HONG KONG HAVE MORE DEMOCRACY: EDITORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Aug. 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington Post said in Thursday's
editorial that mainland China should let Hong Kong people have more
democracy.</P>
      <P>In the editorial, titled "Democracy for Hong Kong," the newspaper
said the massive demonstrations last month in Hong Kong in support of
democracy and against a Beijing-backed anti-sedition law do not seem
to have shocked China's Communist rulers enough to accept the remedy
for the dilemma, which would be more democracy.</P>
      <P>Instead, they are following a more familiar Communist script:
"Make short-term concessions to popular anger while vilifying and
seeking to isolate democracy movement leaders," the editorial said.</P>
      <P>This tended to confirm the prediction of an American columnist
last week that Beijing would follow "classic united front tactics,"
pressuring some democracy proponents back into the fold while
ostracizing and vilifying those who can't be pressured. The columnist
said, "The demonization of the democrats,... will alienate the
majority of Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>The editorial said that, in the long run an effort to rein in
Hong Kong can only sour U.S.-China relations. If China really wants
to understand their views and complaints, it should let Hong Kong's
people express those views through the ballot box.

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fourth summit meeting of the heads of
state of the Republic of China and its diplomatic allies in Central
America and the Caribbean opened in Taipei Thursday, with the topics
of political and economic cooperation dominating the first part of
the one-day meeting.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the opening ceremony at 9
a.m. Afterwards, the participants entered into a roundtable room
which accommodates 40 people.</P>
      <P>The first part of the morning meeting centered on the giving of
reports and discussions on political issues. After President Chen
gave a brief report, Honduran Vice President Alberto Diaz gave a
report on regional integration in Central America. Panamanian
President Mireya Moscoso then gave a report on security, focusing on
anti-terrorism and the battle against drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>President Chen affirmed the efficacy of Central America's
regional integration, adding that he is happy to see the Central
America region's development and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The president said that since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks in the United States, the world has begun to attach greater
importance to the question of security, pointing to the passage of
U.N.
Resolution 1373 in 2001 which states that the Security Council
unanimously adopted a wide-ranging, comprehensive resolution with
steps and strategies to combat terrorism.</P>
      <P>Although the Republic of China is not a member of the United
Nations, it will devote itself to cooperating in the international
battle against the crime, Chen said, earning an enthusiastic response
from the participating countries.</P>
      <P>Reports and discussion on issues related to the economy and
cooperation made up the second part of the morning meeting. President
Chen first gave a report on cooperation relations, then Guatemalan
President Alfonso Portillo gave a report on the cooperation and trade
relations between the ROC and Central America, with participating
countries expressing appreciation for the assistance provided by the
ROC to Central America and the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>President Chen noted that Central America has excellent
geographical position and abundant natural resources. After a free
trade zone in America is established, the region's potential for
development will be enormous, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Navy General Headquarters (NGH)
debunked media reports Thursday that a navy anti-submarine aircraft
made a forced landing at Shuinan Airport in the central Taiwan city
of Taichung earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The NGH said in a press release that the S-2T was on a
post-maintenance test flight when its pilot spotted an engine fire
warning signal.</P>
      <P>The pilot immediately made an emergency landing, the press
statement said, adding that thanks to the pilot's appropriate
handling, the plane landed safely and didn't veer off the runway as
some media reports claimed.</P>
      <P>The NGH further said the plane's smooth emergency landing should
not be described as a forced landing. It also dismissed as
"misleading" media reports that the S-2T was stranded on the runway.</P>
      <P>The NGH stressed that the emergency landing didn't disrupt
Shuinan Airport operations.</P>
      <P>According to airport regulations, fire engines and other
emergency engineering vehicles were mobilized while the S-2T was
making an emergency landing. The mobilization might have cause a
false alarm, NGH sources said.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force transferred 20-plus S-2T anti-submarine
aircraft to the navy a few years ago under a military restructuring
plan. As the S-2Ts are aging, the military has sought to buy a new
generation of anti-submarine aircraft. The United States has agreed
to sell 12 P-3C long-range anti-submarine aircraft to Taiwan. The
navy has yet to detail a procurement plan.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>English teachers in Taiwan said Thursday
that the most common problem they encounter in classrooms is the gap
between students in urban and rural areas and the different levels of
students.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a press conference which was held in the
wake of two workshops sponsored by the College Board, a New
York-based U.S. education institution that is specialized in
nurturing English teachers.</P>
      <P>The three-day workshops were held in Taipei Aug. 14-16 and in
Kaohsiung Aug. 18-20, with 154 English teachers from junior and
senior high schools attending.</P>
      <P>The two teaching experts and two staff of the College Board, who
were invited by the Ministry of Education to come to Taiwan, said
that the ideal situation would be around 20 students in a class,
although most of the English teachers said that they have to deal
with far more students than that.</P>
      <P>A survey of the participants of the workshops found that up to 90
percent of the teachers said that the workshop has helped them, with
some also suggesting that there will be advanced courses in the
future and that they could receive guidance on how to effectively
teach a class that has strikingly different levels of students.</P>
      <P>Fang Huei-chin, an English teacher in a Taipei County junior high
school, said that English teaching tends to focus on reading under
the present examination system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fang said that she had spent a lot of time comparing the English
teaching materials on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and found that
the materials used in the mainland seek to upgrade the students'
ability in listening, speaking and reading and writing
simultaneously, which she said was quite a surprise to her.</P>
      <P>Fang noted that she used to focus on the performance of the
students in tests, and now she was aware that the ability of
listening, speaking, reading and writing is equally important.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BULL SUMMONED BY PROSECUTOR TO GIVE EVIDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bull which is at the center of an
ownership dispute made headlines Thursday after it was summoned by a
prosecutor at the Taoyuan District Court in northern Taiwan to
provide evidence Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Lee San-ming wanted to examine the bull to determine
whether it was the calf stolen from Taoyuan cattle farmer Peng
Yun-neng two years ago.</P>
      <P>Peng claimed his beloved two-year-old calf, called Aiai, was
stolen with three other cows while they were grazing in a riverbed in
Hsinwu, Taiyuan County two years ago. Witness said they saw people
used stun guns to put the cattle into a truck.</P>
      <P>Peng claimed he found Aiai in a herd of cattle raised by another
farmer in Tayuan, also in Taiyuan County earlier this year.</P>
      <P>His claim was disputed by the farmer, identified only by his
family name of Liang.</P>
      <P>Peng presented to a prosecutor a copy of Aiai's nose print he had
made when the bull was young to support his claim.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Peng said there is a close feeling between he and
his two-year-old bull, adding that the bull recognized him
immediately after they were first reunite.</P>
      <P>The bull rubbed its head against Peng gently and wagging its tail
fiercely as if glad to see him again, he said.</P>
      <P>However, the bull didn't show any sign of this close attachment
to Peng at Wednesday's hearing.</P>
      <P>The bull's present owner denied Peng's claim, arguing that he
bought the bull five years ago in Kaohsiung for NT$25,000 (US$730),
and said the bull had been sold at least nine times before it landed
in his ranch. The bull's nose print is not reliable evidence of its
identity, as it changes with age, he said.</P>
      <P>The bull's former nine owners were also present at Wednesday's
hearing. They angrily disputed Peng's claim over the bull.</P>
      <P>A cattle breeding expert from the Council of Agriculture helped
the prosecutor examine the bull's teeth and nose to determine its age
and breed. He also checked Peng's copy of the nose print against the
bull's nose, saying they looked similar, but he was not sure if the
bull is Aiai.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor remanded the bull to Peng's custody, saying
further investigation is needed before he can determine whose claim
is correct.</P>
      <P>A local lawyer said that even if the bull in dispute is the calf
stolen from Peng, its current owner who bought it legitimately would
get compensation for losing the bull under existing law. Only those
who buy stolen goods with knowledge that they are illegal will not be
protected.</P>
      <P>That means Peng still have to pay damages to the bull's current
owner before he can get back his Aiai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEAVING NUCLEAR WASTE TO NEXT GENERATION A SERIOUS MATTER: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said that the
establishment of a nuclear-free homeland is his lifelong goal and
leaving behind nuclear waste for future generations is a serious
moral issue.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks on his Web site which appears
every Thursday. He spoke of his encounter with a courageous teenager,
Hsieh Wen-lung, of the Tao tribe, when he received representatives
from an international children's human rights summit in April 2002.</P>
      <P>The 16-year-old Hsieh came forward to urge the president to
remove the low-radioactive wastes currently stored on Orchid Island,
and conveyed a letter of petition, which impressed him tremendously,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president said that he returned the letter to Hsieh after
carefully reading it, saying that his lifelong goal will be to
establish a nuclear-free homeland.</P>
      <P>The president said, "One should not think of the convenience of
the next 20 or 30 years and leave the nuclear waste to the next
generation, " adding that this would be a "very serious moral
question."</P>
      <P>In answer to a letter to his Web site, the president also urged
the public to participate actively in a global campaign on Sept. 20
to clean up the world.</P>
      <P>The letter, written by "David, " said that Taiwan is very
beautiful, but when one looks around, a person only sees the dirty
and chaotic sights. He suggested that the president set a "national
clean-up day."</P>
      <P>The president responded by saying that Taiwan people are not
without respect for public order, citing that there is no graffiti
either in or outside Taipei rapid transit stations and the
implementation of rules for no dumping of garbage on grounds in
Taipei as examples.</P>
      <P>The president said that spending 1,000 hours to do good is not as
good as 1,000 people spending an hour doing something good, which
will help society more, and this is the reason why he set May 20 as
"Taiwan Volunteer Day, " and set "volunteer Taiwan " as a social
reform movement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO ASSIST IN SEARCH FOR MISSING FISHING BOAT CREW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Thursday it will continue to assist in the search for crew members of
a Taiwan fishing boat which was discovered stranded off a port near
the Indonesian island of Java a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The COA's Fishery Administration said it has asked Indonesian
authorities to help search for the nine crew members aboard the
"Chanchengchung" fishing vessel which was found aground off Sullivan
Port in Java Wednesday after having lost contact for more than two
weeks.</P>
      <P>The vessel left Tungkang in southern Taiwan June 19, with three
Taiwan crew members as well as two mainland and four Indonesian
fishery workers on board. The families of the ship's Taiwan crewmen
reported to fishery authorities Aug. 2 that they had lost radio
contact July 31. According to the report, the ship was operating in
waters east of Guam when it made last contact.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of Indonesian authorities, the ship was
discovered Wednesday off Sullivan Port, but none of its crew and fish
catch were aboard.</P>
      <P>The fishery administration said the incident might have been
caused by three possible scenarios -- encountering a natural
disaster, or being robbed by pirates or a crew mutiny.</P>
      <P>Sha Chih-yi, deputy chief of the Fishery Administration, said the
most urgent task at the moment is to locate all crew members for
questioning.</P>
      <P>Sha refrained from making any comments on media reports that the
incident might be related to the hiring of Indonesian sailors. But he
acknowledged that management of foreign crew members has become a
tough issue.</P>
      <P>With fewer Taiwan people willing to work aboard fishing boats,
local shipowners have been forced to hire mainland or foreign
sailors. Sha said the government will review the current policy on
employment of foreign fishery workers and will open more leadership
training programs for local fishing boats skippers or captains to
cope with the new situation.</P>
      <P>Since May 2002, the skippers and first engineers aboard two Taiwan
fishing boats have been killed by their Indonesian crew members.</P>
      <P>Local shipowners have been forced to hire Indonesian sailors
after mainland China banned exports of fishery workers to Taiwan last
February. Local skippers dislike employing Vietnamese workers because
they were allegedly lazy and inferior in fishing skills. Philippine
sailors were also unwelcome as they were prone to brawling after
drinking.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has agreed to improving treatment for mainland fishery
workers, mainland Chinese authorities have invited local fishery
associations to visit the mainland in the near future to discuss
manpower export issues.</P>
      <P>Local shipowners like to hire mainland workers because they speak
the same language and have a common cultural background. "We hope the
mainland export ban can be lifted as early as possible, " a Tungkang
fishery association executive said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The optical communication industry has
become a rising star in Taiwan, with its production expected to reach
NT$40 billion (US$1.16 billion) in 2008, accounting for 40 percent of
global production.</P>
      <P>Liu Jung-sheng, director of the opto-electronics and systems
laboratories under the Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI) , made the remarks in an international optical communication
forum held in Taipei Thursday, in which about 100 experts, scholars
and government officials from around the world attended.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that in the past five years, domestic optical
communication firms have been focusing on the production of passive
devices, and until the last two or three years they have made
considerable progress in active devices.</P>
      <P>However, Liu added, their products were mainly for original
equipment manufacture (OEM), and crucial components still depended on
imports. Liu urged domestic manufacturers to develop high-end
products, such as laser diodes and receivers, to sharpen their
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is also president of the Taiwan Optical Communication
Industry Alliance, noted that the world optical communication market
is reviving, with many orders flowing into Asia in search of
suppliers, and Taiwan manufacturers are well prepared to capitalize
on opportunities offered by its neighboring countries like Japan,
India and mainland China.</P>
      <P>An expert from mainland China said that the optical communication
related industries in mainland China are growing considerably thanks
to the promotion of the government; however, there still remains much
space for the improvement of some technologies. He urged the
industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to cooperate to create
more trade opportunities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sought to build
closer ties with the Republic of China's diplomatic partners in
Central America and the Caribbean Thursday, asking allies in the
region to help Taiwan join regional groups in bilateral cooperation
to explore the world market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the call at the Fourth Summit of the Heads of States
and Governments of the ROC, Central America, the Dominican Republic
and Belize, which lasted through the day. Presidents, envoys and
ranking officials from Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Belize took part in the
event -- the largest ever sponsored by the grouping to date.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan hopes very much to enter the System of Central
American Integration as a non-regional member and become a dialogue
partner at the planned American free trade agreement area.</P>
      <P>Challenged by fierce competition from across the globe, the
president said Taiwan has been relentless in seeking globalization by
taking part in international and regional organizations, including
those based in Central and South America which are of vital
importance to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a bid to boost trade and commercial relations with friendly
countries in that part of the world, the ROC government has spared no
effort to sponsor investment seminars and provide loans as well as
securing legal incentives and encouraging Taiwan businesses to invest
there, he said, claiming that all the measures have noticeably paid
off.</P>
      <P>For instance, exports of seven Central American countries and the
Dominican Republic to Taiwan in 2002 rose by 29 percent compared to
the 2001 level, while Taiwan investments in those countries have
totaled more than US$1.4 billion as of the end of June this year, an
indication that two-way links have solidified in recent years, he
said.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, Chen said Taiwan is willing to share its
development experience with those countries and expressed the hope
that more business alliances could be set up, both for the government
and private sectors, between the two sides to create a mutually
beneficial "win-win" relationship.</P>
      <P>With the help and assistance of diplomatic allies in Central
America and the Caribbean, Taiwan sincerely hopes to become a
non-regional member of the System of Central American Integration and
a dialogue partner of the proposed American free trade agreement
area, which is slated to take shape in 2005, Chen reiterated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will benefit a great deal from an
economic recovery in the United States, and the country's economic
growth rate is expected to reach 4 percent for this year and 6
percent for 2004, a high-profile economist from Europe said Thursday
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Norbert Walter, chief economist of Deutsche Bank Group, Germany
made the comments while giving a key-note speech on global economic
recovery at a seminar sponsored by the European Chamber of Commerce
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The current economic rebound in the United States will persist
until November next year for President George W. Bush to seek
re-election, Walter predicted, claiming that Taiwan, a major
outsource of the U. S. information industry, will also "go with the
tide."</P>
      <P>Taiwan will secure a 4 percent economic growth rate for this
year, while the ratio for 2004 will hit 6 percent, he forecast,
adding that Asian economies, including mainland China, will be the
leading engine behind the global economic upturn. Before traveling to
Taiwan, Walter also visited mainland China and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the problem of a stronger renminbi, mainland
China's currency, Walter ruled out such a possibility over the next
year on the grounds that the new Beijing leadership will try to
stabilize its job market and achieve an 8 percent economic growth
rate by maintaining the value of its currency at its current level.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that the renminbi must be freely
convertible should mainland China wish to become a world power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>60 PERCENT OF TAIWAN PEOPLE SUPPORT DIRECT TRANSPORT LINKS WITH MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) survey
released Thursday showed that almost 60 percent of Taiwan people
support direct transportation links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey conducted Aug. 18-19 followed the recent
remarks by President Chen Shui-bian that his administration will
promote the opening of direct cross-strait transportation links under
a three-stage program by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The survey, queried 860 adults around Taiwan, had a margin of
error of 3.4 percent.</P>
      <P>A total of 57 percent said they are afraid that direct
transportation links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait may
jeopardize the island's security, while 34 percent said they are not
worried.</P>
      <P>Fifty two percent said that direct transportation ties will rev
up Taiwan's economy, while 34 percent said they do not think so.</P>
      <P>On Chen's statement that there is one country on each side of the
Taiwan Strait regarding the status of relations between Taiwan and
mainland China, 57 percent said they agreed with it, while 26 percent
said no.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the survey also showed that after Chen's remarks on
opening direct transport links with mainland China, the popularity
between Chen and the presidential election ticket of opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chen and People First Party Chairman James
Soong would be equal, making next year's presidential election a
neck-to-neck race.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AND PANAMA SIGN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian signed a free
trade agreement with visiting Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Emerging from a summit between Chen and his counterparts of the
country's eight Central American allies, both Chen and Moscoso put
their names on the agreement in a brief ceremony.</P>
      <P>Noting that the pact is the second of its kind signed by her
after she took office, Moscoso said the agreement opens a new chapter
in bilateral ties and cements the long-standing economic and trade
exchanges between Taiwan and Panama.</P>
      <P>She said the agreement which provides for a 95 percent cut in
tariffs on goods from each nation over the next 10 years will boost
two-way trade and give Panama a valuable access to the Asia market
through Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It also serves as an example for Panama in future negotiations
with other countries on free trade pacts.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said the agreement is significant for his
country as it is the first free trade pact ever signed by the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>He urged other Central American states to follow Panama's lead in
forming free trade agreements with Taiwan, adding that his country is
more than willing to become their gateway to the Asia market.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chen and Moscoso, Thursday's summit brought
together El Salvador President Francisco Flores, Guatemala President
Alfonso Portillo, Costa Rica President Abel Pacheco, Nicaragua
President Enrique Bolanos, Belize Prime Minister Said Musa, Honduras
Vice President Alberto Diaz and Secretary-General to the president of
the Dominican Republic, Sergio Grullo.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, Vice Economics Minister Chen
Ruey-long said the free trade pact with Panama not only will give
Taiwan a valuable trade bridgehead in the Americas but also will
prompt other countries to talk with Taiwan on similar agreements.</P>
      <P>Panama, on the crossroads of the Americas, is set to become a
member of the American Free Trade Zone in 2005. ROC's free trade with
Panama will provide Taiwan businessmen a strategic highland in this
central American state from which to make forays into both north and
south America, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the favorable treatment Taiwan grants to Panama in
the agreement will certainly drive other countries which used to shun
Taiwan for fear of offending Beijing into negotiating with Taipei.</P>
      <P>The vice minister said it will open the door to more similar
pacts for Taiwan.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Deposit Insurance Corp.
(CDIC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with its South
Korean counterpart Friday to establish formal cooperative ties.</P>
      <P>Tsay Chin-tsair, chairman of the CDIC, and Yon Won-Young,
chairman and CEO of the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO) ,
signed the MOU on behalf of their respective institutions.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Finance Minister Chang Hsiu-lien, in witnessing the
signing ceremony, said that South Korea's achievement in addressing
its non-performing loans problem in its financial sector has won
world recognition, adding that "Taiwan can learn from South Korea's
experience."</P>
      <P>Tsay noted that South Korea suffered a deterioration in both its
financial and corporate sectors during the Asian financial crisis of
1997. As a result, the amount of non-performing loans of financial
institutions in the country rose sharply. In order to restore
financial stability, the KAMCO was reorganized in 1997 and put in
charge of handling the non-performing loans of South Korean banks.</P>
      <P>Since then, the KAMCO has adopted aggressive and cutting edge
techniques in the overall planning and operation of its
Non-Performing Asset Fund in order to effectively resolve the
non-performing loan problem of financial institutions and to promote
the sound operations of the country's financial institutions and
companies, Tsay added.</P>
      <P>Tsay said that as state-owned enterprises, the CDIC and KAMCO
have the mission of upholding financial stability and promoting the
healthy development of the financial sectors of their respective
countries.</P>
      <P>He said that the signing of the MOU will expand cooperation and
exchanges between the two sides in carrying out their mission. In the
future, the two sides will share their expertise and experience in
order to raise the efficiency of their operations, he added.</P>
      <P>Such exchanges will be facilitated by the appointing of official
contact representatives and by the arranging of meetings, training
programs, and information personnel exchanges, he added.</P>

      <P>The Ilan County Government-sponsored
2003 International Children's Film Festival, the first children's
film festival ever to be held in Taiwan, kicked off in Ilan Friday.</P>
      <P>To give the festival more publicity, the county government held a

story told through the eyes of aboriginal children. The theme is of
an aboriginal culture gradually eroded by modern life.</P>
      <P>The festival, which features movies and animation from eight

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO SET UP IMMIGRATION AGENCY SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An association grouping nine Taiwan social
welfare organizations suggested on Friday that the government
establish an immigration agency as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice said that in view of
Taiwan's declining birth rates and the rapid graying of the island's
population, the government should also work out a substantive
immigration policy soon.</P>
      <P>Alliance officials said that it is estimated that the number of
new births in Taiwan for this year will not exceed 220,000, marking
the lowest figure in half a decade. The forecasted figure is
one-third less than that for 1997, and nearly 50 percent less than
the number of annual births seen during the 1960s.</P>
      <P>They added that it is estimated that the birth rate will be less
than 1 percent for this year, or an average of 1.3 births per couple,
even lower than the average of 1.6 birth per couple for
industrialized countries.</P>
      <P>With declining birth rates in Taiwan, the ratio of senior
citizens has risen rapidly, the officials said, citing statistics by
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) to back up
their claims.</P>
      <P>The CEPD estimated that by 2007, senior citizens will account for
10 percent of the total population, and by 2025, the ratio will
increase to 20 percent, the alliance officials added.</P>
      <P>The officials said that compared with other countries, the speed
of graying in Taiwan is the fastest in the world.</P>
      <P>The officials suggested that the government work out a
comprehensive immigration policy, adding that Taiwan already has a
lot of women from mainland China and Southeast Asian nations marrying
Taiwan men.</P>
      <P>Figures released by the Ministry of the Interior showed that
there are around 250,000 foreign spouses of Taiwan residents, and
that children born to foreign spouses accounted for over 12 percent
of all new births in Taiwan last year, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that the government has viewed the
newly-arrived women as the responsibility of the individual families
and has refused to address the issue of the women's civil rights. The
related government agencies have only had contingency plans to deal
with unexpected situations, they added.</P>
      <P>The officials urged the government to establish an immigration
agency and work out a substantial immigration policy soon to address
and protect the work, education and social welfare rights of the new
arrivals.</P>
      <P>The officials also urged the Taiwan people not to look down on or
view with suspicion the new arrivals after they obtain their
residential status in Taiwan, and to give Taiwan a new color of
peace, tolerance and pluralism. They added that the new arrivals will
help alleviate the problem of Taiwan's graying population.</P>
      <P>The alliance, which was formed Aug. 10, is also known as the
"pan-purple alliance" to distinguish itself from the "pan-green" camp
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- and the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China signed a cooperation
agreement with El Salvador Friday, pledging to gradually redress the
central American nation's trade deficit with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chi-jen, chairman of the semi-official China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA), signed the agreement with El
Salvador Minister of Foreign Affairs Maria Eugenia Brizuela de Avila,
on behalf of their respective countries.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said that in view of the trade surpluses enjoyed
over a long period of time by Taiwan with the five Central American
countries, the ROC government began an action plan of promoting
exports to Taiwan by the five nations, and promoting investment in
the countries by Taiwan manufacturers to redress the trade
imbalances.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that after the launch of the plan, the ROC's
exports to El Salvador totaled US$70.78 million for 2001, down from
US$87.66 million for 2000, while imports into Taiwan from El
Salvador increased from US$532,000 in 2000 to US$1,177,000 in 2001.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after the signing of the agreement, the
CETRA will work closely with the economic unit of the Foreign

Taiwan manufacturers to invest in El Salvador and encouraging them to
export their products back to Taiwan to help redress the trade
imbalance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Papua New Guinea (PNG) opened an
honorary consulate-general in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung Friday to further promote bilateral relations, particularly
in fishery cooperation.</P>
      <P>Papua New Guinea Honorary Consul-General Tsai Ting-pang presided
over the inaugural ceremony, with the participation of
representatives from the PNG fishery community, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh, opposition Kuomintang Kaohsiung Chapter Director Lin
Hsiang-nung and executives of major Kaohsiung fishery groups.</P>
      <P>Tsai, president of the Kaohsiung Fishery Association and a former
National Assembly member, said Papua New Guinea appointed him as a
consul-general in Taiwan in May this year and that he has received a
certificate from the ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to perform
consular duties on the island.</P>
      <P>During his trip to the South Pacific island nation in July, Tsai
said he had met with PNG Prime Minister Michael Somare for
wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>"Somare told me that his country appreciates the ROC's longtime
assistance, particularly the dispatch of a technical mission to
assist in Papua New Guinea's fishery industry development, " he
recalled.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the most encouraging result of his visit was that PNG
has agreed to directly print its visa stamps on ROC passports,
instead of on an additional paper attached to the passports as in the
past because of the absence of formal diplomatic ties. Moreover, he
said, the PNG visa stamps will identify Taipei, Taiwan as the issuing
place.</P>
      <P>Papua New Guinea is a major purse seine fishing ground for
Kaohsiung-based deep-sea fishing vessels. More than 40 large purse
seine fishing vessels from Kaohsiung are currently operating in PNG
waters, with tuna, spearfish and bonito as their main catch.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Tuna Fishing Industry Association signed a fishery
cooperative agreement with PNG in February 2001.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC's Center for Disease Control (CDC)
under the Department of Health (DOH) said Friday it has come up with
a plan to ask arrivals from Canada to undergo self-health management
to prevent a recurrence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).</P>
      <P>The CDC made the remarks amid reports that cluster transmissions
of a SARS-like disease have occurred at a nursing home in Vancouver.
Although the United Nations has yet to confirm whether the outbreak
is SARS-related, the new development has caused international
concern.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said Taiwan must heighten its
alert and adopt appropriate precautionary measures to ward off any
possible import of SARS.</P>
      <P>"We have presented a preventive measures initiative to the DOH
for approval, " Shih said, adding that the date for implementing the
measures will be decided in the next few days.</P>
      <P>According to the CDC proposal, arrivals from Canada will be asked
to take their own temperatures daily. Should they fall ill during a
specified period of time, they should go to a designated fever
screening center to receive treatment.</P>
      <P>At the moment, arrivals from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau
have been subject to such requirements. "We plan to impose similar
requirements to arrivals from Canada as part of drive to prevent SARS
from returning to Taiwan," Shih said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Toronto were gripped by
SARS between March and June this year. Health experts are concerned
about a SARS relapse this winter.</P>
      <P>Shih said local people intending to visit Canada in the near
future should pay attention to their personal hygiene -- wash their
hands frequently and avoid unnecessary visits to hospitals or public
places during their stay in Canada.</P>

to the ROC-Panama free trade agreement inked Thursday and President

      <P>The spokesman's remarks came on the heels of Beijing's claim that
it will spare no effort to set up full diplomatic links with Panama,

rhetoric.</P>

and expressed his appreciation for the support El Salvador has
extended to the ROC in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Chen told his Salvadoran guest that the ROC and El Salvador share
the same spirit of potential and unlimited opportunity under adverse
circumstances with limited resources. It is called in Taiwan "the
spirit of the sons of Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also praised the courage and tenacity demonstrated by the El
Salvadoran people in braving adversity, particularly in
reconstructing the nation in the aftermath of two devastating
earthquakes that hit El Salvador over the past years.</P>
      <P>El Salvador was not knocked down by the earthquakes but stood
firm and was back to normal in the shortest period possible after the
disasters, Chen noted, adding that it represents the spirit of not
abandoning the opportunity of success, which is similar to "the

      <P>In a ceremony held prior to the meeting, Chen conferred the order
of Brilliant Star with Special Cordon on El Salvadoran first lady

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL), Taiwan's largest air
carrier, reiterated Friday that its decision to purchase engines for
its 18 newly ordered aircraft from General Electric (GE) was purely
based on commercial considerations.</P>
      <P>CAL was responding to a protest by the European Union aimed at
CAL for its failure to purchase engines from Rolls Royce of Britain,
an E.U. member state.</P>
      <P>CAL said it had conducted comprehensive evaluations and extensive
discussions with the three competitors -- GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and
Rolls Royce -- before coming to a final conclusion earlier this
month.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the terms offered by GE serve our best
interests," a CAL spokesman said. "All three competitors were given a
fair opportunity in the negotiation process."</P>
      <P>The spokesman stressed that the company has never discriminated
against E.U. products. For instance, the airline said it decided to
purchase 12 A330-300 jetliners late last year from Airbus, which is
jointly invested by four E.U. nations, including Britain.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that CAL's latest decision to purchase GE engines
for the 12 A330-300 and six Boeing B747-400 jetliners was based on
terms of engine quality, price, follow-up maintenance support and
technology transfer.</P>
      <P>"GE excelled in all categories and provided other benefits,
including handling the last B747-200 all-cargo aircraft in our
fleet," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that although some CAL departments were in favor of the
engine offered by Rolls Royce to be installed on the A330-300s in
some assessments, they disagreed with maintenance terms offered by
Rolls Royce. "After negotiations, the British company still failed to
provide acceptable maintenance terms," he noted.</P>
      <P>The spokesman further said that although the U.S. company Pratt &amp;
Whitney also failed to secure the contract, it sent a letter to CAL
President Wei Hsing-hsiung earlier this week recognizing the fairness
in CAL's engine procurement negotiations.</P>
      <P>Delivery for the 12 A330-300s and six B747-400s that CAL ordered
in late 2002 will begin in 2004.</P>

received personal political donations from the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Vargas, who accompanied Pacheco on a visit to Taiwan, told a

none of it had ever been funnelled to any individuals.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu
encouraged Taiwan businessmen to invest in El Salvador Friday, citing
the country's good location and sound investment climate and the
planned American free trade agreement area.</P>
      <P>Lin made the call while giving a key-note speech at an investment
seminar presided over by Wang Chung-yu, chairman of the Chinese
International Economic Cooperation Association. Visiting El
Salvadoran President Francisco Guillermo Flores Perez and about 100
ranking government officials and business community representatives
from the two countries also took part.</P>
      <P>Praising El Salvador's diligent workforce and good location, Lin
said politics and infrastructure in that country are also sound. He
strongly recommended Taiwan companies to consider investing in El
Salvador -- one of Taiwan's staunchest diplomatic partners --
especially at a time when the proposed American free trade agreement
area is slated to be forged by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>El Salvadoran Economics Minister Miguel Ernesto Lacayo also
addressed the gathering, providing the attendees with the latest
trade information and investment incentives of El Salvador.</P>
      <P>According to Lacayo, his country highly welcomes foreign
investment in a wide range of sectors, except the small retail and
fishing and agricultural sectors, and has devised a set of incentives
to protect foreign business interests and boost exports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to El Salvador hit US$60.54 million, exceeding
that country's exports to Taiwan worth US$9.048 million.</P>
      <P>To help Taiwan businesses invest in Central and South American
countries maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan, the ROC
government also offers a string of subsidies and incentives for
Taiwan investors willing to operate in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>In addition to accords on investment protection and on temporary
clearance, Taiwan and El Salvador also are negotiating a free trade
agreement in the hope of further enhancing two-way trade and
commercial ties.</P>
      <P>Presidents, envoys and ranking government officials from Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, the
Dominican Republic and Belize were in Taipei to take part in the
Fourth Summit of the Heads of States and Governments of the ROC,

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian received visiting
Minister of the Presidency of the Dominican Republic Sergio Grullon
Friday at the Presidential Office, reaffirming the Republic of
China's friendship and cooperation with its Caribbean ally.</P>
      <P>Chen first extended a warm welcome to Grullon and thanked him for
participating in the just-concluded fourth summit of heads of states
and governments of the ROC, Central American nations and the
Dominican Republic and Belize in Taipei and asked that his message be
relayed to President Rafael Hipolito Mejia.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked the Caribbean nation for the support it has
extended to the ROC in the international arena, resisting tremendous
pressure imposed by Beijing. He expressed the hope that Santo Domingo
will continue to voice support for the ROC's bid to join the United
Nations in the upcoming U.N. General Assembly in September.</P>
      <P>Prior to the meeting, Grullon conferred the Golden Order of
Columbus with Gran Cruz on ROC first lady Wu Shu-chen on behalf of
the Dominican government in recognition of her contribution to the
promotion of social welfare and democracy.</P>
      <P>On receiving the medal, Wu said that it is not only her personal
honor but also represents the close relationship between the ROC and
the Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>She asked Grullon to convey her gratitude to President Mejia and
the Dominican people and expressed the hope that the Dominican first
lady will visit Taiwan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Grullon assured his host that his country will continue to
support the ROC's bid to join the United Nations and other
international organizations.</P>
      <P>He praised the ROC's progress in all aspects, particularly in the
economic field.</P>
      <P>Both he and President Mejia have witnessed the way that Taiwan
advanced from an agricultural economy to a hi-tech one, Grullon said,
noting that he had visited Taiwan twice, in 1979 and 1981, and that
President Mejia has visited Taiwan 24 times thus far.</P>
      <P>He invited President Chen to visit his country again for further
enhancing ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A majority of people believe that there is
no hurry to open direct transportation links with the mainland, the
mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing a survey conducted by National Cheng Chi University, the
MAC said more than 52 percent of the people interviewed said the
government should "take it easy" when it comes to opening direct
links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Those who said "the sooner, the better" accounted for only 28
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, nearly 30 percent of those polled believe the current
pace of opening exchanges with the mainland is "just as it should
be, " with 20 percent saying "too fast" and 20 percent saying "too
slow," the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 32 percent believe developing ties with
foreign countries is more important than developing ties with the
mainland. That figure is far more than those who believe the opposite
and those who said the two are equal in importance.</P>
      <P>In case ties with foreign countries strain the island's relations
with Beijing, 61 percent said the country should go ahead with
efforts to foster ties with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 75 percent of the people surveyed oppose
Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula for uniting with Taiwan,
and more and more people feel Beijing's hostility, with 71 percent,
or 6.4 percent higher than the last poll in May, believing that
Beijing is hostile towards Taiwan authorities, and 51 percent, or 6.3
percent higher than the last poll, believing that Beijing is hostile
toward the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted Aug. 5-8 by telephone among 1,149 adults

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS FOURTH IN BERI GLOBAL INVESTMENT CLIMATE SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan tied with Japan for fourth place in
a global investment climate survey released recently by the
U.S.-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) market
research firm.</P>
      <P>BERI has studies the investment climates and overall
competitiveness of the world's 50 major economies regularly. Its
latest survey report was released earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Switzerland boasts the best investment climate among the 50
economies studied, followed by Singapore and the Netherlands in that
order.</P>
      <P>Among Asian economies, Singapore ranks first in terms of its
investment climate, while Taiwan ties with Japan at second.</P>
      <P>According to the BERI report, Taiwan's investment climate belongs
in the top A category, meaning that Taiwan is a low-risk investment
destination.</P>
      <P>The report predicts that Taiwan will witness an evident economic
recovery next year and that the island's overall investment climate
score will rise to 73 points on a zero-to-100 scale from this year's
72 points.</P>
      <P>It also foresees further improvement in the island's investment
climate five years from now. By 2008, it forecasts, the island's
investment climate score will rise to 74 points, with its world
rating remaining fourth.</P>
      <P>BERI gauges a country's investment climates based on three major
indicators -- the business risk index, the political risk index and
the currency exchange rate risk. More specifically, BERI evaluates
business risks and profitability a multinational company faces while
investing in a specific country.</P>
      <P>In the business risk index, Taiwan receives a score of 71 points,
ranking fourth among the 50 economies studied. But its political risk
index is less than ideal, ranking 12th with a score of 62. In
contrast, Taiwan ranks third in the currency exchange rate risk, with
a score of 84.</P>
      <P>The BERI report also forecasts that Taiwan will make steady
improvements in all three investment climate indicators in the next
five years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL OBSTACLES PREVENT TAIWAN JOINING WTO'S GPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  Aug.  22 (CNA)
(By C. H. Lu and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's failure this year to become a
signatory of the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) due to mainland China's heavy-handed
political interference is regrettable since the issue is purely an
economic one, a high-ranking Republic of China trade official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade
of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the remarks while
participating in the GPA Committee meeting held in Geneva Friday.</P>
      <P>He said that despite the fact that Taiwan has demonstrated a
remarkable amount of flexibility, non-economic factors were still
used against the island in its quest to be a signatory of the GPA.</P>
      <P>Without a consensus being reached by the 28 members of the GPA
Committee, issues regarding Taiwan's GPA bid were not placed on the
meeting's agenda. The committee has been unable to accept Taiwan as a
GPA signatory because of Beijing's political intervention.</P>
      <P>The GPA is a plurilateral agreement under the WTO framework. Its
goals are to promote market access and transparency in the government
procurement sector. The agreement now has 28 signatories and most of
them are developed countries. Taiwan promised to join the GPA when it
became a WTO member in January last year.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that Taiwan already completed its bilateral
consultations on relevant issues with all GPA signatories in December
of last year and has expressed its hope of joining the grouping. He
said that non-economic interference prevented the island from making
any headway on the issue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang urged all GPA signatories to do all they can
to remove the political obstacles hindering Taiwan's GPA entry. He
admitted, however, that the current situation has left him
disappointed.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's tactic is usually to once oppose Taiwan using
its government agencies' names on the GPA government procurement
list.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has again failed to join the GPA this year, Huang
said that all the GPA signatories have affirmed the island's hard
work and determination to join the agreement. They also expressed the
hope that Taiwan will be able to become a GPA signatory soon.</P>
      <P>He also emphasized that although Beijing continues to play
political hardball with the GPA bid, Taiwan still feels that
government procurement is an economic issue that should have nothing
to do with politics.</P>

      <P>Also seized in the midnight raid on a surveillance-monitoring

    <HEADLINE>BOEING'S REFUSAL OF LU'S VISIT MEANS NO U.S. POLICY CHANGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 22  (CNA)
(By W.H.Kuo and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research fellow of the Heritage
Foundation said Friday that Boeing Co.'s recent refusal to allow
Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu to visit does not mean
that Washington wants to change its Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>John Tkacik, an expert in the fields of Taiwan, mainland China
and Asian trade as well as military strategy of the Washington-based
think tank, made the remarks in an interview conducted with the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>The researcher said that as far as he knew, the U.S. government
was rather disappointed over the aircraft manufacturer's refusal of
Lu's visit and that he himself considered that Boeing Co. was not
smart in dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>In her transit stops in the United States after a recent two-leg
Latin America visit to Panama and Paraguay, Lu originally planned to
visit Boeing Co.</P>
      <P>Considering the jobs creation and business opportunities,
Washington actually hoped that the vice president would be able to
visit Boeing Co., Tkacik said, adding that Douglas Paal, director of
the American Institute in Taiwan, had recently made efforts to
persuade China Airlines to purchase Boeing aircraft.</P>
      <P>He also said that from what he has learned, Boeing Co.'s refusal
of Lu's visit absolutely does not mean that the U.S. government wants
to change its Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>Talking about the competition between Boeing Co. and Airbus
Company in selling aircraft to Taiwan, Tkacik said that the European
consortium is very active in promoting its businesses on the island.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that despite the fact that Boeing Co. has paid
more attention to the mainland Chinese market, records show that the
company has profited more from its business with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Parris Chang, a legislator from ruling Democratic
Progress Party, who is currently attending a U.S.-Japan-Taiwan
trilateral dialogue seminar being held in the U.S. capital by the
foundation, echoed what the American scholar said, indicating that
actually, the U.S. government was very disappointed that Lu was not
allowed to visit Boeing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CALL TAIWAN, TAIWAN' CAMPAIGN WILL RECEIVE WORLD SUPPORT: EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The call to rectify the name of the nation
from the Republic of China to Taiwan is gaining momentum every year
and the whole world should support the cause, former President Lee
Teng-hui said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The former president, who will serve as a chief convener of a
large rally to call for support for the "call Taiwan, Taiwan"
movement in front of the Presidential Office Sept. 6, made the
remarks in a flag-presenting ceremony for the upcoming rally at the
Ambassador Hotel in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Slogans such as "our country is called Taiwan, " "call Taiwan,
Taiwan, " and "Taiwan wants to march into the United Nations" were
heard throughout the meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee, in addition to presenting flags to the groups and volunteers
who will take part in the Sept. 6 rally, also delivered a 10-minute
speech.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan people need to think about the significance
of rectifying the name of the nation: "We are an independent
sovereign state, but few countries recognize us because of
international convention. This is especially so with the relentless
pressure from mainland China...a lot of countries are unable to
develop normal relations with us and we cannot walk toward the
international community and receive the respect we are due, " the
former president said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the situation has "adverse effects on national
development, and to make our country turn from abnormal to normal,
and see Taiwan stand up in the world, the only feasible way is to
change the name of the nation, " which he said, in a nutshell, is
called " Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee said that President Chen Shui-bian has no way of saying these
things openly now, but as he himself is out of office, the words,
"the name of our nation is Taiwan," can be spoken.</P>
      <P>He said that the wish to rectify the name of the country could
have not been fulfilled mainly because in the past Taiwan was ruled
by alien regimes, including the Netherlands, Japan and the Republic
of China, which he said "had nothing to do with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He noted the "old forces" of society are still saying that they
want to fight to see which is the "real China," the Republic of China
or the People's Republic of China, although even late President
Chiang Ching-kuo said that he couldn't say that mainland China could
be recovered.</P>
      <P>"The old guards do not identify with Taiwan, and if they don't
identify with Taiwan's culture, how can the nation develop? " he
questioned.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan's struggle to be its own master began very
early, but it had also encountered enormous obstacles, adding that
resistance does not take place in a day, although the call for
rectifying the nation's name to Taiwan is gaining momentum.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the United States will support the movement,
so will Japan and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>The Alliance to Campaign for Rectifying the Name of Taiwan noted
that to promote the campaign, it first broached the idea in 2002,
setting that year as a campaign year, and this year as the action
year. Next year will be the harvest year, officials from the alliance
said.</P>
      <P>The alliance is calling for 100,000 dedicated Taiwanese to come
forward to take part in the rally, to tell President Chen and the
people of Taiwan that they want to return the original picture of
mother Taiwan, and that the nation will be an equal partner on the
world stage as Taiwan and become a true member of the international
community.</P>
      <P>Taking part in the meeting were Examination Yuan President Yao
Chia-wen, Taiwan Independence Alliance Chairman Haung Chao-tang and
its vice chairman Huang Er-hsiuan, Presidential Office advisers Huang
Tien-lin, Chuan Po-lin, Huang Hua, Chou Ping-te, and Yang Chin-hai,
legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chen Tang-shan
and Chou Chin-yu, as well as Lin Chih-chia, secretary-general of the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, which considers former president Lee as its
spiritual leader.</P>

      <P>A group of veterans and military
authorities in Kinmen visited a public tomb Saturday to salute with
flowers those who died in the "Battle of the Taiwan Strait, " which
began on Aug. 23, 1958.</P>
      <P>The battle played a significant role in the relations between
both sides of Taiwan Strait over the last 45 years.</P>
      <P>Communist Chinese troops began to shell Taiwan's outlying island
of Kinmen on Aug. 23, 1958. In the first 36 hours, the island was
battered by 94,000 artillery rounds. In the following 42 days, some
400,000 additional shells rained down on the island, which is only
131 square kilometers in area.</P>
      <P>Hostilities ceased on January 7, 1959.</P>
      <P>Leading more than 70 veterans who fought in the famous battle, Lu
Fang-yen, chairman of the Confederation of Veterans of the Aug. 23
Battle, noted that "there would have been no prosperous and peaceful
life in Taiwan without the victory in the Aug. 23 battle, " and
reminded the government to take good care of the veterans who fought
hard for their country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a large parade to commemorate the Aug. 23 battle was
held Friday in downtown Taipei, in which opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan, People First Party (PFP) Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung and some 10,000 people, mostly veterans, participated.</P>
      <P>Noting that it was because of the hard fight of those veterans in
the battle that successfully deterred the communist influence from
spreading to other parts of the world, the KMT and PFP lawmakers
present at the parade promised to push for a bill to take special
care of the veterans of the Aug. 23 battle.</P>

      <P>An official of the Taiwan Solidarity Union

said Saturday that their "pan-green camp" should garner at least 55
percent of the votes to win the presidential election next year.</P>

      <P>"Those who love Taiwan should unite to work for a bright future

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS TO TREASURE ETHNIC, CULTURAL DIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
diverse ethnic cultures are Taiwan's most precious asset which forms
Taiwan's uniqueness in the world community.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a speech delivered at the graduation
ceremony for an indigenous people research class at the Ketagelan
Academy -- an institute founded by President Chen to nurture a new
generation of politically adept professionals.</P>
      <P>While pursuing globalization, Chen said, Taiwan must have its
unparalleled ethnic cultural assets fully developed to enhance its
competitiveness and preserve its uniqueness.</P>
      <P>Chen said the previous Kuomintang administration's policy of
forcing indigenous people to give up their ethnic cultures and
languages and to Sinicize their names was wrong.</P>
      <P>Such a biased policy has made aboriginal people become bogged
down in a political, economic, social and cultural quagmire, Chen
said, adding that the situation should be reviewed and corrected.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Ketagelan aboriginal affairs research class focuses
on discovering indigenous people's vigor, vitality and perseverance.
Over the years, he said, the local aboriginal rights movement has
offered valuable inspiration for the government to improve its policy
in dealing with aboriginal affairs.</P>
      <P>Since taking power, Chen said, his administration has made
strenuous efforts to forge new partnerships with all of the island's
11 aboriginal tribes.</P>
      <P>Chen especially read out the name of each aboriginal group in his
address. He said he hopes all local people can memorize the names of
the island's 11 aboriginal tribes because it symbolizes respect for
them.</P>
      <P>The first Ketagelan indigenous people research class had 32
graduates, including Chen Yi-hsin, a retired professional baseball
pitcher. They all donned their traditional tribal costumes. President
Chen also wore an aboriginal costume and sang a popular song, "We Are
Family," with all new graduates.</P>

      <P>Supporters of President Chen Shui-bian and
former President Lee Teng-hui issued a joint declaration Saturday
pledging their unified support for Chen's re-election bid.</P>
      <P>Huang Kun-hu, president of the national federation of groups

      <P>Huang also announced his determination to resign from his post on
the Central Election Commission (CEC) to campaign for Chen's
re-election.</P>
      <P>"As a CEC member, I must maintain neutrality and refrain from
campaigning for a specific candidate. As Chen's re-election is
critical to consolidate Taiwan's young democracy, I'm determined to
quit the CEC and dedicate myself to stumping for Chen, " Huang told
the press after a joint meeting of senior executives of groups from

      <P>Huang said although groups supporting Lee and Chen partially
overlap, their formal integration will generate an even greater force
in boosting Chen's victory in the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Addressing the joint meeting, Huang said Taiwan still faces
serious national identification problems because pro-unification
forces refuse to recognize Taiwan's separate identity and want to
push for unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Huang said Chen must win next year's election to deepen Taiwan's

      <P>Coast Guard Administration officials raided
an illegal drug packaging plant in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, late
Friday night, seizing 2.2 kg of heroin and amphetamines and arrested
three suspects.</P>
      <P>The officials were tipped off recently that a drug smuggling ring
in southern Taiwan had used grinding machines to reduce heroin blocks
and amphetamines, and then mixed them with unknown white powder and
reprocessed and repackaging them in air-tight tinfoil pouches to sell
to customers.</P>
      <P>After months of monitoring activities, the coast guard found a
man surnamed Yeh was the owner of the reprocessing plant, who always
hung around Fengshan, Kaohsiung County, peddling drugs. The
reprocessing plant was established in a building in a residential
area in Chiencheng district in Kaoshiung City.</P>
      <P>The coast guard found Yeh was carrying with him several small
bags of drugs when he went out of his home in Chiencheng district.
The coast guard then searched his home and found the whole room set
up like a repacking plant.</P>
      <P>The coast guard found a large pile of air-tight bags and ground
materials, as well as three blocks of unprocessed heroin and some
amphetamines worth a market value of NT$20 million (US$579,710) in
Yeh's home.</P>
      <P>Yeh and two other accomplices surnamed Huang and Jao were

      <P>The coast guard noted that the suspects had adopted the rare
approach of using air-tight bags to evade detection. The drug ring
had established its own trade mark and enjoyed some reputation in
southern Taiwan, they added.</P>
      <P>From the scale of the repackaging plant, the ring must have been

      <P>A Taiwan scholar said Friday in a
seminar on U.S.-Japan-Taiwan security that the direct expression of
ideas by Taiwan people in a referendum plays a very important role in
the process of the island's democratization.</P>
      <P>Lai Yi-chung, director of the Department of International Affairs
under Taiwan Thinktank, made the remarks in the third round of the
trilateral dialogue with the main topic focusing on the
anti-terrorist strategies of Asian countries and other nations.</P>
      <P>Lai noted in the trilateral meeting currently held in Washington
that Taiwan's democratic development can serve as an inspiration for
other Pacific nations and mainland China.</P>
      <P>With mainland China's growing military threat against Taiwan, the
security promise from the United States to Taiwan would guarantee the
continued democratic development on the island. Meanwhile, the
expression of Taiwan people's thinking is of the same importance, Lai
added.</P>

democracy and liberty in Taiwan is in great interest of the United

discussions with the island on issues such as anti-submarine,
anti-missile and anti-terrorist strategies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO GIVE PRIORITY TO NORMALIZATION OF CROSS-STRAIT ECONOMIC TIES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The "pan-blue" alliance of the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) will give priority to the
normalization of economic and trade relations between Taiwan and
mainland China, if it wins the 2004 presidential election, a
high-ranking KMT official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT Central
Policy Committee and director general of the KMT Mainland Affairs
Department, said the controversial issue of "one China" will be set
aside, if the pan-blue alliance wins the election.</P>
      <P>He said he does not think cross-strait relations will become a
hot top of debate during the election campaign, because what most
people are worried about are social and economic problems rather
than cross-strait relations.

      <P>A group of activists who want to change the
country's official name to "Taiwan" will call on President Chen
Shui-bian Monday to seek stronger support for their cause from Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Wang Chen-chung, one of the organizers of the "Calling Taiwan
Taiwan" movement said that many DPP members who support the movement
have urged the party to endorse the cause officially.</P>
      <P>The DPP decided in March to initiate a signature-collecting
campaign for renaming the country, but the decision was put on hold
because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak
which ravaged the island from March to July and because of the
by-election for magistrate in Hualien in August.</P>
      <P>Noting that the party's support for the campaign to rename the
country has been a vital indicator of the DPP's loyalty to the cause
for which it was founded, Wang said he hopes the party will support
his campaign more aggressively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU WON'T GET INVOLVED IN PRESIDENT CHEN'S REELECTION BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , a
political party that groups political followers of former President
Lee Teng-hui, will not get involved in President Chen Shui-bian's
reelection bid, a TSU official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming said that instead, a group of Lee's followers
called the Clubs of Lee's Friends will help Chen with his reelection
bid. These clubs are made up of the same TSU supporters, with TSU
lawmakers as their heads in different election districts.</P>
      <P>The strategy is meant to remind the public that the TSU is a
political group separate from Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , although the two parties share similar political views
and are competing to win the support of voters who favor Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>If the results of the 2002 city councilor elections in Taipei and
Kaoshiung and the Hualien magistrate by-election this August are any
indication, then President Chen's support among those who favor
independence seems to be subsiding, which doesn't bode well for his
reelection bid, the TSU official said.</P>
      <P>Lee will play an important role in this regard by using his
influence to galvanize the support of these voters behind President
Chen, the TSU official said.</P>
      <P>In light of the TSU's failure in the 2002 councilor elections in
which it did not win a single seat in Taipei and only won two seats
in Kaohsiung, the TSU official said, his party had decided to
maintain its own identity by standing apart from the DPP.</P>
      <P>As a political party, the TSU is competing against the DPP for
votes, and it would be inappropriate for the TSU to officially
support a DPP candidate in the presidential election even if it
itself does not field any candidates in the race, Chen said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's financial industry will become
internationally competitive if it deepens its reform and
globalization, Minister of Finance Lin Chuan said in New York
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while giving a key-note speech on Taiwan's
financial reform at an academic meeting sponsored by an association
of American Chinese on the U.S. East Coast.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is optimistic about Taiwan's financial reform and the
industry's globalization now that the Legislative Yuan has approved
six major economic and financial bills that clear the way for the
sector to sharpen its competitiveness and to go international.</P>
      <P>According to the finance minister, promoting the financial
service industry should be used as a means of countering Taiwan's
rising unemployment at a time when the manufacturing sector is no

      <P>A mother stunned social workers in
Kaohsiung city, southern Taiwan, recently by telling them that she
had had sex with her two mentally-challenged sons to prevent them
from possibly attacking others.</P>
      <P>The mother, in her fifties, told psychiatrists at the Kaohsiung
Municipal Kaihsuan Hospital that she raises the two sons by herself,
although she herself receives financial aid from the government.</P>
      <P>She said that after the two sons entered their teenaged years,
their emotional states started becoming unstable. Four years ago when
her eldest son was 16, she had sex with him for the first time out of
fear that his unsatisfied sexual desires could drive him to attack
others.</P>
      <P>Then, her second son requested to have sex with his mother after
seeing what happened between her and his older brother.</P>
      <P>The woman sought the psychiatrist's help after her second son
began to injure himself because his mother started turning down his
requests for sex. The son would hit his head against the wall or beat
his mother.</P>
      <P>The son was later admitted to Kaihsuan Hospital for psychiatric

    <HEADLINE>LEADING INTERNATIONAL HIGH-TECH FIRMS SET UP R&amp;D CENTERS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  24 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Adequate technical backup and qualified
technology manpower have become Taiwan's advantages in attracting
international technology firms to set up research and development
centers on the island, an official from the Technology Transfer
Service Center under the Economic Affairs Ministry said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ger Jy-gang, deputy director of the center, said that in addition
to the 38 R&amp;D centers affiliated with local enterprises, including
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. and United Microelectronics
Corp., many international manufacturers of computer hardware and
software have set up R&amp;D centers in Taiwan over the past two years.</P>
      <P>The economics official said that while Taiwan's electronics firms
have gained a strong foothold in the international market as
reputable original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the government has
sought to advance the island's industrial structure by attracting
more international corporations to set up R&amp;D centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>So far, international computer manufacturers, including
Hewlett-Packard, Dell, and IBM, as well as chips and software
developer and manufacturer Intel, software giant Microsoft, and
Becker Avionics, a developer of sophisticated navigation systems,
have employed Taiwan's technology resources to advance their R&amp;D.</P>
      <P>Ger said that he believes that more international corporations
will use Taiwan as an R&amp;D base when the government's regulations and
incentive measures become more flexible.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Ferng-ching, president of the Institute for
Information Industry, Taiwan is playing an important role in the
information industry's manufacturing and R&amp;D.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Lin said, the information industry has become
ever more predominant in Taiwan's industrial structure. In 1997, the
production value of the information industry accounted for 16.3
percent of the island's gross national product (GNP) . By 2002, the
ratio had risen to 30.3 percent. It is estimated that the production
value of the information industry will represent 33 percent of
Taiwan's GNP this year.</P>
      <P>Stressing the contributions made by many hardware and software
companies, Lin said that companies such as the anti-virus software
developer Trend Micro Inc. have helped cultivate many science and
technology workers and advance Taiwan's high-tech standards.</P>
      <P>An official from the Council for Economic Planning and
Development indicated that many international corporations have
chosen Taiwan as a base for their product development centers in view
of the well-cultivated high-tech personnel and good basic
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>He said that among the international corporations making Taiwan
their R&amp;D base, Hewlett-Packard has set up a product development
center; IBM, an R&amp;D center for computational biology as well as an
R&amp;D center for e-commerce; Sony, an information products R&amp;D center
and a large semiconductor (LSI) and module design and development
center; Dell, the Dell Taiwan Design Center; Becker Avionics, an R&amp;D
center for navigation systems certification technology; and the
semiconductor production equipment manufacturer Aixtron, the Aixtron
Manufacturing Oriented Research Lab.</P>
      <P>The official disclosed that Intel's chief executive officer,
Craig Barrett, who flew into Taipei Sunday, is expected to make an
announcement Monday regarding the company's plan to set up an R&amp;D
center in Taiwan. On Tuesday, Phoenix Technologies Inc., a Canadian
manufacturer of optical motion sensing devices for animation, will
also announce its plan to move its R&amp;D facilities to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is planning to launch an endorsement campaign calling for a
halving of the number of seats in the Legislature as a means of
garnering greater public support ahead of the presidential election
next March.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Chen Chi-mai said the campaign, aimed at
collecting 800,000 signatures, will be held across Taiwan in line
with a "Call Taiwan Taiwan" rally slated for Sept. 6 in Taipei, as
well as the DPP's Sept. 28 founding anniversary celebration in
central Taichung, and an Oct. 18 parade in southern Kaohsiung
organized by DPP Legislator Trong Chai to appeal for the people's
right to referendum.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the endorsement campaign will help the DPP
display its political philosophy and add momentum to President Chen
Shui-bian's reelection bid.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Lai Ching-teh said the aim of the campaign --
downsizing the Legislature -- and the call for referendums in Taiwan
have long been topics high on the DPP's agenda. The series of
activities projected by the DPP will not only help win increased
public backing but will also set a course for Taiwan's future

(By James Kuo &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars emphasized Taiwan's strategic
importance during the last day of a three-day symposium in the U.S.
capital Sunday.</P>
      <P>If mainland China were to annex Taiwan by force, Beijing would
control the sea lanes through the western Pacific and the South China
Sea, challenge U.S. predominance in the Pacific, and threaten the
strategic interests of the United States and Japan, said Hisahiko
Okazaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Thailand.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the symposium co-organized by the Heritage
Foundation in Washington, D.C., the Okazaki National Research
Institute in Okazaki, Japan, and the Taipei-based Taiwan Think Tank,
Okazaki warned that the whole of Southeast Asia would fall under
mainland China's sphere of influence if Beijing were to gain control
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He and some other Japanese scholars at the symposium were of the
opinion that the United States and Japan should step up their
security cooperation with Taiwan, and share their strategic
intelligence and missile defense technology with Taiwan to help the
island stand up against Beijing's military threat.</P>
      <P>However, June Dreyer, a political science professor at the
University of Miami, dismissed as out of the question any joint
military exercises among the three countries because of the Japanese
Constitution which renounces war as a means of resolving conflict
with other countries.</P>
      <P>Tokyo is smart in trying to get rid of the anti-war provision in
its constitution in a step-by-step manner, Dreyer said, but before
this is accomplished, any discussion about joint military exercises
or defense cooperation with Taiwan and the United States would be
unwise, she added.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Lai Yi-chao, a scholar from the Taiwan Think Tank,
said the symposium has helped Taiwan to realize its strategic status
in the Pacific and Asian regions and to learn what Tokyo and
Washington expect from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The symposium is designed to be an unofficial channel of dialogue
among Washington, Taipei and Tokyo. The just-concluded symposium was
the third of its kinds under a two-year program which envisions the
holding of four such symposiums. The fourth and last symposium under
the program is slated to be hosted by Taipei early next year.</P>

signature-collecting campaign to express the people's discontent with
the administration's high tuition policy for higher education and the
hike in premiums and self-payment fees under the National Health

      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT Central Policy Committee,
said that the alliance will formally announce the campaign starting
Tuesday in a press conference, adding that it hopes to collect more
than one million signatures from across Taiwan by Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>The alliance will urge the KMT's and PFP's lawmakers, local
government heads and party officials to organize activities at places
where people frequently gather in order to collect the signatures,
Tseng said. The signatures will be delivered to the Presidential

      <P>The campaign is also set to feature the KMT and PFP concerns

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO DECIDE WHETHER TO IMPOSE FURTHER WATER RESTRICTIONS SEPT. 4</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
called an emergency "drought-fighting" meeting Monday to review the
water supply situation in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director of the MOEA's Water Resources Agency,
said after the meeting that relevant government agencies will meet
again Sept. 4 to discuss the timing for beginning the second phase of
water restrictions in the Taipei-Taoyuan region.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although there have been afternoon thundershowers
in northern Taiwan in recent days, rainfall in the Feitsui Reservoir
and Shihmen Reservoir areas remains limited.</P>
      <P>If the current trends continue, Chen said, Shihmen's water level
is expected to fall to 210 meters by around Sept. 5, while Feitsui's
water level could drop to 130 meters by around Sept. 10.</P>
      <P>According to current regulations, the second phase of water
restrictions should be imposed in Taoyuan when the water level at
Shihmen Reservoir drops to 210 meters and in the greater Taipei
area when the water level at Feitsui Reservoir falls to 130 meters.
Feitsui's water level stood at 136.29 meters as of noon Monday.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, the MOEA will call a
"drought-fighting" meeting again Sept. 4 to decide whether to impose
the second phase of water restrictions in the Taipei and Taoyuan
areas. Measures to be adopted during the second phase of water
restrictions include cuts in water supply to large users, such as car
washes, saunas and swimming pools.</P>
      <P>The MOEA began implemented the first phase of water restrictions
in the Taipei-Taoyuan area in May, with water pressure being lowered
at night to restrict water flow and save water resources.</P>
      <P>Thanks to afternoon showers in the Keelung River area in recent
days, Chen said, the Hsinshan Reservoir's water level has risen.
Therefore, he said, the implementation of the third phase of water
restrictions in the Keelung area will be postponed to mid-September.</P>
      <P>If the reservoir receives more rainfall in the coming weeks, he
added, the third phase of restrictions may not be implemented at all.
The northern Taiwan port city began to implement the second phase of
water restrictions earlier this month.</P>

      <P>Vincent Siew, one of Taiwan's well-known

Taiwan into an important center for raising capital.</P>
      <P>Siew, chairman of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research

made the remarks at a symposium on economy, finance and accounting
sponsored by the Taiwan Hakka Forum.</P>
      <P>He said that because of Asian economic integration, the
government wants to develop Taiwan into an important business
operations center in Asia. To do so, Taiwan should first develop
itself into an important center for raising capital. The first step
to this goal is to allow Taiwan investors in mainland China to list
their stocks on Taiwan's stock exchange.</P>
      <P>Siew said that this is his own opinion, and that the president's
economic advisory group has not suggested that the president adopt
the idea because other members of the group believe that there could
be some undesirable side-effects of the plan.</P>
      <P>He said the plan does have some drawbacks, but they can be

    <HEADLINE>ASSOCIATION OF ENGLISH-SPEAKING TAXI DRIVERS FORMED IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of taxi drivers who have passed the
Taipei City Government's English proficiency test formed an
association Monday to develop a special channel for foreign
passengers to get access to their services.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hsien-chou, a founding member, said the association will
also help upgrade Taiwan's national image and increase its members'
revenues.</P>
      <P>Since the city government implemented a taxi drivers' English
proficiency certification program two years ago, 711 taxi drivers
have passed the test and thus obtained the right to display a yellow
sticker reading, "Yes, I speak English" in their car windows.</P>
      <P>However, the small sticker has so far not helped bring more
business to English-speaking taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>"The number of foreign clients has not increased and those who
need English taxi services still have no way to contact us, " Chiang
said, adding that he and his friends have therefore decided to form
an association to pool their wisdom and strength to improve the
business prospects for English-speaking taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>Chiang said several radio taxi groups have agreed to cooperate
with his new association to increase access to foreign customers. The
association will also study the feasibility of setting up special taxi
stops at public places or hotels where foreign visitors converge, he
added.</P>
      <P>In a congratulatory speech delivered at the association's
inaugural ceremony, Lin Chih-ying, director of the Bureau of
Transportation under the Taipei City Government, said the municipal
bureau will consult with the National Palace Museum to set up a
special taxi stop in its complex for English- or Japanese-speaking
taxi drivers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lin said, the city government is considering adopting a
classification system to grade taxi cabs in terms of car condition,
driver's manners, service and price. "Foreign language proficiency
may also be included in the evaluation," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO LAUNCH SEARCH FOR RUNAWAY FOREIGN LABORERS STARTING SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An intensive campaign to search for runaway
foreign laborers will begin Sept. 1 around the island, government
sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the National Police
Administration will join forces with city and county governments in
search of runaway foreign workers, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CLA tallies, Taiwan has legally imported
some 300,000 foreign laborers and more than 10,000 have fled their
jobs and remain unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>A Taipei County Government spokesman said the county had
41,000-plus foreign workers by the end of June this year and 388 of
them had fled from their legal employers between April and June.
Among the runaways, 303 were women workers and 85 were males. Most of
the runaways were house maids or caregivers, the spokesman said,
adding that the runaway rate was highest among Vietnamese citizens,
followed by Indonesians.</P>
      <P>The spokesman urged county residents to report to relevant
authorities whenever they discover a runaway foreign laborer. "Local
employers should also refrain from hiring runaway foreign workers.
Otherwise, they will be fined at least NT$150,000," he warned.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"Small nations united can become giants, "
President Chen Shui-bian told his Guatemala counterpart Alfonso
Portillo Monday before the two signed a joint communique at the end
of Portillo's five-day Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>Echoing a statement made by Portillo that minor states have to
unite to make their presence felt, Chen said joining forces can turn
small countries into giants.</P>
      <P>Praising Portillo as a charismatic orator, Chen said the
Guatemalan president has fascinated the host country's 23 million
people with his grace. If Portillo would speak out for the Republic
of China at the United Nations, it would certainly be a great boost
for the ROC's bid to return to the international organization, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In the joint communique, both Chen and Portillo gave a pat on the
back to each other by admiring the other's contributions to their
countries, and pledged to continue their cooperation and friendship.</P>
      <P>On the part of the ROC, Chen promised to keep encouraging Taiwan
businessmen to invest in Guatemala to create more jobs for that
country, and upgrade the living standard of its people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Portillo reconfirmed his country's support for the
ROC's right to join the international groups, not least its bids for
access to the United Nations and the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>They reiterated their countries' pursuit of democracy and
freedom, their determination to safeguard world peace and human
development, and their believe that any regional conflicts should be
solved peacefully through dialogue, and their support for the
international community's efforts to wipe out terrorism.</P>
      <P>Portillo arrived in Taiwan last Wednesday for a biennial summit
on Thursday with leaders of the ROC and Central American states. He
is slated to leave Taiwan late Monday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Graig Barrett, the chief executive officer
of Intel, announced in Taipei Monday that the company will set up a
research and development center in Taiwan, the first for the company
in Asia.</P>
      <P>Barrett said that if Taiwan wants sustainable development, it has
to develop high value-added industries. For this reason, Taiwan
cannot rely on manufacturing industry alone, it also has to step up
its research and development and education.</P>
      <P>In other words, education is very important and it will affect
the quality of life, Barrett said.</P>
      <P>He said that R&amp;D hopes to turn abstract creativity into
substantial products, and this is the reason why Intel has promoted
the cooperation between colleges and businesses, hoping to develop
good products through basic research.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan has high quality education, talented
people and a good industrial environment, and its achievements in the
manufacturing and design of its high-technology industry is
outstanding.</P>
      <P>He noted that the computer industry couldn't find good design
people in Taiwan five years ago, but now it can, showing that Taiwan
is now entering a transformation period.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the division of work on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, he noted that mainland China is the world's powerhouse for
the manufacturing industry, while Taiwan's industry, making good use
of the cheap cost in the mainland, has transformed itself to gain a
niche in areas of innovation and design.</P>
      <P>Barrett arrived in Taiwan Sunday and is scheduled to leave Monday

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will
exercise prudence in dealing with abortion issues, a senior official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Chen Chien-jen made the remarks after an alliance
formed by several religious and social welfare groups spoke against
the government's plan to revise the current health law to allow
married adult women to abort their pregnancies without their
husbands' consent.</P>
      <P>Under the current eugenics law, a married woman must consult with
her husband and obtain his consent before abortion. Media reports
said the Cabinet will draft an amendment to the current law allowing
married adult women to decide on their own whether to abort.</P>
      <P>Chen said respecting life is the DOH's ultimate health management
goal. "We'll handle abortion issues with prudence," he said, without
elaborating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local women's rights groups threw their support behind
the Cabinet's proposal to exempt married adult women from obtaining
their husbands' consent before abortion.</P>
      <P>"The exemption doesn't mean that married women need not consult
with their husbands before abortion. The proposed amendment would

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education is considering
providing scholarships to foreign students to encourage them to study
in Taiwan, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to a plan introduced by the Ministry of Education in an
inter-ministerial meeting on education reform, the officials said
that at least one department, one graduate school and one course of
every college must be taught in English to encourage foreign students
to study in Taiwan,</P>
      <P>The meeting was presided over by Premier Yu Shyi-kun. Officials
from the ministries of education and foreign affairs, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, as well as minister
without portfolio Chen Chi-nan also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>In such areas such as languages, electronics, electrical
engineering and biomedicine, where Taiwan colleges enjoy a
international competitive edge, they should at least increase 15
percent of their numbers of foreign students every year.</P>
      <P>There are around 300 or 400 foreign students who have officially
registered to study in Taiwan, and the ministry is hoping that the
figure could rise to 3,000 by 2008, while students in language
centers could increase 1,000 a year, and that the number will be
increased from the present more than 6,000 to 12,000.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun touted the country's
favorable investment environment and his administration's many
measures taken to advance industry and business on Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference called by Intel to announce its
plan to set up a research center in Taiwan, the premier said Taiwan
ranks fourth in the world and second in Asia in terms of its
favorable environment for investment, citing an annual survey
compiled by the Business Environment Risk Intelligence in Switzerland.</P>
      <P>He said his administration deserves a significant share of the
credit, because of the tax incentives it has offered to investors,
the easy investment procedures which can be accomplished in one step
and its plan to increase the country's research and development
expenditure from 2.16 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2004
to 3 percent GDP in 2008.</P>
      <P>The government is also planning to attract multinational companies
to set up 30 research and development centers in Taiwan within five
years, to make Taiwan one of their foreign partners, Yu went on.</P>
      <P>There are 42 domestic businesses which have research and
development centers in Taiwan with a combined investment of more than
NT$100 billion (US$2.94 billion), Yu said.</P>
      <P>The premier didn't forget to mention the government's much-hyped
five-year plan of spending NT$500 billion (US$14.74 billion) on
public projects in an attempt to bolster the economy, and a program
to develop mobile communications to create its own industry with an
annual output of more than NT$1 trillion (US$29.41 billion) after the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD DEVELOP VALUE-ADDED, KNOWLEDGE-BASED INDUSTRY: VICE PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 25 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should develop high value-added and
knowledge-based industries at a faster pace, Vice Prime Minister Lin
Hsin-i said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the Cabinet's annual
conference on strategies for developing industrial technologies, Lin
said that Taiwan should focus on transforming and upgrading domestic
industries into those that are high value-added and knowledge-based.
This should be done by reaping the benefits of the manufacturing
sector, which has a solid foundation, much experience, a good
business environment and talented people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has already bottomed out, given various
indicators, Lin said. Moreover, the economy is expected to recover at
a faster pace in the second half of this year, the vice premier, who
doubles as chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), predicted.</P>
      <P>The overseas relocation of low-end manufacturing industries,
which are entering into a micro-profit era, is a global trend and is
unavoidable for Taiwan, Lin stressed.</P>
      <P>The output of Taiwan's knowledge-based service industry accounts
only for 34 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) ,
far less than the 48 percent registered in Japan, 48 percent in the
United States and 53 percent in Germany, Taiwan's economic tsar
noted.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing and electronic product composition industries
that led Taiwan to the world economic stage in the past have been
gradually replaced by those of mainland China and Southeast Asian
nations given that they are relatively less skillful and easy to be
imitated, he went on, adding that the average gross profit they can
earn now is less than 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The semiconductor industry, which is a knowledge-based
manufacturing industry, can earn an average gross profit of more than
40 percent, while the semiconductor designing and knowledge-based
service industries can make a gross profit of more than 50 percent,
even more than 100 percent, he continued.</P>
      <P>Lin encouraged domestic industries to be prepared, to seize the
opportunity when it comes for making use of their professional
knowledge and talents and to face global competition with results of
research and development programs they have invested in, including
trained, skillful manpower and intellectual properties they have
created.</P>
      <P>Some 500 representatives from government agencies, industrial and
academic sectors and foreign experts are participating in the
five-day meeting, which is mainly discussing strategies on the
development of medical services and the health care industry, the
development of strategic services industry and its supporting
environment, and strategies on rooting defense technology in the
private sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ENTRY INTO WHO WILL HELP GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST SARS: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Taiwan can enter the World Health
Organization, it will definitely help the world fight severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), Vice President Annette Lu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she met Rosa Lopez Garnica, chairwoman
of the health committee of the Senate, and Maria Isabel San
Baldomero, chairwoman of joint committees on women's rights of the
Senate and Congress from Spain.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that as the world turned its focus on the U.S.-led
attacks against Iraq in March, Taiwan was being hard hit over the
following two months by the potential deadly respiratory disease
which claimed 84 lives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Taiwan experienced "panic and helplessness" in
dealing with the unexpected foe, not knowing where the virus came
from. "Such an experience will be hard for those who have never
experienced it to understand," she said.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that SARS could resurface in the winter, and if Taiwan
is admitted into the WHO, she believes that Taiwan can contribute a
great deal to the global fight against the potentially deadly
disease.</P>
      <P>On issues concerning women's rights, Lu, who herself is a women's
right campaigner, said that great strides have been made since she
first campaigned for gender equality in 1971.</P>
      <P>Lu cited herself as an example, saying that she is the first
woman vice president through popular election in Taiwan. She also
said that nearly one quarter of the Cabinet, and 22 percent of the
lawmakers are women and that women also shine brilliantly in every
walk of life in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lopez said that her visit was mainly to understand how Taiwan
dealt with SARS. As SARS is not confined to one place, and no one can
escape it, she supports Taiwan's bid to join the WHO, especially
because it is unjust to exclude Taiwan when the island performs well
in every area.</P>
      <P>San Baldomero also spoke on issues concerning domestic violence,
the working rights of women and women's health with the vice
president.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked its
representative office in Tokyo Monday to file a protest with the
Japanese government over the landing on the Tiaoyutai Islands, known
as the Senkaku Islands to the Japanese, by a group of Japanese right
wing extremists.</P>
      <P>Calling Tiaoyutai a inalienable part of the country's territory,
the ministry said the group of Japanese extremists have infringed on
the country's territory, and the Japanese authorities should prevent
the incident from happening again.</P>
      <P>Nine Japanese, who come from a little-known group called Japan
Youth Federation, landed on the island Monday morning to repair a
beacon they erected there in 1996.</P>
      <P>The uninhabited islands, located some 102 nautical miles
northeast of Taiwan, is claimed by both mainland China, Japan and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The United States turned over the islands to Japan in 1971 to the
outrage of mainland China and Taiwan. They protested the U.S. move
but refrained from doing anything which might disrupt the ties
between them.</P>
      <P>Japanese patrol ships often sail around the islands to drive away
Taiwan and Hong Kong activists who try to land on the islands to
underline their countries' territorial claim to them.</P>
      <P>In a related story Monday, a councilor from Taipei County in
northern Taiwan, Kin Chie-shou, who made headlines in 1996 by trying
to raise an ROC flag on the islands, vowed to try again, probably in
conjunction with activists from mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN VOWS TO MAKE CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE TOP PRIORITY IF ELECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan,
reaffirmed Monday that if elected president next year, his party's
top priority will be to resume cross-strait dialogue and promote
direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks when he received a delegation from the
European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) who called on Lien at his
party's headquarters to learn about the KMT's trade and economic
policies.</P>
      <P>Lien said that there are already one million Taiwan businessmen
and their dependents in the mainland, with Taiwan's talented
individuals, capital and technology all flowing into the mainland and
the government must address the cross-strait trade and shipping
issues squarely.</P>
      <P>He noted that during the KMT administration, it had actively
promoted cross-strait dialogues as well as the establishment of
direct trade and shipping links, adding that the original plan was
direct cargo links first followed by personnel links, which he said
was "feasible" and would be beneficial to both sides.</P>
      <P>Lien spoke of the Asia and Pacific operations hub plan during the
late period of the KMT administration, adding that though the plan
made some adjustments due to the environment, the party still thinks
it is the best blueprint that can revive Taiwan's economy, and if the
KMT regains power, it will put it into practice after some revisions.</P>
      <P>He also questioned the government's approach in striving to
better the economy, saying that the ratio for private investment and
private consumption accounted for up to between 70 and 80 percent of
the gross domestic product, while the ratio for public spending was
relatively much less.</P>
      <P>He said that the best effective way to better the economy is to
revive private confidence so that the public is willing to invest and
spend, not the current approach by the government to raise the
ceiling of debts to finance its public spending.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the "Taiwan miracle" in the past did not come
from heaven, but was the result of strenuous efforts over the years.
He said he hoped that if the KMT is in power again, it will make
Taiwan prosper as it used to be.</P>
      <P>ECCT members said that globalization is an unstoppable trend, and
that every country has made it the top consideration when mapping out
economic policy, but Taiwan's process of globalization seems to be
only feet-dragging because of overemphasis on localization.</P>
      <P>Lien responded that the biggest problem facing Taiwan's economy
is that political factors take precedence over other considerations,
adding that this is the reason why many financial experts, including
those in his party and the KMT's ally, the People First Party, who
had broached substantial proposals, had fallen on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out the other obstacle to the island's economic
development comes from social problems, with the cleft between the
mainlanders and the local peoples who emigrated to the island before
them, as well as the controversy over the future status of the
nation.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with the widening gap between the rich and the
poor, have contributed to the split of Taiwan society, Lien said,
adding that national leaders should take on the responsibility to
unify the people at a time like this.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, the ECCT delegation invited Lien to speak to
its chamber members next month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL ENGINE DEAL WON'T AFFECT TAIWAN-BRITISH TIES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The row over China Airlines' (CAL's)
decision to procure engines from U.S.-based General Electric (GE) for
its aircraft will not affect substantive relations between Taiwan and
Britain, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chu Chien-sung, deputy director of the MOFA's European Affairs
Department, said the CAL engine deal is small in comparison to the
value of total annual trade between Britain and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that substantive Taipei-London ties are cordial in many
other fields, Chu said that the CAL deal was an isolated case and
that it would not have an impact on bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Chu was commenting on reports that the European Union has lodged
a protest aimed at CAL -- Taiwan's largest air carrier -- for its
failure to purchase engines from Rolls Royce of Britain, an E.U.
member state.</P>
      <P>Chu said CAL has offered explanations of the reasons behind its
decision to purchase engines from General Electric (GE) instead of
Rolls Royce for its 18 newly-ordered aircraft.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will also assist in communicating with British
authorities to secure their understanding of CAL's reasoning and to
minimize any possible backlash, Chu said.</P>
      <P>As to media reports that Britain may seek a settlement through
the World Trade Organization's trade dispute arbitration mechanism,
Chu said Britain must first have justifiable reasons to file such an
application. It is still too premature to forecast future
developments in this respect, he added.</P>
      <P>CAL said last week that its decision to purchase GE engines was
based purely on commercial considerations.</P>
      <P>"We had conducted comprehensive evaluations and extensive
discussions with the three competitors -- GE, Pratt &amp; Whitney and
Rolls Royce -- before coming to a final decision earlier this month,"
CAL said in a press statement released last Friday.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the terms offered by GE best serve our
interests, and all three competitors were given a fair opportunity in
the negotiation process," the statement stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a CAL spokesman said earlier that the company has
never discriminated against E.U. products. For instance, the airline
said it decided to purchase 12 A330-300 jetliners late last year from
Airbus, which is jointly invested in by four E.U. nations, including
Britain.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that CAL's latest decision to purchase GE engines
for the 12 A330-300 and six Boeing B747-400 jetliners was based on
engine quality, price, follow-up maintenance support and technology
transfer terms.</P>
      <P>"GE excelled in all categories and provided other benefits,
including handling the last B747-200 all-cargo aircraft in our
fleet," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He further said that although Pratt &amp; Whitney also failed to
secure the contract, it sent a letter to CAL President Wei
Hsing-hsiung last week recognizing the fairness of CAL's engine
procurement negotiations.</P>
      <P>Delivery for the 12 A330-300s and six B747-400s that CAL ordered
in late 2002 will begin in 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CONVINCED TAIWAN'S WISH TO JOIN WHO TO BE FULFILLED SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he is
convinced that the Republic of China's wish to enter the World Health
Organization (WHO) will soon be fulfilled after domestic efforts and
stronger support from the international community.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when receiving more than 30
members of a delegation comprised of overseas Chinese medical
professionals at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president noted that Taiwan spent 12 years working to be
admitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO), which it achieved in
January 1, 2002, but he said he is convinced that "so long as we
don't give up, it will take much less time to achieve its goal of
entering the WHO."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's attempts to join the WHO as an observer were foiled this
May at the World Health Assembly -- the top decision-making body of
the WHO -- for the seventh straight year.</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan faced an unprecedented challenge
after being hit by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) earlier
this year. He noted that the island was finally removed from the
WHO's list of SARS-affected areas July 5 thanks to people in Taiwan
and abroad who made a great contribution to combating the potentially
deadly respiratory disease. SARS claimed a total of 84 lives in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the most regrettable part for the Taiwan people in
combating SARS was the island's being shut out of the WHO due to
Beijing's obstruction, which he said made Taiwan's fight against the
disease harder than that of most other countries.</P>
      <P>The president said he is convinced that the issues of health and
communicable disease prevention are borderless, stressing that
political considerations should not be put before humanitarian causes
or respect for human life.</P>
      <P>Although noting that Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO suffered
another blow this year, the president said that compared with
previous years, Taiwan's cause won more sympathy and support. He also
noted that nine diplomatic allies, including Palau, Honduras, El
Salvador, Nicaragua, Gambia, Belize, the Dominican Republic, Senegal
and Panama, spoke in support of Taiwan's bid.</P>
      <P>He added that U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy
G. Thompson sent a letter to the WHO and later expressed strong</P>
      <P>support for Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as an observer in the
May conference.</P>
      <P>While welcoming the delegation of overseas Chinese medical
professionals, Chen expressed the hope that the members will learn
more about Taiwan's process in its battle against SARS during their
stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that the government had asked all health institutions to
map out standard procedure operations for dealing with communicable
diseases so as to be fully prepared in the event of a resurgence of
SARS this winter.</P>

      <P>Six mainland Chinese drowned and four
others are still missing at sea after a group of 22 mainlanders in
two speedboats tried entering Taiwan illegally early Tuesday, coast
guard officials said.</P>
      <P>The coast guard said that after they were tipped off the attempt,
they sent two cutters to the waters off Tunghsiao, Miaoli, at around
4a.m. to try to intercept the speedboats.</P>
      <P>The captains of the two speedboats, after spotting the
approaching coast guard cutters, forcefully pushed the mainland
Chinese women into the sea before speeding away. The coast guard
immediately started rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Among the 12 rescued, two were in serious condition when they
were pulled out of the sea. One was rushed to a hospital in Miaoli
County and the other to a hospital in Taichung County.</P>
      <P>When questioned, the rescued mainland women claimed they had been
tricked into boarding the speedboats, saying the smuggling ring
leaders told them that they could make a lot of money working in
Taiwan. They had no food or water for three days at sea.</P>
      <P>The smuggling fee was around NT$200,000 (US$5,882) for each
person, which they were to pay back with money made working in
Taiwan, the women said.</P>
      <P>The 10 rescued who were not seriously injured are Wu Qin, 24;
Huang Chunhong, 25; Hu Bingmei, 21; Zhang Shiying, 26; Wu jing, 21;
Jiang Hong, 20; Jiang Jinli, 22; Chen Yen, 28; Cheng Shu, 27; and Xi
Zhengzheng, 18.</P>
      <P>The coast guard has temporarily placed the six bodies of the
drowned mainlanders in a mortuary in Tachia, Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are continuing investigations to find out who was on
the two speed boats that carried the mainland Chinese.</P>

      <P>The military will conduct a combined
services live-fire combat training drill in Ilan County's coastal
Litze township Sept. 1, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)

      <P>The Han Kuang series of exercises is Taiwan's largest military
training drill of the year.</P>
      <P>Huang said the combined services drill was originally scheduled
for mid-May. "Due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
outbreak in Taiwan between March and June this year, the drill has
been rescheduled for Sept. 1," he explained.</P>
      <P>The upcoming drill will test the three service branches' combined
combat prowess in air, sea and amphibious operations, Huang said,
adding that the live-fire exercise will also verify the feasibility

      <P>The Ministry of Education (MOE) will
introduce 369 foreign English teachers into the school system next
year to upgrade the quality of English teaching in Taiwan, an
education official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Based on an annual salary of NT$996,000 for each of the 369
foreign teachers -- to come from the United Kingdom, the United
States, Australia and Canada -- the cost to the government will be
NT$367.83 million for the year.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Huang Jung-chun pointed out that the MOE's
international cultural and educational relations bureau will work
with representative offices of foreign governments in Taiwan on the
"country to country" principle in introducing the foreign teachers.</P>
      <P>Among the 369 teachers, a total of 97 will be assigned to the
counties of Chiayi, Kaohsiung and Taichung, while a total of 31 will
be sent to the counties of Taitung, Hualien, Kinmen and Lianjiang,
according to Huang.</P>
      <P>The English teachers will first take a one-month class in Taiwan
to learn more about the culture and education situation in order to
enable them to adapt more quickly to their new environment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Ming-ying, deputy director of the MOE's
Department of Elementary Education, stressed that introducing foreign
English teachers into the school system will not affect the

    <HEADLINE>NEW VERSION OF ROC PASSPORT TO BE ISSUED FROM SEPT. 1 AS SCHEDULED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The new version of the Republic of China
passport will be issued from Sept. 1 as scheduled despite claims by
mainland China's official media that some countries will refuse to
accept the new version of the passport, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih said that most countries have expressed their
intention to work with the new version of the passport which will
display the word "Taiwan" in addition to the official national
designation of "the Republic of China" on its cover.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the purpose of adding the word "Taiwan" is to help
customs officials of other countries better distinguish between
citizens from Taiwan and those from mainland China. He said the move
is meant to make customs clearance more convenient for Taiwan people
when they travel to other countries.</P>
      <P>He said that other than the addition of the word "Taiwan, " the
new version of the passport is completely the same as the current
version.</P>
      <P>He stressed that as an independent sovereign state, the ROC has
the right to issue passports.</P>
      <P>He also said that following communications with other countries
regarding the issue, major countries, including Japan, the United
States and the member states of the European Union, have expressed
their intention to work with the new version of the passport.</P>
      <P>He would not confirm reports by Beijing's Xinhua News Agency that
Afghanistan and Pakistan will refuse entry to carriers of the new
version of the ROC passport, nor would he speak on the government's
contingency plans in the event that the passport holders are refused
entry into those countries.</P>
      <P>He only said that the ministry "will continue to communicate with
certain countries, " and that the new version of the passport will be
issued as scheduled on Sept. 1.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIVIL DEFENSE DRILL TO BE HELD IN NORTHERN TAIWAN AUG. 29</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's "wan-an" civil defense drill
will be held in northern Taiwan Friday and in other parts of the
island in the second half of October, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said the "wan-an" series
of civil defense drills are aimed at testing city and county
governments' emergency response and disaster relief operations.</P>
      <P>This year's drill will be for the first time led by city and
county governments, with the military playing a supporting role,
Huang said, adding that mayors and magistrates are allowed to
organize the maneuvers in terms of their unique regional demands.</P>
      <P>A total of 11 cities and counties as well as 117 public agencies
and private groups will take part in the exercise, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"The series of drills will test local governments' vertical
command and horizontal coordination capabilities," Huang said, adding
that anti-terrorist operations will be included in the training
program.</P>
      <P>On Friday Aug. 29, the "wan-an" civil defense drills will be held
in Taipei city and county, Keelung City, Hsinchu city and county,
Taoyuan County and Ilan County.</P>
      <P>In metropolitan Taipei, the drill will focus on rescuing hostages
held by terrorists at the Shin Kong Building -- a skyscraper near the
Taiwan Railway Station in downtown Taipei and handling explosives
supposedly hidden there as well as a simulated poison gas attack on
the city's mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>In Ilan, the exercise will center on response to terrorist
attacks on an oil depot in Suao; drills in Keelung and Taoyuan will
feature response to sabotage to a major power generation plant and a
water purification facility.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a mock anti-terrorist operation at the Formosa
Plastics Group's petrochemical complex in Yunlin County's Mailiao
township on Taiwan's southwestern coast will be held Thursday
afternoon, Huang said, adding that local government officials and
industry executives will be invited to watch the exercise.</P>
      <P>Similar anti-terrorist, anti-sabotage and anti-abduction drills
at selected public places and facilities in central, southern and
eastern Taiwan as well as on the frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matsu will be conducted from mid-October through the end of the
month, Huang said.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign

traditionally part of the Republic of China's territory.</P>
      <P>Richard Shih, director-general of the MOFA's Department of

the landing on the Tiaoyutais by a group of Japanese right wing
extremists a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the MOFA instructed its representative office in
Tokyo to file a protest with the Japanese government over the
incident and asked the Japanese authorities to prevent a similar one
from happening again.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in Japan
then delivered a letter of protest Tuesday in Tokyo to the

stance on the Tiaoyutais and its concern over the landing on the
islets by nine members of the Japan Youth Federation, which it said
infringed on the ROC's territory.</P>
      <P>The Interchange Association of Japan represents Japanese

    <HEADLINE>PHOENIX SETS UP WORLD'S LARGEST CORE SYSTEM SOFTWARE CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American software firm Phoenix Technologies
Ltd. expanded its investment in Taiwan Tuesday by establishing the
world's largest core system software (CSS) research center in the
island aimed at training more Taiwanese in basic input and output
systems (BIOS).</P>
      <P>A cocktail party was held in Taipei to celebrate the
establishment of its CSS center in Taiwan, in which Phoenix Chairman
and CEO Albert E. Sisto, Republic of China Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i,
and director of the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan
Douglas H. Paal attended.</P>
      <P>Sisto noted that the company aims to make Taiwan the global base
for BIOS research and an R&amp;D center for the new generation of
personal computers.</P>
      <P>Explaining why the company chose Taiwan, Sisto pointed to the
earlier access to markets and to new technology information offered
on the island. He added that Phoenix's presence represents a win-win
strategy both for his company and for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Phoenix Taiwan general manager Jack Huang noted that
the company's decision to set up the CSS research center in Taiwan,
which has generous computer systems and abundant semiconductor
manufacturers, was due to the need to meet the needs of clients and
partners, as well as reducing the time for the introduction of a new
product onto the market.</P>
      <P>Phoenix's establishment of the CSS research center in Taiwan
represents its recognition of the information technology industry and
economic development prospects in Taiwan, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1979, Phoenix, the supplier of 80 percent of BIOS in
the world, helped launch the digital revolution when it created the
industry's leading machine-independent BIOS software, which ships in
more than 100 million new systems each year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE ALLIANCE' LAUNCHES SIGNATURE DRIVE AGAINST HIGH TUITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) kicked off a
signature campaign Tuesday aimed at stealing some of the thunder from
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP legislative caucuses called a joint news
conference where they announced the start of the signature campaign
against what they see as overly high university tuitions and double
hikes in national health insurance premiums and outpatient
self-payments.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who concurrently serves as chief
executive of the KMT's Central Policy Coordination Committee, said
the signature campaign is also designed to vent public discontent at
the rising unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>"We hope to collect at least one million signatures from all over
Taiwan within a week's time through promotions by 'pan-blue'
lawmakers, city and county government chiefs, councilors, township
chiefs, borough wardens and social group leaders," Tseng said.</P>
      <P>The campaign will close Sept. 4 and the results of the petition
drive will be presented to President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Yu
Shyi-kun to push them to "listen to the voice of grassroots people, "
Tseng explained.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, PFP legislative whip Chung Shao-ho
claimed that the DPP administration's inexperience and incompetence
have led to high unemployment, high college tuitions and hikes in
health insurance fees.</P>
      <P>"The signature campaign is a 'static form' of protest, " Chung
said, adding that the alliance has no plan to take to the streets at
the moment as it would not like to cause public disorder and social
instability.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chung said, the "pan-blue alliance" hopes the DPP
administration will make a positive response to the petition.</P>
      <P>The alliance's two top leaders -- KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong -- will team up to challenge President Chen
Shui-bian's re-election bid next March.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the signature campaign, DPP legislative whip Chen
Chi-mai said the "pan-blue alliance" need not launch such a petition
as it controls the majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"They can initiate amendments to current laws or budget cuts in
case they truly oppose high tuition fees and double hikes in national
health insurance fees," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"It's really weird for the 'pan-blue alliance' to launch a
signature campaign against high tuitions while opposing the
legislation of a referendum bill to let ordinary citizens express
their opinions on major policy issues, " Chen said. "I simply cannot
understand the logic behind its thinking."</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-chin, who is also director of the DPP's women's
affairs department, said the previous KMT administration was to blame
for the rise in college and university tuitions.</P>
      <P>Under the KMT administration, Yeh said, the number of colleges
and universities around the island registered a 114 percent increase,
resulting in a dilution of educational resources and a rise in
tuition fees.</P>
      <P>As to the health insurance fee hikes, Yeh reminded the "pan-blue
alliance" that 80 percent of local residents have expressed
satisfaction with the national health insurance program and that its
efficiency ranks second in the world.</P>
      <P>Yeh also blamed the KMT for the high unemployment rate as it was
the previous KMT administration that opened the local job market to
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>As for the "pan-blue alliance's" proposal to collect capital
gains taxes, Yeh said the KMT chairman will be the first target
subject to the tax. Yeh claimed that Lien had dodged inheritance tax
payments for the more than NT$20 billion in assets he inherited from
his late father.</P>

      <P>Various hospitals in Taiwan will coordinate
their efforts from September to prevent and control severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) should the disease make a reappearance on
the island, the head of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su I-jen said that the CDC has laid out a plan for establishing a
SARS prevention network around the nation with 19 hospitals
designated for exclusively treating patients with the flu-like
atypical pneumonia.</P>
      <P>The hospitals will take on their SARS-fighting posture if the
potentially deadly disease is detected again in Taiwan, Su noted.</P>
      <P>Also, he added, health authorities will start a nationwide
anti-flu vaccination program Sept. 15 for senior citizens aged over
65 to avoiding possible mistakes in diagnosing potential SARS
patients.</P>
      <P>The disease, which gripped mainland China, Hong Kong, Vietnam,
Singapore, Canada and Taiwan between March and June this year,
claimed more than 800 lives around the world, 84 in Taiwan. Health
experts are concerned about a SARS relapse this winter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI KEEN TO HAVE SUNGSHAN AIRPORT TO SERVE DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government should include
Taipei Sungshan Airport in its initial stage to open direct
cross-Taiwan Strait transport links after Taiwan and mainland China
have agreed upon such ties, Taipei City Government spokesman Wu
Yu-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks as part of the city government's response to
an assessment published by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) in mid-August about the impact on Taiwan of opening direct
transport services across the Taiwan Strait, in which the Chiang
Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport was designated by the MAC as the
only airport in the north of the island that would be suitable for
such links.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Sungshan Airport is the only option to allow Taiwan
businessmen to travel between the two sides of the Strait within just
one day, Wu said the government's failure to include the airport to
serve direct cross-strait transport links in its plan will greatly
damage businessmen's advantages.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Taipei City Government will continue seeking to
include the Sungshan Airport in its direct links proposal, in
cooperation with the CKS International Airport near Taipei to
transport cargo and personnel between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>To combine Sungshan Airport and the CKS Airport in northern
Taiwan to conduct the much hoped for direct cross-strait transport
links will much better serve the country's interests, Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Sungshan Airport was out of the
question for inclusion in the plan because of national security
concerns, prompting Taipei municipal authorities to say that such an
arrangement will greatly hamper Taipei's development and its
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent public opinion survey of residents
in the Taipei and Keelung areas, Wu said 68 percent of the
respondents agreed on opening the direct transport links, while 50.7
percent said they were aware of the designation of the CKS Airport.</P>
      <P>At the same time, more than 50 percent of the people surveyed
favored using Sungshan Airport as the link in direct air travel with
mainland China, while 51 percent did not think that opening Sungshan
Airport would be more dangerous than using the CKS Airport.</P>
      <P>Some 30 percent of the public contended that direct transport
links will have an impact on Taiwan's national security, while 39.3
percent believed that such ties will help forge peace between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>About 50 percent thought that Taiwan's global competitiveness
will be sharpened, ahead of the 30 percent who thought Taiwan's
industries will be hollowed out, according to the result of the
survey.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Sheng-tsung, director of the municipal Bureau of
Commerce and Economy, 67 percent of the overseas Chinese-funded
companies, 83 percent of the foreign business groups and 49
enterprises base their headquarters in Taipei.</P>
      <P>They are the prime targets to be served by the links and direct
cross-strait traffic convenience will be their top concern when
deciding whether to keep their roots in Taiwan or make Taiwan their
mainland Chinese market management center, he noted.</P>
      <P>As northern Taiwan has a much stronger demand for direct
cross-strait transport, Sungshan Airport will help businessmen save
at least two and a half hours in travel time over the CKS Airport.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-hsiu, director of the Municipal Research, Development
and Evaluation Commission, stressed that using Sungshan Airport and
the CKS Airport to carry cargo and personnel across the Strait will
create a "win-win" situation for Taiwan, as the CKS Airport is
nearing its capacity saturation point.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP OFFICIAL ATTENDS SEMINAR IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Gueilin,  China,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By C. L. Tseng and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 30 specialists and
scholars from Taiwan, including a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) official, are currently in Gueilin in southwestern China
attending a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait ties that opened Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chung-hsin, who concurrently heads the DPP's
mainland Chinese affairs department, kept a low profile at the
meeting and is not scheduled to present any paper for discussion.
Chen is reputed to be one of the most vocal advocates in the DPP of
forging ties with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Before coming to Gueilin, Chen visited Nanjing where he
reportedly met with officers of the Nanjing Military Region and other
mainland officials for exchanges of views on matters of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>The three-day Gueilin seminar will focuses on topics related to
the current state and future prospects of cross-strait exchanges in
political, economic, cultural and other fields.</P>
      <P>Wang Zaixi, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
mainland China's State Council, said at the opening session that the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should start negotiations for opening
direct trade, postal and transportation links, commonly known as the
"three links," as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the "three links" are economic issues, Wang said
negotiations should be simplified and need not touch on such thorny
issues as the "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan authorities to show sincerity to "three links"
negotiations by shelving disputes over the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian has on many occasions said Taiwan is
unlikely to negotiate "three links" with mainland China under
Beijing's cherished "one China" principle which downgrades the
Republic of China to a province under Beijing's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang Shubei, director of the Beijing-based
Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations Research Center, also said at a seminar
held in Guangzhou that "three links" negotiations need not involve
the "one China" principle because they are purely economic issues.</P>
      <P>Tang said "three links" negotiations should not be postponed
until after Taiwan's next presidential election to be held March 20,
2004.</P>
      <P>"Since opening direct 'three links' will benefit to both sides,
negotiations should kick off as early as possible," he urged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA TO START TALKS ON RESUMING EMPLOYMENT OF MAINLAND SAILORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Tuesday it will negotiate with mainland Chinese
authorities in September for resuming employment of mainland
Chinese fishery workers as early as possible.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan made the remarks after
three Taiwan crew members aboard a Pingtung-based fishing boat
were allegedly killed by their Indonesian colleagues late
last month.</P>
      <P>Lee said the COA will review the policy of hiring foreign
fishery workers and bar foreigners with previous criminal records from
working on Taiwan-registered fishing boats.</P>
      <P>"We'll also ask exporting countries to offer pre-job training for
those who will work aboard Taiwan-owned fishing vessels," Lee said,
adding that the COA will also step up leadership training programs
for local fishing ship skippers.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan fishing vessel, the Chan Cheng Tsung, disappeared
after leaving the Pacific island of Guam late last month. Indonesian
police found it abandoned near the island of Java last week. A search
in Java turned up four Indonesian and two mainland Chinese crew
members, but the three Taiwanese on board, including its captain, had
disappeared.</P>
      <P>"Police in Java say the Indonesian crew members killed the
Taiwanese three days after leaving Guam," Lee said, adding that the
motive for the killings is still not clear.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Indonesians were believed to have thrown the
bodies of the Taiwan crewmen overboard. The four Indonesians and
the two mainland Chinese have been detained for questioning in
Indonesia, he said.</P>
      <P>"We want foreign fishing workers to be investigated for criminal
records before they can be employed," Lee said. It was not clear if
the four Indonesians had previous criminal records.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ROC government will ask Indonesian authorities
through diplomatic channels to make further probes into the case.</P>
      <P>"The COA will also help the families of the three Taiwan crew
members handle relevant affairs and offer them financial aid," Lee
said, adding that each family will receive at least NT$1.25 million
in relief funds.</P>
      <P>As young Taiwan people dislike to work aboard fishing vessels,
local shipowners have relied heavily on foreign crews. According to
COA tallies, Taiwan fishing vessels have hired a total of 37,000
foreign sailors, with 30,000 of them working on deep-sea fishing
trawlers. And about 24,000 of them come from mainland China while the
others are from the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Last year, the skippers and first engineers aboard two
Taiwan fishing boats were killed by their Indonesian crew
members.</P>
      <P>Local shipowners have been forced to hire Indonesian sailors
after mainland China banned exports of fishery workers to Taiwan last
February. Local skippers dislike employing Vietnamese workers because
they were allegedly lazy and inferior in fishing skills. Philippine
sailors were also unwelcome as they were prone to brawling after
drinking.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has agreed to improving treatment for mainland fishery
workers, mainland Chinese authorities have invited local fishery
associations to visit the mainland in the near future to discuss
manpower export issues.</P>
      <P>Local shipowners like to hire mainland workers because they speak
the same language and have a common cultural background. "We hope the
mainland export ban can be lifted as early as possible," a Tungkang
fishery association executive said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian affirmed Tuesday
the success of Vice President Annette Lu's recent overseas trip,
which took her to the United States, Panama and Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the weekly Central Standing Committee meeting of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in his capacity as party
chairman, Chen said that the vice president had successfully conveyed
Taiwan's willingness to share its experiences in its democratic and
economic development with its allies.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan is willing to continue to provide
assistance in the fields of social welfare, agriculture technology
and medicine to its allies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and its allies share the common values of democracy, peace
and prosperity which constitute a solid foundation for bilateral
relations, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen cited the just-concluded fourth summit of heads of state and
governments of the Republic of China, Central American nations, the
Dominican Republic and Belize in Taipei to show that Taiwan's
relations with its Central American and Caribbean allies have been
further strengthening.</P>
      <P>The one-day summit, held Aug. 21 in Taipei, drew together
President Chen and his counterparts from Guatemala, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama, and Belize Prime Minister Said
Musa, Honduras Vice President Alberto Diaz Lobo, and Sergio Grullon,
Minister of the Presidency of the Dominican Republic to discuss
various topics on multilateral and bilateral cooperation programs,
including the promotion of trade, investment, tourism and
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked Taiwan's allies for their support in the
international arena, particularly voicing support for Taiwan's bid to
join the World Health Organization in this year's World Health
Assembly in May in spite of tremendous pressure by Beijing to refrain
from doing so. "The people of Taiwan will remember their support," he
affirmed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to participate in international activities and
assume its responsibility and obligations to the international
community when its sovereignty, security and dignity are safeguarded,

Phoenix Technologies Ltd., Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at an opening ceremony for Phoenix's core

      <P>Lin noted that Phoenix, the supplier of 80 percent of basic
input/output systems (BIOS) in the world, has suffered in the last
three months a 30-to-40 percent drop in revenues in other areas in
the world, except in Taiwan, where it enjoyed a 53 percent growth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's excellent engineers and its highly developed
knowledge-based industries prompted Phoenix to set up the world's
largest CSS research center on the island, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Information Service Industry Association of the
ROC's honorary chairman Weng Cheng-hsiung said that although Taiwan's
software production has lagged that of its hardware production, it
still saw two-digit growth in recent years.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the ROC government has allocated NT$40 billion
(US$1.16 billion) in its plan to modernize its electronics
infrastructure, providing the software industry with abundant
opportunities, Weng added.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan's software industry will focus on three main
categories in the future -- wireless communications, digital content
and information appliances.</P>
      <P>While a bit weak in the field of wireless communications, Taiwan
has good hold on the digital content and information appliances
sectors, according to Weng.</P>
      <P>With a R&amp;D budget accounting for 3 percent of its gross domestic
product and talented individuals, Taiwan is expected to continue
playing a key role in the global science and technology industry,
Weng added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT PROMOTING DIGITAL CONTENT INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is eagerly promoting the value-added
digital content industry, which is capable of creating a production
value worth at least NT$370 billion (US$10.73 billion) and offering
40,000 job opportunities within three years, a government official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jerry J. R. Ou, deputy director-general of the Industrial
Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the
remarks at a 2003 strategic meeting on promoting promising key
industries, which focused on the information service and digital
content industries.</P>
      <P>The two high value-added industries have been touted by the
government as the centerpiece in its flagship "two-trillion,
two-star" project.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by a task force under the economics ministry
show that production value generated by 1,681 companies in the
domestic digital content industry reached NT$153.7 billion last year.
It is forecast that the figure may hit NT$370 billion for 2006, with
the number of companies growing to 3,000 and the number of employees
increasing to 70,000.</P>
      <P>However, Ou pointed out that the domestic industry has
encountered many difficulties with funding and has so far failed to
succeed in forging joint ventures with other sectors.</P>
      <P>To achieve this goal, the economics ministry is seeking
assistance from a fund under the control of the Executive Yuan and
other interested industries to help various Taiwan-based companies
with the potential of producing world-class products to set up joint
cooperative ventures.</P>
      <P>These ventures include the production of several major animation
films and video games with well-known leading international
companies, such as NEC Interchannel, SO-NET and Plnet/NHK, according
to Ou.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the government also plans to sponsor seven
investment seminars next year in an effort to secure joint ventures
worth over NT$4 billion and lure billions worth of investments from
the private sector with the financial help of the fund under the
Executive Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER REITERATES GOVERNMENT'S DETERMINATION TO REV UP ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 26 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun reiterated Tuesday his
Cabinet's determination to stimulate Taiwan's economy and called on
the private sector to join the government's efforts.</P>
      <P>Addressing the congress of the Taiwan Federation of Industry
Association, Yu said that his Cabinet has laid out various programs
for national economic development, including the six-year national
development plan "Challenge 2008" and that their implementation has
produced good results which demonstrate that the policies taken by
the government are on the right track.</P>
      <P>The government is stimulating the country's economic development
and helping transform and upgrade domestic industries to produce
innovative and high value-added products in the face of increasing
international competition, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the United States chip giant Intel's
intention to establish a research center in Taiwan a day earlier
proves that the government's policies and efforts have won
international recognition, the premier continued.</P>
      <P>However, Yu said that his Cabinet is not satisfied with the
achievements it has made in revving up the country's economy and that
it will do more to help increase domestic industries'
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Intel chief executive officer Craig Barrett announced Monday in
Taipei that his company will set up a research center in Taiwan which
will have 18 researchers in the primary stage, and will expand to 25
soon. Eventually the hope is to have 50 to 60 researchers, he said.</P>
      <P>The center will work together with local universities and
businesses in developing new products, said Barrett.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNBALANCED MILITARY FORCE ACROSS TAIWAN STRAIT A PROBLEM: PAAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should pay heed to the increasing
military threat from mainland China and consider it one of the three
biggest problems concerning the security in the Asia-Pacific region,
an American diplomat said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, director of the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , made the remarks in a seminar on
Taiwan-United States-Israel national security held in Taipei, in
which government officials and scholars of the three countries
attended.</P>
      <P>After the Sep. 11 terrorist attacks, Paal noted, there were still
problems with stability and security in the world, citing as examples
three major threats to the Asia-Pacific region -- the unbalanced
military forces between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
increasing nuclear threat on the Korean Peninsula, and continued
terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Among these threats, what Taiwan can do is close the increasing
military gap between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Paal said,
adding that the AIT welcomes the promise from Taiwan leaders to
modernize the island's military forces, a goal that will take time to
reach.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report from the U.S. Pentagon, Paal went
on, Beijing is expected to add 75 ballistic missiles targeting Taiwan
this year, and the figure may even be an underestimate.</P>
      <P>Paal admitted that this year will be a difficult one as the talks
on the nuclear threat on the Korean Peninsula will be filled with
uncertainty, and Taiwan will hold a presidential election in the next
year, which is expected to create tension across the Taiwan Strait.
In addition, nobody knows where the next terrorist attack will be, he
added.</P>

cooperation from mainland China to stop human smuggling across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, director of the Planning and Research Department

      <P>Jan said that human smuggling has long been a serious threat to
Taiwan's coastal security and social order, and that help is needed

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR VISITS FIRMS IN SILICON VALLEY TO COURT INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Silicon  Valley,  Aug.  26 (CNA)
(By Chiang Ying and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has
visited many major high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, including
Hewlett-Packard and Intel, over the past few days to attract them to
invest in Taiwan's largest city.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered Tuesday in Silicon Valley, Ma touted
Taipei's strategic location and superb investment climate. He
encouraged foreign high-tech companies to set up innovation or
research and development (R&amp;D) centers in Taipei for tapping into the
vast mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taipei can serve as a testing market for information
technology (IT) products to enter the greater Chinese community and
as a springboard for technological cooperation between the East and
the West.</P>
      <P>"The greater Taipei area has a large cluster of IT companies. For
instance, the Yuanshan-Linkou area is the world's largest notebook
computer production base, while Taipei City and Taipei County form
the world's top motherboard manufacturing hub," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Nankang software industrial park's annual
business turnover has reached NT$120 billion (US$3.49 billion) and
that the Neihu industrial park's annual turnover has topped NT$77
billion, Ma said Taipei can be a shortcut for IT firms in Silicon
Valley to enter the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taipei has 27 universities and more than 10 large
research institutes. "We have Asia's largest number of MBA degree
holders, and those with bachelor's or higher academic degrees make up
39 percent of the city's total population."</P>
      <P>An abundant supply of brainpower is key to industrial
development, Ma said, adding that Taipei's per capita education
expenditure is the second highest in Asia.</P>
      <P>Since assuming the mayorship five years ago, Ma said, he has
given priority to developing Taipei into an "Internet capital." At
present, he said, 900,000 Taipei households have computers, and 50
percent of these households have subscribed to broadband
communication services.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ma said, 72 percent of Taipei citizens use Internet
services, and 81 percent have cell phones. Taipei City Government
will invest more in creating a broadband wireless environment to
bring about new business opportunities for the IT industry, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the annual Taipei international computer trade fair has
become the world's third largest exhibition of its kind. In addition
to the current 2,600-booth exhibition hall, Ma said, a new exhibition
ground that can accommodate 3,000 booths will be inaugurated in two
years.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said, Taipei boasts a convenient living
environment, with many round-the-clock services. "We also have rich
cultural resources and facilities as well as prestigious
international schools and medical services to cater to the needs of
high-tech industry professionals," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the city government will offer more financial incentives
and vocational training services to attract foreign investors. He
further said semiconductor chip designing firms are most welcome to
set up technological support centers, product testing facilities and
laboratories in Taipei. Other knowledge-based industry firms and
biotechnology companies are also welcome to come to Taipei, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN REPROACHES BEIJING FOR DROWNING INCIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian took Beijing
authorities to task Wednesday for the incident a day earlier off the
coast of the central Taiwan county of Miaoli when six mainland
Chinese women drowned while trying to enter Taiwan illegally.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is regrettable that six mainland Chinese women
drowned after being thrown overboard by human smugglers, commonly
known as "snakeheads, " to escape pursuing Taiwan coast guard boats
early Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"While human traffickers and the crew of the vessels are to blame
for such a callous move, mainland Chinese authorities should also be
held responsible for the tragedy," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while meeting with an Australian
parliamentary delegation.</P>
      <P>A total of 26 mainland Chinese women were thrown overboard by
"snakeheads" from two speedboats off the shore of Tunghsiao at around
4 a.m. Six of them drowned while the 20 others were rescued by Taiwan
coast guard officers.</P>
      <P>All of them were young women lured into going to Taiwan with
offers of lucrative work, coast guard officials said, adding that the
fee they were charged for the voyage from the mainland to Taiwan was
around NT$200,000 each.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the young mainland women had fled their
motherland to express their discontent with Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>"They chose to flee to Taiwan at risk to their own lives, " Chen
said. "What bewilders us is the Beijing authorities' disregard for
their own people's lives, rights and safety."</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chen said, mainland China has persistently spared no
efforts in trying to isolate Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>"They have blocked our entry into the United Nations and the
World Health Organization (WHO) , " Chen said, adding that Beijing's
"rude manner" toward Taiwan's plead for observership at the 2003
World Health Assembly -- the WHO's governing body -- held in Geneva
in May this year deeply hurt the Taiwan people's feelings.</P>
      <P>Equally outrageous is the fact that Beijing has asked its
diplomatic allies not to recognize or accept the new version of the
ROC passport to be issued from Sept. 1, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The new version of the ROC passport will display the word
"Taiwan" on its cover in addition to the nation's official
designation of the "Republic of China" in order to make it more
distinguishable from the passport issued by the People's Republic of
China -- mainland China's official title.</P>
      <P>Chen said what Beijing urgently must do is to prevent mainland
people from trying to enter Taiwan illegally and to refrain from
blocking Taiwan's WHO observership or pressuring its diplomatic
allies to reject Taiwan's new passport.</P>
      <P>The Australian parliamentary delegation is being headed by Sen.
Alan Ferguson, who concurrently serves as chairman of the Joint
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade of the
Senate and the House of Representatives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is expected to markedly
rebound in the second half of this year, with the composite index
rising for the third month in a row in July and hitting its highest
level since April last year, a Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) spokesman reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent survey of Taiwan business firms
and manufacturers, the spokesman noted that 50.5 percent of the
polled said they are optimistic about business conditions over the
coming six months, while only 9.3 percent said they are pessimistic.
The remaining 40.2 percent said they think business conditions will
remain about the same for the period.</P>
      <P>Fueled by an expected economic upturn in the global market
following the containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
and the conclusion of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, the domestic economy
will also regain momentum, with exports booming, private-sector
consumption and investment growing, and public construction projects
expanding, the TIER official said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a low-interest rate environment will be
maintained in the international market in an effort to boost demand,
with global economic growth for 2003 expected to be about 2 percent,
he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER BRIEFS ON TAIWAN'S CAPITAL MARKET AT FORUM IN N.Y.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Chang Sheng-chao and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lin Chuan told
participants at the "Taiwan Investment Forum" in New York Tuesday
that Taiwan has undertaken a series of reformatory measures to
improve the mechanism of the capital market and further globalization
and liberalization of the market.</P>
      <P>Lin and his entourage attended the forum sponsored by the
Ministry of Finance, which was aimed at attracting more foreign
investments in Taiwan's capital market.</P>
      <P>Pointing out Taiwan's advantageous geographic position for
foreign investors interested in the Asia-Pacific market, Lin said
that Taiwan is graced with good industrial infrastructure as well as
ample research and development capabilities.</P>
      <P>The minister said that as an export-oriented economy, Taiwan's
external trade has continued to grow since 1952. Being the
14th-largest exporting country and the 16th-biggest importing country
in the world, last year Taiwan's two-way trade amounted to US$243
billion and the foreign reserve accumulated to US$175.2 billion.</P>
      <P>While the government is offering numerous incentives to business
and industry for the advancement of their R&amp;D capability since 2000,
it has also sought to accelerate monetary reforms, in relation to
legislation and regulations governing financial control companies,
merger of financial institutions, securities of monetary assets, and
real estate securities, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>He said that in order to consolidate the nation's banking system,
the government has applied both stick and carrot to banking
institutions, requiring them to limit the overdue loan ratio under 5
percent.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the Resolution Trust Committee (RTC)
Fund, the monetary reconstruction initiative has helped dozens of
banks clear their debts. The overdue loan ratio of local banking
institutions shrank from 8.04 percent in the first quarter of 2002 to
5.68 percent at the end of June, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minister said, cross-Taiwan Strait monetary
exchanges have continued to increase over the past years. While seven
local banks have set up offices in mainland China, banking
institutions across the Strait will be allowed to set up branches in
Taiwan when the revised Provisions Governing the Relations of People
on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait is legislated.</P>
      <P>In light of further globalization and liberalization of Taiwan's
banking system, Lin said that the government has adopted a series of
reformatory measures to improve the market mechanism in order to
provide a transparent and trustworthy investment environment.</P>
      <P>The minister elaborated that last month the government announced
further openness of foreign portfolio investment in the domestic
securities market, and the QFII (qualified foreign institutional
investor) restrictions will be abolished by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>He said that international banking institutions are offered an
equal footing with their Taiwanese counterparts to operate in
Taiwan's monetary market, and the government has simplify the
application procedures for the introduction of new monetary
derivatives.</P>
      <P>According to the minister, Taiwan's capital market has continued
to expand over the past years. As of the end of June, the 638
companies listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange had an overall market
capitalization amounting to NT$284 billion. In the first half of this
year, the value of securities turnover of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
amounted to NT$234 billion, the value of securities changed hands in
the OTC (over-the-counter) Securities Market totaled NT$19 billion,
and the number of futures contracts exceeded 10 million.</P>
      <P>Since the government opened its insurance market in 1986,
international insurance companies have become ever more active in
this lucrative market, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Referring to a report of the Asian Insurance Review in its
February 2003 issue, the minister said that Taiwan was the
third-largest life insurance market and the fourth-largest property
insurance market in Asia, in terms of premium revenues.</P>
      <P>Welcoming foreign investments in Taiwan's monetary market, Lin
said that Taiwan is making all necessary changes and embracing every
opportunity.</P>
      <P>Heading an investment promotion mission composed of financial
officials, legislators and executives of banks and securities houses,
Lin flew into New York last Friday. He will leave for Boston
Wednesday to attend a forum on Taiwan's financial system there on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to return to Taipei on Friday.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Wednesday asked the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) to be prepared
for a possible strike by Taiwan Railway workers on Moon Festival, one
of major holidays for Chinese, which falls on Sep. 11 this year.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Railway labor union vowed to strike on one of the most
important holidays for Chinese people to make known their opposition
to the privatization of Taiwan Railway. They said the government's
movement will only benefit the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp., and the
plan intends to ultimately eliminate Taiwan Railway.</P>
      <P>Yu asked the MOTC to continue strengthening communications with
the union to find a resolution, while in the meantime coordinating
long-distance bus drivers and air traffic companies to increase
services on that day.</P>
      <P>Chang Wen-cheng, chairman of Taiwan Railway labor union, said
that their decision to strike has not changed and some 12,000 out of
14,000 Taiwan Railway workers have endorsed the idea.</P>
      <P>While on the administrative side, Taiwan Railway Administration
Director General D.C. Huang said he is sure that railroad services
will be kept normal on Sept. 11 because he has faith in Taiwan
Railway workers, who, in the eyes of Huang, are devoted to their
work.</P>
      <P>Huang announced that the company will sell tickets for the Moon

    <HEADLINE>MAC SUGGESTS INTERVIEW OF M'LAND SPOUSES TO SCREEN OUT FAKE MARRIAGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should work out a feasible
mechanism to screen out mainland Chinese who have used the cover of
marriage to come to Taiwan illegally, the head of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) suggested Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen made the remarks at the legislature
while reporting on the trend of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
using phony marriages to circumvent the law and ways to deal with the
situation. The issue was brought into grim focus yesterday as six
mainland Chinese women trying to sneak into Taiwan drowned after
being pushed from their ship by panicked crew fearing discovery.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the number of mainland Chinese spouses applying
to come to Taiwan to be united with their Taiwan families has risen
every year, reaching more than 190,000 at present.</P>
      <P>But she said that given the personnel constraints at the Bureau of
Immigration, the review of mainland Chinese spouses has been
conducted mainly through paperwork with interviews being rare. She
said this had resulted in some mainland Chinese women coming to
Taiwan under the cover of marriage to engage in illegal activities.</P>
      <P>She expressed the hope that the Bureau of Immigration would
conduct interviews with mainland Chinese spouses applying to come to
Taiwan and that local police stations would call and check on the
women regularly so as to foil those who have used the name of
marriages to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tsai also pointed out that the problem of accommodation and
repatriation of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants lies in the
growth of their numbers in Taiwan, far outpacing the number who have
been sent back to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tsai cited statistics to show that the number of women among
illegal mainland immigrants has risen rapidly in recent years. There
were 7 percent before 1999, 22.3 percent in 2000, and 73.3 percent in
July 2003.</P>
      <P>But she noted that currently, only a Hsinchu detention center
accommodates female illegal mainland Chinese. The space is too small
and there are too few women guards.</P>
      <P>This results in other female illegal immigrants from mainland
China being sent to provisional detention centers or police stations,
some staying there for up to five to six months, she said, adding
that "This problem should not be overlooked."</P>
      <P>She noted that the number of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
peaked between 1992 and 1994 and declined afterwards, averaging 1,500
people a year. But the number of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
then climbed in 2002.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the number will be maintained at around
2,000 this year. Repatriation takes place about once a month for
around 150 individuals each time. It is estimated that 1,500 will be
repatriated a year, a much slower pace than the speed of rounding up
new illegal mainland immigrants.</P>
      <P>To effectively solve the problem resulting from the delay by
mainland China to take back the illegal immigrants, Tsai said that
the government had urged Beijing to agree to increase repatriation
missions to three times every two months.</P>

      <P>One out of eight babies born last year in
Taiwan were from mothers who were not Taiwan citizens, the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that around 248,000 babies were born last
year, and the mothers of 12.5 percent of them had come from mainland
China, Hong Kong, Macau and other countries.</P>
      <P>In 1998, there were only 13,000 babies born of non-Taiwan
mothers, and the number increased sharply to 30,000 last year. That
accounted for 12.5 percent of the total babies born in the same year,
an increase of 7.4 percentage points over that of the five years ago.</P>
      <P>With the rapid growth of non-Taiwan mothers, the officials said
that a major task is to help them integrate into local society, offer
eugenics information, and provide assistance in the raising of
children and helping them with employment to upgrade the quality of
life for the next generation.</P>
      <P>According to information by the Ministry of the Interior and the
semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, out of 173,000 couples
that registered for marriage last year, nearly 45,000 couples were of
Taiwan men and women who were not Taiwan nationals. Among these, 60
percent came from mainland China, Macau and Hong Kong. They are 30
years old on average and have lower than junior high school
educations.</P>
      <P>Those wives coming from mainland China and Southeast Asia usually
have lower than junior high school educations, while wives from
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and other areas in general have higher
educations with 40 to 50 percent of them having higher than college

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER EXPRESSES DEEP REGRET OVER DEATH OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun expressed deep regret
Wednesday over the drowning of six illegal mainland Chinese
immigrants off the coast of Miaoli County in central Taiwan a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Yu was referring to the incident whereby 26 mainland Chinese were
thrown into the ocean by human traffickers, commonly known as
"snakeheads, " from two speed boats early Tuesday to escape Taiwan
coast guard ships, which resulted in the drowning of six mainland
women.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Yu said respect for life
and human rights is a universal value. "The tragedy was appalling and
disheartening, " Yu said, adding that no similar incident should
happen again.</P>
      <P>Yu said law enforcement authorities should launch an all-out
crackdown on cross-strait human smuggling rings and bring to justice
masterminds of such criminal operations.</P>
      <P>He also directed Cabinet Secretary-General Liu Shih-fang to call
an interministerial meeting to craft effective measures to stave off
illegal cross-strait human trafficking.</P>
      <P>Noting that the steady stream of illegal mainland immigrants has
threatened Taiwan's public order and social stability, Yu said
mainland China should address the problems. "Otherwise, it seems to
us that the Beijing government is assisting and tolerating such
criminal operations."</P>
      <P>Yu further instructed the Ministry of the Interior and the
Mainland Affairs Council to coordinate with the Red Cross Society and
the Straits Exchange Foundation in pushing mainland Chinese
authorities to take back illegal immigrants as early as possible.
Some of them have been detained in Taiwan for more than six months.</P>
      <P>The premier also urged mainland China to resume dialogue with
Taiwan to discuss certain practical issues, such as repatriation of
illegal immigrants, prevention of cross-strait human trafficking and
cracking down on other criminal activities. "Cross-strait cooperation
is needed to resolve these thorny issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary-General Liu said he will invite
officials from relevant government agencies to a meeting within a
week to address the cross-strait human smuggling issues.</P>
      <P>Twenty-six mainland Chinese women were thrown overboard by
"snakeheads" from two speedboats off the shore of Tunghsiao at around
4 a.m. Six of them drowned while the 20 others were rescued by Taiwan
coast guard officers.</P>
      <P>All of them were young women lured into going to Taiwan with
offers of lucrative work, coast guard officials said, adding that the
fee they were charged for the voyage from the mainland to Taiwan was
around NT$200,000 each.</P>
      <P>One of the rescued mainland immigrants is still hospitalized for
treatment of injuries sustained in the incident. She is conscious but
has to rely on a respirator as her lungs were damaged due to inhaling
too much water.</P>
      <P>The remaining 19 illegal immigrants are healthy and have been
sheltered at the Tunghsia police station and a coast guard base in
Changhua County's Lukang township. They will be repatriated later,
coast guard officials said.</P>
      <P>Four crewmen of the two speedboats, identified as Yeh Tien-sheng,
Tseng Chun-ming, Ke Ching-sung and Wang Chung-hsing -- have been
arrested on charges of homicide. All of the suspects are residents in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The identities of the six deceased mainland women have yet to be
determined. Coroners may perform autopsies Thursday, prosecutors
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LU PLANS TO OFFER A COOPERATION PLATFORM FOR PACIFIC DEMOCRACIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday
that the establishment of the Democratic Pacific Union and an
upcoming Democratic Pacific Assembly is to offer a cooperation
platform for the democracies surrounding the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a meeting with Edwin J. Feulner, president
of the U.S. Heritage Foundation, who, being an old friend of Lu, also
asked about Lu's recent tour to ROC's diplomatic allies in Latin
America.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that she will sponsor a Democratic Pacific Assembly in
Taipei in mid-September and set up a Democratic Pacific Union with
the final goal of developing the abundant resources of the nations on
the Pacific rim to build a new "ocean civilization."</P>
      <P>During the gathering, Lu and Feulner talked about the dialogue on
the nuclear threat on the Korean Peninsula currently being held in
Beijing. Lu said that Taiwan was also concerned about the issue.</P>
      <P>Regarding the holding of referendums in Taiwan, Lu noted that the
island was fighting alone when it was hard hit by severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) earlier this year. Worse yet, mainland
China did not extend a helping hand to Taiwan, but humiliated the
island in the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly, the
decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) , an
organization in which Taiwan was eager to enter.</P>
      <P>Taiwan wants to hold referendums to let Beijing and other parts
of the world understand the real feelings of the people of Taiwan, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Feulner said the Heritage Foundation he leads has
been always supportive of Taiwan. With regard to the holding of a
referendum, Feulner said that judging from American experience, it is
nothing odd as it is a demonstration of democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN,  PHILIPPINES SHOULD SIGN FREE TRADE ACCORD: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed the hope
Wednesday that Taiwan and the Philippines will sign a free trade
agreement and increase cooperation in the technological, agricultural
and fishery fields.</P>
      <P>Meeting with Roberto Romulo, an advisor in the national
competitiveness to the Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo,
and the later's daughter, Evangelina Lourdes Arroyo, at the
Presidential Office, Chen said that Taiwan and the Philippines are
neighboring countries and have long maintained close relations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the fourth-largest trading partner of the Philippines
with two-way trade that amounted to US$5.6 billion last year, leaving
a surplus of US$1.6 billion for Manila, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also the fifth-largest capital supplier of the
Philippines with investments that accumulated to more than US$1
billion at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 Taiwanese visited the Philippines last year,
making Taiwan the fifth-largest tourist source of the Southeast Asian
nation, Chen continued, emphasizing that the number represents an
annual growth rate of 21 percent.</P>
      <P>More than 71,000 Philippine laborers are working in Taiwan,
earning more than US$400 million a year for Manila's foreign exchange
reserve, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that he greatly appreciates Taiwan's
relations with the Philippines and hopes to further strengthen these
ties during his administration. There is still room for improving
ties, particularly in the trade, investment, tourism and labor
fields, he said.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that the Philippines offer more incentives to lure
Taiwan investors, Chen said that the signing of a free trade
agreement between the two countries would be mutually beneficial.</P>
      <P>Chen asked his guests to convey his regards and invitation to
President Arroyo. He said that he hopes to meet Arroyo in Taipei at
an opportune time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SUPPORTS NUCLEAR-FREE KOREAN PENINSULA: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday the
Republic of China supports a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and looks
forward to seeing a peaceful solution to all disputes between the two
Koreas.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of South Korean
National Assembly members.</P>
      <P>"Our policy toward the Korean Peninsula issue is clear and
unequivocal, " Chen said. "We dislike to see any nuclear arms
development programs on the peninsula and call on all parties
involved to resolve disputes through peaceful dialogue."</P>
      <P>As a member of the Asia-Pacific community, Chen said, the ROC is
concerned about regional peace, security and stability. For instance,
he said, Taiwan is concerned about the results of the current
six-nation meeting in Beijing on East Asia's most urgent security
concern -- North Korea's nuclear program and U.S. demands that it be
halted immediately.</P>
      <P>Chen said he earnestly hopes that the three-day conference will
be fruitful in helping ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula and
eventually resolve the nuclear arms issue to maintain regional
security and stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC supports the U.S.-initiated prevention of
nuclear arms proliferation plan, Chen said Taiwan's impounding of 158
barrels of a controlled chemical aboard a North Korean freighter
earlier this month signifies Taiwan's commitment to opposing arms
proliferation and global terrorism.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-South Korean relations, Chen said the two
countries have traditionally maintained close ties, particularly in
the trade and economic fields.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade reached US$11.58 billion last year, with South
Korea enjoying a trade surplus of US$3.84 billion. Taiwan was South
Korea's fifth-largest trading partner, while South Korea was Taiwan's
fourth-largest import source and fifth-largest export market.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that senior officials of the two countries can
strengthen exchanges of visits and resume the annual
ministerial-level economic conference to boost bilateral cooperation.
The annual event has been suspended since Seoul switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1992.</P>
      <P>As to the resumption of direct flight services between the two
countries, Chen said the ROC would like to see an early resumption of
direct Taipei-Seoul air links under the principles of dignity,
equality and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>"Our two countries should increase exchanges to avoid
misunderstandings and facilitate cooperation in promoting peace,
security, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, " Chen
told his guests.</P>
      <P>The North Korean freighter "Be Gaehung" was allowed to leave
Taiwan's Kaohsiung Harbor only after it unloaded the 158 barrels of
phosphorus pentasulfide -- a chemical that can be used in rocket fuel
production.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy stabilized in July with
the composite index of its economic situation registering 24 points,
rating a green light for the first time this year, according to a
government report published Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The report compiled by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) under the Executive Yuan showed that the composite
index increased by four points from the previous month's level which
was rated a yellow-blue light.</P>
      <P>A yellow-blue light indicates economic sluggishness in the CEPD's
five-color grading system. A red light signifies an overheated
economy. Yellow-red indicates that the economy is heating up. Green
reflects steady growth and blue represents recession.</P>
      <P>The report also stated that the leading index was 100.5 points in
July, up 1.4 percentage points from that of a month ago, while the
current index was 102.6 points, up 0.8 percentage points from that of
a month earlier.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, a survey of local manufacturers conducted by the
CEPD in July indicates that 17 percent of the respondents believe the
economy will improve in the next three months, the same registered in
the preceding month, while 13 percent predicted that the economy will
get worse, up from 8 percent recorded a month ago, with the remaining
70 percent believing the economy will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Based on the leading index -- a key barometer of economic trends
over the next three to six months -- CEPD officials said that the
island's economy will continue to recover steadily in the short-term.</P>
      <P>The country's stock prices, monetary supply, orders received by
the manufacturing sector, production and exports and other economic
indicators are back to normal, they noted.</P>
      <P>They attributed the economic improvement to the global economic
recovery, increase of business confidence and stimulus measures taken
by the government, including expansion of public construction
programs.</P>
      <P>Many foreign economic analysts and forecasting groups have
predicted a brighter future for Taiwan's economy, they said, noting
that the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) estimated that Taiwan will
enjoy economic growth of 5.4 percent next year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN SAYS HE ASSUMED THE PRESIDENCY UNDER ROC CONSTITUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
assumed the presidency under the Republic of China's Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with a group of U.S. scholars
and experts on cross-Taiwan Strait affairs, headed by John Tkacik, a
research fellow with the Washington-based think tank the Heritage
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after former President Lee Teng-hui said over
the weekend that the ROC no longer exists.</P>
      <P>"It is not disputed that I was sworn in as the ROC's 10th
president on May 20, 2000 in line with the nation's Constitution, "
Chen said, adding that he is obligated to safeguard national
sovereignty, dignity and security as well as work for the well-being
of the people of Taiwan in terms of constitutional provisions.</P>
      <P>Chen said Beijing issued a white paper during the run-up to
Taiwan's 2000 presidential election in which it claimed that the ROC
had been dead since 1949 due to the loss of its international status.</P>
      <P>Beijing's claim is wrong, Chen said, adding that the ROC has
continued to exist on Taiwan since 1949.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is an independent, sovereign state, Chen
said its current national title is the Republic of China. Therefore,
he noted, it is a stark reality that there is one state on each side
of the Taiwan Strait at the moment, namely, the Republic of China and
the People's Republic of China -- mainland China's official title.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that his administration is determined to hold
the nation's first-ever referendum on certain policy issues before or
on the day of the island's next presidential election -- March 20,
2004.</P>
      <P>The issues will include whether construction on the island's
Fourth Nuclear Power Plant should be halted or continued as well as
whether Taiwan should join the World Health Organization (WHO), Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"We want to hold a referendum on our WHO bid mainly because of
Beijing's opposition to our participation in the world health
watchdog body. We want to demonstrate to the world our people's
unanimous desire to join the WHO through a referendum. So long as
Beijing stops blocking our bid, we'll not include the issue on the
list of topics subject to a referendum," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the planned referendum will not touch on any
sensitive issues regarding Taiwan's future -- independence or
unification with the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he plans to start negotiations with Beijing
for opening direct cross-strait transportations links after next
year's presidential election. And if all goes well, he said, direct
cross-strait shipping and air links could become a reality by the end
of 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO STEP UP CRACKDOWN ON HUMAN SMUGGLING RINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several women's rights groups urged the
government Thursday to step up its crackdown on human smuggling rings
by establishing a special investigative agency.</P>
      <P>The groups made the appeal after human traffickers, commonly
known as "snakeheads, " threw 26 mainland Chinese women overboard
early on Tuesday near Tunghsiao in Miaoli County to escape pursuing
Taiwan coast guard ships, which resulted in the drowning of six of
the women.</P>
      <P>All of them were young women lured into going to Taiwan with
offers of lucrative work. The fee they were charged for the voyage
from the mainland to Taiwan was around NT$200,000 each.</P>
      <P>Chen Wan-hui, deputy chief executive of the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation, said she had interviewed many mainland women detained at
local police stations for illegally entering Taiwan to engage in
prostitution.</P>
      <P>"Their average age was 20. All of them had lost their freedom
since being lured into going to Taiwan. In the process, they were
sold from time to time. As a result, police have difficulties
locating snakeheads even after they have arrested illegal mainland
immigrants, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>In her view, Chen said, the most important work in preventing
human trafficking lies in investigation. "If we fail to track down
'snakeheads' and their accomplices, illegal mainland immigrants,
particularly young women, will continue to stream into Taiwan, " she
said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said, the government must set up a special agency
to investigate human smuggling rings and their operations. "Whenever
law enforcement officers round up mainland Chinese prostitutes, they
should continue their probes into the criminal rings that control
those prostitutes," she said.</P>
      <P>Only by going after the "snakeheads" and getting them can Taiwan
put an end to cross-Taiwan Strait human smuggling and prevent a
recurrence of Tuesday's drowning tragedy, Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>34 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS NABBED IN SUBURBAN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-four illegal immigrants, including
31 from mainland China and three from Russia, were intercepted in
suburban Taipei early Thursday, coast guard officials reported.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they spotted a suspicious truck in
Shihpai, Taipei, at around 2 a.m. which was covered with thick sponge
all over. They then stopped the truck and discovered the illegal
immigrants, all of them women, hiding inside.</P>
      <P>This represents the largest group of illegal immigrants that the
coast guard has intercepted this year.</P>
      <P>The officials sent the illegal immigrants to the Keelung branch
of the Coast Guard Administration for initial questioning, while the
driver of the truck, 38-year-old Chang Chou-yao, was handed over to
the Shihlin Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>The women claimed that they boarded a ship at Pingtan, Fujian
Province, on the southeast coast of mainland China, and then changed
to another ship on the open seas. They arrived at Hualien, eastern
Taiwan, Wednesday night.</P>
      <P>The women said that they came to Taiwan to work but would not say
what kind of work.</P>
      <P>The women, in tears during the questioning, claimed that they had
been tricked into coming to Taiwan and that they had little to eat
while at sea for five days.</P>
      <P>Upon learning the news of the six mainland woman who drowned
Tuesday trying to illegally enter Taiwan, some of the women said they
were "lucky to be arrested" because at least they didn't die.</P>
      <P>As for the three Russian women, the coast guard officials are
awaiting translation assistance from the Moscow-Taipei Economic and
Cultural Coordination Commission in Taipei to facilitate the
investigation. They will decide later whether to send the three women
to a detention center for foreigners in Sanhsia, Taipei County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH ADVISES TAIWAN PEOPLE NOT TO VISIT RURAL CHINA OVER SARS CONCERN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan citizens should not head to rural
areas nor eat wildlife meat while visiting mainland China in order to
avoid contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a senior
Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease
Control (CDC) , said a team of World Health Organization (WHO)
officials traveled to the southern mainland Chinese province of
Guangdong earlier this month to conduct coronovirus tests on birds,
reptiles and mammals in the wild.</P>
      <P>"Most of those animals tested positive, indicating that
coronovirus -- the pathogen that causes SARS -- still exists, " Shih
said, adding that against this backdrop, SARS is very likely to stage
a comeback this fall or winter.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan citizens should avoid non-essential trips to
mainland China. "Even if they travel to the mainland, they should
stay away from rural areas. More important, they should not come into
contact with any wild animals nor eat wildlife meat," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>In preparation for a possible reemergence of SARS, Shih said, the
WHO has unveiled a new reporting system and quarantine regulations.
The world health watchdog body has also formally listed SARS as a
statutory communicable disease -- a move that will require medical
professionals to inform relevant health authorities immediately after
they spot a suspected or probable case.</P>
      <P>Shih said the Republic of China government will call an
interministerial meeting Sept. 1 to discuss precautionary measures.</P>
      <P>According to the new WHO regulations, the SARS prevention
mechanism should be activated whenever two health care providers or
three patients in the same hospital come down with the disease. The
preventive measures will include temperature-taking on arrivals at
airports as well as various in-hospital infection control practices.</P>
      <P>The WHO has also stipulated that those who have possibly been
exposed to the SARS virus and have developed respiratory symptoms
within 10 days of that possible exposure should undergo a three-day
quarantine during which time they should not go to school or work.
Such individuals can however do such daily errands as going out to
buy boxed lunches or putting out their garbage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIETNAM TO STEP UP ITS MANAGEMENT OF LABOR BROKERAGE AGENCIES: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Lillian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vietnam agreed during a meeting with Taiwan
on Vietnamese laborers earlier this week to step up its management of
its labor brokerage agencies, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The two sides held the meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, Aug. 25-26.
They discussed how to cut the Vietnamese laborer runaway rate in
Taiwan, with the Vietnamese side promising to revoke the license of
any brokerage agency with a runaway rate of 3 percent among the
laborers it introduces to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese side also promised to straighten up the pre-work
training institutions and to ban the recruiting of laborers in
regions that tend to have high runaway rates.</P>
      <P>In addition, Vietnam is also planning to have its local
governments, instead of brokerage companies, introduce laborers to
Taiwan. The fees will also be standardized to avoid exploitation of
the laborers.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese side also agreed to cooperate with Taiwan's
crackdown on runaway laborers. According to the agreement, if runaway
Vietnamese laborers turn themselves in, the brokerage agency
that had introduced the laborers into Taiwan will be responsible for
paying for their plane ticket home. Also, the Taiwan side agreed
to work out a plan to allow those laborers who have turned themselves
in to return to Taiwan in the future to work again.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are more than 2,600 Vietnamese laborers on the
run in Taiwan, for a runaway rate of 6.4 percent among Vietnamese
laborers. The figure represents the highest runaway rate among
foreign laborers.</P>
      <P>Kuo Fong-yu, director general of the CLA's Employment &amp;
Vocational Training Administration who attended the Hanoi meeting,
said that to effectively mitigate the runaway rate, Vietnam will use
the runaway list provided by Taiwan to send notices to the runaway
laborers' families in Vietnam in the hope that the families will be
able to persuade them to turn themselves in.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether to adopt a similar strategy to deal
with runaway laborers from other countries, Kuo said that every
country will adopt different measures and that as long as the other
countries are willing to reciprocate Taiwan's goodwill, the CLA will
study possible cooperation measures within its authority.</P>
      <P>CLA officials noted that they will begin a three-month campaign
Sep. 1 to search for runaway laborers and crackdown on employers who
illegally hire such workers, and complete an assessment report on
foreign laborer exporting countries in November, in the hope of
effectively cutting foreign laborer runaway rates.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CLA tallies, Taiwan currently has some
300,000 foreign laborers that were introduced legally, with more than
10,000 of those having fled their jobs and remaining unaccounted for.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is of the position that the needs of
new members should be taken into account in the agricultural
negotiations at the upcoming Fifth Ministerial Conference of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's permanent representative to
the WTO said Thursday in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Yen Ching-chang said that Taiwan is very concerned about the
rights of new members in the agricultural negotiations, which will be
high on the agenda at the September meeting. The Fifth Ministerial
Conference of the WTO is set for Sept. 10-14 in Cancun, Mexico.</P>
      <P>As the outcome of the agricultural negotiations is expected to
have a significant impact on Taiwan's economy, Yen said, the
government has sought to safeguard the rights and interests of
Taiwan's farm population.</P>
      <P>Referring to the special and differential treatment to new
members, Yen said that it is impossible to apply a unified solution
to all members, adding that the rules should be more flexible.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Doha Ministerial Declaration of November
2001 stressed that "the special and differential treatment for
developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the
negotiations and shall be embodied in the schedules of concessions
and commitments and as appropriate in the rules and disciplines to be
negotiated, so as to be operationally effective and to enable
developing countries to effectively take account of their developing
needs, including food safety and rural development."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MILITARY TO FLEX MUSCLES IN 'HAN KUANG' EXERCISE SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC military will flex its muscles in a
combined services live-fire exercise to be held in the northeastern
county of Ilan Sept. 1, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The drill is the second round of the "Han Kuang 19" exercise,
which is designed to test the armed forces' combined services defense
capabilities and the performance of various weaponry systems, MND
officials said. The Han Kuang series of exercises is Taiwan's largest
military training drill of the year.</P>
      <P>The first round of the "Han Kuang 19" exercise was held in
mid-May. Due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreaks in
Taiwan between March and June, the second round was postponed to
Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The upcoming drill will test the three service branches' combined
combat prowess in air, sea and amphibious operations, an MND official
said, adding that the live-fire exercise will also verify the
feasibility or adaptability of various defense strategies and combat
programs.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will preside over the training drill,
with some 400 other senior government officials, legislators, foreign
diplomats and journalists witnessing. The audience will be the
largest for a military exercise in recent memory.</P>
      <P>During the drill, the ROC Navy will for the first time launch two
Hsiungfeng II ship-to-ship missiles from a domestically developed
"stealth" speed boat, MND sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, U.S.-made Harpoon missiles will be fired from F-16 jet
fighters in the upcoming exercise, the sources said. It will be the
second time that airborne-fired Harpoon missiles will have been
test-fired outside the United States. In the "Han Kuang 17" exercise
two years ago, a Harpoon missile was test-fired for the first time
from an ROC F-16 jet fighter.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, a mainland Chinese surveillance vessel
believed to be a "spy ship" was found north of Taiwan as the island's
military prepared for the large-scale Han Kuang exercise.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, MND
officials said, the military will demonstrate to the world through
the "Han Kuang" exercise that its has the determination and

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday his
11- day visit to Canada and the United States produced good results
on methods of dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ,
and that some interest was shown in investing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma, who returned to Taiwan Wednesday night after concluding his
visit to six major cities in the two countries, said that after
visiting Toronto, Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, he thought that the
situation in Toronto was similar to Taiwan. He also visited Atlanta,
Phoenix and San Francisco.</P>
      <P>He noted that after the outbreaks of the potentially deadly
disease, medical care staff in Toronto were panicked, and had to ask
the United States for a support.</P>
      <P>Ma said that reviewing the experience in combating SARS in
Singapore, Canada and Taiwan, he believes a better coordination
mechanism between cities would help a great deal in combating the
disease. He has instructed the Department of Health to conduct
prevention drills in the city, and that it work with the
Cabinet-level Department of Health on how to deal with the disease
and upgrade the efficiency of medical response agencies.</P>
      <P>Chang Hang, director of Taipei's Department of Health, noted that
during the outbreaks of SARS in Toronto, Singapore and Hong Kong,
people were not compelled to wear surgical mask as in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that a lot of countries had not asked people to wear
surgical masks in mass transportation systems as Taiwan did during
the peak of the SARS outbreaks when it required the wearing of
surgical masks while using the mass rapid transit and railway
systems.</P>
      <P>If the disease resurfaces in the winter, Chang said that the
prevention measures will have to depend on the situation, and may not
be as strict as when Taiwan was hit hard between March and June.</P>
      <P>On the soliciting of investment in Taiwan, Ma stressed that his
biggest achievement was to let high-tech companies in the Silicon
Valley know that there is not only the showcase Hsinchu Science-based
Industrial Park in Taiwan, there are also the Neihu Science-based
Industrial Park and Nankang Software Park in suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said that it would be a lie if he said that he had attracted
the promise of tens millions of dollars from the first visit, adding
that "this is only the start."</P>
      <P>"The trade promotion will be even more systematic in the futre, "
Ma said, adding that he will take manufacturers from the Nankang
Software Park and the Neihu Science-Based Industrial Park on an
investment-soliciting trip next year to San Diego which houses many
giant computer companies.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he has confidence in Taipei's investment
environment, as Taipei not only offers tax incentives, it also offers
excellent trade, entertainment and leisure conditions.</P>
      <P>To create an environment more attractive to foreign businessmen,
he said that he had instructed the Department of Health to provide
assistance to Taipei American School which has been seeking to expand
the school grounds, as well as assisting those schools who cannot
recruit enough students to grow, and some bilingual primary schools
to help solve the education problem of the children of expatriate
businessmen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A cab driver was arrested Thursday
afternoon for trying to drive his taxi through a second guard station
at the Presidential Office, according to police.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Ai-ming, 47, who lives in Taichung City, central Taiwan,
was waved down by guards at the first entrance to the Presidential
Office when he followed a motorcade driving into the complex.</P>
      <P>However, he ignored the military police officers and drove
through the first entrance. Four guards came out to stop him at the
second gate.</P>
      <P>Exiting the car, the man told the guards that he wanted to appeal
to the president for help. The guards called in police to take him
away after finding two 600 c.c. bottles full of gasoline in the
vehicle.</P>
      <P>A police officer from the Chungsan Police Station, which is in
charge of the investigation, said the man seemed mentally unstable
and was unable to keep his account straight as to what exactly he
wanted from the president.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are beginning their investigations.</P>
      <P>This is the second time that a motorist has tried to storm into
the Presidential Office compound, which is located downtown.</P>
      <P>In June, a motorist with a record of mental illness breached the
Presidential Office gate after quarreling with his mother who was in
the car with him. He was stopped by guards and referred to
psychiatrists for treatment.</P>
      <P>The president's guards have been on heightened alert after a
truck driver rammed his truck loaded with containers of gasoline into
the building of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on
May 15. The truck was burned and the driver killed, but no other
damage or casualties ensued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai Jing-lung, a Taichung City councilor, said in
Taichung that Hsueh often came to his office asking for help. He
visited Tsai's office four of five times a week, complaining that his
wife was persecuting him, or that agents from the local office of the
Investigation Bureau were out to get him.</P>
      <P>Since Hsueh was unable to produce any evidence to support his
claims, the councilor said, he suggested that the man seek medical
help.</P>

      <P>All the relief goods donated by the ROC government and private
local groups will be delivered to Liberia in two weeks, Cummings
said, adding that there will be confirmation receipts to prove that
the relief goods are really distributed to needy people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Chung-ju, director of the African Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said ROC Ambassador
to Liberia Chen Yeo-chio is expected to return to the Liberian
capital of Monrovia before the Liberian transitional government
begins operations Oct. 14. Chen is now staying in neighboring Ivory
Coast as civil war in Liberia has yet to fully calm down.</P>
      <P>After Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, flew into exile
earlier this month, Lee said, Chen has offered felicitations to the
head and deputy head of Liberia's transitional government which will
replace its current interim government Oct. 14. The transitional
government will remain operational until January 2006, according to a
cease fire pact reached among Liberia's various warring factions.</P>
      <P>Barring unexpected developments, Lee said, Chen will leave Ivory
Coast for Monrovia before Liberia's transitional government becomes
operational.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
he has faith that he will win the presidential election next year,
and the faith has been further boosted by the prediction by a South
Korean veteran journalist that he will be re-elected.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a meeting with leaders of the Taiwan
Chambers of Commerce around the world.</P>
      <P>Though complaining about the chaos and rhetoric among the ruling
and opposition parties after the previous presidential election in
2000, Chen said he is prepared to fight.</P>
      <P>In the 2000 election, Chen of the Democratic Progressive Party
garnered 39.3 percent of the votes, James Soong of the People First
Party trailed with 36.8 percent, while Lien Chan of the Kuomintang
got 23.1 percent. Chen will face the two on a joint ticket in next
year's election.</P>
      <P>Chen also mentioned his earlier talks with South Korea's veteran
journalist Kim Young-oak, an influential people who got the first
exclusive interview with President Roh Moo-hyun in mid-April shortly
after Roh's election.</P>
      <P>In earlier talks with Kim, Chen told Kim that the road from
authoritarian rule to democracy is a correct one, and people should
treasure the value of democracy and let it be a part of daily live.</P>
      <P>Chen also made known the ROC's position of supporting a resolution
to the nuclear arms threat on the Korean Peninsula, expressing the
hope that the problems and disputes on the peninsula can be
peacefully resolved through dialogues.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agreement on the first port container
warehouse center joint venture between the government and the private
sector was forged Thursday, with Premier Yu Shyi-kun presiding over
the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Keelung Harbor Bureau Director Wang Chung-hsiung and Taipei Port
container warehouse corporation chairman Lin Hsing-san inked the
pact, while Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Ling-san
and Taipei County Magistrate Su Tseng-chang witnessed the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Yu hailed the accord on establishing the NT$20.33 billion
(US$589.3 million) container warehouse center at the Taipei Port --
the joint venture made on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model --
will help the port in northern Taipei County develop into a shipping
hub in the Asia-Pacific region, especially after Taiwan and mainland
China open direct transport links.</P>
      <P>Noting that the BOT joint venture will markedly strengthen the
partnership between the government and the private sector, Yu
stressed that the government will do its best to help participating
private companies reduce operational risks and increase their
profitability.</P>
      <P>Minister Lin said the investment from the shipping sector is
proof that domestic enterprises are willing to keep their roots at
home and make Taiwan their business operational hub.</P>
      <P>Lin added that an assessment made by his ministry shows that the
Taipei Port is suitable to be built into a free trade port zone and a
container transshipment center.</P>
      <P>Su said the 110-hectare Taipei Port, with a projected
accommodation of between 8,000 and 12,000 twenty-foot containers,
will help Kaohsiung Port in southern Taiwan deal with additional
containers, and do a lot to make Taiwan into a global business

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Thursday that reports saying that Afghanistan and Pakistan will refuse
to accept the new version of the Republic of China passport are not
true.</P>
      <P>Chin Jih-hsin, director of the Department of North American
Affairs, said that the MOFA had solicited the assistance of the
United States to verify the reports by asking the embassies of the
two countries in the U.S., both of which denied such was the case.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will continue to follow the matter and the U.S. has
promised to help.</P>
      <P>Even if the two countries refuse entry to holders of the new
version of the passport, the U.S. has promised to help with a
solution, Chin said.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Richard Shih said that new version of the
passport, which will display the word "Taiwan" in addition to the
official national designation of "the Republic of China" on its
cover, will be issued as scheduled on Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>He said that the new passport will enable customs officials of
other countries to better distinguish between citizens of Taiwan and
those from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the new version of the ROC passport is meant to
make customs clearance more convenient for Taiwan people when they

    <HEADLINE>AIT'S FEES FOR INFORMATION AND INTERVIEWS HAVE CONSUMERS SEEING RED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The coin has finally dropped for Taiwan
citizens wanting to get visas to the United States as complaints have
begun to flood in over the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) 's
policy of charging people additional money simply to call for
information, the ROC Consumers' Foundation said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>AIT, the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties, started charging people March 17 this year for
asking for information or reserving a visa interview -- rates of NT$8
to NT$15 (US$0.23 to US$0.44) per minute.</P>
      <P>Those seeking non-immigrant visas through AIT are required to use
the toll prefix 0204.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said in a news conference that a great many
Taiwan people apply for U.S. visas every year, and that statistics
released by AIT showed that Taiwan people have made around 200,000
non-immigrant visa applications on average each year over the past
decade.</P>
      <P>The officials said they have received calls from people who
complained that the application procedures are too complicated, and
that when they call AIT, they are required to use the toll prefix and
pay NT$8 per minute even when contacting the automated response
number and a whopping NT$15 to talk to the staff of the office.</P>
      <P>The officials said that if 200,000 people apply for U.S. visas
every year and they talk about three minutes over AIT phones at NT$10
per minute, this would translate to NT$6 million (US$175,428) per
year in toll call income.</P>
      <P>Compared with AIT's practice, the officials pointed out that
Japan's Interchange Association, the New Zealand Commerce and
Industry Office, and the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei, do not
charge extra for Inquiries or visa interview reservations. Also, the
U.S. Consular Office in Hong Kong allows people to make appointments
for interviews via the Net.</P>
      <P>Defending the move by AIT was Andrew Dickson, AIT's acting
spokesman at the Taipei office, who said that AIT has not gained from
the new system.</P>
      <P>Dickson said that if the new system is actually not workable, it
can be modified, but he added that the current setup was better than
the one that AIT had been using.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that there are two categories of fees: one for
application and visa fees, proceeds of which go to the U.S.
government, and the other for service fees, including calls and
appointments through toll calls. The toll call prefix system is being
operated by a Taiwan company, in this case, Chunghwa Telecom Co.,
which won the contract through an open bid, and AIT does not profit
from the pay call service, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the new system aims to cut the waiting time in long
lines and will provide better and faster service.</P>
      <P>He noted that since the implementation of the new system, waiting
times have been reduced.</P>
      <P>Moreover, detailed information on how to apply for a visa to the
United States and various particulars are found at AIT's Web site:

      <P>Taiwan car accessory-makers are in the

Taiwan-based companies are displaying their products at the largest
exhibition area of its kind in the city's world trade center.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan businessman surnamed Wang said Taiwan manufacturers have
been paying greater attention to the Russian market in recent years,
evidence that the number of this year's participating companies is
twice that of last year.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan products are popular and often seen in Russia,
Wang said most of the goods are indirectly imported from Germany,
Italy and Dubai. He said many participants from Taiwan are preparing
to take the opportunity to study the Russian market.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan-made car accessories are very suitable for Russian-made
cars because they are durable and easily replaced, Taiwan
manufacturers will try to contact leading car makers while in Moscow,

    <HEADLINE>MAC SLAMS BEIJING FOR RELUCTANCE TO STEM CROSS-STRAIT HUMAN SMUGGLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
Beijing Thursday to consult with Taiwan on issues regarding the
drowning of six mainland Chinese women off the coast of Taiwan
earlier this week while trying to enter the island illegally.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tong said the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) should
contact Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) as soon as
possible to help families of the drowned women handle relevant
affairs.</P>
      <P>"No matter how mainland authorities are indifferent about their
people's human rights and well-being, they cannot adopt a hands-off
attitude toward this incident," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Human traffickers, commonly known as "snakeheads, " threw 26
mainland Chinese women overboard early on Tuesday near Tunghsiao in
Miaoli County to escape pursuing Taiwan coast guard ships, which
resulted in the drowning of six of the women. All of them were young
women lured into going to Taiwan with offers of lucrative work.</P>
      <P>Since the six women died, Chen said, the quasi-official SEF has
twice informed ARATS of the tragic incident. However, ARATS has not
made any response. ARATS has instead tried to seek the assistance of
other Taiwan private groups in handling relevant affairs.</P>
      <P>At this moment, Chen said, ARATS should drop all political
considerations and cooperate with the SEF in assisting the families
of the drowned mainland women in handling the aftermath.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said mainland China has often failed to abide by the 1990
Kinmen Agreement regarding repatriation of illegal mainland
immigrants to Taiwan. As a result, he said, Taiwan's three detention
centers have often been jammed with illegal mainland immigrants,
posing a big financial burden to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chen said, mainland China has declined to negotiate
with Taiwan on cooperation in preventing cross-strait human
trafficking and other criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Noting that the steady stream of illegal mainland immigrants has
threatened Taiwan's public order and social stability, Chen said
mainland China should not continue turning a blind eye to the human
smuggling issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC government condemned the brutality of human
traffickers immediately after the incident and that four suspects
involving in pushing mainland women overboard have been detained on
charges of homicide.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday that although the human
traffickers, boat owners and pimps should be blamed for the incident,
the authorities in Beijing should take most of the responsibility.
His remarks drew a backlash from ARATS which claimed that Taiwan's
leader was disseminating absurd comments. "And this was extremely
inhuman, " ARATS said in a statement carried by Beijing's state-owned
Xinhua News Agency late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Ming-tong said Beijing should face up to the
cross-strait human trafficking issues instead of criticizing the
ROC's leader.</P>
      <P>"ARATS' comments symbolized Beijing's attempt to dodge its
responsibility to crack down on cross-strait human smuggling, " Chen
said, adding that such an irresponsible attitude will hinder
normalization of cross-strait ties.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian watched
over an anti-terrorism drill Thursday at a petrochemical complex in
southern Taiwan and hailed the skillful techniques employed.</P>
      <P>The drill is part of a series of "Wan-An" defense exercises to be

the annual "Wan-An" defense exercises have focused on anti-terrorism
operations in 26 years.</P>
      <P>Thursday's drill was held at the Formosa Plastics Group's
petrochemical complex in Mailiao, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the United
States totally changed people's understanding about forms of war.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical complex, an important industrial base in
Taiwan, is a possible target of terrorist attacks and is
strategically important in war time, Chen said, pointing to the
reason why the drill was being held here.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that it will be the priority work for the
government to integrate various emergency task forces in the country
to form a more sufficient security net against attacks or natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>He said that Yunlin County Government's performance in the drill
can serve as a model for other cities and counties in fighting
against terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>Similar anti-terrorist drills will be held in northern areas
Friday, and in central and southern Taiwan in mid and late October.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUNGSHAN AIRPORT NOT SUITABLE FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT LINKS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Sungshan Airport was not included by
the central government to serve direct transportation links between
Taiwan and mainland China mainly because of its insufficient
facilities and capabilities, a government official in charge of
mainland Chinese affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) , Taiwan's top policy-planning agency toward</P>
      <P>mainland China, made the remarks following an MAC meeting in
response to the Taipei City Government's dissatisfaction about the
issue.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics to support his argument, Chen said Sungshan
Airport was not selected to conduct direct transport links across the
Taiwan Strait as a result of its lack of sufficient runways, aprons
and cargo and passenger transshipment capabilities.</P>
      <P>Sungshan Airport only has a runway of 2,605 meters, which Chen
said is unable to accommodate 747 airplanes, making it impossible for
the airport to conduct international cargo and passenger
transshipment services.</P>
      <P>As the airport lacks adequate facilities to operate international
transshipment business, it was excluded from the central government's
initial direct transportation program with mainland China out of
consideration of operation costs, he noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, he pointed out that a no-fly regulation from 11: 00
p. m. until 6: 00 a. m. the next day imposed at Sungshan Airport to
reduce noise for residents in the neighborhood adds greater
inconvenience for it to open direct cross-strait transport links.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government issued Tuesday an assessment about the
negative effects of the MAC's failure to list Sungshan Airport in its
direct cross-strait transportation program along with Chiang Kai-shek
(CKS) International Airport in neighboring Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Municipal spokesman Wu Yu-sheng claimed that Sungshan Airport in
Taipei is the only suitable option to allow Taiwan businessmen to
travel between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait within just one
day.</P>
      <P>To combine Sungshan Airport and the CKS Airport will much better
serve Taiwan's business interests, as Taipei is the headquarters of
many international multinationals and leading domestic business
groups, Wu said, adding that the Taipei City Government will continue
seeking to persuade the central government to allow Taipei Sungshan
Airport to serve direct air travel links across the strait.</P>

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) member
Trong Chai resigned his post as chairman of the Formosa Television
Company Thursday in line with DPP Chairman Chen Shui-bian's call for
freeing the media from the grip of political parties, government and
the military.</P>
      <P>His post was taken over by Tien Tsai-ting, the vice chairman of

      <P>Chai, who founded the Formosa Television Company in 1997, said
at a ceremony to mark the change of chief executive officer that the
company is the island's fourth and first private terrestrial

belongs to the people.</P>
      <P>Claiming that he had devoted his whole life to fighting for a

    <HEADLINE>NEW ROC PASSPORTS WILL WORK IN U.S. AS NORMAL AS BEFORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 28 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government said Thursday that
the issuance of the new version of the Republic of China passport
from Sept. 1 will not affect Taiwan citizens' travel to the United
States, and that it is not a question of whether the United States
recognizes it or not.</P>
      <P>In response to a question from a CNA reporter, a U.S. State
Department official said that Taiwan has reiterated that the new
version of the passport is purely for the purpose of making it more
distinguishable from the passport issued by the People's Republic of
China and that it by no means represents that the ROC's policies have
changed in any way.</P>
      <P>The new version of the passport, which will display the word
"Taiwan" in addition to the official national designation of "the
Republic of China" on its cover, will not have any impact on the
United States' "one China" policy, the official said.</P>
      <P>The new ROC passport will not affect how the United States deals
with travel to the country by Taiwan citizens or their travel
documents, the official added.</P>
      <P>The official noted that Taiwan has been talking about the
issuance of a new version of its passport since last year and that it
is a decision for Taiwan alone to make.</P>
      <P>The new version of the passport will be issued from Sept. 1 as
scheduled despite claims by mainland China's official media that some
countries will refuse to accept the new version, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Richard Shih said earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the purpose of adding the word "Taiwan" is to help
customs officials of other countries better distinguish between
citizens from Taiwan and those from mainland China. He said the move
is meant to make customs clearance more convenient for Taiwan people
when they travel to other countries.</P>
      <P>He said that other than the addition of the word "Taiwan, " the
new version of the passport is completely the same as the current
version, stressing that as an independent sovereign state, the ROC
has the right to issue passports.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that following communications with other countries
regarding the issue, major countries, including Japan, the United
States and the member states of the European Union, have expressed
their intention to work with the new version of the passport.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM ASKS FOR SPEEDY ESTABLISHMENT OF IMMIGRATION ADMINISTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
problem of illegal mainland Chinese immigrants is serious and that it
is necessary to set up an immigration administration.</P>
      <P>The premier said that "the rising number of illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants will affect the quality of life of the 23 million
people of Taiwan as well as social order," adding that "the problem
has to be dealt with cautiously."</P>
      <P>He said that "it is necessary to set up an immigration
administration, and the pace has to be quickened, " adding that he
has instructed Minister without Portfolio Yeh Chun-jung to take
charge of the coordination work among the various government agencies
concerning the draft organization bill of the immigration
administration.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the review of the immigration administration draft
bill is expected to be completed by Sep. 4 and that the bill will
then be sent to the Legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>If the draft bill is passed into law, the Bureau of Immigration
will be expanded to include several units currently under the
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, as well as the National Police
Administration's foreign police unit, and other related
organizations. It's functions will also be adjusted.</P>
      <P>He said that major business of the immigration administration
will be passport checking and verification of passengers arriving via
international air or sea routes, as well as interviewing immigrants
before they come to Taiwan, and providing counseling services for
arriving immigrants.</P>
      <P>The problem of illegal immigrants was brought into focus recently
with the tragic drowning deaths of six out of a group of 26 mainland
Chinese women who attempted to enter Taiwan illegally earlier this
week.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said that the Executive Yuan had
originally wanted to have the Cabinet organization adjustment bill to
go hand in hand with the immigration administration organization
bill, but due to the urgency of the illegal immigrant problem, MAC
Chairman Tsai Ing-wen and Interior Minister Yu Cheng-hsien had asked
the premier to delink the two so that the immigration administration
organization bill can be legislated as soon as possible.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) on Friday blasted a campaign launched by the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and its ally People First Party (PFP) , saying that
the campaign aims to bring the chaos in the Legislature out onto the
street.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, DPP vice secretary-general, made the remarks in
the wake of an announcement by the KMT Taipei branch that the KMT and
the PFP would set up pavilions around Taipei to solicit 1 million
signatures nationwide to express opposition to high tuitions, the
dual hikes in health insurance fees, and high unemployment. The
campaign is set to run through Sep. 4.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the KMT and the PFP aim to bring the reckless
practice of "random boycotts, random increases and random smearing"
in the Legislature out onto the streets.</P>
      <P>He said that it is not important how many signatures one can
collect, stressing that "what counts is policy."</P>
      <P>Lee said that the DPP was a responsible opposition party before
it came to power in 2000, pointing out that whenever it voiced
opposition to a certain policy, it would state its position and put
forward its own alternative policy.</P>
      <P>He asked whether the KMT, if it opposes high tuitions, wants
colleges or universities to close. He added that the KMT tried to put
through an increase in subsidies to senior citizens and college
students in the Legislature without success and that it has therefore
resorted to what he called the smear campaign.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that unemployment is a global problem and that
Taiwan's unemployment is not so serious compared with that of other
countries and regions.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP has addressed the problem squarely, adding
that he hopes that the KMT would come up with substantive suggestions
and alternative measures instead of scaring away investors at a time
when Taiwan's economy is on the road to rebound.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT LINKS WILL ENCOURAGE MORE FIRMS TO KEEP ROOTS IN TAIWAN: CHIANG</HEADLINE>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When direct transportation links between
Taiwan and the Chinese mainland are realized and the inconvenience of
cross-strait travel is reduced, Taiwan businesspeople will have more
of a reason to keep their roots in Taiwan, the deputy speaker of the
Legislature said Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar co-sponsored by IBM Taiwan and the Taiwan
Academy of Banking and Finance, P.K. Chiang said that when more
Taiwan businesses choose to stay in Taiwan, the pace of business
relocations to the Chinese mainland will slow down.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that while the timetable for the
implementation of direct transportation links remains a major concern
of foreign businesses investing in Taiwan, international corporations
also expect that the government will improve its administrative
efficiency and be precise in drafting and implementing laws and
regulations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the former economics minister stressed that at a time
of low profit margins, there are too many banking institutions
competing in too small a market in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that Taiwan's market can accommodate no more than 10
financial management companies, Chiang said that the banking
institutions could improve their competitiveness through mergers.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said that the most serious risk facing local banking
institutions remains the tremendous amount of non-performing loans.
Only when this problem is properly handled, will normal operations of
the banking system be possible, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to local banks' services to Taiwan companies on the
mainland, Chiang said that although several banks have set up liason
offices on the mainland, they are not allowed to open branches there.
The Taiwan banks expect that the mainland Chinese authorities will
open the mainland's financial and service markets, Chiang said.</P>

      <P>An illegal mainland Chinese immigrant who
has lived in Taiwan for 12 years under a false identity was finally
nabbed Thursday by Miaoli police.</P>
      <P>Ouyang Zhixiang, 31, a native of Shanghai, sneaked into Taiwan in
1991 after paying a "snake head" ring some 100,000 renminbi
(US$12,077) . After arriving in Taiwan, Ouyang obtained a stolen

Police Department.</P>
      <P>From that time, Ouyang worked at several small-scale factories in

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN FIRMS: DEREGULATION VITAL TO TAIWAN'S INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>International corporations investing in
Taiwan suggest that transparency and simple laws and regulations are
vital to the improvement of Taiwan's investment environment.</P>
      <P>Nearly half of the foreign companies in Taiwan answering a
questionnaire on the island's investment environment were not
satisfied with the administration's performance in processing
investment applications, and 45 percent said that the existing
taxation system and administrative regulations have confined their
operations and business growth.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Chinese-language magazine Global
Views Monthly among members of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taiwan, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei, and some companies
listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>According to the survey report, 68.5 percent of the companies
replying to the questionnaire suggest that deregulation is of top
priority in order to improve Taiwan's investment environment; 63.7
percent consider an early realization of cross-strait direct
transportation links most important; and 55.6 percent say that the
government should first improve its administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Regarding the attractiveness to international corporations,
mainland China tops the list in luring foreign investments, followed
by Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and
Thailand in that order.</P>
      <P>The international corporations point out that Taiwan maintains
the advantages of having well-educated, qualified manpower and being
geographically adjacent to mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>As to the most potential sectors, the international corporations
say that Taiwan's computer, electronics, telecommunications and
biotechnology industries as well as the monetary sector are most
favored by foreign investors.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is ripe for Taiwan and Japan to
enhance exchanges since mainland China's new leadership has moved
away from its previous harsh attitude toward the two countries, Hsu
Shui-teh, chairman of the quasi-official Association of East Asian
Relations, said Friday</P>
      <P>Hsu said in a recent interview with the Japanese daily Sankei
Shimbun that recently elected Chinese president Hu Jintao's focus
away from Taiwan and Japan will allow the two nations to better
interact with each other.</P>
      <P>The Association of East Asian Relations was established in Taipei
to deal with Japanese affairs on behalf of the ROC government in the
absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the youth of the two nations should be harnessed to
strengthen exchanges.</P>
      <P>In line with this, the ROC Ministry of Education in conjunction
with the association will send a delegation of several presidents of
junior and senior high schools to Japan Sept. 8-12.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation are expected to visit Fukuoka, Sendai
and Sapporo to discuss with Japanese educators the possibility of
exchanging graduation tours of senior high school students of both
countries.</P>
      <P>Also noting that Beijing's criticism of Japanese Primer Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine to honor the war
dead is only an expression of a long-term stance, Hsu stressed that
Koizumi was acting in the best interests of Japan.</P>
      <P>Hsu also maintained that the confrontational situation between
Taiwan and mainland China is on the wane.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged Japan to be more open to global changes and increase

    <HEADLINE>SEF HEAD BLAMES BEIJING FOR TAIWAN'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should be blamed for the
drowning of six illegal mainland immigrants off the coast of Taiwan
because it severed contact with Taiwan for political reasons which
led to the problem, Shi Hwei-yow, secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan, Shi said although
the problem lies in the mainland's failure to prevent its people from
venturing into Taiwan illegally, Taiwan is left to hold the bag. It
has to accommodate these illegal immigrants caught in Taiwan, house
them in detention centers waiting for repatriation, and compensate
those who have died accidentally.</P>
      <P>The problem is worsening because Beijing stopped exchanges
between its Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and
the SEF, and stopped cooperating with Taiwan to combat
people-smuggling operations, Shi said. Beijing has also turned its
back on efforts to speed and streamline the repatriation of illegal
immigrants, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing stopped all contacts with Taiwan in 1999 to protest what
it claims was Taiwan's retreat from a consensus that both Taiwan and
the mainland belong to one China.</P>
      <P>Shi said Beijing should at least resume dialogue with Taiwan to
 speed up the two sides' efforts to stop illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>At the same hearing, Su You-cheng, a human rights adviser to the
president, suggested that local authorities do not do all they can to
keep illegal immigrants from landing on the island.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are no more than 10 beaches in Taiwan where
illegal immigrants could land, Su wondered why the country's law
enforcers and armed forces are unable to keep a close watch on these
sites and prevent illegal immigrants from approaching the beaches.</P>
      <P>The hearing was organized after six female illegal immigrants
were drown off the coast of Tunghsiao, Miali County Tuesday. They
were pushed into sea by local people-smugglers after the smugglers
found they were being followed by coast guard patrol boats.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the six immigrants were stored in the morgue of
Tachia Crematorium in Taichung County Friday.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng went to Taichung to
collect forensic evidence of the women, including photographs. This
information will be sent to the mainland in an attempt to identify
the deceased.</P>
      <P>Jan said the SEF will help the victims' family members to come to
Taiwan to claim the bodies. In case no one come to claim them, the
bodies will be cremated and the remains sent back to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that many illegal immigrants from the mainland are caught
in Taiwan, Jan said the current repatriation rate, 150 persons per
month, is too slow. Beijing should step up its operations to take
back its people.</P>
      <P>It is inhuman to keep these illegal immigrants in Taiwan's
detention centers for months or even years waiting repatriation, Jan
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAN BE IMPROVED: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that to
increase local governments' capability in anti-terrorism, emergency
response and disaster relief operations is one of his Cabinet's
priorities.</P>
      <P>Inspecting the annual civil defense drill "Wan An" No. 26 in
Taipei City, Yu said that the government should not lower its guard
against any possible threat to national security.</P>
      <P>Citing the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States in
2001 and a series of terrorist explosions afterward around the world
as examples, Yu said that the threat to national security of a
country can come in various forms.</P>
      <P>The exercise, which was conducted in two phases, started at 1: 30
p.m. and ended at 4: 30 p.m. The first phase of the exercise, which
lasted for 30 minutes, was focused on a simulation of dispersing
people and vehicles and the second phase was centered on disaster
relief operations.</P>
      <P>In metropolitan Taipei, the second phase of the drill featured
rescuing hostages held by terrorists at the Shin Kong Building -- a
skyscraper near the Taiwan Railway Station in downtown Taipei and
handling explosives supposedly hidden there as well as a simulated
poison gas attack on the city's mass rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>The exercise was staged simultaneously in Taipei city and county,
Keelung City, Taoyuan County and Hsinchu city and county with the
participation of the related local governments and 117 public
agencies and private groups in northern Taiwan. It was described by
government officials as successful.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the exercise is a valuable reference for the
government in integrating all security and emergency management
operations in response to attacks from hostile forces.</P>
      <P>Similar anti-terrorist, anti-sabotage and anti-abduction drills
at selected public places and facilities in central, southern and
eastern Taiwan as well as on the frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matsu will be conducted from mid-October through the end of that
month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY WARNS ABOUT BEIJING'S MILITARY BUILDUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
warned Friday that Beijing's military buildup could pose a threat to
Taiwan after 2008 if Taiwan fails to upgrade its armed forces's
combat capability by then.</P>
      <P>In its first annual report on Beijing's military strength, the
MND said Beijing's armed forces are much larger than Taiwan's, and
its recent economic development gives Beijing the means to upgrade
its weapons systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has acquired advanced Russian-made Sukhoi jet
fighters, new destroyers, Kilo-class submarines, and ship-to-ship
SS-N-22 Sunburn missiles, the report said the capability of Beijing's
armed forces are significantly improved with these new weapons in its
arsenal.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Beijing has deployed more than 100 strategic
ballistic missiles, in addition to 400 regular missiles, and is
upgrading their precision by directing them at targets through
Beijing's own global position system. All of the missiles are
positioned in bases where they can bring Taiwan within their ranges.</P>
      <P>Also, there are 1,000 jet fighters posted in bases within a
radius of 600 miles from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This development has shortened the time Taiwan will have to react
after learning of an attack, and has brought within its striking
range U.S. military bases in Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>However, this won't tip the military balance across the Taiwan
Strait before 2008, thanks to the advanced weapons Taiwan obtained in
the last few years.</P>
      <P>The situation could change after 2008, unless the country's armed
forces can successfully boost its combat capability before then. That
means the likelihood that Beijing could attack Taiwan with force is
slim before 2008.</P>
      <P>Beijing's defense budget has increased by an unprecedented 9.6
percent this year, or the highest rate in the world, not counting its
secret military spending which is usually three or four times the
public defense budget, the report said.</P>
      <P>There are three potential crises between Taiwan and mainland
China: their conflicting views about "one China, " the disparity
between their military forces, and the lack of trust with each other,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the ministry said, it cannot rule out the possibility
that military conflicts might break out accidentally because of small
friction or miscalculations.</P>
      <P>The report was presented to the Legislative Yuan along with the
2004 defense budget which revealed the country's armed forces are
working closely with neighboring states, contrary to the country's
diplomatic isolation. The armed forces will join several foreign
military drills.</P>
      <P>Notably among them is a U.S. Air Force exercise whereby the ROC
Air Force will send an eight-member delegation to observe.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy will sent observers to three U.S. Naval exercises,
in addition to sending 864 officers to the United States to undergo
training to operate the Kidd-class destroyers, of which four will be
sold to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC Army will also send a team to the United States to
undergo training for helicopter night bombing.</P>
      <P>These military exchanges were not the first of their kinds but
were made public for the first time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WTO RESEARCH CENTER TO BE INAUGURATED SEPT. 8</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will inaugurate a World Trade
Organization (WTO) research center Sept. 8 to draft various
initiatives to be presented to the world trade regulatory body,
Cabinet sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The new think tank will be managed by the Chung-Hua Institution
for Economic Research (CHIER) at the request of the ROC government,
the sources said, adding that all relevant government agencies will
jointly finance the new center.</P>
      <P>In addition to initiating proposals to be referred to formal WTO
conferences for discussion, the center will also offer legal
counseling and assist the government in handling trade disputes under
the WTO framework and in cultivating human resources.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan became a WTO member, the sources said, the
government has been mulling over how to more actively participate in
WTO activities and how to more effectively cope with the impact of
trade liberalization in the wake of the island's WTO accession.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the sources said, WTO negotiations have evolved from
bilateral consultations on market opening issues to multilateral
talks on complicated, dynamic regional economic integration
topics.</P>
      <P>The new research center is expected to help the government craft
innovative, forward-looking strategies to sustain Taiwan's market
niches in the international trade and economic arenas, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>CHIER President Chen Tien-chih said the WTO research center will
be staffed by scores of international trade and legal experts from
the CHIER and other domestic think tanks and local universities.</P>
      <P>On the new research center's inaugural day, Chen said, a special
WTO databank will be posted on the Internet, which will be connected
to the WTO's official Web site, while a WTO library will also be
inaugurated to offer more information services.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said, the CHIER will organize a WTO retrospective
show on that day, which will exhibit documents, graphics and photos
featuring Taiwan's decade-long effort to join the WTO and its
achievements in trade liberalization and economic globalization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN TO CALL FOR DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIWAN: FAPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Aug. 29 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-Fla.) is
expected to urge the U.S. government to establish diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, the Formosan Association for Public Affairs
(FAPA) said in a press release Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the press release, the congressman sent to the FAPA
Friday a copy of a statement which he will present in the upcoming
session of Congress. In the statement, Deutsch urges the U.S.
government to diplomatically recognize what he calls the sovereign
country of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Deutsch will urge President George W. Bush to fulfill what his
father strived for when he was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations
in the early 1970s - namely representation of both Taipei and Beijing
in the United Nations, Taiwan's participation in world organizations,
and U.S. diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, according to the FAPA.</P>
      <P>The congressman stresses in the statement that the U.S.
government should recognize Taiwan as an independent and sovereign
country, and as a democratic ally in the global fight against
terrorism.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China, a U.N. founding member, was excluded from
the organization in 1971 after the General Assembly passed U.N.
Resolution No. 2758 which gave the China seat to Beijing at the
expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Deutsch says in the statement that this decision produced an
extremely unfair situation, depriving the Taiwan people of their
representation in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The pro-Taiwan Deutsch is most appreciated by the Taiwan people
for his successful efforts in 1994 with other congressmen in pushing
to give Taiwanese-American citizens the right to choose "Taiwan" for
their place of birth in their passports.</P>
      <P>Before 1994, the U.S. government used the designation "China" for
place of birth for naturalized citizens from both Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>FAFA President Wu Ming-chi said that although the establishment
of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and the United States will be
a hard task to accomplish, Deutsch's statement at least represents a
beginning for the U.S. Congress in reviewing this issue which Wu said
is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Wu went on that complicated historical factors have resulted in
Taiwan losing many diplomatic allies and consequently its
representation in the United Nations and other major international
organizations.</P>
      <P>He noted that the United States' decision to break off formal
diplomatic ties with Taipei in 1979 produced a domino effect among
other countries, adding that he believes that if Washington
reestablishes formal diplomatic relations with Taipei, other
countries will follow suit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAILS RESTORATION OF CRITICAL PASSWAY IN SCENIC SHANLINHSI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Taiwan,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Saturday that he is very happy to see the restoration of the Anting
Bay tunnel -- the sole connecting pass between Nantou County's two
popular mountain resorts of Hsitou and Shanlinhsi in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing an inaugural ceremony for the new tunnel, Chen said he
still remembers the distress he felt when he first saw the seriously
damaged Anting Bay tunnel more than three years ago.</P>
      <P>The tunnel tumbled in the devastating magnitude 7.3 earthquake
that rattled Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999. Military servicemen managed to
repair it a year later, but it was heavily damaged again in July 2001
when Typhoon Toraji swept across the island.</P>
      <P>The collapse of this only connecting pass between Hsitou and
Shanlinhsi dealt a severe blow to the local tourist industry, Chen
said, adding that he has made four visits to the construction site
over the past four years.</P>
      <P>"I felt a bit of comfort only after I saw during my visit this
May that the boring work on the tunnel had been completed, " Chen
recalled, adding that he appreciates the concerted efforts of the
relevant government agencies and private contractors in completing
the difficult construction project ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>The project was originally scheduled for completion in October
2004. Thanks to the exceptional efficiency demonstrated by the
relevant government agencies and private contractors in carrying out
bidding and construction work, the project was completed more than a
year ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Many senior officials, including Minister of Transportation and
Communications Lin Ling-san, Public Construction Commission
Chairwoman Kuo Yao-chi and Nantou County Magistrate Lin Chung-nan,
attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, Chen joined with 12 local couples who have
been married for more than 60 years in walking through the tunnel in
celebration of its restoration.</P>
      <P>In tandem with the inauguration of the new tunnel, the Shanlinhsi
recreational park, which boasts the island's only peony garden, as
well as centuries-old trees, interestingly designed wooden houses and
tourist hotels, was also re-opened to the public Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND VOWS TO BUILD UP ELITE FORCE TO COPE WITH MAINLAND THREAT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will build up an elite deterrent
force to cope with the mounting military threat from mainland China,
Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tang said at a news conference that the ROC military will upgrade
its overall defense capabilities through a structural overhaul, as
well as refinement of manpower quality, renovation of its arsenal,
and upgrading of combined services combat operations.</P>
      <P>"We must focus on quality refinement because we cannot afford to
engage in an arms race with mainland China, " Tang said, adding that
the ROC military has drafted its military buildup plan in reference
to mainland China's combat strength.</P>
      <P>Tang said mainland China has officially set aside US$22.3 billion
for its defense budget for 2004. But according to estimates by major
military powers around the world, Tang said, the actual amount of
mainland China's spending on defense for 2004 should reach US$65
billion. In contrast, he said, Taiwan's annual defense budget is
below US$8 billion.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Tang said, Taiwan must upgrade its combat
prowess through manpower restructuring and quality refinement.</P>
      <P>Tang said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has come up with
a 10-year troops-reduction plan which will be carried out in two
phases.</P>
      <P>In the first stage, from 2003 through 2007, Tang said, the total
number of ROC troops will be cut by 45,000 through integration of
military units and strengthening of combined services combat
operations.</P>
      <P>The second phase of the reduction plan will be carried out from
2008 through 2012, during which time the military will trim personnel
by a further 40,000.</P>
      <P>Tang said the second phase will focus on military transformation
and an upgrading of Taiwan's deterrent force.</P>
      <P>By 2012, Tang said, the number of service members will be trimmed
to 300,000. He further said that ground forces will account for 75
percent of all the military personnel to be cut.</P>
      <P>"We hope to upgrade manpower quality through restructuring of the
service branches," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>75% OF WORKERS THINK THEY ARE OVERWORKED: INTERNET SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the job market remaining tight, some
75 percent of workers in Taiwan think that they are overworked,
according to the results of an Internet survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, conducted by Cheers magazine and udnjob.com
between Aug. 7-13, 30 percent of the respondents said they work for
more than 62 hours in a week, 20 hours more than the maximum legal
number of weekly working hours set by the government. And more than
one-quarter of the polled said they often work on their off days.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Council for
Labor Affairs in July last year, only 11.3 percent of Taiwan
businesses have overtime, with the average overtime for employees of
these companies being 5.32 hours per week, or about one hour a day.</P>
      <P>However, the results of Saturday's poll indicate that the results
of the Council for Labor Affairs survey may be far from the actual
situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Broken down by job description, workers in the research and
development field work the most overtime, with 42.9 percent of them
working more than 20 hours of overtime per week and 20.3 percent
working more than 30 hours of overtime per week, according to the
Internet poll.</P>
      <P>The survey also indicated that many workers in Taiwan feel that
increasing their competitiveness and actively taking on more
responsibilities at work are keys to survival in the new industrial
structure. The poll found that the fear of being laid off is the main
factor behind their situation of being overworked.</P>
      <P>A total of 72.3 percent said they spend part of their leisure
time studying or receiving training to improve their professional
skills, while a minority of those surveyed said they have opted for
other activities in their leisure time in order to enjoy a balanced
life.</P>
      <P>Although overworked, most of the surveyed said they think the
situation will not change in the short term, with only 35.5 percent
saying they think the situation will improve within one year. Another
35.1 percent said they think the situation will improve only after
five years.</P>
      <P>Although somewhat pessimistic about the future, most of the
workers are actively trying to find a solution to their overworked
lives, with a majority of the respondents mentioning that working at
a job they like or strengthening their professional skills to make
themselves more indispensable are the best ways to accomplish this.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,383 valid responses were collected in the Internet
survey.</P>

didn't help.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN INVESTORS WANT GREATER POLICY TRANSPARENCY: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Simplified and transparent
investment policy and regulations are one of the most urgent
tasks for the ROC government to lure foreign investors, according
to the results of an opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by a local magazine "GlobalView"
from Aug. 7-15. The monthly magazine distributed 619
questionnaires to members of the American and European chambers
of commerce in Taipei and collected 124 valid replies for an about 20
percent return rate.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 48.4 percent of the respondents were
dissatisfied with the ROC government's overall performance in dealing
with investment affairs.</P>
      <P>Asked what Taiwan should do to improve its investment climate,
68.5 percent cited "simplified and transparent policy and
regulations"; 63.7 percent singled out "the opening of
direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait"; and 55.6
percent said "upgrading of government efficiency."</P>
      <P>Poll results showed that mainland China is the most attractive
investment destination in Asia, while Taiwan and South Korea tie
at second place; followed by Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand
and Malaysia in that order.</P>
      <P>The respondents said South Korea has clear and consistent
investment policy and has adopted a series of bold financial reform
steps since the 19978-98 Asian financial crisis. These were
reasons that South Korea becomes more attractive than Singapore
and Hong Kong as an investment destination, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>If direct cross-strait air and shipping links cannot be forged in
the next two years, 19.4 percent said they will trim their presence
in Taiwan, but 66.1 percent said they will not change their current
operational scales.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's advantages in attracting foreign investors, 62.9
percent cited "manpower quality"; 50 percent said "geographical
location"; and 37.9 percent said "market scale".</P>
      <P>Computer and electronics products topped the list of
Taiwan's most promising industries cited by foreign investors (82.3
percent); followed by telecommunications equipment (52.4 percent);
financial and investment services (49.2 percent.)</P>
      <P>According to government tallies, foreign investments in Taiwan
have continued falling in the past three years. Accumulated foreign
investments in Taiwan in the first half of this year amounted to
US$1.45 billion, less than half of last year's total of US$3.22
billion.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a GlobalView-sponsored seminar whereby the
poll results were unveiled, Andrea W. Wu, vice president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, said politics should not
interfere with economic operations. Otherwise, she said, foreign
investors will become reluctant to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Even though the opening of direct cross-strait transportation
links is not an essential condition for foreigners to invest in
Taiwan, Wu said, such links will certainly help enhance Taiwan's
appeal to would-be foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu said, Taiwan's government should further improve its
operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Dirk Sanger, president of the European Chamber of Commerce
Taipei, seconded Wu's views, saying that political interference
should be minimized in order to attract foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Noting that market predictability is most critical in luring
foreign investors, Sanger said the Taiwan government must give
priority to forging a clear and transparent legal framework and
effectively enforce all relevant regulations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES CONFERENCE TO BE HELD SEPT. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national water resources conference will
be held Sept. 1 to chart the nation's future water resources
development policy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shen-hsien, director of the MOEA's Water Resources Agency
(WRA), said the agenda will also include issues regarding water price
adjustments.</P>
      <P>The conference is expected to reach a conclusion on raising
domestic water prices, Chen said, adding that an upward adjustment
is necessary to stimulate development of water resources industry and
encourage local people to cut water consumption.</P>
      <P>As domestic water prices have traditionally remained at low
levels, Chen said, few local enterprises are interested in
investing in desalination and commercial utilization
of deep-sea water. Low prices have also made local people indifferent
with water conservation, he added.</P>
      <P>Because of abnormal climatic changes, Chen said Taiwan
has been gripped by water shortage problems in recent years. "We must
address water supply issues by reviewing and adjusting
our water pricing formula to encourage water conservation
and investment in exploration of water resources," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, WRA officials said they don't think that the
proposed water price hikes are likely to be implemented before next
year's presidential election. "Political factors will hinder
upward adjustment of water prices before the presidential election,"
predicted a WRA official who preferred anonymity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, WRA officials said the conclusions reached at the
upcoming conference will serve as reference for the government to
draft a white paper on water resources development and relevant
policy guidelines.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
consider opening Taipei's Sungshan Airport for direct cross-Taiwan
Strait flight service only after mainland China renounces its attempt
to use force against Taiwan, a senior official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Tang Yiau-min said at a news conference that the
MND's insistence on ruling out Sungshan Airport for direct
cross-strait flight service is purely based on national security
consideration and has nothing to do with political consideration.</P>
      <P>According to a newly released evaluation report on the impact of
opening direct cross-strait transportation links, the Cabinet singles
out Chiang Kai-shek International Airport and Kaohsiung International
Airport as the first two airports that may be opened for direct
cross-strait flight service. However, the Taipei City Government has
been pushing for including Sunghsan Airport for such service.</P>
      <P>Tang said mainland China has deployed 500 guided ballistic
missiles along its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan in addition to
deploying many troops in its coastal region and conducting
large-scale military exercises in the area regularly.</P>
      <P>In the face of mainland China's mounting military threat, Tang
said, the MND cannot agree to the Taipei City Government's proposal
out of security concern.</P>
      <P>"The safety of the 23 million people of Taiwan is our top concern
in dealing with the issue," Tang said, adding that unless mainland
China dismantles its missiles targeting at Taiwan and forsakes its
attempt to take Taiwan by force, the MND will not consider adjusting
its position.</P>

    <HEADLINE>40 ILLEGAL MAINLAND IMMIGRANTS SENT TO MATSU FOR REPATRIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Matsu, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 40-member group of illegal mainland
Chinese immigrants, including 35 women and five infants, were sent to
the ROC-held frontline island of Matsu Saturday for repatriation to
mainland China next week.</P>
      <P>The illegal immigrants who were originally detained at the
Hsinchu detention center in northern Taiwan arrived in Matsu
early in the morning via ship.</P>
      <P>The steady stream of illegal mainland immigrants has posed a
financial burden and serious social problems to Taiwan. Mainland
China's reluctance to take back seized illegal immigrants
has left Taiwan's three detention centers often jammed
with illegals.</P>
      <P>Its inaction to punish human traffickers has also led
to deterioration of cross-Taiwan Strait human trafficking. Last week,
26 mainland women were thrown overboard by human smugglers to
escape pursuing Taiwan coast guard ships and six of them drowned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YU ASKS FIVE MINISTRIES TO CONDUCT DAILY PRESS MEETING</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has asked the heads of
five ministries Sunday to preside over a press meeting each morning
from next week to "keep society and the media informed."</P>
      <P>Yu asked the Ministries of education, interior, economic affairs
and transportation and communications, as well as the Council of
Agriculture late last week to convene a daily meeting every morning
to review major events and issues in society and facilitate
interactions and understanding with the media.</P>
      <P>Yu's directive came in the wake of remarks made by President Chen

      <P>Since three other Cabinet agencies -- the Ministry of National
Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Council of Mainland
Affairs -- have long conducted regular press conferences to

    <HEADLINE>BANK EXECUTIVES OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC PROSPECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic recoveries in the United States
and Japan will help stimulate Taiwan's economy and Taiwan will
benefit from positive economic developments in mainland China,
regional executives of two international banks said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mou, vice president of Citibank's Taipei branch, said
that Citibank has recently revised its forecast of Taiwan's economic
growth in 2003 from 2.3 percent to 2.7 percent, while the United
States is expected to attain a 2.5 percent growth, Japan 1.9 percent,
mainland China 7.5 percent, and the Euro-zone 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>He said that the 2.7 percent projection remained conservative in
comparison with the forecast of 3.06 percent by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting, and Statistics under the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>While economists of the international bank have revised upwards
their forecast regarding Taiwan, Cheng pointed out that although
Taiwan suffered the impact of the spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) in April and May, foreign capital has been coming
into Taiwan since early this year, especially in the hi-tech sectors.</P>
      <P>Saying that different industries may expect various paces of
recovery in the following months, Cheng foresees accelerated
recoveries in the semiconductor, TFT (thin-film-transistor) display,
and digital camera manufacturing industries.</P>
      <P>With promising prospects for these locomotive industries, Cheng
said that Taiwan is projected to achieve a 4.2 percent economic
growth next year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, economists of the Standard Chartered Bank are even
more optimistic about economic recoveries around the globe, as they
forecast the U.S. will be able to attain a 4 percent economic growth
in the second half of this year, and a 3.8 percent growth in 2004;
Japan will have an annual growth between 1.5 percent and 2 percent
this year; and mainland China's economic growth this year is
projected at 8.5 percent.</P>
      <P>With the stimulus of economic recoveries in the U.S. and Japan,
Taiwan's economy is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in the coming
months until summer 2004, according to Kwok Kwok-chuen, regional
chief economist for north and eastern Asia of the Standard Chartered
Bank.</P>
      <P>Kwok said that the world economy had suffered in the wake of the
burst of hi-tech stock bubbles. As international information
technology-related industries are gradually recovering and demand
increasing, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea, as leading IT products
suppliers, will benefit, he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing the international competitiveness of Asian economies,
Kwok said that Asian economies stagnated in the first half of this
year due to the impacts of the U.S.-led war against Iraq and SARS
outbreaks. The prospects have been turning for the better over the
past two months, he said.</P>
      <P>A Standard Chartered Bank forecast indicates that Taiwan can
achieve a 3.5 percent economic growth this year, while exports will
continue to expand.</P>
      <P>The economist pointed out, however, in terms of domestic demand
and investment willingness, the recovery will be slow, with a
sluggish jobs market and the increasing number of factories relocating
to the mainland by Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Kwok suggested that positive economic
developments in mainland China will benefit Taiwan's economy, the
hi-tech industrial sector in particular, because Taiwan is still a
leading supplier of electronics parts and components to the mainland
market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LU CALLS FOR CLOSER TIES WITH LATIN AMERICA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Sunday called
for comprehensive efforts by Taiwan's official and private sectors to
enhance relations with Latin America.</P>
      <P>Terming the relations between Taiwan and Latin America the "new
cross-strait" relations, Lu urged the Taiwan people to move their
focus of attention farther from the narrow Taiwan Strait to the much
wider Pacific Ocean, where Latin America is.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA at the Presidential Office
Sunday morning, Lu advocated stepped-up "peoples' diplomacy" with
Central and South America, given that 15 out of the 27 nations that
maintain formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on
Taiwan are in that part of the world.</P>
      <P>Lu called for Taiwan legislators as well as the industrial and
business sectors to shift their fact-finding tours and investments
from mainland China to Central and South America, saying "What's the
point of focusing all your efforts and money in mainland China while
cross-Taiwan Strait relations are mired in hostility and crisis?"</P>
      <P>The vice president also called for Taiwan students and online
species to increase interactions with the peoples in Central and
South America. She said after the frenzy of enthusiasm for the
Japanese and Korean pop cultures, it's time now for the Taiwanese
young generation to change their appetite for some Latin American
flavors to help broaden their global perspective.</P>
      <P>Lu said she will also push for efforts by cities and counties
islandwide to gear up tourism, cultural and agricultural sales
exchanges with counterparts in Central and South American countries.</P>
      <P>Taking Paraguay as an example, Lu said Paraguay is actually an
oasis in the "diplomacy desert" that Taiwan is experiencing in the
vastness of South America.</P>
      <P>Lu visited South America recently and said that the existing
"Taiwan village" there should be further enlarged to become a "Taiwan
town" to accelerate bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>She has advocated that 1,000 Taiwan citizens financially support
1,000 Paraguayan orphans to make the poor children their Paraguayan
protegees.</P>
      <P>Lu also urged the government to help the private industrial and
business sectors invest in Paraguay, turning the backwater country
into the "factory of South America."</P>

Channel and waters near southeastern and northeastern Taiwan to take
precautionary measures against strong winds.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau said Dujuan could affect the weather of Taiwan
because it is moving fairly quickly in the direction of the island.</P>
      <P>Dujuan was located about 1,010 kilometers east of Oluanpi at the
southern tip of the island at 11 a.m. Sunday, moving west-northwest
at 27 kilometers per hour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>13 KILLED, 68 INJURED IN  APARTMENT FIRE IN TAIPEI COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen people were killed and 68 injured
in an early morning fire which engulfed a high-rise apartment in
Luchou, Taipei County, Sunday, according to police.</P>
      <P>The fire broke out at 1: 53 a.m., while most people were asleep.
It set alight motorcycles parked in a lower level and the fire spread
rapidly as the adjoining stairwells acted as flues. The blaze had
quickly engulfed the entire building.</P>
      <P>Reports said that a couple, who had been drinking, began to argue
in the underground parking bay and had tossed paint thinner at each
other then set the accelerant ablaze.</P>
      <P>Alleys leading to the apartment were so narrow that the location
was inaccessible to large fire engines. More than 50 fire engines had
to park one or two block away to fight the fire using long hoses.</P>
      <P>As a result, the pressure coming from the fire hydrants was so
weak that the water could only be sprayed up to the second floor,
even though the blaze was by then on every floor up to the eighth
story.</P>
      <P>Many people who scrambled to escape in their pajamas through
stairway were forced to retreated to their own flats after finding
the building's only exit was blocked by burning motorcycles.</P>
      <P>They waved clothes from their windows, crying for help, but the
 ladder trucks couldn't approach the building because of the narrow
 alleys. Some lucky residents managed to find ropes and rappelled to
 safety from windows; others lost their grip on the rope and fell to
 the ground, while others simply jumped and were injured seriously.</P>
      <P>All of the injured were rushed to hospitals in Taipei County and
Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The local government opened a temporary shelter to accommodate
 people evacuated from the apartment building and promised to offer
 aid of NT$200,000 (US$5,878) to each victim and NT$100,000
 (US$2.939) to every person who was seriously injured.</P>
      <P>Government leaders from President Chen Shui-bian down were
alarmed by the incident.</P>
      <P>President Chen called for a forensic investigation to find the
cause of the tragedy and bring to justice those responsible.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun asked government agencies to do their utmost
to help the families who suffered in the fire.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's spokesman, Lin Chia-lung, said the premier
had been told of the fire almost immediately and was kept informed
hourly all Sunday morning until the fire was put out. However, Lin
said, the premier would refrain from visiting the site for the time
being to avoid disrupting the work of firefighters.</P>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien visited the injured at
hospitals Sunday morning, presented each of them with NT$50,000
(US$1,469) . For the families of the dead, the aid is NT$100,000
(US$2,939) per victim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEDIA CAN GIVE MESSAGE IN MAINLAND TO STOP HUMAN TRAFFICKING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan County, Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan police urged the government
Sunday to launch media drives in mainland China to help curb human
trafficking across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In the light of the drowning of six mainland Chinese women off
waters in western Taiwan while trying to sneak onto the island last
week, Taoyuan police said it would be more effective for the Taiwan
authorities to educate the Chinese people and smash their illusions
about Taiwan via media publicity on the mainland than pressing for
added hands in coast guard forces to bust human cargo and
traffickers.</P>
      <P>Last week, 26 mainland Chinese women were thrown overboard by
human traffickers to escape pursuing Taiwan coast guard ships
offshore Miaoli, northern Taiwan. Six of the group drowned.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County, also on the west coast in northern Taiwan, has
been one of the major places where human traffickers dump ashore
their human cargoes.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan police say they are often called to arrest mainland
Chinese women from motels on charges of engaging in illegal sex
trade. At the police stations, most of the Chinese women say they
paid a fortune to have them secreted into Taiwan to marry Taiwanese
men or start a new life, the policemen said.</P>
      <P>Many said that the traffickers promised them a much better life
once they succeed in landing in Taiwan, but often the reality was
that setting foot on Taiwan soil was just the beginning of their
nightmares, according to police.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan police said stopping human trafficking is a daunting
task for Taiwan law enforcement authorities, saying that while at sea
it is the responsibility of the coast guard to capture smuggling
vessels and human beings, while on land it is the job of the police
to find illegal mainland Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>Unless a case is reported and the police are alerted, finding the
illegal mainland Chinese immigrants in Taiwan society is as hard as
finding needles in haystacks, the police said.</P>
      <P>They argued instead that educating the Chinese while they are
still on the mainland and shattering their illusions about the
prospects of going to Taiwan by illicit means would be a better way
of stemming a further wave of human trafficking than pressing
Taiwan's already small law enforcement organization for extra hands
to handle the ever-increasing waves of illegal immigrants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS TAIWAN-FUNDED COMPANIES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO INVEST IN TSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug. 31 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To replace Hong Kong as a capital-raising
center in Asia, the government should allow foreign-based Taiwan
companies to apply for listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) ,
according to a report presented recently by a presidential economic
advisory panel.</P>
      <P>Such a move will fuel private-sector investment in Taiwan and
help boost capital movements between Taiwan and mainland China, thus
reducing one-way capital flight to the mainland, members of the panel
commented in a meeting late last week.</P>
      <P>The government ought to gradually ease restrictions on capital
use by listed companies and should provide Taiwan-invested and
overseas Chinese enterprises operating abroad with access to the
domestic stock market, they suggested, adding that Taiwan stands a
good chance to replace Hong Kong as a capital-raising hub in Asia by
doing so.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong has been losing its status and functions as a regional
financial center since its reversion to Beijing's rule in 1997, and
Taiwan should be able to succeed it to play that role, panel members
said.</P>
      <P>The panel's comments are indicative that a proposal suggesting to
allow foreign-based Taiwan companies to invest and raise capital in
the Taiwan Stock Exchange may take effect in the near future after
complementary measures are due, officials of domestic institutional
investors contended.</P>
      <P>Once entrepreneurs are permitted to collect funds from Taiwan to
develop their own businesses, they will be more willing to invest at
home and set up their business operational centers here, helping in
Taiwan's economic progress and increasing capital movements between
Taiwan and mainland China. Most foreign-based Taiwan businesses are
headquartered in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Banning mainland-based Taiwanese enterprises from being listed on
the domestic stock market out of political considerations has caused
a great deal of capital flight to mainland China through a third
country or area, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Allowing foreign-based Taiwan companies to make listings on the
domestic bourse will not only increase their affiliation with the
country, but also will set up official mechanisms for relevant
authorities to supervise their operations and finances, they said,
urging the government to quicken its pace in obtaining the goal
before mainland China to secure Taiwanese capital for the homeland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Aug.  31 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>By allowing international corporations
invested by Taiwanese businessmen overseas to become listed on the
Taiwan Stock Exchange, the government will help Taiwanese businessmen
abroad to have a new channel to raise capital, which will advance
Taiwan's position as a financial center in the Asia-Pacific region,
an industrial association executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo Huai-chia, executive officer of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association, said that the association
first made the proposal years ago to allow overseas Taiwanese
companies to become listed and their stocks be traded in a "fourth
market, " in addition to the TSEC (Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation)
market, OTC (over-the-counter) market, and the market for emerging
hi-tech stocks.</P>
      <P>In order to develop a supervisory mechanism over capital flow,
the association suggested that the "fourth market" should open only
to institutional investors from the United States, Japan, Hong Kong
and other parts of the world at first, according to Lo.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that between 1991 and 2002, the government
approved 27,276 applications for making investments on the Chinese
mainland, and the investment amount totalled US$26.61 billion,
representing 45.7 percent of the overseas investments by Taiwan's
business and industry.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of a "fourth market" for the trading of
stocks of overseas Taiwanese companies, overseas Taiwanese companies
which have difficulties becoming listed on the stock exchanges in
Hong Kong and mainland China will have a new channel to raise
capital, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He added, however, the "fourth market stocks trading" remained a
vague idea because the drafting and implementing of such a policy
involves a lot of work in revising regulations.</P>
      <P>Some members of the industrial association suggested that at the
moment, it is more practical for the government to negotiate with
Beijing on an agreement to solve problems facing Taiwanese
businesses, such as double taxation by authorities on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>They said that many Taiwanese businessmen have set up overseas
controlling companies to manage their investments in mainland China.
While these companies are using accounting and auditing systems
different from local companies in Taiwan, they may have problems
meeting the listing requirements in Taiwan.</P>

may help change someone's life, regardless of whether the book is new
or used.

    <HEADLINE>FAMILIES OF CAL AIR CRASH VICTIMS SUE BOEING IN LOS ANGELES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, Aug. 30 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two family members of victims of the
2002 air crash of a China Airlines (CAL) plane filed suit for damages
against the airplane's United States builder, Boeing, in a Los
Angeles court Saturday.</P>
      <P>Attorney Steven Archer said his two Taiwan clients, Chung Chi-hua
and Chung Yen-hua, are seeking reasonable compensation from Boeing on
grounds that it failed to duly supervise the maintenance of a Boeing
747-200 it sold to CAL in 1979 which lead to its crash in the ocean
on May 25, 2002 on its way from Taipei to Hong Kong, killing all 225
on board.</P>
      <P>He claimed that evidence suggested the plane broke up in midair
because of metal fatigue and investigators suspect the breakup
started from a 15-inch, old crack in the plane's tail. The crack was
covered with a stainless steel plate rather than a plate of aluminum
alloy as is usually used to patch cracks.</P>
      <P>Boeing should share part of the blame for the crash as it
undertook to monitor the maintenance of airplanes built by it
according to its contract with CAL, and CAL fixed the crack in
question under the supervision of Boeing technicians.</P>
      <P>Margaret Morrow, a judge at the Los Angeles Federal Court set
Nov. 3 for the first hearing of the case.</P>

billions of dollars to help maintain Taiwan's economic growth in the

Yuan.</P>

approved by the Legislative Yuan, in addition to the projected NT$500
billion program.</P>
