wait for my student to make an effort himself to find his way through
a difficulty, before I show him the way myself. I also make him find
his own illustrations before I give him one of my own. When I have
pointed out the bearing of a subject in one direction and found that
my student cannot himself see its bearings into other directions, I
do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ISRAELI PRESIDENT ATTENDS GROUNDBREAKING OF TAIWAN JOINT VENTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tel  Aviv, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Israeli President Moshe Katzav attended a
groundbreaking ceremony for a new Taiwan-invested joint venture
semiconductor manufacturing plant Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new chip factory, located some 100 kilometers away from Tel
Aviv in northeastern Israel, is a joint venture between Israel's
leading semiconductor company, Tower Semiconductor Ltd., Taiwan's
Macronix International and other partners.</P>
      <P>Macronix, a microchip maker that was the first Taiwan company to
be listed on the NASDAQ, owns a 10-percent stake in the new Israeli
company, which will mainly produce flash memory chips for export and
the local market, according to Macronix President Miin Wu. Wu had
traveled from Taipei to Tel Aviv earlier this week to attend the
groundbreaking ceremony.</P>
      <P>In addition to Katzaf, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
ministers of finance and labor affairs, the president of the Israeli
Parliament and many other officials also attended the ceremony,
underlining the joint venture's importance to Israel.</P>
      <P>The joint venture was technically kicked off last year when
Macronix and Tower Semiconductor signed a manufacturing and
technology cooperation agreement on Aug. 14, 2000. It is considered a
bridge between business and industrial sectors between Taiwan and
Israel, and is expected to serve as a catalyst for more Taiwan
investment in the Middle East country.</P>
      <P>Tower Semiconductor, one of the world's leading manufacturers of
flash memory and image sensors, is a major supplier to Motorola. With
a workforce of 1,000, Tower is expected to begin manufacturing
silicon wafers in 2002.</P>
      <P>Macronix International's parent company is located at the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park in northern Taiwan. The international
unit's monthly production of six-inch wafers currently stands at some
35,000 pieces, while that of six-inch wafers is 40,000 pieces.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng Thursday lambasted Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung as arrogant and opinionated concerning the controversial
fourth nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Lin said the nation's Legislative Yuan is facing a ruling
administration which is "impervious, peremptory, and disrespectful to
the constitutional system and the rule of law."</P>
      <P>He called for all KMT members not to be "driven to discord or
influenced by either force or financial interests" by the government
on matters concerning the power plant issue and to effectively play
their role as the opposition party.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a KMT vice
chairman, reiterated that the extraordinary legislative session
called by the opposition, during which a resolution mandating the
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant was passed Wednesday,
successfully carried out the Legislature's mission and function of
safeguarding the nation's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Noting that a resolution passed by the Legislative Yuan is a law
and a law nobody can defy or violate, Wang reiterated the
justification for the resolution and the Legislative Yuan's mandate
to continue to build the nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>As to whether President Chen Shui-bian's offers to coordinate
negotiations between the Legislature and the Cabinet sometime next
week would be helpful, Wang said that if the negotiations were
conducted under the framework of Wednesday's resolution, the
Legislative Yuan would welcome the negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said it would be improper for the Legislative
Yuan to legislate a new bill on the nuclear power plant project as
recommended by the Council of Grand Justices last month as one of the
three possible ways for resolving the thorny issue.</P>
      <P>Wang said by legislating a new bill, the lawmakers would risk
infringing upon the Executive Yuan's discretionary rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NASA PROBE TO DESCEND ON ASTEROID EROS FEB. 12</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Jan.  31  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>NASA's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous
(NEAR) space probe, the first to orbit an asteroid, has met all
scientific goals of its year of orbiting asteroid Eros, and will now
attempt another first -- a controlled descent to the surface of the
asteroid on Feb. 12.</P>
      <P>The main goal of the controlled descent is to gather close-up
pictures of the boulder-strewn surface of 433 Eros, more than 196
million miles (316 million kilometers) from Earth.</P>
      <P>"NEAR Shoemaker has set a high standard for low-cost planetary
exploration," said Dr. Edward Weiler, Associate Administrator for
Space Science at NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>During its 5-year, 2-billion-mile journey, the NEAR Shoemaker
spacecraft, which was built and is managed by the Applied Physics
Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, MD., provided the most detailed profile
yet of a small celestial body.</P>
      <P>"We now know that Eros is a solid body of uniform composition,
made of material probably older than the Earth," said Dr. Andrew
Cheng of APL, Project Scientist for NEAR. "But we also found many
other things we didn't expect to see, and have questions we didn't
know to ask at the start of the mission."</P>
      <P>For the final phase of the mission on Feb. 12, the primary goal
will be to get the closest images yet of Eros, particularly its
"saddle" area, a 6-mile (10-kilometer) wide depression that has
intrigued scientists with its boulder patches, relatively craterless
surface and patterns of grooves and ridges.</P>
      <P>The secondary aim is to practice the maneuvers that would lead to
a landing, creating a flight plan for future missions to land on a
small celestial body.</P>
      <P>NEAR Shoemaker's 4-hour descent is scheduled to start at 10:31
a.m. EST with a maneuver moving it out of its current orbit 22 miles
(35 kilometers) from the center of Eros. On the way down it will take
pictures that will help determine its exact location and altitude,
and set the timing for the final firings of its thrusters. This
series of thruster firings is designed to decelerate the spacecraft
from about 20 mph to 5 mph.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMAN FAVORS BETTER TREATMENT FOR TRANSITING TAIWAN LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Jan. 31 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One of the most influential members of
the U.S. Congress on Wednesday pledged to seek better treatment for
leaders of the Republic of China when they make transit stops in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Rep. Thomas D. DeLay (R-TX), also told a Taiwan delegation that
if President Chen Shui-bian ever chooses to stop over in the
congressman's home state of Texas, he will be there to meet the ROC
president -- "anytime, anywhere."</P>
      <P>Delay, the majority whip in the House of Representatives, was
commenting on the way Chen was treated during his overnight transit
in Los Angeles last August. Prior to his arrival, Clinton
administration officials persuaded several members of Congress not to
meet with Chen in order to spare the administration from protests
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>In the end, only one Republican House member, Dana Rohrabacher of
California, managed to meet briefly with the president.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Frank Hsieh, chairman of the Democratic
Progressive Party, and other Taiwan visitors, the third-ranking House
Republican said such treatment is unacceptable, "We need to fix
that," he added.</P>
      <P>DeLay's comments reflect a growing feeling on Capitol Hill that
restrictions on transit arrangements for Taiwan's top leaders should
be relaxed. It is expected that legislation aimed at achieving that
goal will be introduced unless the new Bush administration does
something of its own volition.</P>
      <P>While stressing his strong support for Taiwan, DeLay said that
the Republican-controlled Congress will give more time to the Bush
administration, which is also Republican, before pressing it to do
more for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We'd like the administration to design their foreign policy," he
said, "and we'll back off a little bit and let them decide what
position they want to take (on Taiwan)."</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's aspiration to participate in the World Health
Organization (WHO), DeLay indicated his support for a new bill,
expected to be introduced next week, which would require the U.S.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Manila is coordinating with local law enforcement authorities to step
up investigations into the Tuesday kidnapping of a Taiwan tourist, a
foreign ministry official said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chen Ming-cheng said
that Taiwan's de facto embassy in the Philippines has already
dispatched officials to accompany the victim's girlfriend in
reporting the case.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the Taiwan officials are maintaining close
contact with the authorities and have requested police protection for
Hung I-ting, 32, whose boyfriend Chang Ming-wen, 38, was allegedly
abducted by two unidentified gunmen from a taxi en route from the
local airport.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign ministry, Hung and Chang are manpower
agency brokers who frequently travel between Taipei and Manila.
Chang's whereabouts were still unknown as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Hung, she and Chang traveled from their hotel in
Manila to the city's international airport to pick up an arriving
friend at around 4 p.m. Tuesday, but later left by taxi because their
friend did not show up.</P>
      <P>The couple told the taxi driver to bring them to Makati, a
fashionable district of Manila, but the taxi stopped after just 10
minutes of driving, whereupon two armed gunmen broke into the car.</P>
      <P>Hung said the taxi operator drove on for another hour before
stopping at a secluded place where the kidnappers took her diamond
ring, watch and 50,000 Philippine pesos. Then one of the kidnappers
forced Chang to leave the car, after which the driver and the other
gunman brought her to another location and dropped Hung off, she
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO MAKE TAIWAN PIVOT OF CHINESE PUBLISHING MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian encouraged local
publishers Thursday to join forces with the government to build
Taiwan into the pivot of the Chinese publishing industry.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal at the opening of the Ninth Taipei
International Book Exhibition (TIBE 2001), Asia's largest book fair.</P>
      <P>The president said he is very pleased to see major publishing
companies from 46 countries and areas around the world come all the
way to Taiwan to take part in the book fair.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century marks an era of intense competition
and integration, Chen said nearly all major countries have made the
upgrading of national competitiveness their priority national goal.</P>
      <P>To cope with the challenge of the prevailing globalization trend,
Chen said the Republic of China is also pushing for industrial
transformation and upgrading, particularly the development of
knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>As the publishing industry forms the basis for various "knowledge
industries," Chen went on, local publishers should use new thinking
and adopt a two-pronged approach to help develop Taiwan into a
promising, vibrant and knowledgeable society.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, Chen said he hopes local publishers can
introduce fine foreign publications into Taiwan to help cultivate
local people's global vision and refine their tastes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he encouraged local publishing houses to introduce
literary works created by domestic writers to the international
community. "By so doing, we'll be able to turn a new page in the
history of our publishing industry," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that with the concerted efforts of the
Government Information Office (GIO) and local publishing houses, the
number of countries participating in the book fair has increased
steadily over the past 14 years.</P>
      <P>"The expansion of the scale marks progress in our publishing
industry, which will in turn contribute to Taiwan's bid to become the
pivot of the Chinese book market and a stronghold of the Asian
publishing industry," he noted.</P>
      <P>A total of 886 publishing houses from 46 countries and areas are
participating in the six-day book fair in the first and second
exhibition halls of the Taipei World Trade Center. Several countries,
including Austria, Denmark, Thailand and Vietnam, are taking part in
the event for the first time.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the diverse artistry that French writers have
struck into world literature, TIBE's organizers have made France the
centerpiece of this year's event with a special French pavilion.</P>
      <P>France is the TIBE's third "Country of Honor" after Germany and
Britain, respectively. GIO officials said they have given France the
honor due to the nation's position as the fourth largest exporter of
publications worldwide and its increasingly closer literary
relationship with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TIBE 2001 has attracted largely increased media attention
compared with previous years partly because of the arrival of fisrt
Chinese-born Nobel literary laureate Gao Xingjian. Exiled from
mainland China and now a French citizen, Gao has been lauded
throughout the Chinese and world literary community for his works
such as "Soul Mountain" and "One Man's Bible."</P>
      <P>In addition, celebrated novelist Andrei Makine, who immigrated
to France in 1987 from Russia, French sinologist and translator
Andre Levy, cartoonist Golo, and noted French historian Pierre
Vidal-Naquet will alo be in attendance at TIBE 2001 and hosting
seminars over the course of the exhibition.</P>

      <P>Minister of Finance Yen Ching-chang and
Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan said Thursday that the
Taiwan Cooperative Bank (TCB) should merge with "another local bank."</P>
      <P>The two officials made the remarks at a tea party hosted by TCB
Chairman Lee Wen-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that the government last year pushed for financial
organization mergers and added that he expects TCB, which has already
merged with ChinFon Commercial Bank, will merge with "another local
bank" to achieve a goal of "three into one."</P>
      <P>TCB has been examining various "three into one" schemes since
last July, one of which would see the combination of financial
departments in medium-sized business banks, cooperative banks and the
financial departments of farmers' associations to simplify business
operations.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that Taiwan has a sound financial system. However, he
went on, in light of Taiwan's imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization, local financial organizations should make more effort
to face the changing international financial environment.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that according to statistics, the top three
banks in each country in the world have market occupancy rates of
between 45 percent and 82 percent. However, he added, the occupancy
rate in the top three Taiwan banks is as low as 24 percent, showing
that Taiwan has too many financial organizations and that mergers are
necessary.</P>

      <P>Incumbent opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan kicked off an endorsement campaign Thursday for
his candidacy in the upcoming direct election for the party's
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lien was accompanied by KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng and
several KMT legislators when he turned up at the party's headquarters
to pick up an endorsement application form.</P>
      <P>The 106-year-old KMT is scheduled to hold its first-ever direct
chairmanship election on March 24 and started Thursday to accept
applications for candidacy endorsements by party members.</P>
      <P>According to party regulations, hopefuls must collect endorsement
signatures of at least 3 percent of the party members and formally
register with the party headquarters by 5 p.m. Feb. 15.</P>
      <P>As of the party-set Wednesday deadline for the reconfirmation of
its members, about 950,000 people have registered as KMT members. As
a result, any KMT stalwart intending to run in the party's
chairmanship election must secure the endorsements of at least 28,500
party members.</P>
      <P>Lien said the onset of his endorsement campaign marks a very
important moment in his life. "It will be an honor for me if I can
obtain enough endorsement signatures to qualify for the party's
first-ever direct chairmanship election," Lien said, adding that the
election is an integral part of the KMT's ongoing democratic
restructuring.</P>
      <P>Lien represented the KMT in the last year's presidential
election, but lost resoundingly to the Democratic Progressive Party's
Chen Shui-bian, ending the KMT's 55-year control of the ROC
presidency.</P>
      <P>Lien said he has an obligation to push for the KMT's internal
reform and its return to power.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Tuan Hung-chun, a KMT Central Committee
member, also picked up a candidacy application form.</P>
      <P>Tuan said Lien should either resign from the his current post or
go on leave to ensure a fair election. He also demanded that all KMT
workers should remain neutral in handling election-related affairs
and that the period for seeking endorsement signatures be extended.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE SAYS TAIWAN IS `JUST LIKE HOME'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nobel laureate and exiled mainland Chinese
writer Gao Xingjian said here Thursday that Taiwan is "just like
home" to him and that the question of identification is "unnecessary"
because he carries his "roots" within himself.</P>
      <P>Gao, who is the first Chinese-language writer to win the Nobel
Prize in literature, arrived in Taiwan earlier in the day for a
two-week stay as resident writer of Taipei City, a post he accepted
before he was declared the recipient of the coveted award last
October.</P>
      <P>He said at a welcoming press conference organized by the city's
Cultural Affairs Bureau that he has felt at home in Taiwan ever since
his first visit.</P>
      <P>Gao, who fled mainland China in 1987 and is now a French citizen,
said that going into exile in France allowed him to seek space for
artistic expression. Identification is only a "heavy burden" for a
writer, he added.</P>
      <P>During the hour-long press conference, Gao spoke openly about his
personal creative experiences, his inner exploration of freedom, the
development of Chinese-language literature in the global literary
arena and his feelings on receiving the Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>Just as he refrained from commenting on political issues during a
brief stay in Hong Kong prior to his arrival in Taipei, Gao did not
dwell on political issues at the press conference. "Nothing there to
talk about," he said.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of Taipei's Cultural Affairs Bureau, said
that a love for reading and an appreciation of literature might be
important indicators of the maturity of a society's collective
thought. She added that the importance the Taipei authorities have
attached to Gao's visit "might already be a sign of such an
indication."</P>
      <P>Lung said that she hopes Gao's ability to straddle novel writing,
play writing, and painting, as well as his unique bilingual writing
method -- writing Chinese with his right hand and French with his
left -- will make an impact on local artists and open their minds to
different creative perspectives.</P>
      <P>The 60-year-old writer is scheduled to give three public speeches
during his stay and to meet with his friends in local creative
circles. Gao's novel "Soul Mountain" has been a best seller since he
won the Nobel Prize and his visit is expected to create a lot of
discussion on his many other literary works.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb. 1 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities have agreed to
a plan by 10 presidents of Taiwan businessmen's associations
operating on the mainland to sail directly from Kinmen to Xiamen, a
Kinmen County official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tzai confirmed the news when
briefing more than 110 leaders of Taiwan businessmen associations in
mainland China about the current situation concerning the mini three
links, which have stalled after being launched a month ago.</P>
      <P>Mainland officials in charge of Taiwan affairs have informed the
Kinmen County government by telephone, Chen said, adding that he has
instructed the Kinmen government-run shipping company to make
preparations for the Friday sailing.</P>
      <P>A total of 114 Taiwan businessmen association leaders in mainland
China are taking part in an annual gathering celebrating the Spring
Festival in Kinmen. The activities have been jointly sponsored by the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), and the Ministry of Economics Affairs.</P>
      <P>The 10 presidents had submitted their petition to mainland
Chinese authorities in Fujian province for permission for the direct
sailing. Three Kinmen county government officials will also accompany
them to Xiamen for a business trip.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen county government officials will also accompany some
80 Kinmen senior citizens now residing in the Xiamen area who will
travel to Kinmen for family reunions at the invitation of the Kinmen
County government.</P>
      <P>During the gathering, several Taiwan business leaders called on
the government to permit mainland-made products to be transported to
Taiwan through Kinmen and to open the "three links" with mainland
China -- direct trade, transport and mail services between the
mainland and Taiwan proper -- as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Fan Tai-an, president of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in
Santou City, said that the current "mini three links" cannot satisfy
the demands of businessmen in Taiwan and the mainland. He suggested
the government should permit Kinmen to act as a "middle port" for
passengers and products crossing the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuen-tsung, president of the Taiwanese-owned Enterprises
Association in Beijing, said the government should permit the people
of Taiwan and Taiwan-produced products to travel directly to Xiamen

    <HEADLINE>DOH MULLS WHETHER TO IMPORT MAINLAND-PRODUCED HANTA VACCINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will make a
careful evaluation before deciding whether to import mainland
China-produced Hanta vaccine to prevent an outbreak of the
rodent-spread viral disease, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for
Disease Control, made the remarks at a public hearing on the Hanta
disease. The hearing was jointly organized by New Party Legislator
Cheng Lung-shui and People First Party Legislator Shen Chih-hui.</P>
      <P>Hsu said mainland China began to produce Hanta vaccine in 1995,
which is now being widely used on the mainland. According to Hsu,
half of the 150,000 confirmed cases of Hanta viral infection
worldwide per year took place on the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Given its short history of use, the efficacy of the
mainland-developed Hanta vaccine has not yet received wide
recognition," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the DOH will import the mainland-produced Hanta
vaccine, Hsu said the DOH must study whether the strain of the virus
found in Taiwan is same as that collected in mainland China and
assess the effectiveness and safety of the mainland product before
making a final decision.</P>
      <P>Alarms over possible spread of the Hanta virus have arisen after
a couple, Wu Mu-kuei and his wife, in the eastern county of Hualien,
died of complications caused by Hanta virus infection in January.</P>
      <P>Hsu said local people need not overly worry about an outbreak of
the viral infection because the Hanta virus, a potentially fatal
disease agent mainly transmitted by rodents, does not spread from
person to person.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsu went on, the DOH has consistently kept close
monitoring of the development of various contagious diseases. Hsu
said the DOH will join forces with the Council of Agriculture and
relevant local environmental protection and public health
agencies in launching an islandwide campaign to wipe out rats in the
near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CARMAKERS CONFIDENT OF TAKING ON WTO CHALLENGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Encouraged by robust sales since the
beginning of this year, Taiwan-based carmakers are confident they can
ride out the challenges posed by the country's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Expressing confidence in the quality of their products, local
carmakers said they believe they will be able to tackle the heavy
competition expected to be brought about by Taiwan's much-awaited
accession into the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>Despite the sagging economy and a plummeting stock market last
year, sales of locally made new cars increased by 17.1 percent during
the first 10 days of January, as compared to the same period of 2000,
according to statistics that also found the sales represent growth of
196.4 percent from the December level.</P>
      <P>Of the leading five local car producers, China Motor Corporation
and Yulon Motor Co. Ltd., both of which are affiliates of the Yulon
Group, posted the largest growth rates of more than three-fold over
their respective December levels, the same tallies show.</P>
      <P>Looking toward the coming year, local car manufacturers are
cautiously optimistic, estimating that a total of 430,000 cars will
be sold in the domestic market for the whole of 2001, up slightly
from last year's figure.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's admission into the WTO is expected to produce
strong foreign competition in the local market, most local carmakers
are positive about the development and are confident of their
competitive edge.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, average costs of imported cars
will be lowered by 0.73 percent this year due to a 1 percent
reduction in customs tariffs, while costs of locally made cars will
also drop by 0.26 percent because of lowered customs duties on
imported parts and components.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the competitiveness of Taiwan-made cars has been
noticeably upgraded, despite slashing customs duties on foreign
imports from 65 percent in 1986 to 30 percent in 2000, the sources
continued.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that locally produced cars won most major awards in
a local car exhibition held in early January, they said San Yang
Industrial Co., Ltd., outperforming foreign carmakers such as BMW and
Volvo, won the fair's leading award of the 2001 car of the year with
its Civic Ferio model.</P>
      <P>The Civic Ferio's award is fresh proof that local consumers no
longer take pride in driving a foreign car, the sources analyzed,
stressing that they now attach a great deal of importance to
post-sale services, which is a great advantage of local carmakers in
the fierce race against foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan-based carmakers are exploring business
opportunities in mainland China, as the vast market is viewed by
global automobile businesses as the world's last "virgin land,"
business sources say, pointing out that a total of 2.1 million cars
were sold in mainland China in 2000, five times as many as were sold
in Taiwan during the same period.</P>
      <P>According to mainland Chinese forecasts, the mainland car market
has the potential to grow by 11 percent each year, with private car
ownership as a fashion statement expected to sweep certain affluent
cities in coastal provinces in the coming two years. Of the 2.1
million cars sold last year in the mainland, around 600,000 units
were private cars.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that a total of 2.4 million cars will be sold in
the mainland this year, with the figure likely to climb to 3.3
million in 2005 and 5.8 million in 2010, the equivalent scale of the
present Japanese market.</P>
      <P>In a move to lay a solid foundation in mainland China, China
Motor, the first Taiwan-based car firm to receive mainland China's
permission to make inroads, formed a joint venture with a
Fujian-based counterpart four years ago to set up a car manufacturing
company there.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Yulon also made a decision last year to acquire
a 25 percent stake of a leading mainland-based car producer in the
hope of planning to begin manufacturing two-liter models in the
middle of this year.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, the major reason behind Yulon's
investment in the mainland is a desire to increase its output scale
and lower its production costs in face of the fierce competition
expected to be produced in the almost saturated Taiwan market

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Thursday played
host at a dinner party to honor the presidents of the legislative,
executive, judicial, examination and control yuans to mark the 2001
Chinese Lunar new year.</P>
      <P>Although the presidential officials stressed that the gathering
had been scheduled for some time and had nothing to do with the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant issue, it was the second
meeting between Executive Yuan President Chang Chun-hsiung and
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng in a day since the
Legislative Yuan adopted a resolution Wednesday to ask the Executive
Yuan to continue construction of the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Their first meeting ocurred earlier in the day when they attended
the inauguration of new head of the opposition Kuomintang caucus at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>In addition to Chang and Wang, Judicial Yuan President Weng
Yueh-sheng, Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien and Examination
Yuan President Hsu Shui-teh were also invited to the party.</P>
      <P>Chang has repeatedly expressed the hope that the executive and
legislative branches will sit down for consultations on the
controversial power plant. Chang also expressed hope Wednesday that
he could meet Wang to discuss the issue, but the proposal was turned
down by Wang.</P>
      <P>If the two branches fail to arrive at a conclusion on the plant,
Chen is expected to act as a mediator between them to seek a
resolution to the dispute.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Deputy
Secretary-General Yen Wan-ching said Thursday that mainland China's
agreement to allow a delegation of Taiwan businessmen to visit Xiamen
via a direct voyage from Kinmen is a good "pragmatic decision."</P>
      <P>Yen, whose semi-official organization is in charge of handling
Taiwan's relations with mainland China, added that cumulative
successful experiences in carrying out the "mini three links" policy
during its trial implementation stage will be helpful to promoting
Kinmen-Xiamen exchanges and the normalization of cross-Taiwan Strait
trade relations.</P>
      <P>The mini three links -- direct trade, postal and shipping links
between Taiwan's frontline Kinmen and Matsu islands with designated
ports in mainland China -- was implemented by the Republic of China
government Jan. 1, ending a five-decade ban on direct travel between
Kinmen and Xiamen, located only kilometers away from each other.</P>
      <P>Yen said that Kinmen used to be Taiwan's anti-communist outpost,
but with the start of the mini three links, it will become the
frontline for cross-strait trade exchanges. This, he went on, reveals
the ROC government's sincerity and good will to take action to
improve cross-strait relations. He urged mainland China to quickly
resume bilateral talks for the common welfare of the people on both
sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Yen was in Kinmen to organize a two-day spring festival social
gathering of Taiwan business association leaders in mainland China.
Over 100 Taiwan businessmen arrived earlier in the day to acquaint
themselves with the workings of the mini three links.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland China notified the SEF that 10 of the Taiwan
businessmen would be permitted to sail to Xiamen directly the
following day, a decision Yen welcomed as "glad tidings" exactly a
month into the links' implementation.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the SEF will assist Taiwan businessmen with their
needs and will allow direct sailings from Kinmen to Xiamen by Kinmen
residents, on a case-by-case basis for the time being.</P>
      <P>After a series of successful experiences, the SEF can begin to
handle requests in batches and even allow non-Kinmen or
Matsu-residents to sail directly to mainland China in the future for
even "smoother" cross-strait exchanges, he added.</P>

      <P>Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) officials said Thursday that a sandstorm sweeping Gansu
Province in mainland China will affect Taiwan's air quality.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that the sandstorm started Wednesday in the

float to Taiwan due to a cold front being swept south by the
northeast monsoon air flow.</P>
      <P>Officials of environmental monitoring departments in Matzu,
Taoyuan and Ilan, as well as Yangmingshan National Park, reported the
dust density in the air has already increased and warned Taiwan

    <TEXT>
      <P>A common farmed fish exported from Taiwan to
the United States for the past five years has been favorably received
by Americans who have dubbed it the Saint Peter fish, referring to
the fish used by Jesus to feed the five thousand.</P>
      <P>Tilapia, a kind of mouthbreeder, so called because it carries its
young in its mouth, has become more and more popular in the United
States, according to officials at the Council of Agriculture, who
said the popularity is "partially due to the fear of mad cow disease
that has gripped the West since last year" and has scared people away
from beef to poultry and fish.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tilapia exports to the United States reached 26,000 tons
in 2000, making the island the largest supplier of tilapia to the
United States, said the officials.</P>
      <P>Tilapia was first introduced to the U.S. market by ethnic
Chinese, but it rapidly found favor with American customers.</P>
      <P>The fish, which is native to Africa, was brought into Taiwan for
raising in aquaculture when the island was ruled by the Japanese. It
has now become the most widespread farmed fish in Taiwan, with a
production of more than 60,000 tons a year.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Air Force
Commander-in-Chief Gen. Chen Chao-min said Thursday that mainland
Chinese air force activity near the dividing line in the Taiwan
Strait since July 1999 has been more frequent than during the 1996
missile crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed at a dinner with local reporters that the ROC Air
Force is able to effectively monitor the activities of its mainland
counterpart -- even its Sukhoi-27 jet fighters -- from the minute
their jets take off, and has the capability to maintain the nation's
security.</P>
      <P>Citing air force intelligence reports, Chen said that mainland
jet fighters have been more active just west of the imaginary
dividing line than they were in 1996, when mainland China held
massive-scale military exercises and lobbed missiles into the waters
near Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the 570 days since former ROC President Lee Teng-hui announced
his "special state-to-state theory" on July 13, 1999, Chen continued,
mainland jet fighters -- mainly F-8's -- have put additional pressure
on the air space above the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCES INTEREST RATE CUT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China announced Thursday
a cut of 0.25 percentage points in its rediscount rate and secured
loan rate.</P>
      <P>Li Sheng-yann, director-general of the CBC's Banking Department,
and Chrystal Shih, director-general of its Economic Research
Department, announced the rate cut at a press conference.</P>
      <P>From Friday, the CBC rediscount rate will decrease from 4.625
percent to 4.375 percent, while the secured loan rate will drop from
5 percent to 4.75 percent, said the CBC officials.</P>
      <P>This is the second cut announced by the CBC since Dec. 28 in line
with the domestic economic situation.</P>
      <P>The new move was taken after weighing the largely tame commodity
price, the steady foreign exchange rate, the rising unemployment, and
the slowdown in domestic economy, with the purpose of stimulating
economic growth, said the CBC officials.</P>
      <P>Shih said that in light of the slowdown in worldwide trade
expansion, the plunge of private consumption due to the nose-dive of
stock prices and the soaring unemployment, all of which have
contributed to the economic slowdown, Taiwan's exports are unlikely
to grow rapidly.</P>
      <P>She said she expects steady price levels for imports and
wholesale goods this year because the delay in Taiwan's entry into
the World Trade Organization has spared the island the implementation
of a tobacco and liquor tax, combined with the increasing
unemployment and slackened salary hikes.</P>
      <P>Li for his part said liquidity is quite loose, citing as example
that most of NT$300 billion released by the bank before the Chinese
Lunar New Year has gone back into financial institutions, which has
forced 19 local banks to lower their rates.</P>
      <P>The rate cut announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board earlier
in the day will have an impact on the rate of the new Taiwan dollar
against the U.S. dollar, but thus far, the NT dollar is relatively
stable against the greenback, he continued.</P>
      <P>Although many local banks have lowered their rates for U.S.
dollar deposits, Taiwan's rates for U.S. dollar deposits are still
higher than those of the United States, he added.</P>

the effects of the interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve of the
United States, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Perng made the remarks at a post-Chinese New Year party in the

keep the sluggish U.S. economy from slipping into recession.</P>
      <P>Perng said that the nation's currency policy will be consistent

interest rate will depend on the nation's economic and financial
situation and on other economic indexes.</P>
      <P>As for the cut in the U.S. dollar deposit rate, he said this will
help narrow the gap between the interest rates of the U.S. and Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SUGGESTS REFERENDUM TO SETTLE NUCLEAR PLANT DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Friday proposed
holding a referendum as a possible way of resolving the thorny issue
of the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Chang said that it is feasible to him that the country hold a
referendum to redress the controversial issue pertaining to public
policy.</P>
      <P>He called for the Legislative Yuan to pass a referendum bill to
pave the way for such plebiscites on disputed public policies like
the fourth nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the Legislative Yuan can also consider enacting
an energy resources bill as recommended by the Council of Grand
Justices last month as one of the three possible ways of resolving
the power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Chang, however, did not make it clear whether the Executive Yuan
conforms with the resolution passed by the Legislature on Wednesday
by a vote of 134-70 calling for the immediate resumption of
construction on the nuclear plant which has already been 30 percent
completed.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after paying a formal call on
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng in an effort to seek "a
third way" out of the impasse over the controversial issue.</P>
      <P>After nearly two hours of discussions, Chang told the nation that
his talk with the legislative head was amicable and that they reached
a consensus on the point that the drawn-out nuclear power plant
dispute should be settled "the sooner the better" for the sake of the
people and the entire country.</P>
      <P>To Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, the issue has by no
means been settled by the meeting with Chang although the premier
termed the talks "amicable and successful."</P>
      <P>Wang said the premier is throwing the ball back to the
Legislative Yuan by calling on it to legislate a referendum bill or
an energy resources bill as a new way to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>Wang added that by calling for a referendum or energy resources
bill, the Executive Yuan is creating a new challenge for the
Legislature, which he said would meet to discuss countermeasures
before making any new moves on the power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, President Chen Shui-bian, who is in central Taiwan to
preside over a ceremony marking the completion of reconstruction on
the Shih Kang Dam which was damaged during the earthquake on Sept.
21, 1999, did not offer any comment on the meeting between the heads
of the two chambers Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen only said that all non-economic factors which have been
affecting the issue will soon be taken care of and that the dispute
will be settled in the near future.</P>
      <P>"The country cannot afford to consume itself from within any
longer," he stressed.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Cheng Yung-chin, Kuomintang party whip in the
Legislative Yuan, blasted Premier Chang for offering mere lip service
to the nuclear power plant dispute, saying that simply repeating
"respects" verbally is not helpful to dealing with the controversy.</P>
      <P>Cheng stressed that the Executive Yuan should make its position
clearer on the issue so as to allow for resumption of construction on
nuclear power plant.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen said here Friday that the Republic of China government
will continue to implement a trade-and-economy-focused policy toward
mainland China this year.</P>
      <P>"We'll also come up with several concrete projects for
substantiating this policy in the coming months," Taiwan's top
mainland policy planner told a Lunar New Year gathering of senior
executives of Taiwanese trade associations in major mainland cities.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the annual New Year gathering of
leading Taiwanese business people in mainland China have been
held on this frontline island. The arrangement was part of their
efforts to support the Taiwan-initiated direct "mini three links"
between the ROC's two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Addressing the 100-plus Taiwanese trade executives, Tsai urged
Beijing leaders to shed old burdens and old thinking and resume
dialogue with Taiwan with vision and open-mindedness.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope to cooperate with Beijing in turning a new
page for relations across the Taiwan Strait," Tsai added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Jan. 1 opening of the "mini three links" is a
major policy measure adopted by the new ROC government to express
its goodwill to mainland China, Tsai said she is hopeful that the
step will mark an end to cross-strait confrontation and a new
beginning for peaceful co-existence and co-prosperity.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
shelve their disputes and reinforce exchanges and consultations to
forge rapprochement and mutual trust.</P>
      <P>"We'll actively promote normalization of full-fledged
cross-strait relations under the premise that our national security
is ensured," Tsai said, adding that the opening of the "mini three
links" marks the first step toward this goal.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said as the two sides will soon be admitted to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), they should increase economic
exchanges and cooperation based on the principles of equality and
reciprocity and even gradually expand constructive interaction to
other fields.</P>
      <P>"And the WTO accession is also expected to provide a framework
and common regulations for wide-ranging cross-strait commercial
exchanges and cooperation and facilitate the establishment of a new
formula for bilateral engagement," Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>Tsai also outlined the MAC's major work plans for the new year,
including continued promotion of the "mini three links;" planning
full-fledged direct cross-strait "trade, mail and transport" links;
reviewing the "no haste, be patient" policy on mainland China-bound
investment; opening the door to mainland Chinese tourists and
strengthening services to Taiwanese-owned companies in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin
said it's still too early to assess whether the opening of the "mini
three links" is a success or a flop.</P>
      <P>"We cannot make any comment on a film when we have only seen its
prologue," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>He said although the "mini three links" have hit some snags
because of mainland China's reluctance to cooperate, the new
opening measure will gradually gain momentum and move forward
smoothly.</P>
      <P>For instance, Lin said mainland China agreed on Thursday to allow
a Kinmen County Government-run passenger ship to sail directly
from Kinmen to Xiamen Friday, with 10 Taiwanese trade association
leaders and three Kinmen County Government officials on board.</P>
      <P>"With goodwill and patience, we believe that the 'mini three
links' will shift into high gear in the not-too-distant future," Lin
said optimistically.</P>
      <P>The New Year gathering was chaired by Shi Hwei-yow, vice
chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, which is
authorized by the ROC government to handle exchanges with the
mainland in the absence of official contact. Vice Economics Minister
Lin Yi-fu and several other government officials also traveled from
Taipei to Kinmen to attend the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FENG SHUI MASTER CONJURES NEW BELIEF FAD IN MOSCOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Chang Hung-kuang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A feng shui master from Taiwan has conjured
up a new belief fad in Moscow recently by forecasting that Russia's
economy will continue to pick up steam under the leadership of
President Vladimir Putin.</P>
      <P>Master Lu Ho-lim, who owns and runs two Taoist temples in eastern
and northern Taiwan respectively, augured that Putin, who was born in
the year of the dragon according to the Chinese Lunar calendar, will
bring a "high degree" of progress in Russia's economic development
during his tenure.</P>
      <P>A "dragon" head of state, with his office -- the Kremlin --
located at a spot which is exactly the "head" of a "dragon spring" in
Red Square, Putin is in the right spot at a right time as a Russian
president, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Tserteli Zurab Konstantinovitch, president of the
Academy of Art of the Russian Federation, who invited Lu to Moscow
for a seminar on feng shui in late January, Lu is one of the most
popular and reputable feng shui specialists in Taiwan, from whom many
high-level members of Taiwan's political spectrum have sought
consultations to shape their political and social strategies.</P>
      <P>Lu has also gained popularity overseas in recent years. He gave
consultations to former Philippine President Corazon Aquino and
helped "improve" the feng shui formation of Corazon's ancestors'
tombs, leading him to be awarded with a Second-grade Medal of
National Honor by the Philippine government in 1991, according to
Konstantinovitch.</P>
      <P>Konstantinovitch said feng shui has gained popularity in Russia
recently, although the influence actually came from the West.
Konstantinovitch, a renowned artist familiar with Chinese culture,
said he is well aware that feng shui originated in China and is part
of the fabric of Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>Feng shui is a Chinese system that studies people's relationships
to the environment in which they live, especially their dwelling or
workspace, in order to achieve maximum harmony with the spiritual
forces perceived to influence all places.</P>
      <P>At the seminar held in Moscow Jan. 31, Lu said he is not
surprised that feng shui has become popular in Russia because feng
shui is one of the "greatest systems in Chinese culture," while the
Russian people are highly culturally-conscious blessed with a rich
cultural legacy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT UNVEILS POSITION PAPER ON CONTINUED CONSTRUCTION OF NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) unveiled
Friday its position paper on the continued construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT reiterated its position that it wants to see the existing
first, second and third nuclear power plants decommissioned and the
continued construction of the fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT released the position paper on the nuclear plant, a pet
project of the KMT before it was swept out of power last March, two
days after the Legislative Yuan voted in a resolution for the
continued construction of the plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT said that although the Council of Grand Justices stopped
short of saying in a recent ruling that the Cabinet's decision to
scrap the construction of the plant last October was
"unconstitutional," it pointed out that there were "procedural flaws"
in that the executive branch failed to consult with the legislature
on such a major national policy change.</P>
      <P>The ruling, according to the KMT, is tantamount to declaring that
the policy making process of the Executive Yuan violated the law.</P>
      <P>The KMT noted that the public has suffered because of the "wrong"
policy of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, saying that while
the ruling of the Council of Grand Justices could have ended the
impasse between the legislative and executive yuans, the executive
branch had "arrogantly" insisted that the abrupt decision was only
"procedurally flawed" but not "unconstitutional."</P>
      <P>The KMT said that the grand justices have said unequivocally that
passing of the plant's budget by the legislature is "tantamount to a
legal bill" and that the suspension of the implementation of the
related budget plans should be considered a major change of policy
which needs legislative endorsement. If the Legislative Yuan is not
involved, according to the KMT paper, the executive branch's move
"obviously" contravenes the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lashing out at the Cabinet's decision to keep the legislature out
of a major national policy change as not an act in accordance with
the Constitution, the KMT paper said the Cabinet is "trampling on the
will of the people."</P>
      <P>The KMT said that because of the Executive Yuan's "flawed
procedure," the suspension of the construction of the fourth nuclear
power plant is costing more than NT$10 million (US$308.640) per day,
adding that "wrong" policy is worse than corruption.</P>
      <P>The KMT also used the occasion to publish a poll on the
controversial nuclear plant which showed that 49.3 percent of the
respondents are in favor of continued construction.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Foundation, a KMT think tank, conducted the
survey Jan. 31 in a telephone poll of 1,031 people, with a margin of
error of 2.99 percent.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 49.3 percent of the respondents are in favor
of continued construction of the fourth plant, not building a fifth
nuclear power plant, and phasing out the first, second and third
nuclear plants, depending on the situation of the nation's power
supply.</P>
      <P>Those who are not favor of such a proposal accounted for 27.8
percent, and those who have no opinion accounted for 22.8 percent.</P>
      <P>Professor Chang Chung-yuan of National Chengchi University said
that the KMT had exercised extreme caution in its decision to
construct the fourth nuclear plant, adding that during long years of
debate, supporters of the fourth nuclear plant have continued to
maintain a ratio of between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
population, while the percentage of those who are opposed to the
construction has hovered at around 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the decision making process was "careful and
slow" and that the DPP government based its decision on "only 30
percent of the people" when it made its "rash" decision in just a few
months.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Friday that Taiwan will be able to use its strengths in
agricultural technology as a bargaining chip to enter into
negotiations with Beijing after joining the World Trade Organization

      <P>Lu said while visiting a chicken farm in Tainan County that
Taiwan will be able to show the mainland's high-ranking officials who
visit the island that the mainland's egg producing processes can also
be technologically improved. Mainland Chinese officials are scheduled
to visit the island after July 1, when Taiwan is expected to join the
WTO.</P>
      <P>She suggested that Taiwan use its advanced agricultural
technology to help the mainland's population of 1.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Tainan County, a former agriculture-based region, has
successfully combined its traditional agriculture industry with
high-technology, thus improving the quality of its products, Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she also announced that the Technology Consultant

      <P>Taiwan' high-class imported car market has
not been affected by the island's economic slowdown, according to
sales statistics for January.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is experiencing economic hardships due to
businesses transferring operations overseas, the depreciation in the

that demands for imported cars have been relatively unaffected.</P>
      <P>Germany's Mercedes-Benz sold 1,468 new cars in Taiwan in January,
topping the list of foreign car sales for the month with a 18.3
percent share of the total car market and a sales rate increase of

which sold 1,117 new cars and had a 14.4 percent share of Taiwan's
total car market last month, representing a sales rate increase
of 122.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mazda and Ford sold 898 and 584 new cars last month,
respectively. Among high-class imported car manufacturers, BMW was
the only one to experience a decrease in sales, with a 34.5 percent
drop from December's sales level. It sold only 492 new cars in
January, the statistics showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' SEE ANOTHER BREAKTHROUGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The stagnant "mini three links" saw yet
another breakthrough Friday when a 13-member group traveled directly
to the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen from Taiwan's frontline island
of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>It was the second Taiwan group to make a direct voyage to Xiamen
from Kinmen since the "mini three links" were opened Jan. 1. On Jan.
2, Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai led a large delegation of
local government officials and residents on an icebreaking direct
sail to Xiamen for a goodwill visit.</P>
      <P>Friday's voyage between Taiwan's defense outpost and the
nearby mainland port city also marked the first time that a vessel
carrying non-Kinmen residents has been permitted to sail directly to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The 200-ton Kinmen County Government-owned "Taiwu" carrying 10
Taiwan businessmen with investments in mainland China and three
Kinmen County Government officials left Kinmen at 1:10 p.m. and
safely docked in Xiamen at 3:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>On Friday morning, the 10 Taiwan businessmen, including Huang
Tieh-jung, president of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in Xiamen,
attended a New Year gathering in Kinmen of senior executives of
Taiwanese trade associations in major mainland cities.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's "mini three links" policy, only residents of
Kinmen and Matsu traveling on Taiwan vessels are allowed to travel
directly to Xiamen and Fuzhou. Other travelers must still go through
Hong Kong or other third places.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refer to direct trade, transport and
postal links between the Republic of China's frontline island
of Kinmen and Matsu and Xiamen and Fuzhou cities in the southeastern
mainland province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said Friday's voyage was
approved on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has given the cold shoulder to the
Taiwan-initiated "mini three links" program, making it difficult
for Taiwan ships carrying passengers to sail directly to the
mainland on a regular basis over the past month. But it surprisingly
agreed to Friday's voyage on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Tieh-jung said Xiamen now has more than 50,000 Taiwan
business people. "I hope the voyage can set an example and help break
all bottlenecks to facilitate Taiwan businessmen's travel across the
Taiwan Strait via Kinmen," he added.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman of the quasi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), echoed Huang's views, praising mainland
China's approval of the voyage in a pragmatic manner. "We hope
the door for cross-strait exchanges will become increasingly wider
in the future," he urged. SEF is an intermediary body authorized by
the ROC government to handle exchanges with the mainland in the
absence of official contact.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Government officials said the stalemate in direct
Kinmen-Xiamen shipping links is expected to thaw after the Chinese
New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the county government has
received a number of applications for direct sail from Kinmen
to Xiamen in February.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 6, a group of elderly Kinmen residents who have been
stranded in the Fujian area since late 1940s will make a direct
voyage from Xiamen to their hometown for a four-day visit. On the
same day, a Lee clan delegation will travel directly from Kinmen to
Xiamen for a goodwill visit.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 15, opposition New Party Legislator Lee Chu-feng will
lead a delegation to travel from Kinmen to Beijing via Xiamen to
take part in a road race.</P>

(By Herman Pan and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. semiconductor manufacturer Atmel
Corp. announced Friday that the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit has upheld its claim that Winbond Electronics Corp. of Taiwan
and two other companies have infringed on an Atmel-held patent.</P>
      <P>The San Jose, Calif.-based company said in a press release that
it has won a "major and significant" patent infringement dispute
against Winbond, U.S.-based Silicon Storage Technologies (SST), and
Sanyo Electric Co. of Japan two weeks after the court heard oral
arguments.</P>
      <P>According to the court ruling, the companies violated Section 337
of the Tariff Act. Consequently, all SST, Winbond, and Sanyo EPROMs,
EEPROMs, Flash Memory and Flash Microcontroller semiconductor devices
that infringed on Atmel's patent as well as all circuit boards
containing such devices are precluded from entry into the United
States.</P>
      <P>The Federal Circuit also vacated and remanded the International
Trade Commission's earlier determination that Taiwan-based Macronix
International and Macronix America did not infringe on the same U.S.
Patent No. 4,451,903.</P>
      <P>Originally applied for by U.S.-based Seeq Technology and

    <HEADLINE>BRITAIN REITERATES NO USE OF FORCE IN RESOLVING 'TAIWAN ISSUE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The British government has reiterated in
a recent report to the Parliament its firm opposition to the use of
force in resolving the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>The report also reaffirmed Britain's commitment to continued
promotion of non-official relations with Taiwan, despite the absence
of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The report further said the British government will agree to
private visits by ministerial-level Taiwan officials to help
strengthen bilateral substantive relations.</P>
      <P>The report, prepared by the British Foreign and
Commonwealth Office (FCO), was a response to a China policy paper
presented by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons
last November.</P>
      <P>According to the FCO report, the British government has made it
clear to both Taiwan and mainland China that the United
Kingdom has consistently opposed the use of force to settle the
so-called Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>The report said Britain believes that a cross-Taiwan Strait
military conflict would destabilize the Asia-Pacific region and even
other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>Any move resorting to the use of force in the Taiwan Strait will
cause Britain's grave concern, the report said, adding that Britain
thinks that Taiwan's future should be decided through peaceful
dialogue between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The report said although Britain does not recognize Taiwan as a
sovereign state, it is Britain's established policy to develop
cooperative ties in the commercial, educational, scientific and
cultural fields.</P>
      <P>While Britain cannot accept official visits by senior Taiwan
officials, the report said, it welcomes their visits in private
capacity to help boost bilateral commercial, educational,
technological and cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report said, Britain will encourage its
Cabinet ministers and their deputies to visit Taiwan for similar
promotional purposes.</P>
      <P>The report went on to say that Britain is delighted to see
Taiwan's achievements in political democratization and economic
liberalization, particularly its peaceful transfer of power between
different political parties through last March's free, fair election.</P>
      <P>The report also recognized mainland China's growing political
and economic clout in the international community. It pointed out
that Britain's interest lies in pushing mainland China's politics,
economy and society to move in a positive direction.</P>
      <P>While stressing Britain's business interests on the mainland,
the report also expressed British concern about mainland China's
human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>The report said although Britain's efforts to push mainland
China to improve its human rights records have so far achieved
limited results, the British government will continue using its every
possible influence to include mainland China into the global system
and push it to improve human rights records and reinforce rule
of law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANNUAL U.S.-ROC BUSINESS CONFERENCE TO BE HELD IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.   2  (CNA)
(By Herman Y.C. Pan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-Republic of China Business
Council announced on Friday that its 25th annual joint business
conference with the ROC-U.S. Business Council will be held in Boston,
Massachusetts, Sept. 17-19.</P>
      <P>The conference is the highest level annual business meeting
between the two countries and attracts approximately 500 corporate
leaders and government officials from both the United States and
Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration is expected to follow the tradition begun
in 1992 of sending a Cabinet member to make a keynote address at the
opening of the conference. Last year, the Clinton administration sent
Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater to attend the 24th annual
conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Rupert J. Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-ROC Business
Council said that this year's conference will focus on information
technology and biotechnology as they relate to U.S.-ROC business and
trade relations.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has played an important role in the global IT
economy and has become one of the world's most significant producers
of high technology products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesses are in a unique position in the technology
supply chain as American companies are increasingly relying on
Taiwan's personal computer and semiconductor industries to supply
them with high quality, low cost components, he added.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-ROC Business Council said in a press release that "there
are noteworthy opportunities for strategic alliances and
collaborative research, and, given Taiwan's strategic location,
collaboration may provide an opening for opportunities in mainland
China and Southeast Asia."</P>
      <P>For the past 25 years, the two councils have hosted the annual
joint business conference alternately between the United States and
Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Philip Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank will launch a
four-day poverty forum in Manila beginning Feb. 5 as part of its
continuing efforts to fight poverty in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>About 200 delegates from member countries, donor agencies,
non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions will debate
how best to address the needs of the poor and work toward reaching a
Consensus on strategies for reducing poverty.</P>
      <P>The forum, titled "Reforming Policies and Institutions for
Poverty Reduction," will revolve around three key issues: forming
consensus for poverty reduction, getting the ingredients of pro-poor
growth, and tackling the vulnerability and improving the situation of
groups bypassed by the growth process.</P>
      <P>Speakers will include Nobel Laureate and professor Robert Mundell
from the Department of Economics at Columbia University in New York
and Michael Lipton, research professor and director of the Poverty
Research Unit at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>"The vision of an Asia-Pacific region free from poverty provides
the ADB with a clear and single-minded mission. Poverty reduction is
no longer just one of the objectives, it is now ADB's overarching
goal," said ADB President Tadao Chino.</P>
      <P>To date, close to 900 million of the world's poor, who live on
less than a dollar a day, reside in the Asia-Pacific region. Nearly
one in three Asians are classified as poor. The recent financial
crisis has not only slowed down the pace of poverty reduction, but
has also resulted in a considerable increase in the number of poor
people in the region.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's most wanted smuggling and corruption
suspect won a court battle in Vancouver, Canada, on Friday after he
and his wife were told they could live under house arrest in their
luxury condo in a suburb of the city under certain strict security
conditions.</P>
      <P>An adjudicator with the Immigration and Refugee Board said Lai
Changxing and his wife Tsang Mingna could stay in their Burnaby home
while awaiting a refugee hearing.</P>
      <P>Citizenship and Immigration officials immediately served notice
to Lai's lawyers that they would seek a stay of the decision next
week in Federal Court.</P>
      <P>For now, Lai and his wife will remain in detention until they can
meet the adjudicator's conditions, said Joshua Sohn, one of the
lawyers who has been acting for the couple.</P>
      <P>Lai is at the center of a huge probe into corruption in Communist
China's coastal Fujian province. Communist Chinese authorities allege
he masterminded a network responsible for smuggling US$10 billion
worth of goods into mainland China, protected by corrupt officials.</P>
      <P>Lai and his wife came to Canada in 1999 using Hong Kong
passports. They have been in custody since their arrests last
November.</P>
      <P>To comply with the adjudicator's requirements, a security firm,
Intercon Security Ltd., must enter into a contract with Lai's law
firm to ensure the couple cannot escape from the condo.</P>
      <P>Intercon said the Lais were prepared to pay C$20,000 a week for
the arrangement.</P>
      <P>The couple has applied for refugee status, but no hearing date
has been set. A conditional departure order has also been issued
against them by Citizenship and Immigration.</P>
      <P>Lai and his wife fear arrest, trial, and the death penalty "and
that is a powerful motivating force to not appear for removal,"
Immigration official Jim Murray argued before the board.</P>
      <P>He also said the house-arrest proposal creates a "two-tier
detention system -- the rich get a condo and hand-picked security
while the poor go to jail."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS SAY DPP'S NUKE DECISION AMOUNTS TO `CONSTITUTIONAL COUP'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 3 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars and legislators said at
a Saturday seminar that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's claim that his
unilateral decision to halt the fourth nuclear power plant project
was not unconstitutional amounted to a kind of "constitutional coup."</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University professor of political science Chang
Lin-cheng said that the Council of Grand Justices in its Jan. 15
ruling was merely trying to give the Executive Yuan a "face saving"
way out when it cited only a procedural flaw in the premier's
decision.</P>
      <P>She argued that the grand justices were in fact urging the
Cabinet to quickly remedy the error or else be found in violation of
the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>If the Executive Yuan continues to "drag its feet obstinately,"
she went on, the current impasse between the executive and the
legislative arms of the government will remain unsolvable.</P>
      <P>She charged that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's insistence on its lack of any wrongdoing was not
only "a closed option" but was also demonstrating the DPP's disregard
for the "rules of the game" in a democratic system.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP has proposed passing a referendum bill and an
energy bill to serve as alternative solutions to break the deadlock,
she called such measures "too slow to rescue the critical situation."</P>
      <P>The premier's sudden Oct. 27 announcement to scrap the partially
completed nuclear power plant project met with strong resistance from
the opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan, which passed a resolution
Jan. 31 calling for a reversal to that decision after the grand
justices ruled that the Executive Yuan needed to consult with the
legislative body before making a decision on such a major policy
issue.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has refused to accept the resolution as
binding and has called for negotiations between the Legislative Yuan
and itself to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same seminar, which was organized by the National
Policy Foundation, an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) think tank, People
First Party Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said that "each of the grand
justices would surely have a heart attack" if the DPP continued to
claim its decision was neither illegal nor unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tina Wei-kang Pan said that the KMT is not
dwelling on the issue of whether or not the plant should be built,
but rather on the constitutional issue. She added that if the
Executive Yuan continues to ignore the legislative resolution, which
calls for the project's immediate resumption, then negotiations will
not be able to take place.</P>
      <P>Pan urged the DPP not to "play with the law," saying that if it
does so, then the Legislative Yuan will not rule out the possibility
of a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet or a recall motion
against the president.</P>
      <P>Chinese Cultural University professor of political science Yang
Tai-shun said that although he supports the ideal of a nuclear-free
homeland as the anti-nuclear DPP has long advocated, the pressing
issue facing Taiwan today is of a constitutional nature.</P>
      <P>He urged the DPP not to "play with words" and to respect the law
where the law is clear and the spirit of the law where it is not so
clear, instead of "unyieldingly holding fast to its position."</P>
      <P>Yang said that the Executive Yuan should be the one responsible
for resolving the dilemma at this stage, adding that it has taken a
passive attitude instead of coming up with any substantial measures.</P>
      <P>"A nuclear-free homeland is not just a slogan," but an issue that
needs to be resolved, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MANUFACTURING SECTOR TO INVEST NT$5OO B. IN 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) in
an analysis Saturday estimated that Taiwan's private manufacturing
sector will invest NT$500 billion (US$15.62 billion) in major
projects for the year 2001, with the hope that the actual amount may
surpass the previous year's record breaking level of NT$725 billion.</P>
      <P>IDB Director General Shih Yen-hsiang said that investments by
domestic private high-tech manufacturers for this year are expected
to account for 60 percent to 70 percent of the total amount of
investments by Taiwan's manufacturing sector, with investments in
TFT-LCD, optical telecommunications, wireless telecommunications, and
biotechnology and semiconductor-related equipment looking promising.</P>
      <P>Taking this year's economic outlook into account, Shih said the
IDB set the domestic private manufacturing sector investment target
at less than last year's total. He added, however, that giving
consideration simultaneously to the island's economic growth, he
hopes the actual investment amount will exceed the IDB's set goal.</P>
      <P>Last year, the total amount of investments by the domestic
private high-tech manufacturing sector in major projects was
relatively high, while that of the traditional manufacturing sector
was relatively low. The IDB plans to promote investments by Taiwan's
traditional manufacturing industries more vigorously this year, Shih
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan students studying in
mainland China formed an association in Taipei Saturday, the first
of its kind, to promote their legitimate rights and interests.</P>
      <P>The founding members included more than 30 Taiwan students
now studying in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Guangzhou,
Xiamen and other major mainland cities.</P>
      <P>Chu Jung-pin, a doctoral degree candidate at Peking University
who has been elected chairman of the new student association, said
the group is open to the participation of Taiwan students studying
at colleges, universities and graduate institutes throughout the
mainland.</P>
      <P>"The association is primarily aimed at facilitating contacts
among Taiwan students on the mainland, protecting their rights and
interests, and promoting academic and cultural exchanges and peaceful
interaction across the Taiwan Strait," Chu explained.</P>
      <P>He said the association has yet to register with relevant Taiwan
authorities. "We intend to be a non-partisan group, and we hope all
major Taiwan political parties, such as the Kuomintang (KMT), the
Democratic Progressive Party and the People First Party, will support
our cause and make concerted efforts to create the best possible
future for cross-strait relations," he added.</P>
      <P>Shen Heng-teh, who has a doctorate in law from Peking
University, said Taiwan students in mainland China needs an
organization to facilitate horizontal contacts and protect their own
legitimate rights and interests.</P>
      <P>"Our newly formed association does not have any political
inclination, and our main purposes are protecting our own rights and
helping boost cross-strait academic and cultural exchanges," Shen
noted.</P>
      <P>Among the well-wishers was KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung, who
said he has attended the inaugural ceremony to throw his support
for the new student association.</P>
      <P>Ting said it's an opportune time for the establishment of
such a group to help promote Taiwan students' rights and
cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"Those who travel to the mainland for study are pioneers for
cross-strait relations as it's the best way to understand mainland
people's ways of thinking and life and to make friends with
them," Ting remarked.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that cross-strait tension and rivalry are
rooted in both sides' failure to face up to the reality. Ting
cited Taiwan's reluctance to recognize mainland China's academic
accreditation as an example of impracticality.</P>
      <P>Ting said pushing for Taiwan's recognition of the mainland
academic qualification should be the new student group's
priority task.</P>
      <P>In addition, Ting said the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council should offer scholarships to encourage Taiwan
students to study in mainland China and cultivate competent
mainland affairs experts.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan neither recognizes mainland China's academic
accreditation nor requires those studying on the mainland to
register, the actual number of Taiwan students there remains a
"riddle." Ting estimated the number at more than 10,000.</P>
      <P>Most mainland China-bound Taiwan students study politics,
economics and Chinese medicine, and many of them are in their 30s
or 40s and already have rich working experiences, student sources
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
confirmed Saturday that he and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung were both
invited to President Chen Shui-bian's official residence the previous
day and will meet again Monday to continue consultations.</P>
      <P>Wang added that although a definite time and manner of meeting
has not been set, he will send out the invitation after first
discussing related issues with the legislative opposition alliance at
10 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration have been locked in heated debate over Chang's Oct. 27
announcement to scrap the partially completed fourth nuclear power
plant project without prior consultations with the
opposition-dominated Legislature.</P>
      <P>The president offered to serve as a mediator after Chang refused
to acknowledge that a Jan. 31 legislative resolution calling for an
immediate reversal of his decision was binding.</P>
      <P>In an apparent breakthrough, Wang said that the Executive Yuan
and Legislative Yuan were "gradually reconciling their differences"
and claimed that although the president did not explicitly say the
project will be resumed, "everyone has a tacit understanding."</P>
      <P>Wang said that the president asked each of them to work
separately to resolve the differences within their own camps.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Whip Ker Chien-ming said at a party function in
Hsinchu that he had reached a consensus with Chang the previous
evening.</P>
      <P>After the NT$123.8 billion (US$3.8 billion) allocated for the
nuclear plant project runs out in 2002, he continued, any future
addition to the budget will have to be decided by the new Legislature
to be elected at the end of this year, implying that the DPP caucus
may allow the existing budget to run out completely before making any
further decisions on the issue.</P>
      <P>Only NT$50 billion (US$1.5 billion) of that budget has been used
so far, he added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, however, he said that it was unlikely the
Executive Yuan will announce Monday a resumption in the project
because the opposition alliance has yet to "make a concrete response"
to the Executive Yuan's proposal to draft a referendum law or an
energy bill to help resolve the issue.</P>

      <P>One hundred and fifty practitioners and
supporters of Zhong Gong, a form of Chinese kung fu which emphasizes
the use of inner strength to toughen one's body, staged a parade
Friday around Guam to call for the release of founder Zhang Hongbao,

Hongbao in Guam, sent a petition on behalf of the alliance to the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
as the head of state, he is obligated to ensure the country's overall
security and sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Addressing members of an association of Ilan County natives
residing in Taipei, President Chen said the Hollywood film "A Perfect
Storm," which he saw during the Chinese New Year holiday, has given
him much inspiration.</P>
      <P>In the film, the skipper of a fishing vessel ignores a severe
storm warning and heads out to sea on a fishing mission. In the end,
the boat is swallowed by the storm and all the crew members are lost
at sea.</P>
      <P>"I learned much from the film. I think the greatest duty of a
skipper is to ensure the safety of his ship and crew members," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Likening himself to the skipper of a fishing boat, Chen said that
"trying to catch the largest possible amount of fish" is not his only
duty. "My biggest responsibility is safeguarding our national
security and ensuring sustainable development."</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also for the first time sounded conciliatory
notes concerning the protracted row between his administration and
the opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan over the issue of whether
to resume or permanently halt construction on the fourth nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>Chen said a setback does not mean a permanent failure. "If we
can't catch any fish this time, then we can try again next time.
There will be new opportunities," he pointed out, adding that "as
long as we don't forsake our goal and as long as we continue to make
efforts, we'll succeed one day."</P>
      <P>President Chen invited Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Legislative
Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to his residence Friday to exchange
views on a possible compromise or measures to break the deadlock over
the nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>As the Democratic Progressive Party has long held to an
anti-nuclear platform, Chen has reportedly been attempting to
persuade the party's diehard nuclear opponents to soften their stance
and accept a compromise with the opposition-controlled Legislature,
which already passed a resolution demanding an immediate resumption
of construction on the controversial power plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT COMMON MARKET AIMED AT RESOLVING 'ONE CHINA' ROW: EX-PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew said Saturday
that his call for the formation of a "common market" across the
Taiwan Strait is aimed at helping resolve the Taiwan-mainland China
row over the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on cross-strait relations, Siew said he is
convinced that the formation of a cross-strait common market
would enable the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to move from
economic cooperation toward "co-sharing" of sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Siew, who has been pitching for cross-strait common market for
some time, further said that in addition to resolving political
conflicts, the "common market" concept can also bring concrete
economic benefits to both sides at a time when both the mainland
and Taiwan economies are at a critical juncture of transformation.</P>
      <P>Siew suggested that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait spend 20
to 30 years promoting economic integration to lay a foundation for
political integration.</P>
      <P>"And the first step to reach this goal is that the two sides
sign an agreement on the formation of a common market and a number
of other basic treaties to pave the way for integration of
currencies, taxation and other relevant systems," Siew explained.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan and mainland authorities to shed old-fashioned
thinking and cooperate in establishing a new
trade-and-economy-oriented framework for bilateral interaction to
facilitate normalization of cross-strait trade ties.</P>
      <P>"The two sides can learn from the formation of the European
Union in establishing a Chinese or cross-strait common market," Siew
said, adding that Taiwan should adjust its defensive "no haste,
be patient" policy on mainland China-bound investment and open
direct trade, mail and transport links to boost
constructive interaction.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An undeveloped natural beach in a wildlife
reserve zone located at the southernmost tip of Taiwan has been
tainted by fuel leaking from a Greek cargo ship that ran aground near
Kenting National Park in Pintung County, environmental officials said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>About 1,100 tons of fuel have seeped from the tank of the
freighter Amorgos which went aground half a mile off the coast of
Oluanpi on Jan. 14 while enroute from Singapore to Guangzhou,
mainland China carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore.</P>
      <P>Although all 25 Romanian crew members were rescued by coast guard
after the vessel lost mobility and sent out a distress signal on the
night of the accident, the ship was left at the scene and has since
broken into two parts.</P>
      <P>Three days after the accident, an oil slick measuring about six
hectares in area and fifty centimeters in thickness that has formed
on the surface of the sea near the site of the accident has reached
the shore and blanketed a three-mile stretch of coral reef along the
beach inside Kenting National Park's Lungkeng wildlife reserve.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan agent of the ship owner has recruited more than a
hundred workers to begin collecting the spilled oil near the coast,
but strong winds have thwarted their efforts to prevent the spread of
the oil spill and its approach to the beach.</P>
      <P>The agent has also retained a Singaporean vessel to pump out the
200 tons of fuel still remaining in the ship's tank, but the work is
progressing slowly because of rough seas.</P>
      <P>The Pingtung County Government has fined the ship owner
NT$300,000 for contamination and has ordered it to come up with a
mop-up plan or risk being fined daily.</P>
      <P>This is the second oil contamination Taiwan has experienced in
the last two decades, and it could take ten years before the beach's
wild life fully recovers, said experts.</P>

exchanges following the opening of the "mini three links" last month.</P>
      <P>In a joint conference of the directors and supervisors of the

links between Taiwan's offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
selected ports in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wang Shui-chang, president of the Kinmen Red Cross Society, said
that even before the opening of the "mini three links," his society

occurred in the Taiwan Strait and also the repatriation of mainland
fishermen, winning a positive response from the mainland China Red
Cross Society.</P>
      <P>With the opening of the "mini three links, it is expected that

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT COULD BE URGED TO RECLAIM PROPERTY GIVEN TO KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A member of the Control Yuan is set to ask
the government to demand the return of property given by it freely to
the Kuomintang, reported the China Times on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The donations, although technically legal a formality, were
made to the detriment of the government and have eroded the wall that
separates the government from political parties, said Huang
Huang-hsiung, a member of the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said he will come up with a motion at a meeting of the Control
Yuan Wednesday demanding the government remedy the situation,
probably by asking for the return of these properties.</P>
      <P>Most of the property was given to the Kuomintang during the 1950s
and 1960s when the island was firmly in the party's grip, according
to Huang's investigation.</P>
      <P>The party took over a hundred pieces of property from the
Japanese authorities in Taiwan in 1954 and the government allowed the
party to be registered as the owner of these lands and buildings used
by it in 1954 when the island was set to implement its
constitution, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang called the move "questionable" since there was no legal
justification for the transfer of government property to a private
group without payment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Huang said, the government handed over 19 theaters
it took over from the Japanese authorities to a Kuomintang firm in
1947. None of these theaters are operating now, and Huang demanded
that the government be brought to account for how the lands and
buildings were disposed of.</P>
      <P>Huang said much of the property for the Kuomintang's district
offices was donated to it by local governments in the late 1970s and
early 1980s . Although these donations were approved according to the
guidelines on local autonomy by local councils which were dominated
by Kuomintang members at the time, the transfer of public property to
a political party is a controversial matter, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Chang Che-chen, the director general of the Kuomintang
Administrative Committee, said on Friday that all of the party's
assets were acquired properly according to the rules of the time and
that this fact has been confirmed by lawyers and public accountants
entrusted by the party to manage the assets.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang accumulated huge assets during the five decades it
was in power. It has been accused by critics for using the assets for
political gain.</P>

      <P>According to the U.S.-based website chinesenewsnet.com, Qian will

    <HEADLINE>RUMOR OF PREMIER'S DISCONTENT WITH CHEN DENIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communication between President Chen
Shui-bian and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has been good, and it is
untrue that Chang is discontented with the president's delay in
helping seek a compromise with the opposition on the fourth nuclear
power plant issue, ranking sources at the Presidential Office said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, it is true that Premier Chang has come
under strong pressure as a front-runner in the fight against the
resumption of construction of the fourth nuclear power plant. But
they denied the rumor that Chang is upset with Chen dragging his feet
on stepping forward to find common ground with the opposition parties
on the controversial issue.</P>
      <P>Amid widespread speculation that the Executive Yuan may announce
the resumption of construction on the plant as soon as Monday, the
sources only reiterated that President Chen will come forth to work
out a compromise between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan
if such a move becomes necessary.</P>
      <P>It is understood that ranking officials with the Presidential
Office and the Executive Yuan will launch a campaign to convince the
anti-nuclear ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to support the
resumption of construction.</P>
      <P>Although DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh is currently on a visit to the
U.S., other DPP heavyweights, such as former Chairman Lin I-hsiung,
Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen and Legislator Tsai Trong-rong, have
been reluctant to clarify their stance regarding the issue amid
questioning from reporters.</P>
      <P>It is assumed that members of the DPP's Central Standing
Committee will discuss how to handle the aftermath during their
weekly meeting next Wednesday should construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant be resumed.</P>
      <P>However, Legislator Chang Chun-hung, a faction leader within the
DPP, has insisted on holding a public referendum to decide the
ultimate fate of the plant, adding that he will join forces with
other opinion leaders in building Taiwan into a homeland free from
nuclear power through legislation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Fong-cheng, secretary-general of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT), called on the government to allow for
the resumption of construction as soon as possible, pointing out that
"the public is no longer willing to watch this farce continue."</P>
      <P>Stressing that the minority should comply with the opinion of the
majority in a democracy, Lin sincerely urged the entire society to
stop wasting further resources on the matter and asked the DPP to
forge an internal consensus first before rekindling negotiations with
the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>As to the proposal that the Legislative Yuan enact a national
energy law to resolve the dilemma, relevant policy-making officials
in the KMT emphasized that they are not at the present time
considering doing so as such a move would have a negative impact on
the future interaction between the executive and legislative branches
of government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said Sunday
that it has traced ground poultry powder imported from affected
European countries and has found no evidence of the presence of mad
cow disease in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The COA released the results of its investigation after recent
reports in Europe said that many countries, including Taiwan, have
imported the remains of affected beef and animal bone powder and were
in danger of having cases of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), pop up in their backyards.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that Taiwan has banned the
importation of ground powder, beef bone powder, meat powder, stud
beef, and stud sheep from affected European countries since 1990.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the council's most recent investigation showed that
Taiwan did import three batches, or hundreds of tons of each batch
of poultry powder, but not beef remains, from affected areas in
Europe between 1990 and 1995.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the three batches of poultry powder were imported
by a large domestic feed company and that the company had used the
three batches for domestic fowl and maritime feed, adding that it has
not used any of the powder as beef or sheep feed.</P>
      <P>To avoid the possibility of the outbreak of mad cow disease, the
bureau recently collected 820 cow brains from southern, central, and
northern Taiwan to see if any had BSE, but it has so far not detected
any such symptoms.</P>
      <P>BSE was first detected in Britain in the late 1980s, and a
growing number of cases of the disease have been reported in several
European countries.</P>
      <P>The spread of the disease is believed to be caused by grazing
animals feeding on the ground-up remains of infected animals.</P>

      <P>Some 952,835 individuals have registered as
members of the Kuomintang, with 100,080 new members included among
that total, the opposition party announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled the island for more than five decades before
being swept from power in last March's presidential election,
launched a member re-registration campaign last September to solidify
the party's support base. The campaign ended Jan. 31.</P>
      <P>In terms of the gender makeup of the registered members, males
accounted for an overwhelming 70 percent of the total.</P>
      <P>Some 70 percent of the total number were over the age of 40,
showing that the party still has to make more efforts to entice
younger voters.</P>
      <P>Breaking down the numbers according to profession, those in the
agricultural and fishery industries accounted for 18.6 percent, those
in the business sector accounted for 15.74 percent, laborers
accounted for 10.83 percent, and teachers, military personnel, and
government employee together accounted for 8.97 percent, with
the remaining 45.6 percent coming from other fields.</P>
      <P>In terms of counties and cities, Lienchiang County (Matsu) had
the highest rate of registration at 85.86 percent, followed by Kinmen
County at 83.48 percent. Taipei city's registration rate was 57.27
percent, while Kaohsiung City's was 46.24 percent. Taipei County's
registration rate was not so high, measuring only 40.06 percent,
while Nantou County and Miaoli County's rates were even lower at less
than 40 percent.</P>
      <P>The military community, which traditionally gave its support to
the KMT until recent years, also recorded a fair registration rate of
78.21 percent, which the KMT said it was quite satisfied with.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director of the KMT's Commission of Organization

members may have found it difficult to re-register because of the
change in power brought by the election of the Democratic Progressive

      <P>He said that the KMT will not revoke the membership of those who
did not re-register and that the party will welcome those individuals
back to the fold any time.</P>
      <P>KMT officials also said that those who have not re-registered
will still be counted as KMT members but will not be able to exercise
their membership rights to vote directly for a party chairman or to

      <P>Wang, who is also vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang,
which holds a majority in the Legislature, met Monday with
representatives from the opposition coalition, comprised of members
from the KMT, People First Party, and New Party, to seek a final

project.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers agreed that it should be the Executive

continue to be executed until 2003 when a new Legislature, to be
elected later this year, will decide on a new budget plan.</P>
      <P>They also agreed that concrete plans should be worked out to
allow Taiwan to become a "nuclear-free" land, with the existing three
nuclear power plants to be gradually phased out and no further plants
to be constructed after the fourth one is built.</P>
      <P>Amid reports over the weekend that Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian of the anti-nuclear Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
has proposed a compromise on the power plant project, the Executive
Yuan is expected to finalize a blueprint for resuming construction on
the plant, with a formal announcement expected as early as Monday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Party Whip at the Legislative Yuan Chou Po-lun
said DPP legislators will assume neither a "for or against" position
toward the issue if the Executive Yuan indeed comes up with an
announcement Monday afternoon to reverse its earlier decision to
scrap the nuclear power plant project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POWELL SAYS U.S. OBLIGED TO HELP TAIWAN MAINTAIN DEFENSE CAPABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
said Sunday that the United States has an obligation to help Taiwan
maintain an adequate level of defense capability so that it can
defend itself against any military threats.</P>
      <P>In his first television interview since taking office last week,
Powell declined to comment on whether the Bush administration is
inclined to sell Aegis-equipped destroyers or other advanced weapons
to Taiwan, saying only that the decision-making process will be
"deliberate" and that the cross-strait situation will have to be
taken into consideration.</P>
      <P>Speaking on ABC's talk show "This Week", he said the United
States has to "make sure that it remains strong in the region"
because the American military presence is "sort of the flywheel that
keeps the whole region in a rather stable situation".</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new administration will sell Aegis-class
destroyers or other advanced weapons systems to Taiwan, Powell said
officials will examine what Taiwan has asked to purchase from the
United States before the annual arms sales talks take place in the
spring.</P>
      <P>"We will make our decisions on individual weapons systems in
accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, the various communiques
(between the United States and mainland China), as well as with what
Congress has said with respect to the enhancement of Taiwan's defense
capability," Powell said.</P>
      <P>"But it'll be done in a way that is deliberate, with a full
understanding of the implications of the effect of each one of these
weapons systems sales on relations between Taiwan and mainland
China", he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing has warned Washington against selling the advanced
warships to Taiwan, and mainland officials have privately warned that
any such sales would trigger a strong reaction from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese officials have often cited a 1982 Sino-U.S.
communique which they said restricts the continuation of U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan. Quoting from the so-called "August 17 Joint
Communique," the host of the "This Week" television program Sam
Donaldson said the language suggests that the sale of Aegis
destroyers would be "off-base".</P>
      <P>Powell said, however, that the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and the
various Sino-U.S. communiques "suggest that we have an obligation to
Taiwan to make sure that their level of defense capability remains
constant over time and that they are in a position to defend
themselves against any threats that might come their way".</P>
      <P>"And so we will always be looking for that balance in our arms
sales policy with respect to Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Aegis-class destroyers, Taiwan is also seeking
to purchase submarines and other military hardware.</P>
      <P>Observers in Washington have attached great significance to what,
if anything, the Bush administration decides to sell to Taiwan this
year because this will be the first round of arms sales talks since
the change in administrations in Washington and in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RECEIVES ANTI-NUCLEAR ACTIVISTS TO HELP SOLVE NUKE IMPASSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian received activists
from various anti-nuclear groups Monday to try to quell long-standing
opposition to the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The meeting took place amid reports that the stalemate over the
nuclear power plant issue will soon end and the Cabinet will announce
the resumption of construction on the plant after intervention by the
president.</P>
      <P>Chen has actively sought over the last few days to form a
consensus within the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which
made an anti-nuclear stance part its party platform, for the
resumption of construction after the Legislature passed a resolution
last week calling for the continued construction of the nuclear power
plant.</P>
      <P>The president, accompanied by Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to
the president, received anti-nuclear activists Kao Cheng-yen and Shih
Hsin-ming, hoping to solicit their understanding for his changed
attitude on the issue. Chen pitched for the scrapping of the fourth
nuclear power plant during last March's presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>Kao, a professor at National Taiwan University, said after his
meeting with Chen that he is "disappointed and saddened" by such a
development, terming the president's decision as "wrong."</P>
      <P>Kao said that he has engaged in the anti-nuclear movement over
the past two decades and is gratified that his efforts bore fruit
last March when the DPP candidate won the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the president had told him that the DPP, because of
its minority in the Legislature and other factors, has had to use
zigzag tactics to allow for the implementation of the nuclear power
plant budget this year and the deciding of the ultimate fate of the
issue by the new Legislature, to be elected near the end of this
year.</P>
      <P>Kao said that the government should have other alternative
methods to prevent the continued construction of the plant, such as
an assessment of the effects on the environment of the plant or a
national referendum, and not only think about the legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Kao said that there is still a long way to go in the anti-nuclear
battle and that he is now discussing with other opponents the holding
of a large anti-nuclear rally Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, after the intervention of the president, the attitude
of anti-nuclear DPP officials seems to have softened.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said that those DPP legislators who
are "rational and pragmatic" account for about half of the total in
the Legislative Yuan and that he will try to unite them to express
their views.</P>
      <P>Shen made the remarks while another DPP heavyweight, Chang
Chun-hung, said that he would stick to the "nuclear-free homeland"
stance of the party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2 MAINLAND REPORTERS TO ARRIVE FOR MONTH-LONG NEWS COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two journalists from mainland China's
official Xinhua News Agency are scheduled to arrive in Taipei
Thursday for month-long news coverage missions.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing, deputy director of Xinhua's Taiwan and Hong Kong
news department, and Chen Binhua, a Xinhua political news reporter,
will be the first batch of mainland media professionals to work in
Taiwan since the Republic of China opened its door last November for
mainland news organizations to post correspondents on the island for
news coverage for up to one month on each visit.</P>
      <P>Fan told CNA in a telephone interview Monday that her
application for news coverage in Taiwan has been approved. "I'm
scheduled to leave for Taiwan via Hong Kong Feb. 8," she added.</P>
      <P>Fan is no stranger to Taiwan. She was among the first group of
mainland journalists to cover news in Taiwan after the
decades-old ban on civilian exchanges across the Taiwan Strait was
lifted in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>Fan said she hopes that her new assignment in Taiwan will help
expand cross-strait news exchanges and promote mutual understanding.
"I'm convinced that increased cross-strait news exchanges will be
conducive to overall bilateral relations," she added.</P>
      <P>As the first batch of mainland reporters to work in Taiwan, Fan
admitted frankly that she indeed feels a bit of pressure. "And my
greatest expectation at the moment is that my work in Taiwan can
proceed smoothly."</P>
      <P>Fan further said her news coverage will not be confined to
cross-strait relations. "We'll attend press conferences given by any
unit so long as there is news or major policy announcement," Fan
said, adding she hopes that Taiwan journalists will regard her and
her colleague as their equal counterparts and strengthen
mutual contacts and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Noting that free cross-strait news exchanges will be a general
trend, Fan said it will be a boon to the development of cross-strait
relations. "I look forward to seeing Taiwan and mainland Chinese news
organizations allowed to branch out across the Taiwan Strait in the
near future," she added.</P>
      <P>Fan said she will pick up her Taiwan travel papers at the ROC's
representative office in Hong Kong Thursday. If all goes smooth, Fan
will be able to arrive in Taiwan Thursday night. Taiwan's China Times
press group will help arrange her residence in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In addition to Xinhua News Agency, mainland authorities have also
agreed to allow several of its central-level media organizations,
including the People's Daily, to post journalists in Taiwan for news
coverage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUMPTION OF N-PLANT CONSTRUCTION BENEFICIAL TO ECONOMY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The resumed construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant will benefit Taiwan's overall economic growth
even though the actual budget allocated for the plant constitutes
only a tiny proportion of the country's gross domestic product (GDP),
a government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The psychological impact of the resumption in the plant's
construction on Taiwan's economic and financial sectors will be more
significant than the actual effect of the budget allocated for the
project, said Koo Ping-chen, a deputy director-general at the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting, and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Koo said the strong surge in Taiwan's stock prices since Jan. 31,
when the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution by a vote of 134-70 to
salvage Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant project, is a strong
signal that resuming the project indeed makes a difference in the
stock market's performance and investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, whether the value of investors' stock portfolios grow
or tank will have a direct impact on domestic consumer spending,
which in turn has a large impact on Taiwan's overall economic growth,
he added.</P>
      <P>Other local analysts also welcomed the news of the power plant's
resumed construction, pointing out that it will certainly slow the
pace that high-tech manufacturers move out of Taiwan because of the
island's unstable electricity supply -- which has also chilled the
ardor of foreign investors in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Koo noted that Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
surged by 2.36 percent in January, the highest in 26 months.</P>
      <P>Koo attributed the sharp growth in the CPI mainly to the fact
that the Chinese Lunar New Year fell in January this year, instead of
February as in previous years.</P>
      <P>For the entire year of 2001, Koo forecast a stable and mild
growth in consumer prices. He said that while rising international
oil prices and soon-to-be legislated wine and cigarette taxes will
shore up CPI growth, other factors will combine limit growth in
consumer prices.</P>
      <P>These favorable factors include the liberalization of the
telecommunications industry and petroleum products market, falling
cell phone rates, rising labor productivity and Taiwan's expected
entry into the World Trade Organization, Koo explained.</P>
      <P>Despite the expected stable CPI growth year, Koo said the DGBAS
has readjusted downward Taiwan's overall economic growth this year to
5.3 percent on the grounds that domestic industrial production is
beginning to slow down while the United States, one of Taiwan's major
export markets, is facing a stumbling economy.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS previously forecast 2001 growth at 6.03 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Charismatic Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was
down on his knees scrubbing a urinal in a public restroom in downtown
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>Decked out in a water-proof outfit, rubber boots and gloves, Ma
led a team of officials from Taipei City Hall to clean up a public
toilet in Kwanghua Electronics Market, showing off his cleaning
skills and trying to educate Taipei residents about the importance of
maintaining a clean environment.</P>
      <P>Noting that scrubbing toilets in his home is "no big deal" for
him, Ma said maintaining a clean environment is the responsibility of
every member of society.</P>
      <P>Ma said he hopes that his clean-up demonstration will serve as a
catalyst for more people to observe environmental sanitation and
better "toilet culture" in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Monday's demonstration is part of efforts to drum up support and
attention for the "Year of the Clean Public John" program that the
city government launched Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Ma said that all the 8,000 public toilets in this metropolis
should be useful and hygienic throughout the year, while all city
residents should nurture respectable habits when using bathrooms.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the mayor called for all the officials from Taipei
City Hall to use public toilets more often to help monitor the
sanitation situation in the city.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) held a
meeting Monday to plan for a large-scale rodent-extermination
campaign.</P>
      <P>Participants in the meeting included officials from the
Department of Health, Environmental Protection Administration,
Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, and local governments. They decided to launch a
weeklong extermination of the rodents from March 30 to April 5.</P>
      <P>The campaign will target rats living in people's homes as well as
in the wild. The COA estimates the island's rat population to be 80
million-strong, approximately 20 million of which are crop-harming
mice.</P>
      <P>The participants also discussed in detail how to implement the
extermination plan in people's homes, agricultural fields, bush and
forests, military barracks, harbors and vessels.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, noted that the COA has mobilized a
lot of government agencies for the campaign, the largest in years.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the COA, which will be responsible for
exterminating field mice, plans to place one kilogram of bait spiked
with rat poison on each hectare of the island's crop fields, which
will cost more than NT$50 million (US$153,850).</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Environmental Protection Administration and the
Department of Health will be in charge of killing mice in people's
homes, the Ministry of National Defense will be in charge of
exterminating rats in military barracks, and the Ministry of
Transportation and the Communications will be in charge of killing
mice in train and bus terminals.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the large-scale rat-extermination campaign
comes after a national scare involving the deadly Hanta virus, which
is believed to be transmitted from the excrement and urine of
infected rodents, usually rats.</P>
      <P>Hanta virus caused the sudden deaths of a couple in eastern
Taiwan recently. Symptoms of Hanta virus infection includes fever,
fatigue, muscle pain, nausea, and stomach ache.</P>
      <P>Health officials said that approximately one-tenth of the rats in
Taiwan carry the virus, but they urged the public not to be
panic because the probability of infection is relatively low and there
is currently no sign of an outbreak.</P>

      <P>Construction of a new global logistics
center in Kaohsiung kicked off Monday, with Kaohsiung's municipal
government cooperating with a private firm to build the facility.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau and Yangming Marine Transportation
Corp. are jointly building the center under an agreement in which the
project's private investors will transfer their businesses to the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-HK TIES IN GOOD SHAPE: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong   Kong,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Semy Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative
to Hong Kong Chang Liang-jen said Monday that relations between
Taiwan and the former British colony are now in good shape and
atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Chang, who assumed his post as head of Chung Hwa Travel Service,
the ROC's de facto representative office in Hong Kong, late last
month, made the remarks during a visit to the Taipei Trade Center.</P>
      <P>As the visit was Chang's first reach-out activity since his
arrival in Hong Kong Jan. 30, the event attracted a large crowd of
reporters and camera crews.</P>
      <P>Chang received a warm welcome from Hung Yao-teng, managing
director of the Taipei Trade Center when he arrived at the center.
Hung briefed Chang on the current state of Taiwan-Hong Kong
trade and economic relations.</P>
      <P>In response to press inquiries about his job expectations and
plans, Chang said he is convinced that there is still ample room for
Taiwan-Hong Kong ties to grow. "I feels that our relations are now
amicable and moving in a positive direction."</P>
      <P>Noting that strengthening Taiwan-Hong Kong trade and economic
cooperation is his priority task, Chang said this is why he has
chosen to visit the Taipei Trade Center on his first work day in
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"I hope to learn more about current Taiwan-Hong Kong trade ties
in order to work out a practical work plan," Chang said, adding that
he will forge extensive contacts with local society. "I would
actively approach any channel that can help boost Taiwan-Hong Kong
relations."</P>
      <P>Chang further said the first thing he did after his arrival in
his office Monday was filling an application form for becoming
a friend of the Hong Kong Cultural Center. "In addition to promoting
trade, I would also endeavor to boost cultural exchanges between our
two sides," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang would not made any comments on such sensitive questions as
why the Hong Kong government finally agreed to grant his a work
permit and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's planned visit to Hong Kong
later this month. Chang instead said he is hopeful that all these
developments will help lay a solid foundation for future progress in
Taiwan-Hong Kong ties.</P>
      <P>Chang succeeded Cheng An-kuo, who was forced to leave his post
in late 1999 after he publicly defended former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui's statement that cross-Taiwan Strait relations should be
conducted on a special state-to-state basis. Lee's statement angered
Beijing which regarded it as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Since its reversion to Beijing's control, Hong Kong has supported
Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China and should be unified
with the mainland eventually. Hong Kong authorities didn't approve
Chang's application for an entry visa until late last month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S MILITARY BUILD-UP CAUSES ANXIETY IN EAST ASIA: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's intensified military
build-up has become a major cause of anxiety and unrest in East
Asia, the Sankei Shimbun daily reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Japanese newspaper quoted a recent report, prepared by the
Nixon Center, a private think tank in Washington, D.C., as saying
that mainland China has deployed at least 200 guided missiles along
its southeastern coast opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the number of mainland missiles
targeted at Taiwan has been increasing by more than 50 annually. If
this trend continues, the report said, the number will reach 700 by
2005.</P>
      <P>In the face of this trend, the Nixon Center report said, the
United States and Taiwan are beefing up their military might to cope
with mainland China's increased missile deployment, causing
escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The report went on to point out that mainland China's
military build-up has triggered further anxiety in the region
partly because it has also deployed 66 medium-range guided missiles
-- Dongfeng No. 4, No. 3 and No. 21 -- all of which can hit Japan.</P>
      <P>The report warned that no matter whether the United States will
go ahead with its national missile defense development plan, mainland
China will continue to beef up its missile technology and nuclear
weapons, including the development of submarine-based missiles and
nuclear weaponry systems with multiple warheads.</P>
      <P>The report further said the traditional mistrust between mainland
China and Japan is also a source of misgivings in East Asia over
mainland China's military build-up.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Sankei Shimbun said although the Nixon Center
has consistently stressed its political neutrality, it actually
maintains close ties with the Republican Party. Therefore, the paper
said, the report may reflect the views of the new George W. Bush
administration on mainland China.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China has donated a batch of
computers and printers for use in Macedonian high schools, which have
been unable to provide computer-related education due to their
limited budgets.</P>
      <P>Officials of the ROC Embassy in Macedonia, who made the donation
on behalf the ROC government, said Monday that thanks to the 720
computers and 86 printers donated by the ROC government, Macedonian
students will have greater access to the latest knowledge and more
exchanges with students in other countries via the Internet.</P>
      <P>The officials said the computers and printers are part of the
ROC's plan to bolster Macedonia's infrastructure through ten
different projects.</P>
      <P>With so much focus on political ties between the ROC and
Macedonia lately, less attention has been paid to their cooperation
in the ten infrastructure projects. These include the education,
transport, mass communications, medical and hydraulic sectors, said
the officials, who noted that Taiwan has set up schools for public
nurseries in six areas in Macedonia.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's inflation rate is expected to be
tame this year in spite of the recent hike in international oil
prices to more than US$30 per barrel, according to economists at the
Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>Commodity and wholesale prices for January posted annual growth
of 2.37 percent and 1.67 percent, respectively, according to
statistics prepared by the Executive Yuan's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The CBC economists predict that the island's commodity price
level will increase, mainly owing to the relatively low level of last
year's prices. But they forecast no surge in prices this year because
of the rising value of the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>The oil price surge will drive up global commodity prices, but
will have little impact on domestic commodity prices if it does not
last for a long time, said the CBC economists.</P>
      <P>They forecast a 1.6 percent rise in the core consumer price this
year, well below the 2 percent forecast of the national economic

    <HEADLINE>BEWARE OF HIGH-CALORIE RICE DUMPLINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local medical doctors are warning Taiwan's
population to be wary of eating too many glutinous rice dumplings,
which are high in calories, during the run-up to the Chinese Lantern
Festival. Just four sesame rice dumplings, each smaller than a golf
ball, is equivalent to that of a bowl of rice, the doctors point out.</P>
      <P>Glutinous rice dumplings -- Tan Yuan or Yuan Hsiao in Chinese --
are a popular traditional snack for Taiwanese during the approach of
the Lantern Festival, which falls on the 15th day of the first month
of the lunar calender, or Feb. 7 this year.</P>
      <P>The Lantern Festival is one of the most important traditional
festivals in the Chinese community.</P>
      <P>Doctors at Taipei's Chronic Disease Hospital said Monday that
most rice dumplings are made with a high quantity of sugar and lard
to create their rich flavor. The heavy dessert is not recommended for
patients suffering from hyperlipidemia, high blood pressure or
diabetes, they said.</P>
      <P>The doctors added that gout sufferers should also refrain from
eating too many of the greasy treats, which tend to undermine the
excretion of uric acid.</P>
      <P>They added that the smaller-sized Tan Yuan dumplings contain no
filling and have fewer calories, and are a good substitute for the
bigger Yuan Hsiao, which contain fillings made from peanuts, sesame
and red beans.</P>
      <P>According to the hospital's research, the number of calories in
40 Tan Yuan is equivalent to just one bowl of rice.</P>
      <P>However, both Yuan Hsiao and Tan Yuan are not a perfect snack for
children, the elderly, and persons with weak digestion systems,
because of their glutinous texture, the doctors said.</P>

      <P>The COA recently added Italy to its list of countries affected by

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual arms sales negotiations between
Taipei and Washington remain on track despite reports that mainland
Chinese Deputy Premier Qian Qicheng is trying to stop them, Foreign
Minister Tien Hung-mao said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei will keep a close eye on Qian's talks with U.S. officials
in Washington, but Taiwan has no plans to change the nature of the
April talks with Washington on arms sales, said Tien.</P>
      <P>Washington reviews Taiwan's requests for arms each April in a
bilateral meeting and the Los Angeles Times reported last week that
Beijing has asked for a meeting between Qian and U.S. officials in
March, in what it described as "an obvious attempt" to block the Bush
administration from selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, notably four
Aegis-equipped destroyers.</P>
      <P>Tien said there could be many reasons behind Qian's abrupt visit
to Washington, such as a general exchange of views with the new U.S.
administration on items of mutual interest, only one of which is arms
sales. However, Tien said, his ministry will keep a close eye on
Qian's trip to Washington.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will permit privately run
power plants to be set up in the future despite a possible government
policy change to allow the resumption of construction of the disputed
fourth nuclear power plant, Economic Affairs Minister Lin Shin-yi
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the government will allow for the establishment
of more privately run power plants in order to satisfy demand for an
increase of 1.3-1.4 million kilowatts of electricity each year should
the Executive Yuan make a final decision on whether to continue
construction of the plant.</P>
      <P>The fourth nuclear power plant's capacity of 2.7 million
kilowatts will only meet Taiwan's increasing demand for electricity
for two years, he pointed out, adding that the Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) set up a task force last November to handle the aftermath
should construction be renewed. The Executive Yuan abruptly announced
the suspension of the construction of the project last October.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest official watchdog
organization, confirmed speculation that an ad hoc committee composed
of five Control Yuan members had interrogated ranking government
officials, including Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Vice Premier Lai
In-jaw and Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
head Lin Chuan, on the fourth nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>At a time when the resumption of the plant's construction seems
set to take place, Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has maintained a low profile and
has been reluctant to voice his opinion amid questioning from the
press.</P>
      <P>Sources said that the DPP authorities will soon launch a public
opinion poll on a three-point package proposed by the Executive Yuan
regarding the resumption of the plant to help it decide the next
move.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the DPP will adjust its anti-nuclear stance
should survey results show that the pubic favors continued
construction. If the public is not in favor of the move, the DPP will
stick to its previous stance, he added.</P>

Bureau (HHB) officials said Monday that the captain and two senior
crewmen of the grounded Greek cargo ship M.V. Amorgos have been
prevented from leaving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials said the decision to keep the men in Taiwan was
taken because heavy oil that leaked from the stricken vessel has
seriously polluted the southern coast of Taiwan and the ship's owner
and insurance company should jointly take care of the problem.</P>
      <P>The ship ran aground Jan. 14 in waters off Oluanpi in southern
most tip of Taiwan, where bad weather prevented Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) officials from securing the fuel oil
remaining inside the ship and from collecting some 200 tons that
escaped into the water.</P>
      <P>In addition, EPA Administrator Lin Chun-yi said the EPA lacks the
proper equipment and technology to clean up the oil pollution. He
added that so far, 50 tons of oil had been washed up along the
coastline, with a further 150 tons floating on the surrounding ocean.</P>
      <P>EPA officials added the oil slick was extending to the Kenting

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first direct sailing from mainland China
to the Republic of China's frontline island of Kinmen in five decades
is scheduled to take place Tuesday, 37 days into the implementation
of a new ROC government policy allowing for such direct sailings.</P>
      <P>The voyage will mark the first time in 52 years and the first
time since the "mini three links" -- direct trade, postal and
transport links between Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands
and designated ports in mainland China -- went into effect Jan. 1
that mainland China has given the nod to a reciprocal trip.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC Executive Yuan's trial sailing affairs
administrative coordination center in Kinmen, the Kulangyu transport
ferry is set to depart from Xiamen Port's Heping Wharf at 10 a.m. and
scheduled to arrive at Kinmen's Liaolo Port at 12:30 p.m., flying the
ship's company flag.</P>
      <P>The ferry will carry 76 Fujian Province residents who were
originally from Kinmen but have been unable to return since the civil
war broke out over half a century ago. The 76 passengers -- all of
whom are above the age of 65 -- will be accompanied by 10 officials
and staff members as well as six reporters.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held at the administrative coordination center
Monday, ROC officials decided that if sea conditions at the time of
the trip are excessively severe, or if any passengers develop sudden
acute medical conditions, then the ship will be allowed to dock at
the nearer Shuitou Port, effectively shaving an hour off the time the
elderly travelers will have to spend at sea.</P>
      <P>Docking for such direct sailings is currently limited to Liaolo
Port, with an evaluation and any possible adjustments to take place
after three months of trial sailings, officials said.</P>
      <P>On its return trip to Xiamen, the ferry will carry 136 members of
Kinmen's Lee clan association who are scheduled to head for ancestral
memorial ceremonies to honor the clan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Xiamen delegation will stay in Kinmen for four
days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to
Malaysia Paul J.K. Tso said Monday that substantive relations between
the two countries, particularly in the areas of trade and investment,
are growing steadily.</P>
      <P>Tso said at a Chinese New Year celebration banquet hosted by a
local association of students who had studied in Taiwan that the
total trade volume from the first 10 months of last year alone
surpassed the annual total of the previous year of US$6.7 billion.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the total from last year would exceed US$10
billion, which he said represented a "considerable amount of growth."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taiwan investment in Malaysia had reached
US$180 million as of October 2000, more than twice the amount
recorded for the same period of the previous year. Investment was
mainly in the high tech industry, which the Malaysia government
welcomed, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the Malaysian government's policy of allowing
manufacturers to apply for foreign labor will be "very helpful" to
Taiwan businessmen who wish to invest in Malaysia in the future.</P>
      <P>Tso is slated to return to Taipei early March, ending over three
years of work at the head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office
in Kuala Lumpur.</P>

      <P>Medicine usage and funding at Taipei
hospitals and medical centers decreased in the first six months of
2000 based on analytic surveys released by the Bureau of Public
Health, sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City's public hospitals and medical centers treated one
million patients over the first six months of last year, prescribing
a total of NT$620 million (US$18.1 million) worth of medicine in that
period.</P>
      <P>Medicine for injections to treat heart disease and blood vessel
problems cost the government the most among all types of medicine, at
more than NT$150 million (US$47 million) during the period. Medicine
for central nervous system treatment, hormonal composite nerve
treatment, and gastric medicine also cost the government a large
amount, the report showed.</P>
      <P>More than 20 million doses of gastric medicine were consumed,
making up 21.92 percent of all the different kinds of medicines used,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The amount of funding and total consumption of medicine at
Taipei's local hospitals declined due to increased government medical
controls over the previous year and a half, said the Bureau of Public

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE-EXECUTIVE DIFFERENCES NARROWED BUT NOT RESOLVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Differences between the Legislative Yuan and
the Executive Yuan over the restarting of construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant have narrowed but are not yet resolved, Executive
Yuan Secretary-General Chiou I-jen said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Although progress has been made, the two sides remain apart on
core issues," a haggard Chiou said at a press conference called to
announce the results of negotiations between the Executive Yuan,
which wants to abolish the plant, and the Legislative Yuan, which
insists on the project going ahead as planned.</P>
      <P>He said the two yuans did not see eye to eye on whether the
Executive Yuan should be bound by the Legislative Yuan's resolutions
when the two branches are at odds on national policy.</P>
      <P>The issue concerns the legal authority of the Executive Yuan to
take the initiative in shaping policy, said Chiou.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan also demanded that the follow-up budget of the
controversial nuclear plant should be examined by the next
legislature rather than "be prepared according to legal procedure" as
proposed by the opposition-controlled legislature.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the Executive Yuan is willing to bring in an energy
bill -- another suggestion by the opposition in the legislature --
but added that intensive negotiations between the two sides are
needed before such a bill could enjoy a rapid passage through the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Further negotiations between the two sides had been scheduled for
the following day, Chiou went on.</P>
      <P>Chiou, who has a staunch anti-nuclear stance within the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), denied at the press conference
that he and his anti-nuclear comrade -- DPP Secretary-General Wu
Nei-jen -- would resign if the Executive Yuan were to reverse its
decision to scrap the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>He said he did not raise the question of his resignation during a
meeting earlier in the day when government leaders pondered how to
respond to a four-point resolution by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian had reportedly intended to bow
to opposition pressure and reverse his decision to drop the partially
finished nuclear plant, he was said to have been astounded by the
strong backlash within the DPP that forced premier Chang Chun-hsiung
to delay an announcement of the policy turnaround expected that day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>400 ARTIFICIAL REEFS TO BE PLACED ALONG HUALIEN'S COAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Council of Agriculture,
in cooperation with Taiwan Power Co., will begin placing 400
artificial reefs along Hualien County's coast Feb. 6, sources said.</P>
      <P>The artificial reefs are expected to provide a safer environment
for the fish living along Hualien's coast and to bolster the local
recreational fishing and tourism industries, said the Department of
Fisheries under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The department said that the establishment of artificial reefs
will help improve the environment of the fishing grounds and foster
the area's natural resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has placed 166,372 artificial reefs in 79 designated areas
along Taiwan's coastline since 1974. These reefs not only function to
prevent the deterioration of fishing grounds, but also help increase
fish stocks, according to the department.</P>
      <P>The artificial reef areas are expected to become local points of
interest and create new businesses in such activities as deep-sea
sightseeing tours, leisure fishing, and recreational scuba diving.</P>
      <P>The new potential, added to the existing advantages of high
quality and diverse marine life that the waters around Hualien are
renowned for, is expected to stimulate growth in the region's tourism
and recreational fishing industries, the department said.</P>
      <P>Department officials also suggested that concrete, the common
material used in building artificial reefs, can be replaced by
recycled materials, such as the hulls of old ships and metal parts of
old structures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. has been financially supporting Taiwan's fishery
industry and assisting water seedling work in recent years. The
company also invested a total of NT$40 million (US$1.25 million) at
the end of 1999 to build 4,000 artificial reefs, and it is now
planning to put more money into further related academic research.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Instead of joining a U.S.-initiated shield
against missile attack, Taiwan should neutralize the threat of
Beijing's ballistic missiles via information warfare or by acquiring
offensive weapons and laser weapons, according to a U.S. expert.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the American Institute in Taiwan, retired U.S.
Rear Admiral Eric A. McVadon, who served as U.S. defense and naval
attache at the American Embassy in Beijing until 1992, noted the
theater missile defense system (TMD) is a project still under
development.</P>
      <P>In view of its high cost and uncertain effects, McVadon said,
Taiwan should not count on the system for its safety. Rather, he went
on, the island should preempt Beijing's missile threats either with
laser weapons and offensive weapons, or via information warfare.</P>
      <P>The Patriot PAC-3 missiles acquired by Taiwan from the United
States is enough to build a low-attitude shield impregnable to
Beijing's missiles, he went on, although he added that any Beijing
missile attacks against the island would be "a stupid move doomed to
fail."</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States reaffirmed Monday its
commitment to assisting Taiwan in meeting the island's legitimate
defensive needs in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and the
three Washington-Beijing joint communiques.</P>
      <P>U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher made the
reaffirmation in response to a Washington Times report that mainland
China is deploying more and more short-range missiles against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Boucher said the U.S. government is quite aware of mainland
China's military modernization. "It's an issue that we follow," he
said, adding: "There's a limit to what we can say about matters like
this because we don't comment on intelligence or information that
purports to come from intelligence."</P>
      <P>But in terms of the U.S. policy, Boucher went on: "We will
continue to assist Taiwan in meeting its legitimate defensive needs.
That's in accordance with our obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act and consistent with the U.S.-PRC Joint Communiques."</P>
      <P>Boucher further said the U.S. government has made quite clear
that it looks forward to having conversations with mainland Chinese
leaders in the near future about Beijing's policies toward the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of Russian sales of military technology and
advanced arms to mainland China, Boucher said the United States is
quite aware of Russian sales of various kinds of defense know-how to
the mainland.</P>
      <P>"We're certainly aware of these developments. We monitor Russian
sales, developments in the Taiwan Strait and modernization of the
Chinese military. So this is something that we're quite aware of,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times report quoted an unidentified U.S. military
official as saying that the number of mainland China's
Taiwan-targeted guided missiles was less than 50 in 1998 and surged
to 150 the following year. The official estimated the present number
at between 200 to 300. The report also predicted that the number
could reach 600 to 1,000 in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The report also said that Russia is selling state-of-the-art
ballistic missile technology and strategic nuclear warhead
technology to mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN RESPONDS TO LEGISLATURE WITH COUNTER-PROPOSAL (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The administration responded Tuesday to the
legislative opposition's compromise proposal from Monday with its own
proposal, in which it indicated a willingness to revive the fourth
nuclear power plant project with a few strings attached.</P>
      <P>In the draft version of its proposal, which was delivered to the
Legislative Yuan in the morning by Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen, the Executive Yuan agreed to resume construction on the
partially completed plant after more than a three-month hiatus.</P>
      <P>However, it added that when the budget earmarked for the project
runs out, the new Legislature, to be elected at the end of the year
and carrying with it a new mandate from the people, should be allowed
to decide on whether to continue allotting funds to finish the
project.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's sudden Oct. 27 announcement to scrap the
project had met with strong resistance from the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan, and the Council of Grand Justices ruled Jan. 15
that the Executive Yuan's unilateral decision failed to follow due
process as the Cabinet did not first consult with the Legislative
Yuan on the major policy issue.</P>
      <P>The grand justices demanded that the Executive Yuan take remedial
measures by reporting to the Legislative Yuan. After hearing the
premier's arguments on the issue, lawmakers passed a resolution
calling for the project's resumption. Calling the resolution "not
necessarily binding," the Executive Yuan has been attempting to seek
out a middle ground with the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The legislative opposition alliance had demanded the
administration's acceptance of the Legislative Yuan's Jan. 31
resolution. It added in its version of the compromise proposal that
future budget allotments for the project should be handled "according
to the law" without mentioning whether the new Legislature should be
called upon to settle the debate.</P>
      <P>Chiou said in response to the alliance's demand for the
acceptance of the legislative resolution -- an issue which the
Executive Yuan entirely left out of its draft -- that the two yuans
still hold "slightly different views" in regard to the separation of
power under the constitutional system. The two sides are still
working to narrow that gap in understanding, and there is no need to
dwell on the issue, he added.</P>
      <P>In response to the follow-up budget issue, Chiou said that the
Executive Yuan still believes that a new Legislature with a new
public mandate should be allowed to deal with the matter and that the
wording of the compromise proposal should be more specific than
simply saying "according to the law."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's attempt to strike a happy balance also
called for negotiations to take place between the two yuans before a
new energy bill -- with new provisions concerning the fate of nuclear
energy in Taiwan -- is to be sent to the Legislative Yuan for
deliberations.</P>
      <P>The legislative opposition alliance, however, had earlier called
for the Executive Yuan to propose the bill for deliberations as soon
as possible. Negotiations among the ruling and opposition legislative
caucuses could take place afterward, the alliance added.</P>
      <P>Chiou said that the Executive Yuan wants to avoid sending a bill
to the Legislative Yuan that will only be "hacked to pieces."
Negotiating for a unified version before sending the bill to the
Legislative Yuan will be a more efficient process, he asserted.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's four-point draft compromise proposal is as
follows:</P>
      <P>In consideration of national political stability, economic
development, and the welfare of the people, the two yuans agree to
the following conclusions with regards to the dispute over the
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant:</P>
      <P>-- The directional planning of the nation's energy development
should take into account national economic and social development
needs as well as international trends. Under the precondition of
sufficient energy, the nation's overall energy development planning
should strive toward the end goal of establishing a "nuclear-free
homeland."</P>
      <P>-- The national system and the constitutional spirit of the rule
of law should be respected and maintained. In accordance with the ROC
Constitution and Grand Justice Ruling No. 520, and after coordination
by the president, the Executive Yuan is willing to resume executing
the legally allotted budget for the fourth nuclear power plant and
resume the plant's construction. The plant's follow-up budget will be
handled by the new Legislature with its new public mandate.</P>
      <P>-- The Executive Yuan is willing to negotiate with the
Legislative Yuan as soon as possible to determine a related energy
bill so as to draft a legal bill that conforms with public opinion
and can be conveniently deliberated in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>-- The opposition alliance in the Legislative Yuan agrees to open
the door to consultations after the Executive Yuan announces a
resumption of the fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PLAN TO RESIGN OVER N-PLANT: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
in an interview with a local radio station Tuesday that he has no
plan to resign over the fourth nuclear power plant controversy.</P>
      <P>Lin dismissed as rumors that he would step down from his current
post after the Cabinet came to a decision to resume construction on
the nuclear power plant under the Legislative Yuan's pressure.</P>
      <P>Lin said he had proposed halting construction on the
controversial plant out of his professional conscience. "But I have
never offered to resign over the issue. Speculation about my
departure from my present position is baseless," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lin went on to say that the Cabinet and the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan have reached a consensus on establishing a
nuclear-free living environment in the long run.</P>
      <P>And with this understanding, the Cabinet has agreed to resume
construction on the nuclear power plant after a three-month hiatus.
Lin said the Ministry of Economic Affairs will accordingly implement
this policy.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report that construction on the plant may
be halted again after the already approved NT$123.8 billion
(US$3.84 billion) budget runs out, Lin said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) will continue to set aside funds for the
project. The MOEA's budget proposal should be approved by the
parliament.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that the ministry has never received any
instruction from the Cabinet that construction on the plant
should be halted again after the year-end parliamentary election.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin agreed that the new legislature, which will
carry with it a new mandate from the people, should be allowed to
decide on whether to continue allotting funds to finish the project.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the government will continue encouraging private
companies to build power generation plants, Lin said it is the
MOEA's established policy to develop new energy resources.</P>
      <P>To realize the goal of creating a nuclear-free
homeland, Lin said, the island's existing three nuclear
power plants will be decommissioned ahead of the schedule. "And to
ensure adequate domestic electricity supplies, we must build more
power plants using natural gas or recycled fuel," he explained.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the domestic electricity demand has been
growing by 1.3 million kilowatts to 1.4 million kilowatts annually.
The MOEA already approved three batches of private applications for
building power generation facilities. Lin said the MOEA will
certainly approve other private investment projects in the power
generation industry to meet the local market demand in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JANUARY CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DISTORTED BY CHINESE NEW YEAR: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index last month rose
significantly because several trades increased their service fees
during the Chinese New Year holiday, the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials made the remarks after media reports that the
misery index, a composite of the unemployment rate and the consumer
price index rate of increase, set a new high in January.</P>
      <P>They said consumer prices surged for January because this year's
comparison basis is different than last year's due to the fact that
the Chinese New Year fell in the first month of 2001. Several trades,
including barbers, taxi drivers, and baby-sitters, traditionally
increase their fees during the Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>DGBAS statistics showed that the consumer price index rose to
2.36 percent in January, representing the highest level since
December 1998.</P>
      <P>With the consumer price increase rate rising to 2.36 percent and
an unemployment rate of more than three percent, the misery index
rose to more than five percent in January, hitting its highest level
in years.</P>
      <P>The officials however pointed out that if the added fees charged
during the Chinese New Year holiday are excluded, then the consumer
price index for January actually is 0.8 percent lower than that of
the previous month.</P>
      <P>They also said that the unemployment rate will continue to be
high as more people lose their jobs because of the ongoing structural
changes to Taiwan's industries and as those already unemployed
continue to have difficulty finding new jobs.</P>
      <P>The situation is being compounded by the sluggish economy,
resulting in more plant closures and more employee layoffs. Because
of these combined factors, the officials said they expect the
unemployment rate to stay above the three percent mark for the next
two or three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE OPPOSITION PRESENTS FINAL PROPOSAL ON NUKE PLANT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
announced Tuesday what he said will be the final version of the
legislative opposition's conclusions on the fourth nuclear power
plant issue, calling for an immediate resumption of the project.</P>
      <P>Wang, who serves concurrently as a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang, said that the opposition-dominated Legislature
has already said everything it has to say and that there is nothing
further to "coordinate" or negotiate.</P>
      <P>The official response came after a two-hour meeting of the
opposition legislative caucuses that was convened to discuss the
Executive Yuan's newest compromise proposal, which was delivered to
the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>To simplify the three- or four-point proposals that have been
traded back and forth between the two yuans since last week, Wang
said that the opposition alliance has decided to avoid the disputed
lines and simply call for the project to recommence immediately.</P>
      <P>The legislative opposition counter-proposal reads:</P>
      <P>"In consideration of the nation's political stability and
economic development as well as the people's welfare, and in
accordance with the Constitution and the Judicial Yuan's No. 520
ruling, the Legislative Yuan's opposition alliance has already fully
communicated its views on behalf of the majority public opinion
regarding the disputed issue of the fourth nuclear power plant's
construction.</P>
      <P>"While giving consideration to both the constitutional system and
harmony between the two yuans, the alliance urges the Executive Yuan
to immediately announce a resumption in construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant. After the announcement is made, coordination
between the ruling and opposition parties can commence."</P>
      <P>Wang argued that simplifying the complicated issue and explicitly
calling for an immediate revival of the project is the best way to
solve the problem because if the two yuans were to continue bickering
over each other's conclusions, the time wasted would delay the timing
for the project's resumption and do even more harm to the domestic
political situation.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of follow-up budget allotments after the
money already earmarked for the project runs out, Wang said that it
is not necessary to declare as the Executive Yuan did in its proposal
that a new Legislature -- with a new public mandate -- should have
the final say. After the year-end elections, the new Legislature will
naturally handle the issue according to related laws, he added.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's sudden Oct. 27 announcement to scrap the
project had met with strong resistance from the opposition-dominated
Legislative Yuan, and the Council of Grand Justices ruled Jan. 15
that the Executive Yuan's unilateral decision failed to follow due
process as the Cabinet did not first consult with the Legislative
Yuan on the major policy issue.</P>
      <P>The grand justices demanded that the Executive Yuan take remedial
measures by reporting to the Legislative Yuan. After hearing the
premier's arguments on the issue, lawmakers passed a resolution
calling for the project's resumption. Calling the resolution "not
necessarily binding," the Executive Yuan has been attempting to seek
out a middle ground with the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan's Council of Agriculture
reported Tuesday that more than 2,000 smuggled animals, including
popular pet rodents and turtles, were intercepted last year.</P>
      <P>According to the statistics released by the council, the 2,432
smuggled animals included common pet rodents such as chipmunks,
Syrian hamsters, and draft Russian hamsters. Also smuggled were 391
tons of animals and animal products, the report showed.</P>
      <P>Republic of China customs officers arrested two tourists who
tried to smuggle a large number of animals into Taiwan last July 6.
The animals included raccoons, prairie dogs, Syrian hamsters,
winter-white draft Russian hamsters, squirrels, and two endangered
species of giant tortoises.</P>
      <P>Besides small pet rodents, birds like white Java sparrows and
love birds are also favored by smugglers, said the Council of
Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Disease Prevention and Examination
last year seized 1,090 smuggled birds, including 16 endangered
magpies.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture warned that animals smuggled from
mainland China and other countries neighboring Taiwan are usually the
transmitters of fatal diseases, such as rinderpest, rabies,
mouth-and-feet disease, that exist in those countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTRY MUM ON POSSIBLE U.S. SALES OF AEGIS-CLASS FRIGATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined Tuesday to make any comment on foreign wire service reports
that the United States is likely to sell Aegis-class missile frigates
to Taiwan to ensure peace and security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The wire service reports quoted U.S. military sources as saying
that if mainland China continues increasing its guided missile
deployment against Taiwan, the United States will agree to
sales of Aegis-class frigates to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the MND's views on the reports, military spokesman
Huang Suey-sheng said it is the MND's established policy to refrain
from explaining and commenting on any arms procurement deals.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said, the MND has consistently tried its
best to obtain weaponry systems that can contribute to Taiwan's
national security.</P>
      <P>According to a recent Washington Times report, mainland China is
deploying more and more short-range guided missiles against Taiwan.
The report said the number of Taiwan-targeting mainland missiles was
less than 50 in 1998, and jumped to 150 the following year. The
paper estimated the current number at between 200 and 300. It also
predicted that the number could hit 600 to 1,000 in the next few
years.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's routine press conference, Huang also confirmed
that military prosecution authorities are investigating whether there
was any irregularity or scandal involved in the procurement of 60
French-made Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>Huang said military authorities began to look into the process of
purchasing the Mirage warplanes in late 1999 at the instruction of
then-Defense Minister Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>"At present, the prosecutor's office of the military high court
is handling the case," Huang said, adding that he is not in a
position to divulge any details concerning the case in line with the
principle of "keeping the investigation secret."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China struck separate deals with France in the
early 1990s for the purchase of six Lafayette-class missile frigates
and 60 Mirage jet fighters as part of its efforts to modernize its
military arsenal. Amid extensive reports of the Lafayette
deal-related kickback scandals, the ROC legislature in 1999 demanded
the MND look into whether the Mirage deal involved similar kickback
scandals or any other irregularities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has taken delivery of all the six Lafayette-class frigates
and 60 Mirage jet fighters from France.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CAUCUS ADVOCATES CONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS ON NUKE PLANT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Whip Chou
Po-lun said Tuesday while lambasting the opposition alliance's most
recent stance on the fourth nuclear power plant issue that the DPP
legislative caucus is in favor of continued negotiations.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislative alliance of the Kuomintang (KMT), the
People First Party, and the New Party decided after a two-hour
meeting earlier in the day to "simplify" the ongoing negotiations
with the Executive Yuan by sidestepping controversial issues and
plainly calling for the resumption of construction on the power
plant.</P>
      <P>Chou said that such a proclamation was tantamount to calling for
an "unconditional surrender" from the DPP administration, which has
been attempting to seek out a middle ground with the
opposition-dominated Legislature since opposition lawmakers pushed
through a resolution at the end of last month calling for the
immediate revival of the project.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yung-chin, a KMT party whip, said that the opposition
alliance decided to cut to the chase and return to its initial demand
after versions of compromise proposals were traded back and forth
between the two yuans. The sudden turn in the course of events came
about because the Executive Yuan's versions continued to be
"misleading," he charged.</P>
      <P>Cheng added that he felt "regret" over the insistence by the DPP
legislative caucus for continued negotiations and for a continued
standstill in the project.</P>
      <P>The fate of the partially completed power plant has been in limbo
since the Executive Yuan's unilateral Oct. 27 announcement to scrap
the project and a subsequent Judicial Yuan ruling that demanded the
Executive Yuan take remedial measures by reporting to the Legislature
for failing to follow due process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said that it is still too
early to declare the official stance of his party, which is made up
of both hardliners who advocate a "no compromise" stance on the power
plant issue and moderates like Hsieh and President Chen Shui-bian who
believe in a resumption in construction first in light of the overall
political situation and negotiations later.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that once the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan
arrive at a common conclusion, the DPP will naturally consolidate
opinions within the party. The party's stance will be decided by its
central standing committee, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INFECTIOUS SWAMP FEVER FEARED MAKING COMEBACK IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leptospirosis, an infectious disease spread
by domestic animals and characterized by jaundice and fever, is
suspected of making a comeback to Taiwan after 10 such cases were
confirmed late last year with one recent fatality.</P>
      <P>Leptospirosis, also called swamp fever, is an infectious disease
of domestic animals, especially cattle, swine, dogs and rats, caused
by spirochetes of the genus Leptospira.</P>
      <P>The disease was declared extinct in Taiwan some 30 years ago, but
several cases have been reported in the past three years, prompting
the Center for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health
to announce it as a newly found infectious disease in Taiwan last
March, said CDC Deputy Director Hsu Kuo-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Domestic animals are highly susceptible to swamp fever and in
turn spread the disease to humans who come into contact with the
animals' urine or feces. People who have cuts or wounds and spend
time in dirty areas or areas close to water are at most risk of
contracting the disease, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>People at particularly high risk, such as veterinarians, mine
workers and those in the field of animal husbandry, should be
especially careful, he noted.</P>
      <P>Victims of the disease usually have symptoms including fever,
headache, chills, myalgia, meningitis, inflammation of the mucous
membranes and jaundice.</P>
      <P>One of the 10 recently reported cases, a 41-year-old man died of
the disease Jan. 5, not long after checking into Kuangtien General
Hospital in Taichung County, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hospital sources said the man, a hepatitis patient, died of swamp
fever because the hepatitis had robbed him of the power to resist the
disease.</P>
      <P>Commenting on this fatal case, Professor Pan Ming-cheng from
National Taiwan University's Institute of Veterinary Medicine said
leptospirosis, even if confirmed as an outbreak, is not as lethal as
the Hanta virus that has been causing worries around Taiwan recently.</P>
      <P>Swamp fever, which can be cured with antibiotics, can be easily
prevented if people wash their hands more often, avoid cuts and
contact with unclean water, and refrain from drinking untreated water
in the outdoors, the professor said.</P>

Tzoying Port on Monday for a 20,000-nautical mile training mission

      <P>The flotilla, which is comprised of the Chengkung-class

and the supply ship Wu Yi, will call on the Marshall Islands, the
first leg of its journey. It will also visit El Salvador, Guatemala,
Belize, Honduras, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines before returning
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This journey will represent the first time that an ROC Navy
flotilla visits the ROC's allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>The flotilla's trip to El Salvador was originally scheduled to

Central American diplomatic allies and ROC President Chen Shui-bian
to be held in San Salvador. Chen was expected to board the vessels of
the flotilla to inspect the crew members and cadets of
the Naval Academy, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The summit, however, might be delayed as El Salvador was recently

provide standard lighting facilities, suitable desks and chairs and
regular eyesight examinations for their students. Students with
eyesight deficiencies will have to have their vision corrected.</P>
      <P>The bureau will publicly cite those schools and kindergartens
which are assessed to have performed well in these activities.</P>
      <P>According to an investigation, the higher the grades of Taipei

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT MEETS EXILED MAINLAND CHINESE NOBEL LITERATURE LAUREATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian seconded exiled
mainland Chinese-born Nobel literature laureate Gao Xingjian's view
Tuesday that literature's future lies in breaking the shackles of all
types of ideology.</P>
      <P>"Your ideology-free literary stand can serve as my guiding
principle in handling sensitive issues related to relations across
the Taiwan Strait," Chen told Gao when they met at the Presidential
Office for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Gao for his achievements in creative writing, saying
Gao's winning of the 2000 Nobel Prize in literature was a marvelous
event for all Chinese around the world. He also hailed Gao for
standing up to political pressure from his homeland.</P>
      <P>"I'm pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate you on
behalf of the Republic of China government and the 23 million people
of Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that literature is a way to show concern for life and
humanity, Chen said literature does not need ideology, national
borders or national identity.</P>
      <P>The president further said respect for writers and literature is
the measurement of the civility of a society. "I feels that
politicians should be humble and respectful when they meet writers,"
Chen said, adding that he fully agrees with Gao's remarks in a
recent speech in Hong Kong that politics cannot drive literature and
that literature does not serve politics.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that politics should not interfere with
literary writing but should instead serve it. "I share your view that
creative writing should not be restricted by any taboos or limits,"
the president told Gao.</P>
      <P>For his part, Gao said he has made frequent visits to Taiwan
since he fled mainland China in 1987. "I feel at home here. I have
many local friends. Taiwan is not only home to Taiwanese people but
also home to Chinese-language writers because it fully respects
culture and arts, and allows arts and literature to fully express
itself," he explained.</P>
      <P>Gao, who lives in exile in Paris, arrived in Taipei Feb. 1 for a
two-week visit at the invitation of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of
Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>The 60-year-old writer, whose works have been banned in
mainland China since 1986, is the first Chinese to win the Nobel
Prize for literature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VEEP LU FORESEES PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday
that Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's prudent, friendly
attitude toward mainland China has helped stabilize relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while meeting with a delegation of the
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), a
Washington-based, non-profit educational organization aimed at
promoting U.S.-Israel ties.</P>
      <P>Lu told her guests that the current ROC government has on many
occasion held out olive branches to mainland China since its
inauguration last May.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this year, Lu went on, the ROC
government even opened the direct trade, mail and shipping links,
commonly known as "mini three links," between its two frontline
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou to
signify its goodwill and determination to improve relations with
the mainland.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president said the ROC has been an
independent sovereign state. However, Lu said, mainland China has
arbitrarily defined cross-strait exchanges as its "internal or
domestic affairs." Lu said she thinks Beijing's such hegemonic
attitude would not be helpful to the development of cross-strait
ties.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lu said she still feels optimistic about the
prospects of future cross-strait relations. In addition to President
Chen's friendly attitude toward the mainland, Lu said, several other
elements will also help ensure steady, peaceful development in
cross-strait ties in the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Lu said, mainalnd China will host this year's
activities of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
Against this backdrop, Lu said, Beijing is not expected to take any
drastic action to hinder smooth proceeding of APEC ministerial-level
meeting and an informal leadership meeting.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said, Beijing is seeking to host the 2008 Olympic
Games. Its success in winning the right will hinge on a stable
environment in mainland China and the entire Asia-Pacific region, Lu
noted.</P>
      <P>Touching on ROC-U.S. relations, Lu said as the two countries
share many common values, she hopes that the new George W. Bush
administration will adopt an even friendlier policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I look forward to seeing the Bush administration open exchanges
of visits by high-ranking ROC and U.S. officials and offer better
treatment for top ROC leaders when they make transit stops on the
U.S. territory," she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT AIR LINK COULD PROVE LUCRATIVE: FEAT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Planned direct air links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait could bring NT$60 billion-worth of
business opportunities for domestic airlines, a senior airline
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tsui Yung, board chairman of the Fareast Air Transport Corp.
(FEAT), quoted statistics showing that citizens of Taiwan and
mainland China made some three million cross-strait visits for
business or pleasure through a third country or area last year.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the coming direct air links between Taiwan and
mainland China will also save NT$23 billion in money spent by local
citizens traveling to mainland China through a third country or area,
which will greatly help the domestic air service market.</P>
      <P>He added that cross-strait flights would present no technical
problems, adding that FEAT plans to use Boeing 757s on the
cross-strait routes.</P>
      <P>FEAT established an office in Beijing last year and other local
companies -- China Airlines, Eva Airways and TransAsia Airways --
have also set up representative offices there. Air services will
start as soon as the government opens direct air links, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that FEAT also plans to open charter flight services next
month to Laoag in the Philippines and Kuching in Malaysia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FRUIT SELLING LIKE HOTCAKES IN SHANGHAI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Plump, yellowish-green star fruit from
southern Taiwan is selling like hotcakes in Shanghai, even though the
sales are only on a trial basis, sources from the Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan star fruit, a tropical fruit also known as carambola, is
being sold in Shanghai at prices even higher than it can command in
Taiwan, said COA Chairman Chen Hsi-huang.</P>
      <P>While carambola has made a successful landing in mainland China's
largest and most prosperous city, other local fruits such as mango
and guava are establishing a beachhead in Hong Kong, ready to open up
larger market shares in mainland China, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said it seems that Taiwan's effort to capture a niche for
the island's agricultural products beyond its borders in expectation
of World Trade Organization (WTO) accession this year is already
beginning to bear fruit.</P>
      <P>In an effort to pave the way for Taiwan fruit making inroads into
mainland China, the COA began selling local fruit to mainland China
via Hong Kong last year on a trial basis.</P>
      <P>With trial sales of mango and guava proving successful in Hong
Kong, where purchasing power has been traditionally high, Taiwan's
star fruit, dates, wax apples and other tropical fruits are expected
to cut smoothly into other mainland Chinese cities including Shanghai
before long as consumer purchasing power gradually picks up as a
result of mainland China's economy continuing to gain momentum, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>With a huge potential market of 60 million in southwestern
coastal areas of the mainland alone, Taiwan fruit and other
agricultural products can expect a bright future for exports to the
mainland once both sides of the Taiwan Strait become WTO members,
Chen said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE FERRY ARRIVES IN KINMEN ON LANDMARK VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese ferry, with 91 passengers
and crew members on board, arrived in the Republic of China's
frontline island of Kinmen Tuesday, marking the first legal direct
voyage from the mainland to Kinmen in more than 50 years.</P>
      <P>The ship "Gulangyu" sailed into a warm welcome from dragon
dancers, bands and some 200 Kinmen residents and government
officials at Liaolo Harbor after a three-hour voyage from Xiamen in
mainland China's southeastern province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>It was the first mainland ferry to arrive in Kinmen since the
ROC opened direct trade, mail and shipping links, commonly known as
the "mini three links, between its two frontline islands of Kinmen
and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou at the beginning of
this year.</P>
      <P>Among the passengers were 75 mainland citizens born in Kinmen --
an ROC-held small island a few miles off the southeastern mainland
coast -- who have been separated from their families since a civil
war split the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in the late 1940s.</P>
      <P>The visitors, smiling broadly, were embraced by their relatives
as firecrackers exploded to mark the occasion. They were invited by
the Kinmen Senior Citizens Association for a four-day visit. Ten
mainalnd officials and six journalists accompanied the elders on
their emotional homecoming visit.</P>
      <P>During their stay, the mainland visitors will tour scenic spots
on Kinmen, pay respects to their ancestors at clan shrines and meet
relatives. They are scheduled to return to Xiamen Friday.</P>
      <P>Also welcoming visitors were John C.C. Teng, vice chairman
of the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China, and Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai.</P>
      <P>Teng said the arrival of the "Gulangyu" showed the goodwill of
mainland China. "We hope mainland China will be even more
open-minded and allow the 'mini three links' to shift into normal
operations," Teng urged, adding that the success of the "mini three
links" will lay a foundation for full-fledged direct trade and
transport links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The ferry "Gulangyu" left Kinmen for Xiamen in the
afternoon, carrying 138 Kinmen residents of the Lee clan, who were
on a four-day goodwill visit to Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has given cold shoulder to the Taiwan-proposed
"mini three links" and has so far allowed only a Kinmen County
Government-run ferry to make two direct voyages from Kinmen to
Xiamen since Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Teng said more than 7,000 Kinmen residents have applied for
making direct voyage to Xiamen. "We hope mainland China will allow
ships from both sides to sail directly between the two places on
regular basis as soon as possible," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA GIVES GREEK SHIPOWNERS ONE MONTH TO CLEAN UP OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) Tuesday ordered that the oil spill from a
grounded Greek freighter on the coast of southern Taiwan should be
cleaned up in one month and no longer.</P>
      <P>The oil spill, believed to be several hundred tons, leaked from
the M.V. Amorgos when it ran aground Jan. 14 in waters off Oluanpi at
the southernmost tip of Taiwan and has blanketed coral reefs in the
area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the sensitive
ecosystem years from which to recover, EPA officials said.</P>
      <P>The EPA called an emergency meeting Tuesday with the Ministry of
Defense, the Interior Ministry and the Coastal Police Administration
to try to seek a quick and effective remedy for the accident.</P>
      <P>The officials concluded that the oil spill should be cleaned up
within one month -- instead of two months as previously decided --
that the 200-odd tons of fuel oil still remaining in the ship should
be removed to avoid further spills, and that the number of clean-up
crew teams should be increased from the current one to four to
facilitate the clean-up.</P>
      <P>EPA Administrator Lin Chun-yi, who has been closely monitoring
the accident, will travel to Kenting Park, one of the most treasured
natural parks in Taiwan and located near the oil-spill area, to
inspect the progress of the clean-up work.</P>
      <P>The captain and two senior crewmen of the cargo ship have been
prevented from leaving Taiwan since the accident.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman
John Deng and Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai Tuesday urged
Beijing to recognize the "mini three links" between Taiwan-controlled
offshore islands and selected mainland Chinese ports.</P>
      <P>They made the appeals after inspecting a Kinmen visit by a
91-member group from the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen aboard a
Xiamen-registered vessel.</P>
      <P>Members of the group included aged residents who originally lived
on Kinmen but have lived in Xiamen since 1949, mainland Chinese
officials and reporters.</P>
      <P>The ship reached Kinmen's Liaolowan Harbor at noon and returned
to Xiamen with a group of Kinmen residents affiliated with the Lee
clan association, who will visit the birth places of their ancestors
in Tongan and Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen visit by was a move by Xiamen officials to reciprocate
a Xiamen visit by a Kinmen group in early January.</P>
      <P>Deng expressed hope that Beijing will recognize the "mini three
links" between Taiwan's offshore islands and mainland Chinese coastal
ports without any restrictions, rather than on the present "case by
case" basis.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the "case by case" basis adopted by mainland
China cannot meet the actual needs because more than 7,000 Kinmen
residents have presented applications to visit to Xiamen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
predicted Tuesday that the cross-Taiwan Strait situation this year
will be "safe."</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Beijing will concentrate its efforts on entering
the World Trade Organization (WTO), sponsoring a meeting of the
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in October and trying
to win the right to host the 2008 Olympiad. Therefore, said Lu,
Beijing must maintain peace during the course of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, she went on, the new U.S. administration's show of
support to Taiwan and the fact that mainland President Jiang Zemin
will step down within two or three years, "unreasonable action" will
not occur across the Taiwan Strait this year.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while meeting with local textile industry
representatives at the Taiwan Textile Federation (TTF).</P>
      <P>A TTF official said that "hundreds of thousands" of mainland
officials are promoting the textile industry and luring foreign
investors to invest in the mainland Chinese textile industry, while
Taiwan only has some 30 promoters. The mainland is the world's
third-largest potential market for the textile industry, he noted.</P>
      <P>Tai Ke-chiang, one of the board directors of the Taiwan Handbag
Association, suggested that direct three links should be set up
between Taiwan and the mainland area of Senzhen.</P>
      <P>However, Lu said that Taiwan's economy has maintained steady
growth without any connection with mainland China. Now that some
50,000 Taiwan businessmen are engaging in business in mainland China
the growth has stopped, she said.</P>
      <P>She called on local businessmen to think twice before investing
in the mainland.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) issued a
statement Tuesday calling for the immediate resumption of
construction of the partially completed fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT claimed that a majority of the public supports continued
construction of the power plant and added that any delay in resuming
the work will affect the country's economic recovery.</P>
      <P>It said that all political parties should discard policy disputes
within their own parties and give priority to the country's interest

President Chen Shui-bian to act on the issue as "a genuine president

Legislative Yuan Tuesday resolved to urge the Executive Yuan to
announce immediate resumption of the plant's construction, which has

possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

      <P>Canada established diplomatic relations with
North Korea Tuesday, allowing for both countries to open embassies in

      <P>Ottawa recognized the Democratic People's Republic of Korea last

      <P>Manley said the move will also help bring security to the

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN'S SINGAPORE TRAVEL PLAN DENIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has no plan to
make a vacation trip to Singapore in the near future, a senior
Presidential Office official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Eugene Chien, deputy secretary-general to the President, was
responding to a press report that Chen will travel to the Southeast
Asian city state late this month for a private visit.</P>
      <P>"President Chen does not have such a travel arrangement at the
moment," Chien said in response to a press inquiry.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper said Chen is scheduled to leave for Singapore
at the end of February for a vacation trip aimed at promoting the
so-called "vacation diplomacy."</P>
      <P>During his visit, the paper said, Chen is expected to meet with
influential Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong for exchanges of views on relations across the Taiwan
Strait and the East Asian political and economic situation.</P>
      <P>According to the paper, Chen was originally scheduled to take a
vacation in Singapore during the Chinese New Year holiday. But he
was forced to postpone the travel plan due to a simmering row
between his minority administration and the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan over the fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties, substantive
relations between the Republic of China and Singapore have been
cordial. The respected Singapore elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, made
a fact-finding trip to Taiwan last September to see for himself
the island's situation following its first-ever democratic
transfer of power between different political parties in May
2000.</P>
      <P>Although Lee has said he will not mediate cross-strait
dispute, he has no qualms about his constant concern over the
development of Taiwan-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>President Chen has maintained close friendship with the
Singaporean leadership. He made private visits to Singapore during
his stint as Taipei mayor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-LED LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO BOYCOTT PREMIER CHANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang-led Legislature
will continue to deny Premier Chang Chun-hsiung entry into its
compound as the Cabinet failed again to announce an immediate
resumption of construction on the fourth nuclear power plant, a KMT
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yung-chin, KMT party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said all
the means that the Legislature could use to resolve the fourth
nuclear power plant issue have been used up, and he stressed that
there will be "no further negotiations with the Executive Yuan if
construction on the partially-completed plant is not recommenced
immediately."</P>
      <P>The nine-member presidential advisory group was furious Tuesday
after the legislative opposition coalition called for a "resumption
of construction first and negotiations later," and it said that the
opposition's "bossing around" is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the KMT caucus will continue to take a "low-key"
attitude toward the renewed dispute, hoping that construction of the
power plant will resume soon so as to resolve the drawn-out issue and
avoid possible political upheavals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Cheng-ping, the government spokesman, reiterated
Wednesday that the Executive Yuan will not give up any opportunity to
coordinate or negotiate with the Legislative Yuan based on President
Chen Shui-bian's instruction of "conducting positive negotiations for
a swift resolution" to redress the row over the nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who masterminded recent
negotiations with the Executive Yuan and seemed successful in efforts
to bridge the gap between the two branches of government on the power
plant issue, said that Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen's
description Tuesday of the legislative opposition coalition's call
for "no resumption of construction, no negotiations" as a
"conspiratorial scheme" to delay a resolution to the drawn-out
controversy was "too much."</P>
      <P>Wang, who serves concurrently as a vice chairman of the
opposition KMT, said the opposition has already demonstrated the
greatest possible goodwill toward the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the opposition has already taken at least two
major "steps backward" aiming at accelerating a resolution to the
dispute. The first of the two "steps backward" was the Legislative
Yuan's acceptance of the Council of Grand Justices' ruling to allow
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to make a report to the Legislative Yuan to
clarify his position on the issue, he said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang's sudden Oct. 27 announcement to scrap the power
plant project met with strong resistance from the
opposition-dominated Legislative Yuan, and the Council of Grand
Justices ruled Jan. 15 that the Executive Yuan's unilateral decision
failed to follow due process as the Cabinet did not first consult
with the Legislative Yuan on the major policy issue.</P>
      <P>The second "step backward," Wang said, was the opposition's
agreeing to resume negotiations with the Executive Yuan as soon as
construction on the disputed plant is resumed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan called for the minority
government not to engage in a "war of words" any longer, saying that
"the project should be resumed immediately in accordance with the law
and the will of the people."</P>
      <P>Asking the administration not to "blur the focus," Lien said it
is the administration that should bear the full responsibility for
any further capital and social losses incurred by the continuing
delay in resuming construction of the power plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPORTS, IMPORTS FALL IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export and import trades posted
negative growth in January, down 17 percent and 15 percent,
respectively, from the year-earlier levels, the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$9.85 billion-worth of products and services
last month, while importing US$9.3 billion-worth of commodities from
abroad, leaving the country a trade surplus of US$550 million, a
decline of 40 percent from the same month of 2000, MOF officials
said.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the decline mainly to the fact that the
Lunar Chinese New Year, an eight-day holiday, fell in January this
year instead of February as in previous years, making last year's
January foreign trade performance a much higher comparison basis for
this year.</P>
      <P>If the eight-day-holiday factor was excluded, MOF officials said,
the January exports and imports would have enjoyed growth of 4.8
percent and 7.2 percent, respectively, indicating that Taiwan's
foreign trade is still expanding steadily.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the MOF Department of Statistics, said
the effects of fluctuations of the new Taiwan dollar on the island's
foreign trade performances this year remain to be seen.</P>
      <P>Forecasting the prospects of Taiwan's foreign trade for the
entire year, Hsu said export trade is expected to grow slowly due to
mild growth in world economies, which are cooling down from hot
performances last year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the domestic economy is expected to remain in the
doldrums in the first and second quarters of this year, troubled by
political uncertainties and other non-economic factors. Real growth
is expected to begin in the third quarter and reach the annual high
in the second part of the year, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said Taiwan exports'
reliance on the U.S. market has substantially diminished in recent
years, down to 23.5 percent in 2000.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said Taiwan's overall export trade stood at
US$148.4 billion last year, up 22 percent from 1999. Of the total,
US$34.8 billion or 23.5 percent, was directed toward the United
States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2000 exports to the United States was only some 50
percent of the amount registered in 1984, the BOFT officials said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou left for Los
Angeles Wednesday on his way to New York to attend a seminar on the
U.S. policy toward mainland China and relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma, a Harvard-trained legal expert who once served as vice
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, will deliver a speech
"Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations at a Crossroads -- Stalemate or
Breakthrough?" at the seminar.</P>
      <P>The seminar will be sponsored by the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy (NCAFP), an influential U.S. think tank. Ma
also attended an NCAFP-organized roundtable held in New York last
August.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the seminar, Ma will also visit Chicago
where he will meet with the mayor of Chicago and tour the
city's garbage disposal facilities, the mass rapid transit system and
crime-prevention units.</P>
      <P>Following his U.S. trip, Ma will visit Hong Kong Feb. 11-14 as
part of his effort to promote city-to-city diplomacy. He will fly to
Hong Kong from the United States with a stopover at Taiwan's Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, where he will be joined by several
senior Taipei municipal officials.</P>
      <P>A CNA report from New York quoted Professor Donald S. Zagoria,
chief organizer of the upcoming NCAFP seminar as saying that Ma will
be the only official from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to give
a speech at the symposium.</P>
      <P>Zagoria said the seminar will bring together 20-plus U.S.
scholars and experts on China affairs and Taiwan and mainland Chinese
officials in charge of cross-strait affairs to discuss various policy
proposals for the U.S. handling of China-related issues. And
conclusions reached at the seminar will be presented to the new Bush
administration for reference, he added.</P>
      <P>Zagoria and several former Clinton administration officials
responsible for Asia-Pacific security affairs made fact-finding
visits to both sides of the Taiwan Strait last December. They are
expected to present proposals for resolving the current cross-strait
deadlock at the upcoming seminar based on their findings during
their last Taiwan and mainland trips.</P>
      <P>Zagoria told CNA that he is cautiously optimistic about the
prospects of cross-strait relations. He said the U.S. government
should help Taipei and Beijing resume peaceful dialogue and
establish a framework for them to reduce mutual suspicion and
increase contact and commercial exchanges.</P>

citizens on opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait continue to grow,
with people-to-people contacts appearing to be unaffected by the
ongoing cross-strait political stalemate.</P>
      <P>The statistics compliled by the ministry show that over 13.9
million letters have been mailed between the two sides so far this
year, for an average of 38,000 letters per day.</P>
      <P>Some 38.7 percent of the total cross-strait correspondence in

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEED TO MERGE: BANKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local banker suggested Wednesday that
domestic financial institutions should merge to upgrade their
international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Benny Hu, president of the China Development Industrial Bank,
made the remarks when he spoke at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Research Institute on the current situation of financial holding
companies in the United States and Japan and the future development
of Taiwan's financial sector.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that the development of financial holding companies in
the United States, Japan and Europe have been crucial to their
financial reforms. Statistics show that the market value of the
world's top 30 banks grew 20-fold between 1990 and 2000, but between
1980 and 1990, the market value of the world's top 30 banks grew only
10-fold, with the difference due mainly to the promotion of mergers
among financial institutions over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Hu also compared domestic banks with famed international banks,
saying that even if all domestic banks merge into one, their total
assets would only be about the same as the world's sixth-largest bank
-- UBS -- and the seven-largest bank -- the Hong Kong Shanghai
Banking Corp. -- showing that the scale of domestic banks is too
small and that mergers are needed.</P>
      <P>He also said that because there are too many small banks in
Taiwan, there is stiff competition, citing statistics to show that
the market share rate of Taiwan's top three banks accounts for around
26 percent, lower than Singapore's 80 percent and Hong Kong's 78
percent.</P>
      <P>As the competition is so steep, the performances of domestic
banks have spiraled down annually to levels dramatically lower than
those at the international level, so that the government should speed
up the promotion of mergers.</P>
      <P>He said that statistics show that the average profits for
domestic banks have dropped to 7.61 percent in 1998 from 20.79
percent in 1990.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Tien-lin, advisor to President Chen Shui-bian
and former chairman of the First Commercial Bank, said that the
domestic financial scene will change after the implementation of
merger regulations and a proposed financial holding company bill.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the prospects for domestic financial institutions,
Huang said that the increasing financial problems in Taiwan cannot be
entirely attributed to the plethora of domestic financial
institutions, adding that the culprit is actually the exodus of
capital.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan businesses have invested more than NT$70
billion (US$2.16 billion) in mainland China over the years and the
continued loss of Taiwan capital has resulted in a sluggish real
estate market and bourse in Taiwan, which would of course affect the
quality of the assets of the banks.</P>
      <P>Huang said mergers of domestic financial institutions are
inevitable and predicted that there will only be three or four large
merged financial groups in around a decade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE POLICE FIND BODY OF KIDNAPPED TAIWAN TOURIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Feb.  7 (CNA)
(By Philip Liu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine police confirmed Wednesday that
the body of a Taiwan tourist kidnapped a week ago was found in
Batangas Province, south of the capital city of Manila.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Manila,
local police informed Taiwan officials that a body was discovered in
the town of Laurel bearing a photocopy of a passport identifying the
victim as Chang Ming-wen, 38, who had been missing since he was
forcibly taken from a taxi Jan. 30.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Representative to Manila Luo Chih-yuan said that he has
already formally written to the chief police commissioner urging the
authorities to step up the investigation of the case.</P>
      <P>Luo added that his office has already informed Chang's family in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chang's girlfriend Hung I-ting, she and Chang took a
taxi at the local international airport Jan. 30 and told the driver
to take them to Makati, Manila's financial district, but the taxi
stopped after just 10 minutes, whereupon two armed gunmen broke into
the car.</P>
      <P>Hung said the taxi drove on for another hour before stopping at a
secluded place where the kidnappers took her diamond ring, watch and
50,000 pesos. After one of the kidnappers forced Chang out of the
car, the driver and the other gunman brought her to another location
and dumped her, she said.</P>
      <P>Hung said that before leaving, the men told her that they would
hurt her boyfriend if she called the police.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FOREX RESERVES TOTAL US$ 108.05 BILLION AT END OF JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves at the
end of January this year totaled US$108.05 billion, the first rally
in seven months, statistics released Wednesday by the Central Bank of
China (CBC) showed.</P>
      <P>The CBC statistics revealed that the amount of Taiwan's foreign
exchange reserves at the end of January this year was US$1.31 billion
more than that at the end of December last year.</P>
      <P>However, the island's foreign exchange reserves registered a
year-on-year decrease of US$1.99 billion at the end of January this
year, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The rally in Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves was attributed
mainly to the flow back of foreign capital and the premature
settlement of foreign currency deposits by the public, the CBC said.</P>
      <P>The island's foreign exchange reserves hit a historic high of
US$113.83 billion at the end of June last year before decreasing for
six months in a row.</P>
      <P>The foreign exchange reserves figure slipped to US$106.74 billion
at the end of December last year, lagging behind Hong Kong for the
first time to place the island in fourth in the world in terms of
amount of foreign exchange reserves held.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the continuous inflow of foreign capital and the CBC's
replenishment of the U.S. dollar, the island's foreign exchange
reserves have increased since the beginning of January.</P>
      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the CBC's Foreign Exchange
Department, noted that Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves are
expected to increase continuously through February.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Lehman Brothers Bank's forecast that Taiwan's
economic growth rate this year will be 3.7 percent, Chou indicated
that considering the fact that Taiwan's exports are mainly directed
at the U.S. and mainland Chinese markets, the bank's forecast is "too
pessimistic" because the U.S. economy is expected to rally in the
second half of the year and mainland China's economy is expected to
continue performing soundly.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DISSATISFIED WITH SLOW PROGRESS IN OIL SPILL CLEAN-UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Wednesday he
was "baffled" by the length of time it took for the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) to get involved in cleaning up the
oil spill from a grounded Greek freighter off the southwestern Taiwan
coast.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Chang said the EPA should
review its handling of the clean-up operation and come up with a
detailed report on the issue and proposals for improving the handling
of similar incidents in the future.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was dissatisfied with the EPA's earlier promise to
clean up the oil slick from waters off Kenting National Park -- one
of Taiwan's most treasured nature reserves -- within one month.</P>
      <P>"I hope that the clean-up can be finished before that deadline,"
Chang said, suggesting that the EPA seek assistance from the Ministry
of National Defense (MND) to speed up the cleaning work.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed grave concern about the ecological disaster
caused by the oil spill, saying it might take many years for the
sensitive ecosystem to recover from the man-made catastrophe.</P>
      <P>Noting that the incident has exposed the inexperience of
relevant government agencies in handling maritime oil slicks, Chang
said an inter-ministerial task force composed of officials from the
EPA, the Ministry of the Interior, the MND, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Council of Agriculture and
county and city officials should be formed as soon as possible
in order to be prepared for similar catastrophes in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, EPA officials said the current clean-up work
has been moving at a slow pace mainly because of bad weather
and rocky terrain in the nearby region.</P>
      <P>At the request of EPA Administrator Lin Chun-yi, the military
has agreed to send helicopters to look into the slick-caused
pollution. The MND is also ready to send 800 to 1,000 soldiers to
assist in the clean-up operation, military sources said.</P>
      <P>The disaster occurred when the Greek-registered Amorgos,
carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, ran aground off the Kenting park
Jan. 14. An estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil have gushed out of the
vessel. The 35,000-ton ship had been heading for Nantong in mainland
China from Singapore when it developed a mechanical problem and began
to drift. All 25 crewmen were rescued, but the mostly submerged ship
later broke into two part.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said about 200 to 300 tons of fuel oil have
drifted to waters near Kenting park's Lungkeng nature reserve. Some
200 workers have been mobilized to clean up the slick. "The
workers can clean up some 75 ton of slick a day," said an EPA
official, adding that if the weather conditions remain good, 800 to
1,000 tons of oil slick can be wiped out within a month.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers and environmentalists have blamed the
government for its slow response to push the shipping company to
speed up clean-up operation and help save marine lives and coral
reefs in the region.</P>
      <P>"The government has turned its back on the disaster since it
took place 25 days ago, allowing the contaminated areas to expand
continuously without taking necessary measures to control the
damage," said KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan said the government, particularly the
EPA, should be blamed for its negligence in preventing the widening
of contamination. Some officials should step down or be disciplined
over the disaster, he added.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian attended a folk Lantern Festival feast in Yunlin on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that local temples in Taiwan play the role of cultural
centers by transmitting customs between different generations and
connecting communities.</P>
      <P>The president joined in a buffet set up in the natural
surroundings of a field and enjoyed a feast along with about 100,000
local residents.</P>
      <P>Chen was also scheduled to visit several temples and meet with
senior puppeteer Huang Hai-tai.</P>
      <P>The folk "Chinese buffet," set up to celebrate the Lantern
Festival, has been held annually in Yunlin for a hundred years. This
however was the first year that the head of state attended the
traditional feast.</P>
      <P>The annual holding of the feast has its roots in religious
belief. About a century ago, when Taiwan still lacked adequate
medical care and information, a serious plague broke out in Yulin.
Local citizens prayed to a Chinese god and the plague soon came to an
end. In order to show their gratitude for the god's help, local
citizens held a grand feast that became an annual tradition.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
Wednesday ordered relevant government agencies to take active
measures to clean up a polluted area near Kenting National Park as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said that it has already
set up a task force as of Tuesday to handle the matter and that it
will call a coordination meeting later in the day to discuss related
issues in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Taiwan county of Pingtung, where Kenting Park is located, in a
fact-finding mission, the MND noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, EPA head Lin Chun-yi vowed earlier Wednesday to clean
up 85 percent of the Lungkeng area, polluted by an oil spill in
January, as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he has confidence that the ecosystem in the
Lungkeng area will recover, Lin described the oil leak from the Greek
tanker M.V. Amorgos since the middle of January as a "national

      <P>The EPA head further clarified that 68,000 tons of iron ore
carried by the vessel had not fallen into the sea and that the area
contaminated by the fuel oil spill has been limited to the Lungkeng
area, which does not extend far beyond Kenting Park.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the EPA is planning to work for the time being
to clear up the oil spill with chemicals and is confident of
rehabilitating Lungkeng's ecology within two years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, authorities at Taiwan's third nuclear power

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO COMPLETE MILITARY RESTRUCTURING IN THREE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said Wednesday
that the military will be able to complete a major structural
reorganization within three years and streamline itself to a target
force of 350,000 soldiers within five years.</P>
      <P>The military has been following a long-term policy of developing
an elite fighting force and becoming self-sufficient in defense
technology. This calls for restructuring the armed forces,
streamlining command levels, renovating logistical systems, merging
or reassigning military schools and upper-ranking staff units, as
well as reducing the total number of men and women in uniform.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the armed forces will establish a national defense
structure with balanced division of labor among the administrative,
command and logistics branches by 2004.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the first phase of the three-staged
military modernization program will be completed June 30 this year
according to the project timetable, with the reduction of the total
force to 386,000 soldiers and the achievement of the pre-established
goal of increasing efficiency and boosting fighting effectiveness.</P>
      <P>He added that the military will evaluate the effectiveness of the
first phase of execution while beginning the second phase, which
anticipates a further reduction to a target force of 350,000 by the
end of 2006.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to prepare for the emergence of information warfare
and to maintain Taiwan's current superiority in this area, Wu said
that the armed forces has established "information protection" as a
defense objective.</P>
      <P>An existing military communications command has already been
transformed into an information warfare unit, while another will be
established to develop the nation's information warfare strategy, he
added.</P>
      <P>The armed forces will also take advantage of military and private
sector fiber-optic, wireless, and fixed line communication systems to
create a multi-conduit system that uses national resources
effectively, he said.</P>

      <P>Tuan Hung-chun, founder of the Chinese-language World Tribune, a

      <P>He lauded the party's reform which provides for the election of
the party leader directly by rank-and-file members as a big step
forward, but criticized the requirement of sponsorship by 3 percent
of the party membership for any would-be candidate as an "unfair
criteria" designed to "block hopefuls" from running against Lien.</P>
      <P>Claiming that this requirement breaks the law governing civic
groups that provides that officials of such groups should be chosen
democratically, Tuan said the 3 percent threshold is "hard to meet,"
given that the KMT has just finished its re-registration of party
members by Jan. 31 and is still trying to figure out the exact number
of its members.</P>
      <P>The requirement would skew the election in Lien's favor and make
the results of the election unfair for the other candidates, Tuan

      <P>The Control Yuan Wednesday presented a
report on the financial difficulties of the island's farmers'

      <P>The report indicated that overdue loans by the credit departments
of the farmers' associations accounted for 16.1 percent of their
total loans by the end of 1999, up from the level of 1.21 percent in
1991.</P>
      <P>The report said that the overdue loan rate of the farmers'

the farmers' associations is facing difficulties and that the
quality of the assets of credit departments has deteriorated

well-managed farmers' associations to establish a "national

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Lantern Festival, the colorful festivity
that represents the culmination of the joyful Chinese New Year
holiday, was celebrated in every part of Taiwan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The NT$150 million (US$4.63 million) National Lantern Festival,
which had been held in the northern city of Taipei for the previous
11 years, was shifted to Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan for the first
time, turning the harbor city into a glittering and glamorous
spectacle, with three lantern zones around the Love River, the Ocean
Star, and the Circle.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, accompanied by Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung and Minister of Transportation and Communications Yeh
Chu-lan, traveled to Kaohsiung for the festivities.</P>
      <P>The president presided over the lighting up of the theme lantern
in the Love River Lantern Zone. After the sounding of a bugle nine
times and the beating of drums and gongs, Chen joined the thousands
of enthusiastic onlookers in a countdown before pushing the bottom of
the theme lantern at 7:08 p.m. to the sound of resounding cheers.</P>
      <P>The 30-ton, 27-meter long lantern with the "sea tortoise
frolicking and dragon flying" theme, was made up of 50,000 light
bulbs. When the 200-kilowatt theme lantern was lit up, it displayed a
myriad of images with its spectacular laser, to the delight of those
in attendance.</P>
      <P>The theme lantern dazzled onlookers by rotating 360 degrees every
three minutes and giving six sound and light shows during each
rotation at a cost of NT$100,000 per rotation.</P>
      <P>When the theme lantern was lit, a spectacular fireworks display
kicked off in the skies above the nearby Love River. At one point,
the fireworks lit up the skies with the words "2001 Kaohsiung Lantern
Festival."</P>
      <P>More than 40 lantern vehicles participating in this year's
festivities marched in a parade to the Ocean Star Lantern Zone near
Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>Viewed from the air, the Ocean Star Lantern Zone looked more like
a glittering aircraft carrier, boasting the largest ground display in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Before the opening of the Kaohsiung Lantern Festival, the city
government also distributed 100,000 free lanterns designed with cute
baby snakes to mark the Year of the Snake.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although the scale and budget of Taipei's Lantern
Festival could not match Kaohsiung's, this did not diminish its
attractiveness.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Lantern Festival's theme lantern, which was "The
Golden Snake Dances Throughout the Universe," combined modern
creativity with traditional folklore.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP BLAMES OPPOSITION FOR STIRRING UP POLITICAL STRUGGLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
rejected Wednesday the opposition alliance's demand for the
resumption of construction of the island's controversial fourth
nuclear plant as a prerequisite for dialogue with the ruling party,
calling it an attempt to provoke a political struggle.</P>
      <P>One day after the collapse of talks between the Executive Yuan
and Legislative Yuan over the issue of resuming construction, the DPP
denounced the demand made jointly by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
the People First Party, and the New Party as "unacceptable".</P>
      <P>A statement issued by the DPP Central Standing Committee
criticized the opposition for what it called an attempt to turn the
issue into a political struggle in the hopes of making political
gains.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the opposition has ignored public expectations by
repeatedly blocking resolution of the issue, the DPP has called on
its supporters to rally behind it's goal of a nuclear-free homeland
and work aggressively to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the leading opposition KMT disputed the DPP's
statement as an obvious attempt to drag out the political battle in
the hopes that the situation will somehow turn in its favor.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yung-chin, the whip of the Kuomintang caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, said the Executive Yuan was scared away from
announcing a resumption of construction on the nuclear plant at the
last minute Monday because of the fierce infighting between the
various DPP factions, adding that the party has only its own internal
divisions to blame.</P>
      <P>"Now the DPP is trying to shift the blame to the opposition,"
said Cheng.</P>
      <P>He warned that the Executive Yuan can clear up the dispute by
simply resuming construction, or otherwise face a showdown with the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan after Feb. 20 when the new
legislative session begins.</P>
      <P>The ongoing dispute stems from the Executive Yuan's Oct. 27
decision to halt construction on the partially-built nuclear plant.
The opposition-controlled Legislature, angered at not being consulted
in advance, has opposed the decision.</P>
      <P>A senior official at the Executive Yuan said the dispute has
turned into a constitutional issue concerning the division of power
between the executive and legislative branches of government.</P>
      <P>The balance of power between the two branches of government set
out the Constitution would be upset if the Legislative Yuan were
allowed to dictate policy to the Executive Yuan through its
resolution, said the official, adding that this is why the Executive
Yuan has rejected the Legislature's demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-U.S. ARMS SALES MEETING REMAINS ON TRACK: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>This year's arms sales meeting between
Taipei and Washington will take place as scheduled despite reports of
pressure from mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen to call off
the meeting, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the Ministry of National Defense has not received
any requests from the United States to postpone the annual meeting,
which traditionally takes place in April.</P>
      <P>However, he added that because the Bush administration will face
immense pressure from Beijing, Taiwan will closely monitor Beijing's
moves to prepare for any possible responses.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chief of the General Staff Gen. Tang Yao-ming said
that ROC-U.S. military exchanges have become even closer over the
past few years, and Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao also said Monday
that the meeting has not been postponed.</P>
      <P>Washington reviews Taiwan's requests for defensive weapons each
April at the meeting, and the Los Angeles Times reported last week
that Beijing has asked for a meeting between Qian and U.S. officials
in March in what it described as "an obvious attempt" to block the
Bush administration from selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, notably
four Aegis-equipped destroyers.</P>
      <P>Regarding Taiwan's current military objectives, Wu said that the
armed forces plans to continue procuring advanced air-to-air missiles
as well as field-based air defense missiles while working to
strengthen its anti-submarine warfare and naval surface mine-clearing
capabilities.</P>
      <P>The military will also continue to field newer self-propelled
howitzers and multiple-launcher missile systems in addition to
Javelin medium-range anti-armor missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA TO INVESTIGATE FALUN GONG COMPLAINTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister John
Manley said Wednesday that his department will investigate
allegations that mainland Chinese diplomats have been threatening
Canadian followers of the Falun Gong spiritual movement.</P>
      <P>Manley made the pledge after a group of Canadian Falun Gong
members asked the Ottawa government to investigate their
complaints that Chinese consular officials have been using
threatening phone calls and letters to harass and intimidate them.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, the Falun Gong followers said they have
been the target of a systematic campaign of "direct interference,
threat, intimidation, and assault by Chinese foreign officials right
here in Canada."</P>
      <P>Rocco Galati, the lawyer representing the Falun Gong spiritual
movement in Canada, said that "the general substance of the threat
is: `You have family in China. We would hate for something bad to
happen to you or your family.'" He said Beijing should keep the
dispute off Canadian soil.</P>
      <P>The Falun Gong movement was banned in mainland China by Beijing
in 1999, and China's consul-general to Canada recently condemned the
movement at a rally in Toronto.</P>
      <P>Minister Manley said he has seen no evidence of harassment in
Canada and has no plans to lodge a formal complaint. "We don't call
in ambassadors because somebody writes a letter," he said. The
foreign affairs minister did however promise to look into the
allegations.</P>
      <P>Pressure has also been growing on Canada's prime minister to
raise the issue during his trade mission to China, which kicks off
Friday.</P>
      <P>Jean Chretien will lead more than 600 businesspeople on a
nine-day trip to the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>New Democratic Party M.P. Svend Robinson however said that the
mission has to be about more than just trade.</P>
      <P>"Jean Chretien, as prime minister, must speak out clearly and
publicly on behalf of Canadians, voicing our deep concern about the
deterioration of human rights, certainly concerning the peaceful
practices of Falun Gong."</P>
      <P>Chretien promised to bring up the issue of human rights, but he
added that there is only so much that he can do. "We raise the
problem and we engage in dialogue. But, you know, we're not running
China. They are running China," he said.</P>
      <P>According to reports by human rights groups, hundreds of Falun
Gong followers in mainland China have been arrested, tortured, or
sent to labor campas since Beijing launched an all-out war against
what it calls the "evil cult."</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIL SPILL EXPECTED TO BE BIO-DISSOLVED IN FOUR MONTHS: EPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The oil spill from a grounded Greek
freighter off the southernmost coast of Taiwan that has been
threatening to cause an ecological disaster is expected to be
dissolved biologically in four months, Environmental Protection
Administrator Lin Chun-yi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin, who has been blamed by locals in the affected area for the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA)'s procrastination in
handling the pollution case, said the oil spill can be cleaned up in
one month by using chemical defatting agents.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, said he would not recommend using defatting agents
to dissolve the spill, made up of some 400 tons of oil on waters off
the coast of the Lungkeng natural reserve area near Kengting National
Park, in consideration of avoiding polluting the environment with
chemicals.</P>
      <P>Fuel oil began leaking from the M.V. Amorgos after it ran aground
Jan. 14 in waters off Kenting, blanketing the coral reefs in the area
and causing an ecological disaster that may take the sensitive
ecosystem years from which to recover.</P>
      <P>Lin, who was pushed to the ground by angry locals Wednesday when
he visited the affected area, said it may take one or one-and-a-half
years to see the ecosystem fully recover if biological dissolving
technology is used.</P>
      <P>Lin also noted that the oil spill has been confined to the area
near Lungkeng so far and that it has not spread to other areas such
as Nanwan or Houpihu as rumors have said.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reiterated the government's grave
concern over the pollution, saying that relevant agencies have been
asked to do their utmost to help clean up the spill at the earliest
possible date.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, while the government does some
soul-searching about its responsibility concerning this accident, the
public should show more respect to government representatives dealing
with the issue, referring to the inappropriateness of EPA head Lin
Chun-yi being pushed to the ground by local residents while visiting
Lungkeng on Wednesday. The visit was the first to the area by a high
level government official since the accident occurred.</P>
      <P>EPA officials, strongly criticized for taking too long to respond
to the disaster, convened an emergency meeting Wednesday in an
attempt to accelerate the process of remedying the situation.</P>
      <P>The officials decided that the Republic of China military will be
asked to help in the oil spill clean-up if the ship owner and its
Taiwan agent are unable to fully handle the job. The ship owner and
its agent will be billed for all cleanup costs and related expenses,
they noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications on
Thursday asked the ship owner to decide how the sunken freighter,
which still has some 200 tons of fuel oil and an undetermined amount
of mine ores onboard, should be removed from the site.</P>
      <P>The captain and two senior crewmen of the cargo ship have been
prevented from leaving Taiwan since the accident.</P>

(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tough financial climate, trade
quota retrenchment, and rising unemployment rate has led to
conservative profit estimates in the automobile industry for 2001,
according to Hotai Motor Co.</P>
      <P>Hotai said that the Toyota Corolla, Japan's original small
passenger car that has topped the list in sales profits in Japan for
the last 32 straight years, is now being manufactured in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hotai's sales of the locally manufactured Corolla, which will be
promoted on the market this March, is important to reaching the
company's goals for this year.</P>
      <P>The Toyota Corolla has been the best selling imported automobile
in Taiwan since it was first imported from the United States in 1989.
Hotai predicts that 30,000 new made-in-Taiwan Corollas will be sold
this March when the automobile enters the market.</P>
      <P>Hotai has made the conservative estimate of selling 93,000 cars
for 2001, hoping for a stable growth rate in Taiwan's tough economic
climate. The company also said it will raise the price of the Corolla
from NT$500,000 (US$15,000) to NT$700,000 (US$21,800).</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN CAPITAL INFLOW PROPS UP LOCAL STOCK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign stock purchases outpaced their
selling by NT$78.4 billion (US$2.41 billion) for the year to Feb. 7,
the Securities &amp; Futures Commission under the Ministry of Finance
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The commission also said that the net capital inflow for January
amounted to US$2.03 billion, contributing to propping up the stock
market's key barometer from 4,935.28 on Jan. 2, the first trading day
of the new year, to 5,693.58 at the close of trading on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance said that although the bourse's trading
hours have been extended by 90 minutes, with the stock market now
being open from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., daily turnover has decreased by
NT$94.7 billion (US$2.92 billion) from that of last year.</P>
      <P>Financial officials attributed this to the fact that the weighted
index was hovering at the 10,000 mark in January 2000,
with average daily turnover totaling NT$208.26 billion (US$6.42
billion). In comparison, the weighted index this January was only
at over 5,000, with the average daily turnover amounting to NT$113.5
billion (US$3,5 billion).</P>
      <P>They also reported that with the number of trading days in
January reduced because of the Chinese New Year holiday, the
amount of stock transaction tax totaled only NT$5.5 billion
(US$169.75 million) for the month, a sharp decline from the previous
January's level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND NEWS CONFERENCES TO BE OPEN TO MAINLAND REPORTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Thursday that resident mainland Chinese reporters will be welcome to
cover its routine press conferences held on Tuesdays.</P>
      <P>The MND made the statement in connection with the arrival of two
journalists from mainland China's official Xinhua News Agency
for news coverage missions for up to a month.</P>
      <P>The ministry said all relevant government agencies have worked
out principles for handling news coverage applications by mainland
reporters.</P>
      <P>"Like other government agencies, the MND will offer the same
services to mainland reporters as those offered to their local and
foreign counterparts," a ministry official said, adding that all
regular MND news conferences will be open to mainland journalists.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said mainland reporters will not be
allowed to visit Taiwan's military facilities because mainland China
also has not yet opened its military installations for visits or news
coverage by Taiwan reporters. "We have to maintain this ban in line
with the principle of parity," he added.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to promote news exchanges and boost
mutual understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the
Republic of China government decided last November to open its door
for mainland news organizations to post reporters in Taiwan for news
coverage for up to one month on each visit.</P>
      <P>Two Xinhua correspondents -- Fan Liqing and Chen Binhua -- left
Beijing for Taiwan via Hong Kong Thursday, making them the first
batch of mainland reporters to arrive for month-long news coverage
missions under Taiwan's new "open-door" policy.</P>
      <P>Fan, deputy director of Xinhua's Taiwan and Hong Kong news
department, is no stranger to Taiwan. She was among the first group
of mainland journalists to cover news in Taiwan after the decades-old
ban on civilian exchanges across the Taiwan Strait was lifted in the
late 1980s.</P>
      <P>Chen, a reporter with the Xinhua's Taiwan and Hong Kong news
department, has covered many rounds of cross-strait talks over the
past decade.</P>
      <P>Fan told CNA in a recent telephone interview that she hopes her
new assignment in Taiwan will help expand cross-strait news exchanges
and promote mutual understanding. "I'm convinced that increased
cross-strait news exchanges will be conducive to overall bilateral
relations," she added.</P>
      <P>Fan further said her news coverage will not be confined to
cross-strait relations. "We'll attend press conferences given by any
unit so long as there is news or major policy announcement," Fan
said, adding she hopes that Taiwan journalists will regard her and
her colleague as their equal counterparts and strengthen
mutual contacts and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Fan also said she looks forward to seeing Taiwan and mainland
Chinese news organizations allowed to branch out across the Taiwan
Strait in the near future.</P>
      <P>In addition to Xinhua News Agency, mainland authorities have also
agreed to allow several of its central-level media organizations,
including the People's Daily, to post journalists in Taiwan for news
coverage.</P>
      <P>In the past, mainland Chinese reporters were allowed to cover
news in Taiwan on a case-by-case basis. Only 300 mainland
journalists have actually done so in the past 10 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEWLY BUILT WHALE-WATCHING BOAT SINKS EN ROUTE TO TAIWAN FROM JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly-built whale-watching boat ordered by a
Suao-based travel and shipping company reportedly sank off the coast
from Suao early Thursday morning after four crew members were
rescued.</P>
      <P>According to one of the rescued quartet, the Taiwanese captain
surnamed Kuo, the 80-ton passenger ship, built in Japan's Shikoku,
was in risk after strong winds and high tides smashed the bow and sea
water began to pour in at about 2 a.m. Thursday.</P>
      <P>The crew sounded an S.O.S. at around 2:40 a.m. to the Keelung
Fishermen's Radio. At around 5 a.m., after rescue boat PP 3017 of the
Coastal Patrol Administration approached the endangered ship, the
crew members decided to forsake the newly-built vessel and were taken
aboard the patrol boat, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Two members of the quartet, Japanese shipbuilding engineers Shiro
Doi and Peruo Pake, are now in the eastern port city of Suao waiting
for help from the Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese
embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal relations, to return to
Japan.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the passenger ship departed Shikoku Feb. 3 in
gloomy weather. It sought shelter at Koniya Port of the Amami Islands
to the north of Okinawa on the night of Feb. 4 because conditions on
the sea were too rough.</P>
      <P>After staying at Koniya Port for two days, the ship headed out to
sea and once again encountered bad weather when approaching Taiwan.
The ship sent out the S.O.S signal early Thursday morning when it was
about 33 nautical miles away from the northern port city of Keelung,
Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The newly-built ship was supposed to be christened "New Gueishan
No. 2" after it was to arrive in Suao and join the lucrative ocean
sightseeing and whale-watching business that Kuo's company has
operated between Suao and Kueishan, an islet in the shape of a turtle
located offshore the northeastern county of Ilan. Kueishan, which
used to be a secretive military base, was opened to tourists last
year.</P>
      <P>Undaunted by the loss, estimated to be more than NT$20 million,
the owner of the travel and shipping company, which has already been
operating with another similar ship on the Suao-Kueishan route,
decided to order a third of its kind in order to continue expanding
the company's business, said Kuo.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Thursday that "the ball is now in the Executive Yuan's court"
concerning a resolution to the impasse over the fourth nuclear power
plant.</P>
      <P>The row between the executive and legislative branches of
government over the controversial power plant project continues to
drag on despite earlier signs that the long stalemate would finally
come to an end after President Chen Shui-bian's intervention.</P>
      <P>But the ruling Democratic Progressive Party rejected Wednesday
the opposition alliance's demand for the resumption of construction
of the nuclear plant as a prerequisite to dialogue with the ruling
party.</P>
      <P>The executive branch said Tuesday that it is willing to revive
the fourth nuclear plant project with a few strings attached after a
more than three-month hiatus.</P>
      <P>But it added that when the budget earmarked for the project runs
out, the new Legislature, to be elected at the end of the year and
having a fresh mandate from the people, should be allowed to decide
whether to continue allotting funds to complete the project.</P>
      <P>The legislative opposition alliance however has demanded the
administration's acceptance of the Legislative Yuan's Jan. 31
resolution. It added that future budget allotments for the project
should be handled "according to the law" without mentioning whether
the new Legislature should be called upon to settle the debate.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang reiterated that, in the present
situation, if both yuans really want to solve the row, it will
require "sincerity and goodwill," adding that "alternative thinking
is needed" to seek common ground and bridge the gap between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Wang also denied that the Kuomintang has any plans to topple the
Cabinet over the impasse, saying that "no such thing exists."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's stance of not giving up on consultations as
a way of solving the impasse has not changed, top aides to the
president said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said however that the current situation is troublesome,
adding that it is still unknown when the issue will be resolved
despite the president's call for "consultations to speed up the
process leading to a resolution of the thorny issue."</P>

      <P>Gao Xingjian, Chinese-French
novelist and playwright who won the Nobel Prize for literature in
2000, is expected to hold the chair of literature at the Buddhist Fo
Guang University in eastern Taiwan beginning this fall.</P>
      <P>Gao, who regulary lives in Paris and is the first
Chinese-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in literature, has
promised to return to Taiwan this September to teach at Fo Guang
University's Institute of Literature at the invitation of venerable
Buddhist master Hsing Yun, founder of the renowned Foguangshan
Temple, said Fo Guang University President Kung Peng-cheng.</P>
      <P>Gao, who arrived in Taipei Feb. 1 to give speeches and take part
in a series of seminars marking the 2001 Taipei International Book
Exhibition, will be the first scholar from abroad to chair any of the
classes that the newly-founded Fo Guang University offers.</P>
      <P>Fo Guang University, a brainchild of Master Hsing Yun, who also

      <P>Master Hsing Yun's Hsilai Temple, which also has a university in

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR LASTING TAIWAN STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he
looks forward to seeing a silver lining on the horizon for lasting
peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pitch while meeting with a delegation from the
Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA), an
influential Washington-based, non-profit educational organization
aimed at promoting U.S.-Israeli ties.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guests that as the Republic of China's head of
state, he is obligated to safeguard national sovereignty, dignity
and security and promote the well-being of all ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>With this understanding, Chen said he has on many occasions
pitched for normalization of relations across the Taiwan Strait. "We
have come up with many goodwill, innovative proposals for achieving
permanent cross-strait peace. We hope the international community
will recognize and support our sincerity and efforts."</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century marks a new era of peace,
reconciliation and cooperation, Chen said achieving cross-strait
peace requires coordination and cooperation of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the ROC's national security and
cross-strait peace cannot solely rely on the procurement of advanced
weapons. "We should ensure security in political, social, economic
and energy spheres as well as strategic and regional security," Chen
explained, adding that the ROC wants to see peace prevail not only in
the Taiwan Strait but also in every other corner of the world.</P>
      <P>The president further said he will continue to promote
Taiwan's political democratization because democracy, freedom and
human rights are not only universal values but also a guarantee for
national security.</P>
      <P>"I'll also do my utmost to make the ROC a new beacon for
freedom and human rights protection in the 21st century," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The 12-member delegation was led by JINSA Chairman Jonathan
Kislak. Delegation members offered some suggestions for promoting
cross-strait rapprochement. They also suggested that Taiwan
strengthen integration of its defense and consumer industries to save
national resources.</P>

(By David Tseng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
Minister Chang Fu-mei apologized again Wednesday in New York for her
inappropriate rhetoric upon taking office last year.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a dinner party held by a major Chinese association
in New York, Chang said she was very sorry for the "misunderstanding"
provoked in Chinese communities in New York by her remarks about "the
three categories of overseas Chinese" and stressed that the OCAC will
serve all foreign-based Chinese, as long as they identify with the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that she has learned to "travel around the world with
love as a humble Buddhist servant" since assuming the post eight
months ago, Chang said that rather than being the head of the "big
OCAC family," she is the first public servant in the ROC government
to service all Chinese people residing abroad.</P>
      <P>Chang's remarks classifying overseas Chinese into three
categories, made in her capacity as OCAC head on an overseas visit
shortly after the Democratic Progressive Party-led government was
inaugurated last May, stirred up strong opposition from Chinese
communities around the world, which threatened to withdraw from all
activities sponsored by the ROC government.</P>
      <P>The OCAC head said she is confident of cleared up the
misunderstanding among foreign-based Chinese communities with her
hard work over the past eight months and added that the government's
overseas Chinese affairs policies are consistent and that she will do
her very best to promote them.</P>
      <P>A Chinese community representative expressed his appreciation for
Chang's determination to promote overseas Chinese affairs and urged
the ROC government to further advocate democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang, who visited Chinese communities in Brazil, Paraguay,
Uruguay and Washington before flying to New York, is also slated to
call on local communities composed of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam,
Laos and Cambodia Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RIGHTS FILM FESTIVAL OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday at
the opening of a human rights film festival in Taipei that every
government employee should be a "human rights worker" because
promoting such an ideal is the government's job.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked the festival organizers -- the Human Rights
Education Foundation (HREF) and the Chinese Taipei Film Archive --
for their work to raise the public's consciousness on human rights
and to preserve valuable visual assets, respectively.</P>
      <P>Looking back at the 20th century, Chen said it was actually a
century "filled with all manner of physical and spiritual
imprisonment."</P>
      <P>Quoting HREF founder and chairman Bo Yang, the pen name of a
prolific writer who was arrested in 1968 and jailed for over nine
years for his alleged communist sympathies, Chen added: "Past errors
and crimes can be understood, tolerated and forgiven, but they must
not be forgotten."</P>
      <P>"The Last Days," a movie produced by Steven Spielberg about the
lives of a group of Jewish people near the end of World War Two, was
the first film to be shown at the festival.</P>
      <P>Chen announced that six other films with human rights as their
themes will be shown in the week of the nation's Peace Memorial Day,
which falls on Feb. 28. The national holiday was declared in
remembrance of those lost in the unrest and aftermath of the Feb. 28
Incident of 1947, a particularly dark and bloody incident of human
rights violation in the island's history.</P>
      <P>The six films include "My Name Is Joe," "Bread and Roses," "Land
and Freedom," "Burnt by the Sun," "The Shawshank Redemption" and
"Dead Man Walking."</P>
      <P>Festival organizers urged the public to remember that human
rights issues are not simply about political persecution but also
about the broader issue of the respect between people in their daily
lives.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a government agency in charge of planning a human
rights memorial park on Green Island, an offshore island where
political prisoners including Bo Yang were once jailed, announced
that the park will be open to the public in 2003 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>A human rights memorial built by the HREF in 1999 will be
incorporated into the park, as will a human rights historical data
library and an old military compound on the island, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIA  CHIEF  SAYS EVENTS IN TAIWAN COMPLICATE CROSS-STRAIT ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>George Tenet, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, said Tuesday that the situation across the
Taiwan Strait has become even more complicated now that the
Democratic Progressive Party-led government is in power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While telling the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that
Beijing has "stopped its saber rattling against Taiwan," he added
that "the unprecedented developments on Taiwan have complicated
cross-strait relations."</P>
      <P>He said that the election last March of President Chen Shui-bian
"ushered in a divided government" and "profound mutual distrust
(between Taiwan and the mainland) makes it difficult to restart ...
political dialogue."</P>
      <P>In the longer term, he said, cross-strait relations might be even
more volatile because of Beijing's military modernization program.</P>
      <P>He was testifying on the subject of global threats and challenges
to U.S. national security.</P>
      <P>Another witness at the hearing, Director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency Thomas Wilson, said that the Taiwan issue will
remain a "major potential flash point," particularly in the short
term.</P>
      <P>It is "doubtful" that Beijing would attempt a large-scale
military operation to attack Taiwan, Wilson said, unless Taipei
"moved more directly toward independence."</P>
      <P>He said in a prepared testimony that Beijing recognizes the risk
inherent in such a move and is uncertain that it can succeed.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, by 2015," he said, "China's conventional force
modernization will provide an increasingly credible military threat
against Taiwan, though probably not the large amphibious capability
necessary for invasion."</P>
      <P>Commenting on regional issues, the CIA director said that
Beijing's drive for recognition as a great power is "one of the
toughest challenges" facing the United States.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's goal of becoming a key world player and especially
more powerful in East Asia has come sharply into focus," Tenet said.</P>
      <P>While viewing solid relations with Washington as vital to
achieving their ambitions, he said, Beijing's leaders also see the
United States as their primary obstacle.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will formally
announce a ban on cosmetics made of cattle and sheep tissue from 13
European countries in the next few days amid public fears over BSE,
or mad cow disease, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>After the announcement, DOH officials said, local importers or
distributors must recall all those products from market shelves
within six months.</P>
      <P>The 13 BSE-affected European countries are Britain, Ireland,
France, Switzerland, Portugal, Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Liechtenstein, Denmark, Spain, Germany and Italy, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The DOH decided to ban the cosmetic and skin care products after
British authorities confirmed that BSE-contaminated cattle bone
products had been exported to 70-plus countries around the world,
including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hu You-fu, director of the DOH's Bureau of Pharmaceutical
Affairs, said the Republic of China is the second Asian country to
ban animal tissue-containing cosmetics from the mad cow
disease-affected areas. Japan took the lead by imposing a ban last
year.</P>
      <P>Hu said the DOH has sorted out at least 26 batches of skin and
hair care products and lip gloss that contain placenta or collagen
made of cattle and sheep tissue from the BSE-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Among those products, Hu said, 12 came from the United Kingdom,
one from Switzerland, two from Germany, four from Italy and seven
from France.</P>
      <P>Under current cosmetics health regulations, the DOH is authorized
to ban imports and sales of cosmetics harmful to human health. Hu
said local distributors who fail to take banned cosmetics off store
shelves before the DOH-set deadline will face up to one year in jail
or a maximum fine of NT$150,000 (US$4,659).</P>
      <P>As cosmetics makers in BSE-affected areas may use animal tissue
from non-affected regions, Hu said that in six months' time, local
cosmetics importers and manufacturers of products made of placenta
and collagen must produce certificates proving that their raw
materials come from non-affected areas.</P>
      <P>Hu said there is still no direct evidence proving that the BSE
prion that causes the brain-wasting cattle disease is linked to an
equally fatal human ailment -- new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
which has killed some 80 Europeans since the mid-1990s, mostly in
Britain.</P>
      <P>But Hu said the possible spread of the BSE prion from cattle or
sheep to humans has caused alarm in Europe and the United States and
that the World Health Organization has suggested a ban on meat and
other products from BSE-infected cattle and sheep.</P>
      <P>Hu also urged local consumers to avoid applying animal
tissue-containing skin care products to their skin wounds, eyes and
mucous membranes to reduce the risk of infection.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said the DOH will check to find out how many of
the 260,000 kinds of medical products available in the local market
contain animal tissue from BSE-affected areas. According to Hu,
current Taiwan law bans the use of human and animal placenta in the
production of any such products.</P>

      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, chief of the DPP's Policy Committee, said that he

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG-TAIWAN TIES ARE VERY CLOSE: HK CHIEF EXECUTIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lu Chien-hui and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
said Thursday that relations between Taiwan and Hong Kong are very
close at present.</P>
      <P>Tung made the remarks during a question-and-answer session at
the Legislative Council, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region's legislative arm.</P>
      <P>Tung said despite the absence of the head of Chung Hwa Travel
Service, Taiwan's de facto representative office in Hong Kong,
relations between the two sides have continued to grow steadily.</P>
      <P>Tung cited several figures to back his evaluation. According
to Tung, Taiwan-Hong Kong trade rose 25 percent in 2000 from the
year-earlier level, the number of Taiwan visitors to Hong Kong
increased 20 percent and the number of Taiwan people who took
residences or jobs in Hong Kong also picked up 7 percent over the
past year.</P>
      <P>"All these figures reflect close ties between our two places,"
Tung said, adding that he is convinced that there is still ample
room for Taiwan-Hong Kong relations to grow in the future.</P>
      <P>Tung pointed out that Hong Kong has consistently played a
special intermediary role in cultural, trade, financial and
personnel exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We will continue promoting Hong Kong's function in this field,"
Tung said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tung said he will meet with Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
when Ma visits Hong Kong next week. "I'll take advantage of the
meeting to exchange views with Ma on feasible ways to boost
Taiwan-Hong Kong ties and the eventual unification of the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait," he noted.</P>
      <P>Ma will visit the former British colony Feb. 11-14. The
upcoming Ma-Tung meeting will mark the first high-level
Taiwan-Hong Kong contact in recent years.</P>
      <P>Ma is visiting Hong Kong at the invitation of the Hong Kong
Policy Research Institute, headed by Paul Yip, a special adviser to
Tung.</P>
      <P>Former Taiwan Representative to Hong Kong Cheng An-kuo was
forced to leave his post late 1999 after he angered Beijing by
publicly defending former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
statement that cross-strait ties should be conducted on a special
"state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>The ROC appointed Chang Liang-jen to succeed Cheng in December
1999, but the Hong Kong government didn't grant Chang an entry visa
until late last month. After a 13-month wait, Chang finally arrived
here to assume his new post on Jan. 31.</P>

      <P>Exiled mainland Chinese-born Nobel Prize
for literature winner Gao Xingjian said Thursday that he will accept
an honorary doctorate from a Taiwan university in October and will
stay for a while in southern Taiwan to share his views on art.</P>
      <P>Gao, the Chinese-French novelist, playwright and painter who won
the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000, is presently charming Taiwan
with his novels and a number of speeches delivered in various
seminars.</P>
      <P>His novels are selling like hotcakes in almost every book store
in Taiwan, and tickets for his seminars are usually sold out in
advance.</P>
      <P>People are competing to entertain him and schools are vying to
hire him as a teacher.</P>
      <P>Amidst the fierce competition, Gao has agreed to teach at the
Buddhist Fo Guang University's Institute of Literature in eastern
Taiwan beginning this fall, at the invitation of venerable Buddhist
master Hsing Yun.</P>
      <P>Gao, the first Chinese-language writer to win the Nobel Prize in
literature, will receive an honorary doctorate in literature from
National Sun Yat-Sen University in early October and will then stay
for a while in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In September, Gao's paintings will be exhibited at the National
Museum of History.</P>
      <P>Gao, who began painting in oils, focused later on Chinese brush
painting. Considering that Chinese brush painting is considered to
have reached it climax in the Tang and Sung dynasties, Gao said he
hopes to introduce in his painting the Western concept of depicting
light, which is not usually addressed in traditional Chinese brush
painting.</P>
      <P>The prolific 60-year-old writer, who has been exiled in France in
1987, has had his paintings exhibited in many countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGES UNITED STATES TO PRESENT `CONCRETE' SECURITY GUARANTEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior Republic of China Foreign Ministry
official said Thursday that Washington should give the people of
Taiwan "more confidence and concrete guarantees" while helping to
establish greater parity in Taipei-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Kao Shuo-tai, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's
Department of North American Affairs, said that such guarantees can
be shown through the annual ROC-U.S. arms talks and through
strengthened bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>He added that ROC President Chen Shui-bian has continuously
offered olive branches to Beijing since his inauguration last May,
with no reciprocal responses forthcoming from the communist regime.</P>
      <P>Kao was responding to U.S. Central Intelligence Agency Director
George Tenet's Tuesday testimony to the U.S. Senate, in which he said
that Chen's election to office has "ushered in a divided government"
while "profound mutual distrust (between Taiwan and the mainland)
makes it difficult to restart ... political dialogue."</P>
      <P>The United States understands that a state of military imbalance
does indeed exist in the Taiwan Strait, Kao continued, but whether
the region is a "major potential flashpoint," as U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency Director Thomas Wilson testified at the same
hearing, is still open to debate.</P>
      <P>Tenet also said that Beijing's drive for recognition as a great
power is "one of the toughest challenges" facing the United States.</P>
      <P>Kao argued that U.S. concern over the Taiwan Strait issue is an
indication that Washington is keeping an eye on the region's
developments in keeping with its national interest, something Kao
said Taiwan is "happy to see."</P>
      <P>In fact, he suggested, the United States can create a more
peaceful environment in the region by playing the role of a
"balancer, stabilizer and promoter" so that Taipei and Beijing will
not continue to be suspicious of each other but instead quickly
resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>Kao added that he hopes the arms talks scheduled to take place in
April in Washington will proceed under the principle of "mutual
benefits."</P>
      <P>Regarding mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's impending
March visit to the United States, during which he will reportedly
pressure Washington to call off the arms talks, Kao said that the
arms meeting has been confirmed to be held as scheduled.</P>
      <P>He added that the arms sales issue and the Taiwan issue will
"definitely" be two of the "foreseeable" and "unavoidable" issues
Qian will touch on during his visit.</P>
      <P>Qian's visit shows Beijing's sincerity toward the new Bush
administration, and he will also take the opportunity to learn about
new U.S. policies and opinions on defense and diplomatic issues, Kao
predicted.</P>

      <P>Two

Thursday, marking a new milestone for news exchanges between the two

warm welcome extended by the local mass media, while Zhen, who is

attend tea parties or background briefings that take place at the

    <HEADLINE>KMT NOT TO PURSUE CHARGES AGAINST FORMER SECRETARY-GENERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided
Thursday not to pursue embezzlement charges against former KMT
Secretary-General James Soong after a prosecutor cleared him of any
wrongdoing on Jan. 20.</P>
      <P>"Although the prosecutor's investigation is flawed," said party
spokesman Jason Hu at a press conference, the party has decided
against pursuing the case for the sake of reconciliation with Soong's
People's First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Hu said it is regrettable that the prosecutor did not probe the
case thoroughly and based his dropping of the charges solely on
Soong's claims without bothering to summon any KMT officials related
to the case to give testimony.</P>
      <P>"Given the political disturbance and the worsening social and
economic situations caused by the `inexperienced governance' of the
administration of the Democratic Progressive Party," the KMT
statement said, it is time for various domestic political forces to
work together for the stability and prosperity of the country.</P>
      <P>Describing the KMT as an "honest" party which "puts the national
interest beyond it's own," Hu said his party prefers not to ask the
prosecutor to re-examine the case for the sake of the stability and
benefit of the whole nation.</P>
      <P>"At the dawn of the new century, Taiwan political parties should
close the book on past feuds and looks forward to a new vision for
the island," said the statement, alluding to the quarrel between the
party and James Soong.</P>
      <P>The statement acknowledged that there are dissenting opinions
within the party over this decision, but the party would rather
forget its personal grief and work together with anyone who struggles
for a better Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A KMT official said that party Chairman Lien Chan consulted with
former Chairman Lee Teng-hui, who instituted the legal proceedings
against Soong in 1999 during the lead-up to the presidential
election, before making the decision not to press on with the case.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has quit politics since stepping down as party leader
in March and president of the country in May, was quoted by the
official as saying that he will respect any decision by the party.</P>
      <P>Soong is in the United States for a private trip, but a PFP
spokesman said in Taipei Thursday that his party welcomes the KMT
decision and is glad the prosecutor has vindicated Soong's innocence.</P>
      <P>Local evening newspaper the United Evening News quoted Soong as
saying in the United States that he hopes he is the last victim of
Taiwan's "character assassination" election campaign.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five lawyers retained by the KMT to handle the case
said they regretted the party's decision, which, they claimed, was
taken out of political consideration rather than on legal grounds.</P>
      <P>They picked holes in the prosecutor' ruling and branded it a
travesty of justice that instead of clearing Soong's name, will cast
doubt on his character forever.</P>
      <P>A self-proclaimed justice-reform group echoed the lawyers opinion
Thursday by asking the Control Yuan to probe the prosecutor's "flawed
ruling."</P>
      <P>The case arose from a huge amount of cash stashed in a secret
bank account controlled by Soong. When the bank account came to light
during the peak of the presidential election, Soong, who ran in the
race as an independent, claimed the funds were put in his charge by
then-KMT Chairman Lee to finance secret political operations.</P>
      <P>Soong said he took charge of the funds while serving as the KMT
secretary-general but had no chance to return them to Lee after the
two fell out over Soong's insistence on joining the race for the
presidency.</P>
      <P>But Lee angrily denied this, denouncing it as "nonsense" and the
KMT filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office against Soong for
alleged embezzlement.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed that he was framed by the KMT and called the
complaint a smear campaign against him. He offered to give NT$248
million (US$7.75 million) back to the KMT and place it with the
courts in escrow.</P>

      <P>World Vision-Taiwan, a

lovers to sponsor poverty-stricken children whose original sponsors
suspended their obligations due to economic slump.</P>
      <P>According to World Vision-Taiwan statistics, more than 4,000
impoverished children around the world were forsaken by their
sponsors from the second half of last year until the present because
the economic slump has made them unable to afford the extra
expenditure for their charges.</P>
      <P>Some sponsors took the initiative by contacting World
Vision-Taiwan to express their intention to suspend monthly payments,
while some abruptly lost contact with the organization, leaving World
Vision staff scrambling to find new sponsors for the kids, according
to World Vision-Taiwan sources.</P>
      <P>In an emergency measure, World Vision-Taiwan has cooperated with
the Taichung-based Chung Yu Department Store to solicit 200 pairs of
young lovers by Valentine's Day to sponsor one impoverished child
each as part of its efforts to help the kids weather the crisis.</P>
      <P>The sponsorship activity will last through Feb. 14 and each pair
of young lovers will receive a pair of teddy bears after completing
the sponsorship procedure.</P>
      <P>World Vision-Taiwan hopes each pair of young lovers will maintain

      <P>After the speech, Lee told reporters that the 21st century will
be a century filled with paradoxes because all countries will become
competitors, but will also have to cooperate with one another.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan should not be absent from international
cooperation projects in the development of science and technology.</P>
      <P>Regarding the development of cross-Taiwan Strait economic
relations, Lee, who is head of the president's advisory group on
cross-strait relations, said that the best situation would be that
the mainland Chinese economy will continue to grow, while Taiwan will
continue to improve its technological level to maintain its
superiority.</P>
      <P>He said that it is not wrong for Taiwan businessmen to invest in
mainland China, but warned that related regulations are required to
prevent an exodus of capital from Taiwan, which he said might erode
the base of the island's industrial foundation.</P>

Massachusetts become imminent as the British Parliament announces the
state is in rebellion and approves new laws to control the situation.

1799: The U.S. Navy draws first blood in a war with France.

formulate the Monroe Doctrine and who advocated antislavery measures,
is elected the sixth president of the United States, defeating Andrew
Jackson.

1830: Explorer Charles Stuart discovers the source of Australia's
longest river, the Murray.

1881: Feodor Mikhailovich Dostoevski, Russian writer who wrote
such great novels as "Crime and Punishment," "The Idiot," "The
Possessed," and "The Brother Karamazov," dies at the age of 60.

1899: The Boxer Uprising breaks out in China. Sparked by popular
discontent with internal misgovernment and anti-foreign sentiment
aroused by unequal treaties, the boxers lay siege to the foreign
legion in Peking, where a combined force of Japanese, French,
British, Russians, and American troops held out for over a month.

weighted price index breaking the 10,000 point level at the close.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Why should one be too severe? When
a man reforms and comes to me for advice, I accept his present
reformation without inquiring what his past life has been. I am
satisfied if I find that, for the present, he has really reformed,
without being able to guarantee that he will not relapse again. But
why should one be too severe?"</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Deputy
Director-General Francis K.H. Liang left Taipei Friday for Beijing to
attend a senior officials meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Also leaving for Beijing on Friday for the same occasion was Shen
Ssu-tsun, director of the International Organizations Department
under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Liang, he and members of the Chinese Taipei
delegation will exchange views with representatives from other APEC
member nations on certain issues pertaining to international business
and trade relations, such as how to redress the digital gaps among
the different economies in the region.</P>
      <P>The APEC senior officials meeting, to be held Feb. 10-13, will be
the first of its kind this year and will be followed by similar
meetings in May and August prior to the informal summit of the APEC's
21 heads of state in late October in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Mainland China pledged last week that Taiwan would be able to
participate fully in this year's APEC meetings at which Taiwan will
continue using the designation "Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>Liang said he and his delegation will discuss business and trade
affairs under the APEC framework during the three-day meeting in
Beijing. Cross-Taiwan Strait issues will not be on the agenda of any
of the bilateral consultations during the period, he added.</P>
      <P>APEC, founded in 1989 as an informal talking group among a dozen

    <HEADLINE>DOING BUSINESS WITH M'LAND CHINA COMES AT MORAL PRICE: EDITORIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  9 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada is hardly alone in its desire to do
business with the world's most populous country, but doing so with
mainland China comes at a steep moral price, a Canadian newspaper
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In an editorial titled "Human Rights in China," the Montreal
Gazette listed human rights violations by mainland Chinese
authorities, saying that Canadian citizens have not been spared by
Beijing's crackdown.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that Montrealer Jin Yu Li wants Prime Minister
Jean Chretien to press Chinese President Jiang Zemin for the release
of her brother, her husband, and her husband's brother and sister --
all practitioners of Falun Gong -- from a Chinese labor camp.</P>
      <P>The danger in Chretien's not bringing up the issue of human
rights with mainland China is that the Canadian government might come
to appear to be condoning abuses even against its own citizens, the
editorial said.</P>
      <P>It noted that the least the Canadian government can do is stand
up for the rights of its own citizens unfairly arrested and
imprisoned for daring to belong to a group a foreign government
disapproves of.</P>
      <P>The editorial represents one of many calls from Canadian and
human rights groups for the government to act during Chretien's
upcoming trip to China which begins Friday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mercedes Benz maintained its ranking as the
No.1 selling imported passenger car in Taiwan for January 2000,
recently released statistics show.</P>
      <P>Except for BMW, which experienced a slight decline in sales
profits for the first month of the year, most luxury-class imported
passenger automobiles on the top-10 list saw modest profit increases,
according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Mercedes-Benz's E-class ranked in the top spot on the sales list
with 700 cars sold during the month, suggesting that a specific
section of the consumer population has been seemingly unaffected by
Taiwan's sluggish economic climate. Total E-class sales for January
were 2.2 percent higher than those for the same month of the previous
year, the statistics revealed.</P>
      <P>Second on the list was the Toyota Corolla, which obtained a sales
growth rate of 27.7 percent with 604 cars sold. Another Toyota
automobile, the Camry, came in third with 493 cars sold. The number
of Camrys sold during the month however was 9.2 percent lower than
the previous January.</P>
      <P>Mini vans also seemed to be highly favored by car buyers, with
Ford's Escape experiencing a sales growth rate of 102 percent for a
total of 490 vehicles sold during January. Mazda's MPV and Tribute
also made it onto the top 10 list with 432 and 407 vehicles sold,
respectively, and Mercedes-Benz's S-class and C-class came in seventh
and eighth place with 392 and 281 sales, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR SPEAKS AT NEW YORK SYMPOSIUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should continue selling
arms to Taiwan because failing to do so would be detrimental to the
military balance in the Taiwan Strait, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Thursday at a symposium on American policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ma delivered his speech entitled "Cross-Taiwan Strait Relations
at a Crossroads -- Stalemate or Breakthrough?" at the symposium in
New York, which was organized by the National Committee on American
Foreign Policy, an influential U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Ma, a Harvard-trained legal expert, once served as vice chairman
of the Republic of China's Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council,
which charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>He told the 20-some scholars and experts at the symposium that
ROC President Chen Shui-bian had said in his New Year's address that
"one China is not a problem under the ROC Constitution." If this line
of argument can be developed further, Ma continued, it would be
helpful to resolving the current cross-strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>From the manner in which Chen has been handling the controversial
nuclear power plant issue on the homefront, one can tell Chen is a
flexible political figure who is different from the "dogmatists"
within the Democratic Progressive Party, Ma said. The Taipei mayor
urged the symposium participants not to underestimate Chen's ability
to handle the complicated issue of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He added that Taipei and Beijing should resume their dialogue as
soon as possible under the principle of the "1992 consensus" so that
the two sides can begin negotiations on establishing direct trade,
postal, and transport links with each other.</P>
      <P>Before such negotiations are held, however, Ma said that mainland
China must ensure that Taiwan's security will not be threatened and
that Taiwan's diplomatic efforts in the international arena will not
be stifled.</P>
      <P>According to symposium organizers, conclusions reached at the
symposium will be presented to the new Bush administration for
reference. Ma was the only official from either side of the Taiwan
Strait to give a speech at the symposium.</P>
      <P>Ma was also scheduled to head to Chicago after the symposium to
confer with the mayor of Chicago and to inspect that city's garbage
disposal facilities, mass rapid transit system, and crime-prevention
units.</P>
      <P>After his U.S. trip, Ma will visit Hong Kong between Feb. 11-14
where he is slated to meet Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
and deliver a keynote speech on Taipei's vision and its bilateral
exchanges with Hong Kong.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen County Red Cross Society President
Wang Shui-chang said Friday at the inauguration of his chapter's
provisional office that it will serve the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait under the spirit of humanity and philanthropy.</P>
      <P>Kinmen is a frontline island of the Republic of China, which only
recently legalized direct trade, postal, and transport links between
Kinmen and mainland China's Xiamen City, located only kilometers away
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the government's opening measure will bring about
increased exchanges between the people of Kinmen and Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Among those invited to the inauguration ceremony was a group of
elderly visitors from mainland China who arrived Tuesday directly
from Xiamen -- the first legal voyage of its kind in 52 years.</P>
      <P>The visitors, all 65 years of age or older, were originally from
Kinmen but were separated from their families living on the island
when civil war in the late 1940s split the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen Feng-yi, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society of the
Republic of China, presented a collection of computer equipment to
the Kinmen branch office and pledged that the main ROC branch will do
its utmost to assist the Kinmen office in light of its limited
financial strength and human resources.</P>
      <P>Xiamen's Red Cross Society also faxed a memo to congratulate its
Kinmen counterpart as well as to urge the Kinmen Red Cross to play
the role of a "window of exchange" for the people on both sides of
the strait while making new contributions to "the promotion of
peaceful unification."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC ACADEMICIAN TO RECEIVE 2001 ACA NATIONAL AWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.   8   (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born chemistry professor
Yuan-chuan Lee of Johns Hopkins University was chosen Thursday as the
recipient of this year's Claude S. Hudson Award, the most prestigious
citation in chemistry circles in the United States.</P>
      <P>A member of Academia Sinica, the Republic of China's top research
institute, Lee will receive the Claude S. Hudson Award in
Carbohydrate Chemistry from the American Chemistry Association (ACA)
in a presentation ceremony slated for April 3 in San Diego,
California, ACA sources said.</P>
      <P>Lee, elder brother of Academia Sinica President Yuan-tseh Lee,
will be the only award winner in carbohydrate chemistry at this
year's ACA National Awards and the only Chinese to receive an ACA
national award this year.</P>
      <P>ACA sources said 68-year-old Lee, a professor at Johns Hopkins
since 1965, was chosen because his "persistent efforts have enabled
significant advances in the understanding of glycoconjugates such as
glycoproteins and glycolipids."</P>
      <P>Born in Taiwan, Lee earned a master's degree in agricultural
chemistry from National Taiwan University in 1957. He obtained a
doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Iowa in 1962. His
graduate thesis was on the subject of carbohydrate structure of
chicken ovalbumin.</P>
      <P>This thesis, as well as postgraduate work at the University of
California, Berkeley on the subject of Mycobacterium glycolipids and
lipopolysaccharides, motivated Lee to devote himself to the study of
glycobiology and glycosciences, according to ACA.</P>
      <P>Lee's research yielded many insights. For instance, he found ways
to analyze both qualitatively and quantitatively the composition of
glycoconjugates and also to determine their structure. Along the way,
ACA sources said, Lee developed one of the first automated sugar
analyzers, which consisted of a cation-exchange column for amino
sugars and an anion column for neutral sugars in the 10-nmol range.</P>
      <P>These inventions eventually evolved to the form of HPAEC
(high-performance anion-exchange chromatography), which is faster and
more sensitive. HPAEC is now a standard instrumentation in most
carbohydrate research laboratories.</P>
      <P>Using such analytical tools, Lee established the structures of
many N- and O-linked glycans. He was the first to put forth the
concept of "core structure" for the N-glycoside, according to an
academic familiar with Lee's work.</P>
      <P>"Many of the advances in the field of glycobiology have been made
possible by the availability of neoglycoconjugates, and Lee has been
a pioneer in the development of methods for their synthesis," said
another professor of chemistry and biochemistry familiar with Lee's
achievements.</P>
      <P>Lee is an artist when he is not working with chemistry. He
paints, writes and plays cello, viola and violin. One of his works,
written in Japanese, was cited by Japanese literary circles as one of
the best 60 writings of the year some twelve years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WELL-EDUCATED SEE GRADUAL DROP IN TAIWAN'S INT'L STANDING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Well-educated and well-traveled respondents
in a public opinion poll released Friday by the Foreign Ministry
tended to say that they see Taiwan's international standing gradually
declining over time.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, conducted between Jan. 4-9 with 1,068
effective samples collected from citizens around the island aged 20
and above, only 13.8 percent of the respondents said that they see a
gradual rise in Taiwan's international standing, 39.1 percent see no
changes, and 41.5 percent see a decline throughout the years. The
remaining 5.6 percent did not clearly answer the question.</P>
      <P>Luo Chih-cheng, director of the Foreign Ministry's Research and
Planning Board, which conducted the poll, said that those respondents
who traveled more frequently, held higher educational degrees, and
were supporters of the opposition Kuomintang, were more pessimistic
about the nation's diplomatic performance and international standing
than other respondents.</P>
      <P>Luo said that the impression of Taiwan's declining global
standing came about mainly due to the recent changes in the nation's
domestic financial and social situation. Mainland China's rapid
development in recent years also played a role in reinforcing this
impression, he added.</P>
      <P>In a similar poll conducted last year, 25.8 percent of the
respondents said they saw a gradual rise in the nation's global
standing, 33.2 percent saw no changes, and 18 percent saw a gradual
decline.</P>
      <P>On the Foreign Ministry's performance over the past year, 43.4
percent of the respondents in the most recent poll expressed
satisfaction, while 44.7 percent expressed dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 42.7 percent of the respondents expressed optimism for
the nation's future diplomatic work, while 47.4 percent expressed
pessimism.</P>
      <P>Luo added that the public did not seem to be very satisfied with
the nation's diplomatic work as a whole, but when asked to express
their view on individual aspects of the government's foreign policy,
higher marks were given.</P>
      <P>Approval ratings for Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao were not
announced with the rest of the poll results. Luo said that the
figures will be used for internal evaluation purposes.</P>
      <P>The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percent,
according to the sampling authors of the survey.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chernobyl accident, the world's worst
nuclear power plant disaster that occurred in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in
April 1986, should serve as a powerful reminder to Taiwan, President
Chen Shui-bian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ukraine, a constituent republic of the former Soviet Union, is
well-known for its scientific technological research and development,
Chen said, adding that Ukraine and Taiwan should further bolster
bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic, sci-tech, medical
and academic fields so as to prop up substantive ties between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he met with former Ukrainian President
Leonid Kravchuk, who is currently on a short visit in Taiwan with a
delegation of parliamentarians from Ukraine.</P>
      <P>Chen told Kravchuk that Ukraine and Taiwan should swap liaison or
representative offices, saying that establishment of such offices
would accelerate cooperation between the two countries, which began
to engage in bilateral exchanges in 1992.</P>
      <P>"Under promotional efforts by Kravchuk and incumbent President
Leonid Danylovich Kuchma, Ukraine's substantive relations with Taiwan
are becoming increasing cordial and close," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Citing government statistics, Chen noted that two-way trade
between Taiwan and Ukraine amounted to US$367 million in 2000, an
increase of US$90 million over the 1999 figure. Last year, Ukraine
enjoyed a trade surplus of US$269 million with Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his admiration for Kravchuk, a successful
statesman and economist who helped promote economic reforms in
Ukraine during his tenure as president between 1991 and 1994.</P>
      <P>Kravchuk is particularly commendable for Ukraine's contribution
in nuclear disarmament and the nation's quest for democracy and
journalistic freedom, Chen continued.</P>
      <P>For his part, Kravchuk, currently a Ukrainian parliamentarian,
said he has long been impressed with Taiwan's achievement in economic
and sci-tech development.</P>
      <P>He noted that only when a country's people enjoy full economic
freedom can a creative miracle become possible.</P>
      <P>He stressed that bilateral relations between Ukraine and Taiwan
should not be undermined by pressure from Beijing, adding that the
two countries instead should establish information exchange centers
in each other's nations to further strengthen cooperation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OIL SPILL CLEAN-UP OF NATURE RESERVE TO BE COMPLETED `IN ONE MONTH'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) chief Lin Chun-yi said Friday that the oil spill in a nature
reserve in Kenting National Park in southwestern Taiwan will be
cleaned up "within one month."</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks when he presided over a supra-government
task force meeting, which was formed almost four weeks after a Greek
freighter ran aground half a mile off the coast of Oluanpi on Jan.
14, creating one of the worst oil spill disasters in Taiwan's
history.</P>
      <P>Participants in the meeting included representatives from the
Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of National Defense, the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Coast Guard
Administration, other government agencies and environmental
protection groups.</P>
      <P>Lin said that as the clean-up operations will involve many
government agencies, he has asked them all to submit their own
clean-up plans within a week.</P>
      <P>The Kenting National Park Administration will then coordinate
with the military to help clear the oil spill in the Lungkeng marine
preserve region, which he said is expected to be completed "within
two weeks to one month."</P>
      <P>During the second stage of the clean-up operation, the EPA will
study using high pressure water or oil-eating microorganisms, which
he estimated will take about one year to store the ecosystem to its
natural state.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rough sea in the Kenting area forced the suspension of
the cleanup operation near Lungkeng Thursday and Friday, while a
police helicopter flew over the area to inspect the oil spill and
chart its extent.</P>
      <P>More than 20 fishermen rallied outside the National Marine Museum
where the meeting took place, to ask for a speedy clean-up operation,
the removal of the Greek freighter Amargos, for the government to
duly compensate them for their losses and to demand compensation from
the ship owner on their behalf.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who had earlier said that he was
"baffled" as to why it took so long for the EPA to get involved in
the clean-up operation, asked the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission Friday to conduct a thorough investigation of
the case to find out if there was any negligence in dealing with the
ecological disaster.</P>
      <P>The premier also met with Chen Pao-lang, vice president of
Chinese Petroleum Corp. and three other professionals who have
experience in cleaning up oil spills to solicit their views about the
cleanup work.</P>
      <P>The premier was also scheduled to travel to Pingtung and make a
helicopter trip to inspect the oil spill Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Greek-registered Amargos, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore,
ran aground off Kenting National Park -- one of the most treasured
nature preserves in Taiwan -- Jan. 14. An estimated 1,150 tons of
fuel oil leaked from the vessel. The 35,000-ton ship had been heading
for Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed a
mechanical problem and began to drift. All 25 crewmen were rescued,
but the mostly submerged ship later broke in two.</P>
      <P>Professor Chiu Wen-yen of National Sun Yat-sen University who
first blew the whistle on the problem by writing to a newspaper, said
Taiwan still "has not learned its lesson" despite a score of oil
spill incidents over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the remarks when he attended a meeting convened by
legislators Tsao Chi-hung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party,
Liao Hsueh-kuang of non partisan affiliation, and Chao Yung-ching of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Chiu also warned that if oil spill cannot be completely cleaned
up by March, the "loshanfeng," a wild and howling wind special to
the region, will make the slick expand even further.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao said that Taiwan Strait serves as a major route
for shipping petroleum and that the EPA needs to learn from the
incident, map out emergency measures to deal with marine pollution
according to the law and invite world experts to come to Taiwan to
help train local personnel to cope with cleanup operations.</P>
      <P>The opposition alliance in the legislature also lashed out at the
EPA Friday for failing to form a task force in the initial stages,
resulting in heavy environmental pollution and damage, and said that
the government should crack down on those who have neglected their
duties.</P>
      <P>Legislators Wang Tien-ching of the People First Party and Tseng
Yuan-chuan of the KMT asked for the EPA chief to step down, while
legislators Chiang Yi-wen of the KMT and Hsieh Chi-ta of the New
Party said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications should
also take responsibility.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's political risk rating has decreased
year by year, although it is still 16th in the world, according to an
evaluation report compiled by the Swiss-based Business Environment
Risk Intelligence (BERI).</P>
      <P>BERI gave Taiwan a political risk mark of 59, a sizable decrease
from 1994, when the island was rated at 70.</P>
      <P>The decrease of political risk has affected Taiwan's total
investment environment standing, bringing its ranking to fifth among
the 50 countries to receive the BERI rating.</P>
      <P>The report also predicted that the political risk rating for
Taiwan will further decrease next year to 58, but it predicted that
the rate will increase to 64 mark within six years.</P>
      <P>Switzerland was ranked first, followed by Singapore, Holland and
Japan. The United States, Germany, Norway, Austria, Belgium and
France came in behind Taiwan, while mainland China was ranked 22nd.</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Economic Affairs official attributed the decrease

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan formally registered Friday as a candidate for the party
chairmanship in the first popular election of the party chief
scheduled to take place March 24.</P>
      <P>Lien submitted 100,263 signed petitions for his candidacy to
complete the registration process.</P>
      <P>Although hopeful candidates must submit at least 28,585
signatures by Feb. 15 before being eligible to take part in the
election, Lien had already collected more than 100,000 signatures.</P>
      <P>Noting that it will be the first popular KMT election in the
party's 106-year history, Lien said his registration represents the
beginning of democracy following party reforms.</P>
      <P>He vowed to lead a broad-based KMT if elected and that he will
unite the party and its allies to safeguard national dignity and the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>Asked about the KMT's decision not to pursue embezzlement charges
against former KMT Secretary-General James Soong after a prosecutor
ruled Jan. 20 that there was insufficient evidence to make a case,
Lien said that "today is a new era" and that he "will look forward

      <P>Lien also said he will meet with Soong, chairman of the

      <P>The case arose from a huge amount of cash stashed in a secret
bank account controlled by Soong. When the bank account came to light
during the peak of the presidential election campaign, Soong, who ran
in the election as an independent, claimed the funds were put in his
charge by then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui to finance secret political
operations.</P>

accreditation for reporting local news to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Fan Liqing and Zhen Binhua, both of whom are with the official

while reporting the news during their month-long stay in the greater

      <P>Expressing its welcome to the two mainland Chinese reporters, the
GIO said that the major reason behind the Republic of China
government's decision to ease regulations on news coverage by
mainland reporters in Taiwan is to boost bilateral communication and
understanding between the people on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>A total of 6,236 members of the mainland Chinese mass media have

      <P>Related government agencies are still in the

China's "go slow, be patient" policy regarding investment in the
mainland, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the MAC, said that in line with
the conclusion of the National Economic Development Conference
reached in January this year, the government has instructed related
government agencies to review the policy and come up with their own

the returning of profits to Taiwan, matching measures will also be
taken, adding that he expects the review report to be completed by

      <P>The government initiated the "go slow, be patient" policy in
1996, saying that Taiwan investment in mainland China had become too
feverish at a time when Beijing still harbored hostility toward
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The policy has restricted investments by Taiwan manufacturers in
the infrastructure on the mainland and has subjected each investment

    <HEADLINE>"EMISSARIES" FAIL TO SHOW FOR PROBE HEARING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two former Taiwan officials who secretly
contacted senior Beijing officials at the behest of former Republic
of China President Lee Teng-hui failed to show up at a probe hearing
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Su Chih-cheng, former personal secretary to the retired Lee, and
Cheng Su-ming, chairwoman of the China Television Company, did not
appear at the prosecutors office of the Taiwan District Court to be
questioned by a prosecutor on their roles as the former president's
so-called "emissaries".</P>
      <P>In a separate written motion to the prosecutors office, the two
said they are tied to other business and could not attend Friday's
hearing.</P>
      <P>The two were asked by former President Lee Teng-hui to contact
representatives of Beijing leaders in Hong Kong and mainland China
secretly between 1988 and 2000.</P>
      <P>The secret contacts between the leaders of the two sides came to
light in July, 2000, and the two negotiators were accused by a
critic of President Lee, New Party Legislator Elmer Fung, of
violating the National Security Law which prohibits public officials
from visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>In an unrelated development, Leg. Fung said at the Legislative
Yuan that he will ask the prosecutors' office to probe former
President Lee for what he called a violation of the Public Officials
Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Fung told reporters that Lee instituted a judicial probe against
former presidential candidate James Soong over an alleged
embezzlement in the lead up to the March 18 presidential election with
the intent of preventing Soong from winning the race which is an
offense under the Public Officials Election and Recall Law.</P>
      <P>Since a prosecutor has cleared Soong of any wrongdoing on Jan.
20, Fung said it is naturally that Lee should bear the legal
responsibility for wrongly accusation with political motives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT WANTS TO REDUCE MEDIATION FEES PAID BY FOREIGN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official with the Council of Labor
Affairs said Friday that the government will consider adopting a
direct hiring system for the hiring of foreign workers if the
mediation fees paid by foreign workers remain high.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, the maximum permissible mediation
fee per person is NT$56,000 (US$1,735), but the actual figure paid is
often as high as NT$150,000-200,000.</P>
      <P>In a move to help prevent the unreasonable amounts being charged,
the official said that the government recently concluded
direct-hiring memorandums with the Philippines and Vietnam, adding
that negotiations for such a memorandum with Indonesia opened Friday.</P>
      <P>At present, there are two systems for hiring foreign workers --
direct hiring and hiring through agents.</P>
      <P>The official stressed that if the agents do not reduce their
mediation fees, the government may consider enforcing the direct
hiring system through which local hirers can submit their
applications and conduct interviews at the Taipei offices of the
labor exporting countries.</P>
      <P>Once a hirer decides to hire a foreign worker, the administrative
procedures can be entrusted to the agents. By doing so, the agents
will still be able to survive and mediation fees will be reduced
considerably.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WU ELECTED CHAIR OF ASIAN-PACIFIC CAUCUS IN U.S. CONGRESS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Rep. David Wu, the first Chinese
American member of the U.S. House of Representatives, has become
leader of the group of 25 Asian-Pacific American members of Congress.</P>
      <P>Rep. Robert Underwood, D-Ga., the outgoing chairman of the
Congressional Asian-Pacific American Caucus, announced Thursday that
Wu, D-Ore., was elected the new chairman by a unanimous vote. Wu was
vice chairman of the group in the previous Congress.</P>
      <P>Rep. Michael Honda, D-Calif., became the new vice chairman in
Wednesday's election, which was held following the swearing-in of the
107th Congress.</P>
      <P>Wu is "very familiar with Asian-Pacific American issues and will
provide great leadership for the 107th Congress," Underwood said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1994, the caucus has been dedicated to the promotion
of various Asian-Pacific American issues and to ensuring that
legislation by Congress provides for the full participation of
Asian-Pacific Americans and reflects their needs and concerns.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are presently 25 members in the caucus,
including three senators and 22 House members.</P>
      <P>Born in Taiwan in 1955, Wu and his family immigrated to

    <HEADLINE>IMBALANCED EXCHANGES NO GOOD FOR TAIWAN: KINMEN COUNTY CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unilateral enthusiasm about two-way
exchanges with mainland China is not beneficial to Taiwan, Kinmen
County Chief Chen Shui-tsai said Friday.</P>
      <P>If such a situation continues without adjustments or improvements
from mainland China, it will have a negative impact on future
bilateral relations between Taiwan and mainland China as the "mini
three links" serve as a major indicator of the state of bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a farewell party held for 75 Kinmen-born
senior citizens who will return to Xiamen, located directly opposite
Kinmen in Fujian province, after a four-day stay on the Republic of
China-controlled frontline island which is their native homeland.</P>
      <P>The 75 men were the first group of mainland residents allowed to
come to Taiwan territory via a direct sailing across the Taiwan
Strait after the Republic of China opened shipping links between its
offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected ports in mainland
China at the start of this year.</P>
      <P>Although mainland Chinese authorities gave approval to the
significant direct trip to Kinmen by the 75 elderly citizens, the
first of its kind in 52 years, the Kinmen county chief said such
sailings are still a long way from becoming common practice.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, more than 7,000 Kinmen residents have applied
to travel to mainland China for business or to visit family members.
However, mainland Chinese authorities still see the direct shipping
link between Kinmen and Xiamen as a special route and have not made
the step of considering it a regular path.</P>
      <P>Against such a background, passengers and cargo on the two sides
are unable to be freely exchanged, Chen noted, adding that such
imbalanced exchanges fall far short of the people's expectations.</P>
      <P>He called on mainland Chinese authorities to create greater
benefits for the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait by
normalizing direct Kinmen-Xiamen sailings.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's central bank Friday welcomed the
Bank of Japan's move to cut the rediscount rate to 0.35 percent from
0.5 percent, saying this would be conducive to promoting the whole of
Asia's economic growth.</P>
      <P>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced Friday evening the rediscount
rate cut in a bid to stimulate Japan's economic recovery. The BOJ
also decided to keep the inter-bank overnight call rate unchanged at
0.25 percent.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the Bank of Japan lowered the rediscount
rate since ending the era of the zero-rate last year.</P>
      <P>Because Japan plays a major leading role in Asia's overall
economy, if the rate reduction move is able to stimulate economic
recovery in Japan, it will also has a positive effect on Taiwan's
economy, CBC officials said, adding that they welcome the BOJ's move.</P>

      <P>Taipei County citizens should have a
better living environment, according to the results of a survey
released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey of Taipei County living standards was conducted by the
Tzu-Huei Cultural Foundation (THCF) and focused on the living and
environmental quality in the county.</P>
      <P>In terms of quality of life, the respondents were most concerned
about security, including women's safety, sex crimes, burglary and
robbery. There was also widespread dissatisfaction with the quality
of leisure space and public transport.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, the Sanchung city government
gained the lowest satisfaction from the respondents in terms of
services rendered, while the administrations of Wanli, Shihmen and
Linkou earned the highest marks.</P>
      <P>The poll results showed that the respondents find their material
condition, local humanitarian groups' concern for citizens, and
education to be acceptable.</P>
      <P>THCF Chairman Lin Chang-hsun noted that although Taipei City and
Taipei County are next to each other geographically and Taipei
County's population and territory are greater than those of Taipei
City, Taipei County gets far fewer financial resources than Taipei
City.</P>
      <P>Chung Yuan Christian University President Hsiung Shen-kan said
local governments should develop their own individual styles.
He added that the Taipei county government should make more efforts
to attract consumers to the county in order to narrow the differences
between Taipei city and county.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The undersea cable between mainland China
and the United States broke early Friday, seriously limiting millions
of local Internet surfers' access to North American websites.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom Co., which uses the cable to connect
with Northern America, said the cable broke on a stretch between
Japan and Chungming Island in eastern China at about 7:00 a.m.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has dispatched a work ship to the scene to repair
the cable, but since the break occurred at a site some three hundreds
miles east of Chungming Island, it might take two weeks before
repairs are completed, said Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>The operations of local internet service providers, such as HiNet
and SeedNet, that rent use of the cable from Chunghwa Telecom to
communicate data have grinded to a halt because of the incident.
Meanwhile, voice communications, which can be carried through four
other cables, have not been affected at all, said Chunghwa Telecom.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom has rerouted its Internet services through
satellites and also the Pacific undersea cable, but because of the
limited band width of these alternate paths, traffic was backed and
moving slowly Friday.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom said the services will improve after other
countries that use the Pacific cable make more cable capacity
available for Taipei. The broken cable will cost Chunghwa Telecom
millions of dollars in loss of business per day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN APPEALS FOR PEACE WITH BEIJING (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,   Feb.   9   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In an interview with the World
Parliamentarians monthly, the Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian appeals for peace with Beijing while holding his ground by
not conceding to Beijing's claim of "one China".</P>
      <P>In the interview, conducted in Taipei in December and published
here Friday, Chen said that Taipei is ready to negotiate with Beijing
but that Beijing has refused to sit down at the negotiating table
until the island accepts what Beijing calls the "one China" principle
that Taiwan is actually part of China.</P>
      <P>But Chen said in the interview that as a democratically elected
president, he has "no right to contradict any decision by the people
of Taiwan. The people's will must be respected."</P>
      <P>Citing the proposals presented recently by the cross-party Task
Force on Cross-strait Relations that any changes to the present
situation in Taiwan requires the approval of the people, Chen said he
hopes for "a consensus and conclusion among the political parties and
factions."</P>
      <P>Claiming that a new epoch of dialogue has arrived, the president
said "no political party, no government and no individual can refuse
or hinder the opening of the gates to reconciliation across the
strait".</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing to follow the example of South Korea and North
Korea, which put aside a number of important issues and opened
dialogue without attaching any prerequisites or conditions.</P>
      <P>Following is the full text of the interview with President Chen:</P>
      <P>Reconciliation and Dialogue across the Taiwan Strait</P>
      <P>Relations between China and Taiwan across the Taiwan Strait will
be critical in world geopolitics in 2001. Symbolically, on the first
January, the first direct trade link was officially established
across the Strait. Has a new flexibility begun to surface across the
Taiwan Strait? Chen Shui-bian, the first President of Taiwan elected
from outside Nationalist Party which dominated the political scene
over the years, has launched a peace offensive towards Beijing
through an exclusive interview with World Parliamentarian.</P>
      <P>Having achieved for the first time a peaceful, democratic
transfer of government in Taiwan, President Chen is ready to commit
himself to the new mood of reconciliation and confidence-building in
the East Asian region. He compares China-Taiwan relations with the
other two 'time bombs' in the region - the Korean Peninsula and the
South Sea region. There have been talks on the Korean Peninsula
between the US, Communist China and North and South Korea. As for the
South Seas, regional dialogue has taken place in the Asean Regional
Forum (ARF). When it comes to the Taiwan Strait, there has been no
opportunity for dialogue so far. President Chen sees hope in the
example of the Korean Peninsula where "South and North came hand in
hand, so that an environment for reconciliation was produced". He
envisages "reaching across the Strait hand in hand to resume
dialogue, thus managing to solve a number of misunderstandings and
avoid crashes".

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN APPEALS FOR PEACE WITH BEIJING (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,   Feb.   9   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>He refers to events four years ago during the first general
election in Taiwan, when the Chinese mainland launched a missile into
the Taiwan Strait. Strait relations were extremely tense. President
Chen ascribes the further deterioration in relations on his election
in March 2000 to misunderstandings about him and his Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on the Chinese mainland. However, he insists
that "today, regardless of enormous difficulties and challenges, we
are in the epoch of dialogue, in which no political party, no
government and no individual can refuse or hinder the opening of a
gate for reconciliation across the Strait". His image is that of "a
table for dialogue across the Strait...Taiwan is already seated on
one side of the table while the chair on the other side remains
vacant".</P>
      <P>However the government in Beijing refuses to resume talks unless
Taiwan accepts the "one China" principle, whereby they insist that
Taiwan is actually part of China. President Chen sees the Korean
example as offering a solution to this stalemate: "they did not
attach any premises or conditions and temporarily put aside a number
of important issues". He insists that "the final conclusion and
consensus will be only attainable as the result of mutual concessions
and compromises."</P>
      <P>He is firm, at least on the surface, on his position regarding
"unification" across the Strait. As the democratically elected
President, when it comes to the future of Taiwan or new cross-Strait
relations, he feels he has "no right to contradict any decision by
the people of Taiwan. The choice of the people's free will must be
respected."</P>
      <P>The recent cross-party Task Force on Cross-strait Relations
presented proposals stating that any change in the present situation
in Taiwan ought to obtain the democratic approval of the people. Chen
hopes ideally for "a consensus and conclusion among the political
parties and factions." Without this he would have to resort to an
"appeal to the people's will". He is unwilling, however, to specify a
referendum, having in his inauguration address offered to rule out a
Taiwanese referendum on unification or independence, providing that
the Chinese mainland would not exercize its military options. Beijing
has warned to retaliate by vigilant means against Taiwan's move
towards independence.</P>
      <P>When asked if he anticipates any revision of the Constitution
during his term, President Chen insists that it is his "my vocation
and mission to observe the Constitution, including the sovereignty,
dignity and safety as well as the best welfare of the people." He
admits that "until a few years ago, there were some colleagues in the
Democratic Progress Party who turned their backs on the national flag
when they took their oaths as civil servants. Today, such a problem
no longer exists." At the DPP Representative Assembly in May 1999,
the observation of the Constitution was confirmed. This shift in
theDPP position, originally known as pro-independent is
"business-like, rational and progressive", he emphasizes.

    <DATELINE>Brussels,   Feb.   9   (CNA)
(By  P.C.  Tang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Even if the resumption of formal cross-Strait talk is out of
sight for the moment, Chen is willing to build informal contacts to
resume the "civilian dialogue" interrupted in 1995. As he says "On
whatever subject, in whichever form and in whatever venue, we are
ready to meet and have a dialogue at any time." And he senses some
easing in Beijing's position since his inauguration, compared to the
tense relations of the pre-election period.</P>
      <P>In his book "Son of Taiwan", Chen expresses high regard for the
role of preventive diplomacy and early warning. In this context, he
feels that, for example, military exercises ought to be mutually
notified in advance. Similarly, the Taiwanese media is very
diversified but the content of reports is not always true and is
often exaggerated. Misunderstandings can occur if Communist China
judges only through newspapers and the electronic media of Taiwan.
Such situations, he feels, could be overcome with a diplomatic
mechanism for mutual communication.</P>
      <P>With both sides of the Strait due to join the World Trade
Organisation in the first half of 2001, Taiwan as well as Communist
China will be obliged to follow international rules. Chen anticipates
that the resulting liberalisation of the economy and
internationalisation will accelerate the pace of democratic reform in
Communist China, with positive effects on peace, security and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>In the WTO, consultations are necessary and, naturally,
contacts and dialogue occur. Circumstances are turning out to make it
impossible for Communist China to avoid exchanges with Taiwan, says
Chen. Although one may say that "politics and the economy are
divided", in reality, it will be extremely difficult to distinguish
them. He supposes an impediments on political issues shall
inevitablly affect the economic dimension.</P>
      <P>On the international scene, Chen emphasises that, if Taiwan were
forced to become part of Communist China, the stability of Japan
would be immediately under threat - the Taiwan Strait is a life-line
for Japan, too. A crisis or war in the Strait would threaten not only
Taiwan but also Japan, the US and the US position in the Western
Pacific theatre. The prosperity of the Asia-Pacific area depends upon
Taiwan's firm status on the international scene as well as upon
defence and military exchanges between Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Turning to domestic policy, Chen elaborates on his recent
controversial decision to halt construction on a nuclear power
station, a decision which risked his impeachment. He expands on
Taiwan's New Middle Line policy in which "the economy must be
developed but we should not forget the environment, ecology and
sustainable growth". The nuclear power station issue was not only an
economic issue but also a question of energy, of safety, and of good
faith. He is committed to a nuclear power-free state and believes
that this will become mainstream thinking.</P>
      <P>Both on the international scene and in domestic politics,
President Chen hold to principles that he sums up, in a paraphrase of
US President Lincoln, as "You do not always have to succeed, but you
ought not to do things against good faith."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER NOTIFIES G.E. TO RESUME WORK ON NUKE PLANT CORE GEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S.-based General Electric Co. was
recently notified by Taiwan Power Co. to resume building the pressure
vessel for the first reactor to be installed in Taiwan's fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>G.E., which was awarded a US$1.799 billion contract by Taipower
in 1996 to supply two reactors and the initial fuel to be used for
the fourth nuclear plant, will soon restart work on the pressure
vessel. The pressure vessel was about to be completed last October
prior to Taipower calling for a halt in the wake of Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung's announcement scrapping the power plant project, said
G.E. spokesman John Redding.</P>
      <P>Redding, in an interview with the Central News Agency, said that
General Electric welcomes the restart of construction, which he
described as "a move beneficial to both G.E. and Taipower."</P>
      <P>Redding said that Taipower is one of General Electric's most
important clients and that his company strongly hopes to fulfill the
contract. However, he noted, G.E. respects all the decisions made by
Taipower, even if unexpected changes arise.</P>
      <P>The spokesman also categorically denied that there were any flaws
in the contract that his company signed with Taipower in 1996,
stressing that all contracts G.E. has signed with companies around
the world conform to the law and to moral principles.</P>
      <P>On the drawn-out dispute in Taiwan over the fourth nuclear power
plant, Redding said G.E. has been paying close attention to the
issue, although it cannot do much besides wait patiently for the
final "political decision" to be made by the Taiwan authorities.</P>

      <P>A 59-member pilgrimage group left the
Republic of China's frontline island of Matsu Saturday for a direct
voyage to Fuzhou in mainland China's southeastern Fujian Province,
which lies opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Peikan Shangshukung Temple-organized delegation visited the
Taijiang Shuibu Shangshukung Temple in Fuzhou to pay respects
for a local deity shortly after their arrival in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>It was the second Matsu religious group to make a direct
voyage to Fuzhou since the ROC government opened its two offshore
defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu for direct trade, postal and
shipping links with mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou, commonly
known as "mini three links," at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 2, a religious group organized by Matsu's Tienhou Temple
made a direct sail to Fuzhou for a pilgrimage tour of a temple
dedicated to the Chinese Goddess of Sea.</P>
      <P>As Beijing is pushing for full direct trade, transport and postal
links with Taiwan, also known as "big three links," it has only
grudgingly went along with the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links"
program. It approved the Shangshukung Temple group's direct voyage
only after intensive talks between Kuomintang Legislator Tsao
Er-chung and Fujian officials.</P>
      <P>In addition to its pilgrimage activities, the group will also
tour cultural relics and tourist attractions in Shanghai, Beijing,
Hangzhou and other major mainland cities before returning to Matsu
on Feb. 20.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has so far also allowed a Kinmen County
Government-run ferry to make two direct voyages to Xiamen. And on
Tuesday, a mainland Chinese ship made the first legal crossing to
Kinmen in 51 years, carrying 75 elderly Kinmen residents, who have
been stranded on the mainland since the civil war in the 1940s, for a
four-day visit to their homeland.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has been urging mainland authorities to allow
direct Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Fuzhou shipping services on a regular
basis so that the "mini three links" can make headway to pave the way
for the opening of "big three links" in the not-too-distant future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual duck-watching season in the area
near Huanchiang Bridge in Taipei began Saturday, officials of Taipei
City Government's Department of Reconstruction said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Wild Birds Society, which sponsors the annual event,
said that over 10,000 ducks have flown to the are and settled at
their winter resort to escape the cold.</P>
      <P>Among the 10,000 ducks are 9,000 green-winged teals, 326 northern
shovelers, 37 northern pintails, and nearly a hundred gadwalls,
officials said. Several precious pied avocets, a type of rare bird
approximately 42 centimeters in length and having black-and-white
feathers, also appeared earlier in February.</P>
      <P>Many parents took their children to the duck-watching area
Saturday to enjoy the scene of large numbers of our wing-flapping
feathered friends.</P>
      <P>Officials said that the city government's reconstruction of the
wetland area after a severe typhoon last year has led to an increase
in the amount of plankton in the soil, bringing a larger number of
ducks to the area. The birds often gather at the waters some 50
meters from the riverbank during the swelling tide, entertaining
onlookers.</P>
      <P>Ou Chin-der, political deputy mayor of Taipei City Government,
said in a speech marking the opening of the duck-watching season that
the city government has been establishing several bird-watching parks
in the region from Kuandu to Huachiang in Taipei County. The parks
will function as points of interest and preservation sites for

      <P>The quota for Taiwan textile exports to
the United States was increased slightly for 2001 along with the
change of notes in the U.S.-Taiwan textile trade agreement, a Taiwan
trade negotiator said here Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-ya, director-general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade,
said that after talks with America's acting chief textile negotiator,
the two sides reached an agreement on the change of notes Friday at
noon with the effective period of the trade accord being extended for
one more year.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, the Republic of China's representative to the

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CHANG INSPECTS SITE OF OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung traveled to
the southernmost county of Pingtung on Saturday to inspect from a
helicopter the pollution along the coast caused by an oil spill from
a grounded Greek freighter that is threatening to lead to an
ecological disaster in the area.</P>
      <P>After the nearly-two-hour bird's-eye inspection, Chang called for
swift action to control the oil spill, including the quick removal of
the Greek freighter M.V. Amorgos from the site to avoid further
pollution and the speedy clean-up of the coral reef area that has
already been blanketed by oil.</P>
      <P>Chang also instructed that the oil spill which has blanketed
about 800 meters of the coastline in the Kenting National Park nature
reserve should be cleaned up within 30 working days.</P>
      <P>The premier said he has also asked the Cabinet-level Research,
Development, and Evaluation Commission to conduct a thorough
investigation to find out if there was any negligence of duty on the
part of relevant officials in dealing with the ecological disaster.</P>
      <P>He told the media that the actual pollution caused by the oil
spill is not as serious as has been described in previous days. He
pointed out that the spill is fortunately made up of fuel oil and not
crude oil, which is comparatively more difficult to clean up.</P>
      <P>The Greek cargo ship, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, ran
aground Jan. 14 off the coast of the scenic Kenting National Park --
one of the most treasured nature reserves in Taiwan. An estimated
1,150 tons of fuel oil are feared to have leaked from the vessel,
while some 200 tons still remains in the grounded ship's fuel tank.</P>
      <P>Chang said that before the sunken cargo ship is removed from the
location, some 60,000 tons of iron ore and 200 tons of fuel oil will
have to first be emptied from the vessel to allow it to raise to the
surface.</P>
      <P>The freighter had been heading for Nantong in mainland China from
Singapore when it developed a mechanical problem and began to drift.
All 25 crewmembers were rescued, but the mostly submerged ship later
sunk.</P>
      <P>Chang, the highest-ranking official to visit the site of the oil
spill nearly four weeks after the accident happened, declined to
comment on how the administration will deal with Environmental
Protection Administrator Lin Chun-yi, whom opposition lawmakers
lambasted for a dereliction of duty. They also asked for him to be
fired to take responsibility for the government's slow response to
the disaster.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Republic of China Army promised to pitch in with
clean-up operations with some 600 soldiers.</P>
      <P>More effective clean-up methods, including the use of oil-eating
microorganisms and high-pressure water, are expected to begin within
a week, said Environmental Protection Administrator Lin, who
accompanied the premier on his inspection trip.</P>
      <P>Lin estimated that by using these environmentally-friendly
methods, it will take about one year to restore the ecosystem in the
affected area to its natural state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP VICE CHAIR SEES SLIM CHANCES OF KMT COOPERATION IN ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP) Vice
Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung said Saturday that he foresees slim
chances of cooperation between his party and the Kuomintang (KMT) in
the year-end Legislative Yuan elections.</P>
      <P>Chang, a cardiologist-turned-politician, made the remarks in
response to a press inquiry after attending a funeral for Tai
Kuo-hui, a former national policy advisor to the President.</P>
      <P>As the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until last May and
now still controls more than half of seats in the legislature,
decided earlier this week to put the brakes on its financial
litigation with PFP Chairman James Soong, a former KMT
secretary-general, in order to end "old feud" and promote
rapprochement, the local press is interested in the possibility of
the two parties cooperating in the parliamentary and local government
chiefs elections late this year.</P>
      <P>Responding to the question, Chang said it's almost impossible for
the two parties to cooperate in the legislature elections. "As for
the elections of county magistrates and city mayors, there may be
some room. But it will need sophisticated maneuvering technology,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that PFP Chairman Soong is scheduled to
return to Taipei Sunday after a vacation trip to the United States.
After his return, Chang said, Soong is expected to express his views
on the KMT's decision to abandon financial litigation against him and
the simmering deadlock between the Democratic Progressive Party-led
administration and the opposition-controlled legislature over the
fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said even though the room for PFP-KMT
cooperation in the year-end elections is limited, the two parties
may still be able to work out innovative cooperative strategies
since both parties have large talent pools and share similar ideals
of promoting national development in a stable environment.</P>
      <P>The PFP, a splinter group from the KMT, was formed shortly after
last March's presidential election in which Soong, who rank as an
independent, garnered 36.8 percent of the vote, far higher than KMT
candidate Lien Chan's 23 percent.</P>
      <P>In related news, PFP Legislator Shen Chih-hui said Saturday
that the PFP and the KMT are unlikely to cooperate in the year-end
mayoral election in the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>"Our party has our own consideration. We will certainly field a
qualified and competent candidate to run in the Taichung mayoral
election," Shen said in response to a question from KMT spokesman
Jason Hu about the possibility of the PFP backing his bid for the
post. Hu, a former foreign minister, is seeking KMT nomination for
the Taichung mayoral race.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Anti-Nuclear Action Alliance
will stage a large-scale demonstration Feb. 24 in Taipei to call for
a national referendum on whether to complete construction of Taiwan's
fourth nuclear power plant, the alliance's leader said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a press conference held in Taipei, Kao Cheng-yen, convenor of
the alliance composed of more than 40 organizations, urged the local
people to stand up so that they can have a say in the future of the
controversial nuclear plant, a project begun under the former
Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>Kao, who is also the founder of Taiwan's Green Party, pointed out
that the public can no longer stand the ongoing impasse on the issue
of the power plant and the inability of politicians to resolve it,
saying the people should urge the government to hold a referendum.</P>
      <P>The alliance indicated that the administration of Chen Shui-bian
has won the applause of more than one hundred environmental
protection groups around the world since it announced the scrapping
of the project last October.</P>
      <P>A Japanese anti-nuclear forum praised President Chen, predicting
that he will become the most influential leader in Asia in the new
age. Meanwhile, Green Peace and some other American and European
environmental groups have expressed regret over the fact that the
issue has become politically bogged down, saying that Taiwan would
have become a model for the world for its decision to forsake nuclear
power by scrapping the fourth plant.</P>
      <P>Legislator Jao Yung-ching said that what is right should not be
sacrificed, adding that too much political squabbling only suffocates
the space for clear thinking and carrying out what is right.</P>
      <P>Participants at Saturday's press conference also included
legislators, political critics, professors, and actors.</P>

      <P>The 2001 Kaohsiung
International Book Exhibition opened Saturday at the Kaohsiung World
Trade Center after a ribbon-cutting ceremony presided over by Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung.</P>
      <P>One-hundred-and-eighty thousand books provided by 388 publishing
houses at home and abroad are on display at the book exhibition which
will last through Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Chang encouraged Kaohsiung City
Hall to frequently organize similar cultural activities in the future
in a bid to change the public's impression of the southern Taiwan
city as a "cultural desert."</P>
      <P>The government always values and devotes itself to the
development of the culture industry, Chang said, adding that
especially in the knowledge economy-oriented era, a sound cultural
publishing business is needed to pave the way for the development of
Taiwan's knowledge economy with the ultimate goal of promoting the
island's overall competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Kaohsiung is one of Taiwan's major industrial
cities, adding that many people however neglect the fact that the
city is also one of the places where Taiwan's cultural development
began.</P>
      <P>He said it has been Kaohsiung residents' common voice that has
developed Kaohsiung into a major cultural city. After striving for
many years to have the Chinese traditional Lantern Festival
riddle-guessing party held in Kaohsiung, the government finally met
the request of the city's residents by holding the festival in the
southern Taiwan city Feb. 7, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that he believes the government's sponsorship of
the Lantern Festival activity and the international book exhibition
in Kaohsiung, in the wake of the recently-closed Taipei International
Book Exhibition, will promote the transformation of the city into
both an international industrial and cultural city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The simmering standoff between the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led administration and the
opposition-controlled legislature may see a breakthrough soon as
both sides said Saturday they are willing to negotiate again.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said while attending an
international book fair in the southern port city of Kaohsiung that
the Cabinet will not miss any opportunity for reaching agreement
with the Legislative Yuan on the fate of the island's fourth nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>Chang said he already informed Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng and Wang's predecessor Liu Sung-pan, now a People
First Party (PFP) legislator, Friday of his Cabinet's willingness to
continue negotiating with the legislature over the nuclear power
plant issue.</P>
      <P>"I appreciate their devoted efforts to help resolve the thorny
issue," Chang said, adding he has assured them that the Cabinet has
never wavered in its determination to cooperate with the
legislature in seeking a breakthrough to the deadlock.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that he has ordered the Cabinet to
draft a new version of solution to the issue based on the consensus
reached between President Chen Shui-bian and Wang on Feb. 2.</P>
      <P>As for when the Cabinet and the legislature can come to terms on
the issue, Chang said he couldn't make any forecast at the moment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang, also a Kuomintang (KMT) vice chairman, said he
will exchange views with the top leaders of various opposition party
caucuses in the legislature Monday on feasible ways to resolve the
issue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang denied press reports that he has reached a
tentative consensus with Premier Chang on a compromise version for
resuming construction of the controversial nuclear power plant.
"That's not true. We only exchanged views on some procedure issues
in Friday's phone talks and didn't touch on any substantive topics,"
Wang stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang further said he is also not sure at the moment when the
Cabinet and the legislature can strike a compromise on the issue.</P>
      <P>Led by an opposition alliance of the KMT, PFP and New Party, the
legislature passed a resolution early this month that the Cabinet
must instantly and unconditionally resume construction on the nuclear
power plant. Although the Cabinet agreed to resume construction, it
wanted to add some strings to signify its ultimate goal of making
Taiwan a nuclear-free island.</P>
      <P>All of the parliamentary whips of the three opposition parties
said Saturday they are willing to keep their doors open for further
consultations with the Cabinet so long as it comes to understand the
legislature's goodwill and promises to resume construction on the
plant.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Cheng Yung-chin said he thinks that the
Cabinet should first announce the resumption of the construction work
without adding any conditions. "It can later issue a separate
statement explaining its stance or views in detail," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP deputy whip Weng Chin-chu said although many
DPP legislators still strongly oppose the resumption of the
project, the party caucus is willing to respect the Cabinet's
discretion power in handling the issue in consideration of the
domestic political reality. The DPP only controls one-third of the
seats in the current legislature.</P>

      <P>Taiwan businessmen's actual investment in

from the preceding year, according to a Fujian official.</P>
      <P>Li Guangmin, deputy director of Fujian's Taiwan Affairs Office,
disclosed the figure in an interview published by the Macau Daily on

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's "integration"
concept is aimed at seeking a new framework for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to co-exist peacefully, a senior mainland affairs
official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland

ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>

integration at various levels and in various spheres before they
can talk about further association or unification.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China has been an independent
sovereign state, Chen said nobody is eligible to take any action to
hurt its existence.</P>
      <P>"The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should tolerate each
other's stances and work out feasible formulas for both sides
to continue development and for Taiwan to join international
organizations and activities," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As for the establishment a future "one China," Chen said it
needs extensive discussion and that various forms of association,
such as a commonwealth or a confederation, can be put on the agenda
for negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DAILIES PRESSURE CANADIAN P.M. TO RAISE HUMAN RIGHTS WITH BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several major Canadian newspapers stepped up
the pressure on Prime Minister Jean Chretien as he got ready to
depart on a trade mission to mainland China Friday, urging him to
raise the issue of human rights with Beijing during his visit.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail, in an editorial, said now is the ideal time
for governments such as Canada's to "prod China into improving its
behavior," citing World Trade Organization (WTO) entry and the
Olympic Games as two leverages that could be used to prod Beijing.</P>
      <P>"It is obviously true that Mr. Chretien is not `running China,'"
said the editorial, referring to the prime ministers reason for not
being in a position to lecture the Communist Chinese on how to run
their country.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is a sovereign country and Canada alone cannot
hope to change its policies, "but we have a right, indeed an
obligation, to try," the editorial continued.</P>
      <P>"No government has a right to abuse, deny, or revoke them behind
the shield of national sovereignty. China itself acknowledged that
when it offered recently to sign a major United Nations covenant on
rights," it added.</P>
      <P>Another nationally circulated newspaper, The National Post, went
further in one of its editorials by calling on Chretien to "publicly
criticize" China's persecution of Falun Gong, whose practitioners
"are no more dangerous than kittens."</P>
      <P>The editorial said Foreign Minister John Manley should also send
a note to his friends at the Chinese embassy saying that "practicing
Falun Gong is not a crime in Canada, and China has no right to
prosecute its phobic policies on our free soil."</P>
      <P>Canadian members of Parliament and reporters were startled during
a press conference in Parliament when an official from a Chinese
state-run news agency shouted down Zhang Kunlun, a Canadian Falun
Gong member, it said.</P>
      <P>The editorial called this "an abuse of both journalistic and
diplomatic ethics."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Dutch government's sudden decision to cancel a
similar business trip to mainland China to protest Beijing's brutal
crackdown against Falun Gong has added pressure on Chretien to speak
up during the Team Canada trip, the Ottawa Citizen editorialized.</P>
      <P>The daily pointed out that the Dutch government's action stood
"in sharp contrast" to Chretien's vague promise to raise human rights
issues when he meets with top mainland Chinese leaders next week in
Beijing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOVE IS ADDICTIVE, SEX WON'T KILL: CANADIAN RESEARCHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beware, love bugs. Love is an addiction,
just like alcohol, cocaine, or gambling, a Canadian researcher said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chemically speaking, that ecstatic, floating-on-the-clouds
feeling is exactly what addicts feel with a hit of alcohol or another
addictive drug, said George Bubenik, a zoologist at the University of
Guelph in southern Ontario.</P>
      <P>He said romantic love and drug addiction both make the body
release hormones that trigger the production of dopamine, a brain
chemical that floods the body with pleasure and is related to all
addictions.</P>
      <P>That might not seem romantic, but it sure helps explain the highs
and lows of relationships. The intensity of falling in love is like
the high from a drug. Especially during sex, when so much dopamine
can be produced that it can permanently rewire the brain, according
to the scientist.</P>
      <P>"If the sex is really good," said Bubenik, "you'll stay together
for life. People with a good sex life will stay together even if the
relationship is going sour."</P>
      <P>This is part of the reason some people stay in destructive or
abusive relationships, he said. They should leave, but can't --
because they're addicted to the feelings they have during sex with
their partner, he added.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he continued, if a relationship breaks up,
there are traumatic feelings of anxiety, cravings that can't be
satisfied, sadness, anger -- feelings matched by anyone who's tried
to quit smoking or drinking.</P>
      <P>Studies on animals show the hormone oxytocin, which is released
during sex and triggers the production of dopamine, plays a large
part in whether you mate for life.</P>
      <P>The prairie vole, a kind of rodent, usually bonds for life with
its mate when it copulates. "But if you block the release of
oxytocin, they don't bond," Bubenik said.</P>
      <P>Unlike alcohol, heroin, and tobacco, "no one has ever proved that
having too much sex will kill you," he said. That may be a comfort
for many, including the makers of Viagra.</P>

      <P>A fierce gunfight happened in Taichung
early Sunday between police and three suspects wanted in criminal
case, with six police officers and two of the suspects being wounded.</P>
      <P>The gunfight took place when the police raided a hideout of the
three suspects in a townhouse in Taichung after being tipped off
early Sunday about their whereabouts.</P>
      <P>The three suspects, Chen Chih-chiang, Lan Yen-chang, and Huang
Chuan-lin, have been charged in separate criminal cases. They were
cornered in a basement garage by more than a hundred police officers
who burst into their hideout through a rooftop door and put up a
fierce resistance by shooting at the police in a desperate attempt to
get away.</P>
      <P>More than 100 shots were fired during the gun battle. One of the
suspects Huang Chan-lin was shot in the back many times and is now
listed in serious condition after being rushed to a nearby hospital.</P>
      <P>Police seized six guns after the shootout, including an AK-47

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 68 PERCENT UPSET WITH GOV'T HANDLING OF OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 68 percent of the Taiwan public is
not satisfied with the government's handling of the oil spill near
southern Kenting National Park, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the survey conducted by the Policy-Coordination
Committee of the leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT), 68.4 percent of
the respondents said they are unsatisfied with the government's slow
response to the incident and its inefficient handling of the
disaster.</P>
      <P>Around 92.2 percent of the respondents said they are aware of the
oil leak caused by the Greek tanker M. V. Amorgos, which ran aground
off the waters of Kenting Park in mid-January, while 94.75 percent
said they believe that the pollution will seriously damage the
ecosystems in nearby areas and 89.87 percent said it will strongly
hurt Kenting's tourism.</P>
      <P>At the same time, some 37.8 percent of those surveyed said they
think the central government should assume a greater responsibility
for the incident, while 36.02 percent are of the opinion that local
authorities should be held responsible for the catastrophe.</P>
      <P>As to Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's belated criticism of
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) head Lin Chun-yi's slow
response to the incident, around 64.54 percent of those surveyed said
they are not satisfied with Chang's handling of the matter, while 59
percent said they are unhappy with Lin's performance in the post.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question about some lawmakers' demand that Lin step
down to take responsibility for the slow response to the disaster, 44
percent of the respondents said they would support such a move by
Lin, ahead of some 37 percent who voiced disagreement over the
legislators' demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KUOMINTANG TO PUT ITS ASSETS IN TRUST IN PHASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang will create trust
funds for its assets in three phases, with the first trust funds of
about NT$2 billion to be formed by the end of February, said a party
official Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang Che-Shen, director general of the Kuomintang Administrative
Committee, said his party has finished the inventory-taking of its
assets and is ready to place its cash, totaling about NT$2 billion
(US$6.25 million), in trust first to a local trust company, probably
the Chinatrust Commercial Bank or Central Trust of China.</P>
      <P>In a response to challenges by some Control Yuan members that
part of its assets were donated by the government under suspicious
circumstances, Chang said the party's lawyers and public accountants
will verify the legal process through which the party acquired its
assets before disclosing the list of the party assets.</P>
      <P>Chang said the party's assets, consisting of real estate,
buildings, stocks, bonds, U.S. dollars, and New Taiwan dollars, total
about NT$79 billion (US$2.46 billion).</P>
      <P>But this value, calculated according to the price of the assets
at the time they were acquired, might be different from the market
value today, especially the 1,619 pieces of real estate, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang will form a trust for these properties, with a
market value of about NT$8.7 billion (US$271.87 million), in the
second phase when the government enacts the trust law.</P>
      <P>The last phase will consist of putting the remaining
Kuomintang-owned firms in trust after the Legislature passes a
political party law.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan vowed during last March's
presidential campaign to put the party's assets in trust. The party's
political foes have accused the Kuomintang of using its assets for
political purposes.</P>
      <P>Although he failed in his presidential bid, Lien took over as the
head of the party after the March 18 election, and he is trying to
deliver on his campaign promise.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington Times has reported that
the U.S. Pentagon has been gradually making moves to increase its
military force in locations near mainland China in order to be better
prepared in case military conflict were to break out in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The "Pentagon Insider" column in the Washington Times quoted a
U.S. Pacific Submarine Fleet spokesman as reporting that the U.S.
Navy will deploy three submarines to Guam next year so as to be able
to better cope with any crisis that may break out.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times reported on other days that Representative
Robert Underwood (D-Guam) has revealed that the Pentagon has decided
to appropriate a sum to improve the Guam Port facilities so as to
berth the submarines.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times reported last August that the U.S. Air Force
has planned to deploy cruise missiles in Guam, leading Beijing to
lodge a protest with U.S. authorities.</P>
      <P>The report also quoted an intelligence source as saying that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has already compiled a list of
U.S. companies which have maintained business relations with the
Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>At least some 300 U.S. companies have not only had close ties
with Beijing military authorities, but have also been used by the
mainland Chinese authorities to cover its spying activities and
information collection activities, the report said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Congress passed a resolution in 1999 asking the Clinton
administration to investigate how many U.S. companies have business
relations with Beijing. The administration turned down the request on
the grounds that Beijing had ordered its military to pull out from

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO ADJUST ITS MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic experts attending a Sunday seminar
urged the government to adjust its "be patient, go slow" mainland
investment policy.</P>
      <P>Most of the experts taking part in the symposium sponsored by a
Kuomintang-run think tank expressed that they are of the opinion that
the government's current mainland investment policy should be
adjusted so as to maintain Taiwan's competitiveness and economic
clout.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, former chairman of the Council of Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD), said he is in favor of making changes to the
current government policy regulating Taiwan's investment in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan's mainland investment policy is just
part of the nation's overall economic and mainland affairs policies,
Chiang contended that the "be patient, go slow" policy, adopted by
former President Lee Teng-hui, should be changed in consideration of
market mechanisms and changing times.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's top priority at present is to maintain
its economic development and increase its economic strength, the
former CEPD head suggested that the government take concrete measures
to improve the country's investment climate and upgrade its
industrial level.</P>
      <P>Bettering Taiwan's investment climate will rely on a stable
government policy, a harmonious relationship with mainland China, and
a sufficient water and power supply, he added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chiang's remarks, Su Chi, former chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council, also called on the government to adjust its
conservative mainland investment policy because of the different
situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. The "go west"
proposal and Taipei's "remain rooted in Taiwan" policy for its
industries are two concepts which are not contradictory to each
other.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee adopted the "be patient, go slow" policy in
1997 in response to mainland China's economic austerity and its
saber-rattling against Taiwan at that time, he explained.</P>
      <P>C. T. Huang, a panel chief of the KMT's think tank, emphasized
that Taiwan-mainland China trade and commercial ties should not be
simplified to just a pure economic relationship.</P>
      <P>Calling on the Chen Shui-bian administration to view Taiwan's
mainland investment fever as a labor-division approach based on a
global management strategy, Huang said that the government should
forswear its passive and detrimental mindset in order to transform
the phenomenon into energy helping Taiwan further advance.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lai Shih-pao of the pro-unification New Party, also said
he believes that the "go west" and "remain rooted in Taiwan" are not
contradictory, saying Taiwan industries should be encouraged to move
to the mainland while keeping their roots at home and suggesting the
two sides ink a taxation accord to help local businesses keep their
capital in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Hsu Tien-tsai voiced disagreement over the
above-mentioned viewpoints, stressing that Taiwan must maintain its
political advantage over mainland China despite the country's desire
to upgrade its economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the government to adopt new thinking so as to create
Taiwan's political advantage in the face of competition from mainland
China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang expressed its welcome Sunday
for a meeting between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong after the latter said he would like to meet with
Lien.</P>
      <P>Soong said after his return from a vacation trip to the United
States Sunday morning that he would call on Lien after arrangements
are made for such a meeting.</P>
      <P>Cheng Yung-chin, KMT party whip in the Legislative Yuan, said
that the KMT would like to see such a meeting, adding that the
cooperation of the two opposition parties will be for the political
and social stability to the nation.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that since the inauguration of the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) Chen Shui-bian last May as ROC president,
sweeping the KMT out of power after more than five decades of rule,
the new administration has failed to bring about progress,
prosperity, and stability in the nation.</P>
      <P>The DPP has instead insisted on its own platform, citing the
scrapping of the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant as an
example, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that cooperation between the KMT and the PFP is for the
purpose of national stability, pointing out that the PFP, a splinter
party of the KMT formed immediately after the presidential election,
has many of its members coming from the KMT. He added that the old
"feud" during the presidential election should be forgotten and both
sides should look forward.</P>
      <P>Lien, last year's presidential candidate of the KMT, which is
then the largest party in Taiwan, finished a distant third in the
election, while Soong, a former KMT heavyweight who ran as an
independent, finished second.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said that Lien had displayed his generosity and wisdom
when the KMT decided not to pursue embezzlement charges against Soong
after a prosecutor dismissed the case for lack of sufficient
evidence. It is believed the case dealt a severe blow to the
presidential campaign of Soong, who had held a convincing lead over
all other presidential candidates before the charges were brought to
light.</P>
      <P>The case arose from a huge amount of cash stashed in a special
bank account controlled by Soong, who claimed the funds were put in
his charge by then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui to finance secret
political operations.</P>
      <P>Cheng noted that though some members within the KMT may not see
eye to eye with Lien, he said he hopes their views will come closer
together in consideration of the nation's interests.</P>
      <P>Other KMT officials also stressed that it is natural for the two
chairmen to meet, saying that the KMT's recent decision not to pursue
embezzlement charges against Soong has created an amiable atmosphere
between the two parties and has added momentum to increased
cooperation between the two parties in the lead up to year-end
elections.</P>
      <P>They however also said that the two parties are unlikely to
cooperate in the legislative elections but that there should be some
room for cooperation in county and city chief elections.</P>
      <P>They added that both sides have yet to talk in detail about
cooperation in the year-end elections but that there have been good
contacts and exchanges made between them, which should be a great
stride forward for both parties.</P>

(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In addition to reconfirming its
opposition to any attempt by Beijing to solve its dispute with Taiwan
by military force, Washington should make it clear that it won't
support Taiwan's bid for independence, according to a report by a
U.S. think tank to be released Monday, Feb. 12.</P>
      <P>The report by the Asia Foundation, a non-profit institute aimed
at promoting democracy and prosperity in Asia, urges the U.S.
administration to let it be known that it will not come to Taiwan's
aid if military conflict breaks out due to a bid by the island for
independence.</P>
      <P>However, the report recommends that Washington keep Beijing
guessing on how it will respond to any attack by Beijing against
Taiwan by simply telling Beijing that Washington might step into such
a conflict.</P>
      <P>The report on America's role in Asia is the result of a one-year
study by 37 U.S. scholars, politicians, and former officials,
including former Defense Secretary William Perry; well-known Chinese

Roy and Jim Sasser; and former U.S. Deputy Assistant Defense
Secretary Kurt Campbell.</P>
      <P>They recommend that the new U.S. administration stick to the
time-tested "one China" principle, which, they said, has served the
interests of both Washington and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
over the last three decades.</P>
      <P>The "one China" principle, defined in the three communiques
between Washington and Beijing, refers to the notion that there is
only one China of which both mainland and Taiwan are a part,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>While Washington maintains diplomatic ties with Beijing and only
informal ties with Taiwan, it is opposed to the determination of
Taiwan's status through the use of military force. The report said
that any future relationship between the two sides should be one
acceptable to the people on each side.</P>
      <P>As to the thorny issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, the report
suggested that Washington adhere to its stance provided in the
communique of Aug. 17, 1982 that it will limit arms sales to Taiwan
only if Beijing pursues a peaceful solution to its differences with
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Washington should realize that increased economic interaction
between Taiwan and mainland China will not necessarily improve their
ties, rather, it may make Taiwan more vulnerable to economic
intimidation by Beijing while providing a frame for more permanent
and eventually more formal bilateral ties, said the report.</P>
      <P>Although, the report lauded Washington' efforts to defuse
potential risks between Taipei and Beijing after Taiwan's
presidential election March 18, 2000, it said the United States
should keep a low profile in its attempt to promote peace across the
Taiwan Straits given the reluctance by both Taipei and Beijing to see
Washington as a mediator or negotiator in their dispute.</P>
      <P>The report also listed the disorientation of Washington's
alliance with Tokyo, the persistent uncertainty across the Taiwan
Strait, and the "nuclearization" of India and Pakistan among the
threats to U.S. interests in Asia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE SETS `ZERO ACCIDENT' RECORD IN 2000</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amid the country's all-out efforts to build
a "second generation" air force, the Republic of China Air Force has
created a new "Taiwan miracle" by setting a "zero accident" record
last year.</P>
      <P>The ROC Air Force's "zero accident record," the first-ever in its
41 years of written history, also helped remove the shadow hanging
over the air force's commander-in-chief, Gen. Chen Chao-min, who had
come under strong pressure because of the air force's poor flight
safety record since he assumed the post in 1999.</P>
      <P>Attributing the ROC Air Force's record-breaking performance to
the introduction of a "risk control" concept three years ago, Chen
said that the "zero accident" performance is only the beginning and
that the air force will keep working to improve safety.</P>
      <P>Citing the Singapore Air Force's record of seven years without an
accident as an example, the ROC Air Force's highest-ranking officer
claimed that he is confident that the air force will achieve an even
better flight safety record, noting that the Singapore Air Force was
built with its help.</P>
      <P>According to the deputy commander-in-chief, Gen. Liu Kuei-li, the
ROC Air Force began introducing the "risk control" concept, already
widely adopted in the United States and Singapore, in Oct. 1999. In
an effort to increase safety consciousness in the air force, it had
invited several senior experts from Singapore to help carry out the
mission, he noted.</P>
      <P>Although some initial improvements have been made, Liu told the
Central News Agency that air force authorities will further promote
the concept at all bases around the island in March by joining forces
with the private sector.</P>
      <P>Beginning in February of this year, "risk control" experts with
China Airlines and EVA Airways Corporation, Taiwan's two largest
civil passenger airlines, have started such tours at all ROC Air
Forces bases, while relevant air force authorities are planning to
set up a risk-control "certification system" in three years with the
assistance of the two airlines, Liu said, stressing that the system
will be the first of its kind in Taiwan's aviation sector.</P>
      <P>The "risk-control" system will require that all air force pilots
pass all requirements next year in compliance with the system's
standard practices, he added, concluding that the ultimate goal of
implementing the system is to secure the safety of the ROC Air
Force's 600 planes and protect the lives of its hundred thousand-plus
members by preventing any further mishaps from occurring.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA HEAD TO REMAIN STATIONED IN KENTING TILL CLEAN-UP COMPLETED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administrator Lin
Chun-yi said Sunday that he will remain in Kenting National Park in
Pintung County, located in southwestern Taiwan, until the oil spill
clean-up operation has been completed.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks while presiding over another round of
meetings Sunday of a supra-government agency task force set up to
deal with Taiwan's worst ecological disaster in recent years.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he would remain stationed in Kenting park to
coordinate an efficient clean-up operation so as to meet the goal of
completing the work in 30 days.</P>
      <P>He also said that the question of how to dispose of the
Greek-registered freighter Amorgos, which broke in two after running
aground in waters off the coast of Kenting on Jan.14, is still under
assessment. There are two methods being considered, namely towing
away the freighter or dismantling it, he said, adding that the
assessment should be completed within a week.</P>
      <P>The freighter, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for
Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical
problems and began to drift. All 25 crewmembers were rescued, but the
ship later broke into two parts, and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel
oil gushed out of the vessel.</P>
      <P>The oil spill has polluted large areas of coral reef in the
region and has affected marine life along the coast of the national
park, especially within the Lungkeng nature reserve.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is at the eye of the storm for failing to attend to the
major ecological disaster right away, said weather conditions off
Lungkeng were not ideal Sunday, increasing the difficulties in
cleaning up the oil spill.</P>
      <P>But fortunately, the 200 tons of lubricants within the freighter
did not leak out, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Divers in Kenting reported Sunday that no more fuel oil is
leaking out, but the 60,000 tons of iron ore in the freighter have
already oxidized.</P>
      <P>The government has sent military personnel to the Lungkeng nature
reserve to help in the clean-up, but their efforts were hampered
Sunday by rough weather conditions as high waves tinged with oil
continued to pound the coral reef along the coast.</P>
      <P>The eighth field army sent 600 military personnel to establish 11
oil slick collection areas to retrieve the residual oil. The
commander had asked the military personnel to take their own safety
in account and limit their operations to the coral reef closer to the
coast.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. officials said that workers at the third nuclear
power plant have been closely monitoring the sea current since the
incident and have set up multiple filtering devices and lassoes to
keep the oil slick out.</P>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. and Kaohsiung Harbor Authority, which
have experience in dealing with oil spills in the past, also sent oil
spill-absorbing cotton and oil-trapping lassoes to help collect
residual oil.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture has also commissioned eight professors
to establish a team to assess fishery losses and the restoration of
the local fishery industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORT CALLS FOR U.S. TO MAINTAIN STATUS QUO IN TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A special U.S. task force has
recommended that Washington maintain its one-China policy while
cautioning both sides of the Taiwan Strait against unilateral
attempts to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>In its final report completed after a year-long examination of
U.S. policy toward Asia and due to be released Monday as a reference
for the new Bush administration and Congress, the bi-partisan group
of 37 high-ranking American policymakers and scholars urged the U.S.
government to "make clear to Taipei that it will not support an
independent Taiwan achieved without Beijing's acceptance".</P>
      <P>Washington should also tell Taipei that it will not necessarily
come to Taiwan's defense "if Taipei declares independence
unilaterally or otherwise engages in actions aimed at provoking
Beijing".</P>
      <P>The major report, believed to be the first of its kind since the
inauguration of U.S. President George W. Bush three weeks ago, said
it is equally important that the Untied States make clear to Beijing
its opposition to the use of force to resolve the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Without detailing the circumstances under which Washington would
or would not intervene, the report said, the United States should
indicate that "a military attack on Taiwan by the mainland may be met
with U.S. intervention".</P>
      <P>Claiming that the 30-year-old policy continues to serve the
United States as well as both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the report
suggested that Washington "be firm in its commitment to the one-China
principle as outlined in the three communiques" between Washington
and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The task force, commissioned a year ago by the Asia Foundation,
consisted of people who have played leading roles in U.S.-Asian
relations over the last 25 years. It was co-chaired by Harvard
University professor Ezra Vogel and Casimir Yost, director of the
Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University.</P>
      <P>Members of the group included former ambassadors Michael
Armacost, James Sasser, Stapleton Roy, and Charles Freeman, as well
as former administration officials such as William Perry, Joseph Nye,
Douglas Paal, Kenneth Lieberthal, and Kurt Campbell, along with
well-known China experts like Robert Scalapino, Nancy B. Tucker, and
Harry Harding.</P>
      <P>In the 70-page report called "America's Role in Asia," the group
listed continued uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait as one of the
trends that could threaten U.S. interest in Asia.</P>
      <P>The others include the drift in the U.S.-Japan relationship, the
"nuclearization" of India and Pakistan, and nationalism and the
establishment of new regional groupings which exclude the United
States and other Western nations.</P>
      <P>The group's policy recommendations include retaining a stable
forward deployment in Northeast and Southeast Asia, supporting South
Korean reconciliation with North Korea, and continuing U.S.
rapprochement with North Korea, as well as scheduling early and
regular dialogue with Japan and China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS CALL FOR NATURAL FUEL OIL DISSOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Feb.   12   (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars and researchers have
recommended that the fuel oil spill affecting the coral reefs in the
Lungkeng nature reserve area along Taiwan's southernmost coast should
be naturally dissolved by efflorescence or volatilization.</P>
      <P>Scholars and researchers said that the central government's
emergency crew should avoid using chemical defatting agents when
dissolving the oil in order to prevent further pollution to the
waters in the area.</P>
      <P>The central government's emergency crew proposed a 30-day cleanup
of the waters polluted by the oil spill along the coast of Kenting
National Park, sources said.
 Sung Ko-I, professor of National Sun Yat-sen University's
Graduate School of Marine Biology, investigated the Lungkeng nature
reserve area last week. He said that dissolving the oil on the coral
reefs with chemical defatting agents would produce extra toxic
substances in the waters.</P>
      <P>Natural dissolution by efflorescence or volatilization would be a
better choice, the professor suggested.</P>
      <P>Sung, however, was unable to give a specific answer as to how
many years it would take the oil on the coral reef to be totally
dissolved by natural forces. Some areas of the coral reef that have
been severely polluted by the fuel oil might require 20 to 30 years
to be "naturally cleansed", Sung said.</P>
      <P>He added that the algae attached to the polluted coral reefs have
died out but would eventually revive as long as the fuel oil stopped
leaking into the water.</P>
      <P>Fish and shrimp will also return to the coral reef area when the
oil is cleaned up, he said.</P>
      <P>Sung said he discovered in the video tape recorded by divers that
there is less coral reef in the waters near to where the Greek
freighter M.V. Amorgos sunk and so the effect of the oil spill has
been "relatively modest".</P>
      <P>About 112.5 tons of oil has been collected by local clean-up
crews while another 26 tons has been gathered by military personnel
sent to the region to help in the cleanup.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL INTERESTS TOP CONCERN IN NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government will
place the top priority on national interests in considering disposal
of nuclear power plants waste, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in response to a press inquiry about his
views on a report that the lower house of the Russian parliament, or
State Duma, is likely to pass a new environmental bill to pave the
way for legal entry of foreign radioactive waste for treatment and
permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC's state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) once
struck a deal with Russia on the treatment and disposal of its
nuclear power plants waste.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipower has been actively seeking domestic and
offshore nuclear waste dumps in recent years, Lin said if the
Russian State Duma truly passes an amendment to its current
environmental law to allow legal entry of radioactive waste for
treatment, the possibility of Russia substantiating its contract with
Taipower will increase.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which oversees
Taipower operations, will consider the Taipower-Russian deal from
the angle of "meeting our best national interests."</P>
      <P>Taipower signed an agreement with the Russian national science
academy through the mediation of a private Russian firm a few years
ago on the treatment and disposal of 5,000 barrels of low-radioactive
waste from its three existing nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said once the Russian State Duma completes
legislation of the new environmental bill and that its Russian
cooperative partner obtains a nuclear waste import permit from
Russian authorities, Taipower will first ship low-radioactive
waste now stored at its three nuclear power plants to Russia
for treatment and disposal.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the agreement with the Russian
academy on the disposal of 5,000 barrels of nuclear waste is just a
"pilot" project. "If the project proceeds smoothly, we'll negotiate
with the academy for treatment of additional waste," said a Taipower
senior executive.</P>
      <P>Taipower currently has 30,000-plus barrels of nuclear waste
stored at its three nuclear power plants and more than 90,000
barrels of similar waste stored on the Orchid Island off
southeastern Taiwan coast.</P>
      <P>In addition to Russia, Taipower also reached a nuclear waste
disposal agreement with North Korea several years ago for disposal
of up to 60,000 barrels of its nuclear waste. However, shipment has
so far not been made because of some complex reasons, including
strong opposition from neighboring South Korea and world
environmental groups.</P>
      <P>Taipower sources said the company will ship its nuclear waste
stored on the Orchid Island to North Korea for permanent disposal
when North Korea completes construction of relevant storage
facilities and some technical problems are resolved.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower is also seeking the approval of the local
government and residents of the offshore islet of Wuchiu of its
plan to build a facility there for storing its low-radioactive
nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Difficulties in disposing of nuclear waste have been a
major reason for local environmentalists to strongly oppose
construction of Taipower's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the Russian State
Duma is scheduled to conduct a second reading of the controversial
environmental amendment bill on Feb. 22. As Russian President
Vladimir Putin reportedly supports the amendment bill, the State Duma
is very likely to pass it in the near future.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted Russian energy officials as saying that once
the bill clears the legislature, Russia will import about 20,000
tons of nuclear waste from Taiwan, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan,
India and mainland China for treatment. And the business is expected
to earn US$21 billion for cash-strapped Russia over the next 10
years, according to the reports.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong government is welcome to set
up a representative office in the Republic of China on Taiwan to
facilitate bilateral exchanges, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chih-chung, director of the MAC's Department of Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs, said the ROC government appreciates the goodwill
shown by the Hong Kong government in granting a work permit to its
representative and allowing Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to visit the
territory in his official capacity.</P>
      <P>"All these recent moves indicate that Taiwan-Hong Kong relations
have moved from private to official levels," Tsai said, adding that
the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
recognizes Hong Kong's these goodwill gestures.</P>
      <P>Tsai said ROC Representative to Hong Kong Chang Liang-jen has
worked smoothly since he assumed office a week ago. "Chang is
expected to continue focusing his efforts on promoting trade,
economic, cultural and educational exchanges between the two sides,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that increased exchanges will benefit both sides, Tsai
said the MAC will be pleased to see the Hong Kong government open a
representative office in Taiwan and send its officials to the island
for official visits.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said the Taiwan-Hong Kong communication channels
are not confined to Paul Yip, one of the closest aides to Hong Kong
chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, as some people think. "We hope to
forge closer contacts with Hong Kong authorities for mutual
benefits," he added.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma started a four-day visit to Hong Kong Sunday. He
is scheduled to meet with Tung Tuesday for wide-ranging talks, making
him the most senior elected official from Taiwan to meet the top
Hong Kong leader since Britain handed Hong Kong back to Beijing in

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-HK EXCHANGES WILL HELP EASE CROSS-STRAIT TIES: MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday
he is convinced that increased Taipei-Hong Kong exchanges will
contribute to rapprochement between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said his current four-day visit to Hong Kong is mainly aimed
at promoting city-to-city exchanges and that he is not authorized to
talk about any cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Ma said he believes that better Taiwan-Hong Kong
ties will be conducive to reducing tension between Taiwan and
mainland China. The Harvard-trained legal expert once served as vice
chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ma said he has felt the Hong Kong government's enormous
sincerity to improve relations with Taiwan since his arrival here to
a red-carpet welcome Sunday.</P>
      <P>On the speculation that the Hong Kong government might have
given him a warm welcome at Beijing's instruction, Ma said he has no
evidence to judge whether the speculation is true. "But if it is
true, it indicates that mainland China hopes to see cross-strait ties
move toward an eased, steady direction," he explained.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to meet with Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa Tuesday. "I'll invite Tung to visit Taipei when we meet
tomorrow," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma attended a twin city forum, co-sponsored by the Hong Kong
Policy Research Institute and the Taipei-based Taiwan Research
Institute.</P>
      <P>Ma said Hong Kong has continued making headway in city
development after Britain handed the territory back to Beijing in
1997.</P>
      <P>"I'm delighted to see success in Hong Kong of the 'one country,
two systems' formula, which Beijing used to take over Hong Kong," Ma
said. Nevertheless, Ma said on another occasion that he doesn't think
that the scheme is suitable for Taiwan, adding that the best option
for Taiwan at the moment is maintaining the status quo.</P>
      <P>Ma visited Hong Kong in March 1999 shortly after his election as
the mayor of Taipei. During that visit, he failed to meet Tung.</P>
      <P>All major Hong Kong newspapers have given prominent coverage to
Ma's visit in the past few days. Ma is the brightest political star
in the opposition Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until
last May and has supported eventual unification of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait under freedom and democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP IN NO HURRY TO TALK ABOUT COOPERATION WITH KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) is in no hurry
to hold talks with the Kuomintang (KMT) on cooperation in the
year-end elections, PFP ranking officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks after KMT Spokesman Jason Hu said that both
opposition parties could begin discussions on such cooperation by the
end of the month.</P>
      <P>PFP officials said that it would be rushing too much to hold
discussions by the end of February, adding that there is no need to
move so fast.</P>
      <P>PFP heavyweight Liu Sung-fan aid that it would be difficult to
talk about cooperation in the legislative elections but that there
might be "some room" for discussions concerning the county and city
chief elections, adding that "March or April may be appropriate" for
such discussions.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that both sides continue to have contacts and that
they realize there are differences on issues, such as the nominees
and their quota, that need to be worked out.</P>
      <P>PFP officials also said that a prerequisite to a meeting between
the chiefs of the KMT and PFP is that "there is an agenda that both
sides can sit down to talk about."</P>
      <P>They said that if there is such an agenda, then both sides could
meet to discuss how to solve problems or to study how to deal with
the new situation.</P>
      <P>Chung Jung-chi, PFP secretary-general, also said that the issues,
whether they be the controversial fourth nuclear power plant or
others, are not so urgent as to warrant an early meeting between
Soong and KMT Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Chung suggested that it may be a good idea that the two meet on a
more natural occasion, such as Soong visiting Lien next month to
congratulate him for winning the party chairmanship. Lien is expected
to win uncontested in the first direct election scheduled for March
24 of the KMT chief in the party's 106-year history.</P>
      <P>The media has reported widely about the possibility of
cooperation between the two parties in the wake of the KMT's goodwill
gesture last week when it announced that it would no longer pursue
embezzlement charges against PFP Chairman James Soong after a
prosecutor dismissed the case because of insufficient evidence.</P>
      <P>The KMT said that although it thinks the prosecutor's
investigation was flawed, the party has decided not to pursue the
case any further for the sake of reconciliation with Soong.</P>
      <P>The case arose after the discovery of a huge amount of cash in a
secret bank account controlled by Soong, former KMT
secretary-general, which he claimed was put in his charge by
then-KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui to finance secret political
operations.</P>
      <P>The case was believed to have dealt a serious blow to Soong's
presidential campaign. Up until the case came to light, Soong, who
ran as an independent in the campaign, had maintained a convincing
lead among all other presidential candidates.</P>
      <P>Soong, who finished second in the election, formed the PFP
immediately after the election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Lien, the KMT's presidential candidate, finished a
distant third in the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PREMIER TO FORM FOUNDATION TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT COMMON MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew said Monday he
will form a special fund within one month to promote the formation of
a "common market" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew, also a vice chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang,
which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until last May and now still
controls more than half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan, said
10-plus private local enterprises have agreed to join him in setting
up the fund.</P>
      <P>Siew said in an interview with a local radio station that the
local enterprises promising to donate money for the special fund
include Taiwan Semiconductors Manufacturing Corp., Taiwan Cellular
Corp., and UNI-President Enterprises Crop.</P>
      <P>"Our goal is to raise NT$100 million in the long run," Siew
said, adding that he will file an application with relevant
government agencies for the establishment of the fund when the time
is ripe.</P>
      <P>Siew went on to say that he will be willing to make a visit to
mainland China so long as such a visit will contribute to the
formation of a cross-strait common market as well as Taiwan's
economic development and cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Siew said his idea of promoting a cross-strait common market
stems out of his worry about Taiwan's deteriorating economic
situation.</P>
      <P>"We must rely on market economy principles, rather than
government policies, to cope with this adverse situation," Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan needs a hinterland or market to support its
bid to become a regional business hub and logistic center, Siew said
mainland China can serve as Taiwan's market.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out that as Taiwan and mainland China share common
interests and can complement each other in economic development,
they will both benefit if they form a common market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can serve as a bridge for the mainland market to
integrate with the global market," Siew stressed.</P>
      <P>He further said as both sides still face intractable political
problems, they cannot completely follow the pattern of the European
Union in forming a cross-strait common market.</P>
      <P>"We should instead push for the realization of this goal in
several stages," Siew said, adding that in the initial phase, the
two sides can sign an agreement on the formation of a cross-strait
common market in a specified period of time.</P>
      <P>Siew said he had discussed the "common market" proposal with a
number of American China hands during his recent visit to the United
States. "Many of them seconded my idea as they all agreed that
economic exchanges and integration can contribute to cross-strait
rapprochement," he added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Siew said, his "common market" proposal has
also attracted the attention of mainland authorities. "As far as
I know, some influential mainland think tanks are collecting
information and relevant data concerning the proposal," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC CHAIR CLARIFIES MYTHS OF NEW ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Feb.    12    (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The core strength of the
so-called knowledge economy or new economy lies in innovation,
entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to turn knowledge into
profit, a respected semiconductor industry baron said Monday.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corp. (TSMC), made the remarks in a speech delivered at a monthly
Presidential Office meeting in his capacity as a national policy
adviser to the President.</P>
      <P>Chang, also known as godfather of Taiwan's booming semiconductor
industry, said he found that eight mythical concepts about the
"knowledge economy" are prevailing in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chang said, those myths included that knowledge
economy contributes to recent American economic boom; the
current U.S. economic slowdown marks the bust of the bubble
of knowledge economy; the core of knowledge economy is knowledge;
the principles of knowledge economy can only apply to high-tech
industry and have nothing to do with other industries; knowledge
economy will bring increased income to all people of a country;
Taiwan is suitable for the development of knowledge economy as its
people are full of entrepreneurial spirit; knowledge economy can be
developed independently, without any relations to a country's
political, legal and social environments; and knowledge economy is
Taiwan's only choice to ensure its sustainable development.</P>
      <P>"All these concepts are mythic and imaginary," Chang stressed,
adding that Taiwan still has many things to do before it can move
toward knowledge economy.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that knowledge economy can bring fortunes to
only a few people, particularly those who have innovative expertise,
entrepreneurship and ability to turn knowledge into profits.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chang said, the Republic of China
government must do its utmost to expand the "circle of winners" under
the new economy and simultaneously develop a "social safety net" for
"non-winners" or those who fail to benefit from the new economy.</P>
      <P>Chang further said most American economists agreed that
knowledge economy was only the fourth contributing force to the
recent U.S. economic boom and that the three biggest reasons behind
the boom were the U.S. fiscal policy that helped turn its huge
government budget deficit to a large surplus, the Federal
Reserve's nimble monetary policy, and economic globalization.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that the current U.S. economic slowdown
is just a cyclical phenomenon and does not mark an end to knowledge
economy.</P>
      <P>"In fact, knowledge economy is still in its burgeoning stage and
it will also be the future economic model for advanced countries
around the world," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chang said natural resources, manpower, capital and
technology hold the key to a country's competitiveness. "Economy
globalization has made natural resources and capital less important
in deciding a country's competitiveness, but manpower and technology
remain very important," he noted.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said education alone cannot ensure adequate
supply of manpower for knowledge economy. "Educated people are not
enough to sustain the development of knowledge economy. We need
people with innovative ideas and entrepreneurial spirit in the era of
new economy," he added.</P>

      <P>The many Taiwan businessmen based in

is considering helping to set up a school for their children.</P>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung, who is scheduled to take

Shanghai, will discuss the issue with the Shanghai authorities,

schools at home to mainland-headquartered schools for Taiwan
businessmen's children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SCANNER MAKERS MOVING OUT OF TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan scanner producers are moving out of
Taiwan, as the ratio of locally made scanners has dropped from 42
percent in 1999 to 14 percent in 2000, according to government
statistics released Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), the local scanner industry has
posted the largest percentage of relocation among all Taiwan
information hardware sectors in the quest for cheaper production
costs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's information hardware output fell last year, to account
for less than 50 percent of the world's total, to rank as the world's
fourth-largest maker after the United States, Japan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said however that Taiwan's information industry could
play a greater role on the world stage if it concentrates on the
manufacture of high value-added products. It pointed to notebook
computers as an example, saying that 94 percent of the local
brands' goods are still manufactured in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT STEPS UP CLEAN-UP OF OIL SLICK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The oil slick in a nature preserve in
Kenting National Park, in the southwestern Taiwan county of Pingtung,
is expected to be cleaned up within two weeks, weather permitting,
government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that after the military deployed 600
personnel Sunday to help clean up the slick in Lungkeng nature
preserve, the pace of clean-up operations have accelerated,
collecting nearly 30 tons of fuel oil in a single day.</P>
      <P>The officials said that oil collected through various methods,
including buckets and ladles, has reached 140 tons and estimated that
there are still between 80 and 100 tons of oil spilled along the
coast.</P>
      <P>Presently, the government is paying NT$1,500 (US$46.30) per day
to each of 180 fishermen helping to clean up the oil, while the
Environmental Protection Administration has coordinated with them in
order to allow the military to take over the clean-up operations
later in the week at the latest.</P>
      <P>Media reports had said that if southwesterly winds are blowing,
then South Bay and Small Bay in Kenting, where most Kenting visitors
like to frequent, would be polluted, but environmental protection
officials said the Coast Guard Administration had confirmed that
there is no more oil floating on the sea and that the southwesterly
winds do not begin until April. According to the present pace of the
clean-up, the operation will be completed within one month and will
not affect local tourism.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administrator Lin Chun-yi, who failed to
station himself in Kenting on a long-term basis until Sunday --
almost one full month after the spill -- decided that after the spill
is collected in the initial stage, they would use oil absorbing
cotton to suck up the remaining oil.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications was
trying to remove the source of the spill -- the Greek freighter
Amorgos, which was grounded Jan. 14 while transporting 60,000 tons of
iron ore to mainland China from Singapore and later broke into two.</P>
      <P>Transportation officials said however that experts have estimated
that the sea is still rough, and that April would be a more ideal
time to remove the vessel.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in line with marine pollution prevention
regulations, the EPA can demand that the owner of the Greek freighter
deal with the situation, but noted that the owner has given up
ownership of the ship and that while the insurance company is taking
over all rights and obligations, it is still not sure of the best way
to remove the ship.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan visited the Lungkeng
nature preserve Monday to see the military personnel involved in the
clean-up operations and present them with NT$100,000 and 100 cases of
mineral water for their efforts in helping to relieve the island's
worst ecological disaster in recent years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition New Party (NP) legislator
said Monday that the Hualien Harbor Bureau director and the head of
Environmental Protection Administration should be fired for gross
dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Legislator Elmer Fung said in a press conference that after the
Greek freighter Amorgos ran aground off the coast of Kenting in
southern Taiwan Jan. 14 and broke in two, the most crucial time for
dealing with the resultant oil spill -- between Jan. 15 and Feb. 1 --
was lost because neither of the two officials would accept
responsibility for handling the disaster, each saying the other
should do the work.</P>
      <P>According to Fung, they did not even begin to discuss dividing
the work until after the freighter started to leak fuel oil Jan. 18,
by which time it was too late.</P>
      <P>Fung said that the Coast Guard Administration alerted Hualien
Harbor Bureau Jan. 20 to stop the 25 crewmen of the ship from leaving
the country, but the Hualien Harbor Authority failed to notify the
Immigration Bureau until Jan. 29, by which time all but three had
already left the country.</P>
      <P>Fung asked for the replacement of Hualien Harbor Bureau
director for his dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Fung also said that the Greek vessel asked for the EPA to send
helicopters urgently to prevent the oil slick before Jan. 20, but the
EPA did nothing until Jan. 29, which he said is gross negligence of
duty.</P>
      <P>EPA head Lin Chun-yi, at the eye of the storm for failing to
respond quickly to the ecological disaster, has been stationed in
Kenting since Sunday to more efficiently coordinate efforts to clean
up the oil slick.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a five-member investigation team of the Control Yuan,
the highest watchdog body in Taiwan, is scheduled to examine the
pollution situation along the coast of Lungkeng, in Kenting National
Park and interview responsible government officials to learn if
negligence is involved in the handling of the disaster.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN OFFERS COMPROMISE ON FOURTH NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has come up with a new
compromise in its dispute with the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan over the construction of a controversial power plant, Government
Information Office Director-General Su Cheng-ping said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su told a press conference that in the new compromise, the
Executive Yuan offered to resolve the dispute through negotiations
between the two yuans, rather than through mediation by the
president, and the follow-up budget for the nuclear plant should be
made "according to existing rules," rather than when the next
parliament is sworn in.</P>
      <P>As to a proposed energy bill, Su said, the Executive Yuan will
propose a completed draft to the Legislative Yuan for debate rather
than consulting the Legislative Yuan before drafting and presenting
the bill.</P>
      <P>Su said the Executive Yuan will sound out the opposition parties
on the compromise and if they are willing to accept it, the Executive
Yuan will formally present the proposal to the Legislative Yuan and
announce the restarting of construction of the island's fourth
nuclear plant after a deal has been struck.</P>
      <P>The proposed compromise was worked out after a three-hour meeting
between Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and leaders of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Although DPP Legislator Chou Po-lung, who was present at Monday's
meeting, said the compromise would still have to be approved the
following night by the government's nine-member policy-making group
-- which is chaired by President Chen Shui-bian -- a senior
presidential aide that Chen will respect the Executive Yuan's
decision.</P>
      <P>The compromise is a revised version of a proposal presented by
the Executive Yuan to the Legislative Yuan on Feb. 6 but rejected by
the legislative opposition majority.</P>
      <P>The opposition refused to accept it on the grounds that Chen, who
supports the premier's decision to scrap the nuclear plant, is not
"an appropriate mediator" in the dispute and the Executive Yuan
should not strip the legislature of the authority to approve budget
by insisting on having the next legislature examine the supplemental
budget for the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The opposition also balked at the government's plan to have the
legislature pledge to support the draft energy law in return for the
Executive Yuan's turnaround on its decision to scrap the nuclear
plant.</P>
      <P>Although Su said Chang had informed Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng of the new proposal, a leader of the main opposition
Kuomintang in the Legislative Yuan Cheng Yung-chin said he would
reserve his comments until he saw the formal proposal.</P>
      <P>The dispute stems from the Executive Yuan's decision Oct. 27 to
abolish the partially built fourth nuclear plant, a move that angered
the opposition in the legislature, which demanded that the plant be
completed. The dispute persisted despite an order by the Council of
Grand Justices Jan. 15 to the effect that the two branches of
government should work out their differences through negotiations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is a model example when it comes to
intellectual property protection, said an economic official amid
reports that the United States might put the island on its "special
watch list" in an annual trade report.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was put on the U.S. Trade Representative Office's "watch
list" last year in its annual report.</P>
      <P>The "special watch list" is one notch above the "watch list"
among the five categories, set out by U.S. trade acts passed in 1989,
in which a country may be placed by the U.S. Trade Representative
Office and therefore may suffer U.S. trade sanctions if they do not
mend their ways.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Yi-fu touted Taiwan as the
first country in the world to use the Export Monitoring System and
the Source Identification Data Code, as demanded by the United
States, to stamp out pirated computer software and video disks.</P>
      <P>Citing data compiled by U.S. authorities, Lin said only US$6
million worth of intellectual products exported from Taiwan to the
United States were found to have infringed upon U.S. intellectual
property rights in 2000, representing an 86 percent decrease from the
level for the previous year and accounting for only 14 percent of the
total value of fabricated products seized by U.S. authorities for the
year.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, with US$15 million worth of fabricated
intellectual products seized, replaced Taiwan as the leading exporter
of fake products to United States that were seized by U.S.
authorities, said Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin said he is certain that U.S. authorities will take into
account Taiwan's efforts and accomplishments in the realm of
intellectual property rights protection when they prepare their
annual trade report.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 13 (CBA) Anti-virus software programmer Trend Micro
announced a red-alert Wednesday against a devastating new computer
virus called "VBS_Kalamar."</P>
      <P>Micro said the virus is now spreading rapidly around the world
via e-mail messages. Cases of the virus infecting computers in Japan
and the United States have already been reported, he added.</P>
      <P>The virus, also known as "Anna Kournikova," is meant to challenge
the famous "I Love You" virus that caused a major computer and
software disaster last May, Micro noted.</P>
      <P>The new virus, programmed by VB Script, is spread via an e-mail,
titled "Here you have" when it arrives at a computer user's inbox,
with attachments. The computer is attacked when the user downloads
the attachment file, while the virus is passed on to other computer
users by automatically being sent to e-mail addresses in the user's
address folder, Micro said.</P>
      <P>Computers infected by the virus Jan. 26 were also connected by
the virus to the website www.dynabyte.nl., he added.</P>
      <P>Micro called on any individuals or companies receiving an e-mail
titled "Here you have" to immediately delete the message.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAA TEAM STARTS FLIGHT SAFETY CHECKS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seven-member delegation from the U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) started a three-day flight
safety inspection tour of Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The FAA team will focus its investigation on Taiwan's aviation
safety-related legal system and enforcement of security rules by the
two Taiwan carriers that operate U.S.-bound flight services -- China
Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways, airline sources said.</P>
      <P>The group first paid a visit to the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications where the members were briefed on the Republic of
China's recent progress in aviation safety management and
supervisory operations.</P>
      <P>CAA Deputy Director-General Chang Kuo-cheng said the ROC has
continued upgrading its flight safety standards in recent years and
has updated its aviation law to meet world requirements.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chang said, the CAA was troubled by a shortage of
qualified flight safety inspection officers. "The issue has finally
been resolved as the Cabinet approved the CAA's request for
recruiting 16 additional inspectors last year," he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that improving flight safety has been the CAA's priority
task, Chang said it is not just to meet the FAA requirement but also
for fulfilling the CAA's obligation as the country's highest civil
aviation administrative agency.</P>
      <P>Although several serious flight mishaps have happened in Taiwan
in the past few years, Chang said he is convinced that Taiwan will be
able to pass the FAA investigation this time since it has taken many
measures to improve local carriers' safety records.</P>
      <P>The FAA began to conduct regular flight safety checks in 1992 on
countries and air companies that operate U.S.-bound flight services.
Those who fail to pass the investigations will be either banned from
increasing the number of U.S.-destined flights or be ordered to
suspend all such services.</P>
      <P>When the FAA sent its inspectors to Taiwan for safety checks
four years ago for the first time, it gave Taiwan a "second grade"
in its initial check. The CAA made some immediate improvements and
promised to make further upgrading in a short period of time. And
the FAA gave Taiwan a safe "green light" after a double check.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LISHAN FOREST FIRE UNDER CONTROL, RARE FISH HABITAT NOT AFFECTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A forest fire that broke out in central
Taiwan Sunday morning has been brought under control and will not
affect the habitats of a rare landlocked fish of Taiwan, the Council
of Agriculture (COA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said that after 300 workers from
Shei-Pa National Park, Taichung County Government, and the Vocational
Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen urgently pitched in to
help fight the fire, it was brought under control.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the original fears about the fire spreading to the
habitats of the oncorchynchus masou formosanum, a mountainous "Taiwan
trout," have been eased.</P>
      <P>He stressed that whether the fire will affect the sensitive
living environment of the much treasured fish remains to be seen,
adding that the COA will adopt all possible preventive measures.</P>
      <P>But he said that assessments of the area show that the forest
fires and the habitats of the fish are on different sides of a ridge
so there should be no adverse effect on the habitats.</P>
      <P>Previously, Shei-Pa National Park officials said the ecosystem of
thousands of the rare fish could be affected, adding that October is
the breeding season of the fish, and if the fire were to burn down
the forest and the mud were to be washed down the river, then the
rare fish and other marine life in the ecosystem would be endangered.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung flew by helicopter to inspect the
forest fire Tuesday afternoon and later ordered the establishment of
a mechanism for airborne fire fighting and also for a special force
of the Ministry of National Defense to pitch in with the fire
fighting effort.</P>
      <P>Government spokesman Su Cheng-ping said that after the strenuous
efforts of the firefighters and the help of some rain and also the
onslaught of colder weather, the scale of the forest fire has been
reduced, although around 80 hectares of forest have already been
consumed.</P>
      <P>Su said that there remain only sporadic simmering fires in some
forest areas, adding that firefighters had expected to put out the
fire by Monday night, but stronger winds Monday afternoon have
affected the fire fighting efforts.</P>
      <P>Su said that the affected forest areas are made up mostly of
Taiwan pines. As most are new seedlings, the extent of the damage
should be limited, but the actual cost will only be able to be
determined later.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTS CALLS FOR RESTRAINT ON BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  12  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A report released Monday by the Asia
Foundation calls on the new U.S. administration to maintain a
one-China policy while cautioning both sides of the Taiwan Strait
against unilateral attempts to change the status quo.</P>
      <P>A parallel report says that "there is a strong view among all
the countries in the region that China and Taiwan must both exercise
restraint so as not to destabilize the entire region."</P>
      <P>The two reports, respectively presenting the American and Asian
views on the role of the United States in Asia, are published after a
year-long examination of U.S. policy toward the region by two
separate task forces composed of distinguished experts.</P>
      <P>Ezra Vogel, Havard professor and co-chair of the American group,
said that Asian countries don't want a conflict between the United
States and mainland China so that they don't have to decide who to
side with.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the launch of the reports, Vogel also said that Asian
countries are "very concerned" that the Bush administration may be
"too forthright" about arms sales to Taiwan, eventually resulting in
an arms race between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>In its report, the bi-partisan group of 37 high-ranking American
policymakers and scholars urge the U.S. government to "make clear to
Taipei that it will not support an independent Taiwan achieved
without Beijing's acceptance."</P>
      <P>Washington should also tell Taipei that it will not necessarily
come to Taiwan's defense "if Taipei declares independence
unilaterally, or otherwise engages in actions aimed at provoking
Beijing".</P>
      <P>The report, called "America's Role In Asia: American Views,"
says it is equally important that the Untied States make clear to
Beijing its opposition to the use of force to resolve the Taiwan
issue.</P>
      <P>Without detailing the circumstances under which Washington would
or would not intervene, the report says, the United States should
indicate that "a military attack on Taiwan by the mainland may be met
with U.S. intervention."</P>
      <P>Noting the 30-year-old policy continues to serve the United
States as well as both sides of the Taiwan Strait, the report says
Washington "should be firm in its commitment to the one-China
principle as outlined in the Three Communiques" between Washington
and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The task force established a year ago consists of people who
have played leading roles in U.S.-Asian relations in the last 25
years. Its other co-chair is Casimir Yost, director of the Institute
for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University.</P>
      <P>Members of the group include former ambassadors Michael
Armacost, James Sasser, Stapleton Roy, Charles Freeman, former
administration officials such as William Perry, Joseph Nye, Douglas
Paal, Kenneth Lieberthal, Kurt Campbell and well-known China experts
like Robert Scalapino, Nancy Bernkopf Tucker and Harry Harding.</P>
      <P>In its 60-page report, the group lists continued uncertainty in
the Taiwan Strait as one of the trends that could threaten U.S.
interest in Asia.</P>
      <P>The others include the drift in the U.S.-Japan relationship,
the nuclearization of India and Pakistan, and nationalism and the
establishment of new regional groupings which exclude the United
States and other Western nations.</P>
      <P>The other report calls Washington's relationship with Beijing
"the single biggest challenge facing the United States in Northeast
Asia at the dawn of the 21st century."</P>
      <P>The report says that, while mainland China may seek to
avoid direct confrontation with the United States, the possibility of
the two countries engaging in conflict over Taiwan cannot be ruled
out."</P>
      <P>In addition to calling on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to
show restraint, the report presenting the Asian viewpoint also urges
Washington to encourage both parties to resume dialogue and make all
efforts to avoid confrontation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROW OVER NUKE POWER PLANT TO END SOON: LEGISLATIVE YUAN PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday that the row over the issue of the fourth nuclear power
plant is expected to come to an end soon after the Legislative Yuan
received a new compromise proposal from the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the opposition alliance in the Legislative Yuan
will call a meeting on the new compromise proposal Tuesday afternoon
and that, if there are no further differences, he will then sign an
agreement with Premier Chang Chun-hsiung so that the long-stalled
construction on the fourth nuclear power plant can be restarted
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang also said that with an end to the row over the controversial
nuclear power project, the mechanism for dialogue between the two
yuans will be reopened and the premier will be able to give an
administrative report and field questions from the Legislature when
its new session begins next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiou I-jen, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, sent the
new compromise proposal to the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day,
saying that it is a revised version of the proposal presented by the
Legislative Yuan Feb. 6 but rejected by the legislative majority.</P>
      <P>The revised version states that the Executive Yuan offers to
resolve the dispute through negotiations between the two yuans,
rather than through mediation by President Chen Shui-bian, and that
the follow-up budget for the nuclear plant should be made "according
to related rules," rather than leaving it to the new Legislature to
be elected at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The row between the two branches of government stems from the
Legislative Yuan's abrupt announcement Oct. 27 scrapping the
partially completed fourth nuclear power plant, a move that angered
the Kuomintang-led opposition in the Legislature and led to the
premier being declared a "persona non grata" by the legislators.</P>
      <P>The dispute has persisted despite a ruling by the Council of
Grand Justices Jan. 15 to the effect that the two branches of
government should work out their differences through negotiations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   13   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), paid a courtesy
call on President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday for wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>It was the first meeting between President Chen and Koo since
the Republic of China's top negotiator with mainland China
returned to Taiwan late last year after receiving medical treatment
in the United States for his kidney problems.</P>
      <P>SEF sources said Chen and Koo had exchanged views on the latest
development in relations across the Taiwan Strait as well as
the current domestic political situation during their hour-long
talks.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to avoid media attention, Koo kept a
low-profile and was not accompanied by any aides during his visit to
the Presidential Office, the sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Koo briefed SEF Vice Chairman and
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-you and Deputy Secretary-General Jan
Jyh-horng at his home in the afternoon on the content of his talks
with President Chen.</P>
      <P>Koo has not attended any SEF activities since his return from
the United States because of health reasons. Over the past couple of
months, Chen has shown much concern about Koo's health and has on
many occasions requested for meeting Koo. But the Koo family politely
turned down Chen's offers.</P>
      <P>Sources close to the Koo family said Koo took the initiative in
arranging Tuesday's meeting to express his gratitude for Chen's
concern about his health.</P>
      <P>There has been unfounded speculation about Koo's health in
recent months. The sources said Tuesday's Chen-Koo meeting indicated
that Koo's health is not as bad as speculated.</P>
      <P>Koo, now in his 80s, held a historic meeting with Wang Daohan,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), in Singapore in April 1993 to lay a framework
for regular cross-strait dialogue and exchanges in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Koo also made a landmark visit to Shanghai and Beijing in
October 1998. During that visit, Koo held talks with Wang in
Shanghai and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to Jiang, originally
promised to make a reciprocal visit to Taiwan in 1999, but Beijing
halted Wang's travel plan after former ROC President Lee Teng-hui
declared that cross-strait ties should be conducted on a "special
state-to-state" basis in July that year.</P>
      <P>Koo, a stalwart of the pro-unification Kuomintang, remained on
his SEF post after Chen, a founding member of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, took the presidency last May as Chen
wanted Koo to assist him in pushing Beijing to resume cross-strait
dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO PUSHING FOR CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
administration's commitment Tuesday to continuing pitching for
resumption of regular dialogue across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation in a speech delivered at the
opening of a senior military officers workshop.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government's current policy toward mainland China
still focuses on seeking a breakthrough to the protracted
cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>"We'll make continued efforts to push for re-opening of
cross-strait dialogue and consultations," Chen said, adding that his
administration will handle cross-strait exchanges based on the
principles of "constructive openness and effective management" with a
view to guiding the bilateral relationship to move in a positive
direction.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 21st century is a new era of
reconciliation, peace and cooperation, Chen said he hopes the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait can shed old burdens and use new
thinking to turn a new page for cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Touching on domestic affairs, Chen said he looks forward to
seeing all major local political parties reconcile their partisan
differences and move toward cooperation in the new year.</P>
      <P>"As political stability holds the key to achieving economic boom,
reform and progress, both the ruling and opposition parties should
work together to create an environment favorable for investment and
economic development," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's appeal for reconciliation among domestic political
parties came at a time when his minority administration was about to
reach a compromise with the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
over the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>In his address, Chen also encouraged all military servicemen to
pay more heed to mainland China's military build-up plans and
relevant technology development as maintaining balance of military
strength is the most effective way to avert a war.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that since he assumed office in the Republic
of china's first democratic transfer of power between different
political parties last May, he has made 21 inspection tours of
various military units around Taiwan and on offshore islands.</P>
      <P>"During those visits, I have often been moved by our
servicemen's self-sacrifice and devotion to fulfilling their
duties," Chen said, adding that national security is the very
foundation for Taiwan's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of the new century, Chen went on, Taiwan faces
many new challenges. "For one thing, we must pool wisdom, experience
and resources to complete our military modernization program and
infuse new thinking and new concepts in defense construction and
manpower training."</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen pitched for "lifetime learning," encouraging
all officers and men to study new knowledge and technology to
enhance their career achievements.</P>
      <P>In the new year, Chen said his administration will also continue
improving welfare services for all officers and men and ensure
barracks security to upgrade military morale.</P>

    <DATELINE>Keelung,  northern  Taiwan, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Coastal patrol units on
Tuesday found near Keelung Harbor a grounded whale-watching vessel
that was originally suspected of having sunk off the coast of Suao
Harbor in northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 120-ton passenger ship, only recently built in Shikoku,
Japan, was abandoned by its four-member crew last Thursday when it
began taking on water on rough seas.</P>
      <P>Carrying two Japanese shipbuilding engineers, the vessel had been
en route to Taiwan to enter service at a Suao-based travel and
shipping company. All crew members were rescued by the coastal
patrol.</P>
      <P>Keelung Port Authorities speculated that the ship did not take on
enough water to sink after it was abandoned and floated -- partially
submerged and bobbing in the waters -- to Keelung five days later.</P>
      <P>The company that had ordered the boat has been notified, port
authorities added.</P>
      <P>The newly-built ship was supposed to have been christened "New
Gueishan No. 2" after it was to have arrived in Suao and joined the
lucrative ocean sightseeing and whale-watching business that the
company operates between Suao and Kueishan, an islet in the shape of
a turtle located off the northeastern county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>Kueishan, which used to be a secret military base, was opened to
tourists last year.</P>
      <P>Departing Shikoku Feb. 3 in gloomy weather, the boat had sought
shelter at Koniya Port in the Amami Islands to the north of Okinawa
on the night of Feb. 4 because conditions at sea became too rough.</P>
      <P>After staying at Koniya Port for two days, the ship headed out to
sea and once again encountered bad weather when approaching Taiwan.
The ship sent out an S.O.S signal early Thursday morning when it was
about 33 nautical miles away from Suao.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FACTION TO CALL ANTI-NUCLEAR DEMONSTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmaker Hung Chi-chang, also chief of the
New Tide faction under the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
urged supporters Tuesday to take part in a mass rally to protest the
government's compromise over the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Hung claimed that although the New Tide faction understands that
the Executive Yuan's offer of a three-point compromise is aimed at
ending the political stalemate over the nuclear plant issue, the vast
majority of DPP members are against continued construction of the
plant.</P>
      <P>Citing a recent survey conducted by the DPP, Hung said that as
many as 64 percent of all DPP supporters are opposed to continued
construction. He therefore has called on DPP supporters to take to
the streets Feb. 24 to condemn the opposition coalition, which has
majority control in the Legislative Yuan, and to express their desire
for a public referendum to decide the fate of the plant.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the New Tide faction will not allow backers to
lose faith in the DPP, Hung said that his faction will continue
promoting the goal of building Taiwan into a homeland free from
nuclear power by joining forces with the public.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, leaders of the anti-nuclear movement strongly
criticized the Executive Yuan for giving way to the opposition
coalition on the issue, arguing that they cannot accept the
compromise reached between the two sides on continued construction of
the plant.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, a heavyweight of the Green Party, described
President Cheng Shui-bian as a "comrade" without determination on
anti-nuclear stance, while S. M. Shih, head of the Environmental
Protection Alliance, blasted Chen for breaking his election promises.</P>
      <P>According to the two men, DPP leaders, such as former chairman
Lin Yi-hsiung and many of the president's advisors, will also
participate in the planned rally.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen, a staunch anti-nuclear
supporter, remained unwilling to answer questions from the press
regarding the controversial issue. But according to sources close to
the secretary-general, Wu said Monday that the DPP will reluctantly
accept the Executive Yuan's compromise over the issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group comprised of
five members of the Control Yuan Tuesday inspected the the Lungkeng
nature reserve area, located in Kenting National Park at the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, which has been polluted by a fuel oil
spill from the sunken Greek freighter M.V. Amorgos.</P>
      <P>Huang Wu-tse, the group's organizer, said that they will probe
the ability of the environmental protection agency to deal with the
issues of pollution in the area and will also listen to opinions put
forth by the local residents.</P>
      <P>Pingtung County Magistrate Su Chia-chuan greeted members of the
group, including Lee Shen-i, Hsieh Ching-hui, Liao Chien-nan, and
Chao Jung-yao, when they arrived at the scene in the Lungkeng nature
reserve.</P>
      <P>Su told the visiting Control Yuan members that pollution caused
by the oil spill has been confined to waters off Lungkeng and that
other areas of Kenting have not been affected. He also asked them to
probe whether reports have exaggerated the amount of pollution that
has been caused by the fuel oil spill case.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, the visiting members accompanied Lin Chun-yi,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA),
on a helicopter ride for a bird's eye view inspection of the
situation off Kenting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Republic of China Army sent more than 1,500
military personnel Tuesday to help in the Lungkeng area clean-up
effort, which is expected to be completed in the next three weeks.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a naval rescue ship arrived in the waters of
Kenting to help collect fuel oil floating on the surface of the sea.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition lawmaker urged the government
Tuesday to set up a special anti-epidemic task force in preparation
for the opening of direct trade, mail and transport links between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait, also known as "big three links."</P>
      <P>Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First Party
(PFP) said at a news conference that while the government plans
further liberalization of cross-strait exchanges, it should not
overlook the possible spread into Taiwan of various mainland
China-originating infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>Noting that many serious contagious diseases are still endemic on
the mainland, Chou said the government should form a special task
force to work out a comprehensive plan for controlling the spread of
such diseases from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that cross-strait civilian exchanges have increased
rapidly since Taiwan began to allow its people to visit the mainland
for family reunions in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>"And commercial and personnel exchanges are expected to grow even
faster now that our government has opened the two frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu for direct trade, postal and shipping links with
mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou at the beginning of this year,"
Chou said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the government is planning to allow
sightseeing tours of Taiwan by mainland people later this year and
full-fledged direct cross-strait links might also be opened in the
near future.</P>
      <P>"We should learn a lesson from the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
disaster that has dealt a serious blow to our husbandry industry in
recent years," Chou said, adding that the FMD outbreaks at hog and
cattle ranches in Taiwan and Kinmen in recent years were partly
attributable to rampant smuggling of live animals and agricultural
products from the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced Tuesday
that Taiwan's First Commercial Bank, Tah An Commercial Bank and Pan
Asia Bank will merge into a single unit.</P>
      <P>The merger will be completed in three to six months, with the new
bank to be called First Commercial Bank. The three banks together
account for 9 percent of the domestic market.</P>
      <P>Chang made the announcement at a press conference at which
Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang, Kao Chih-shang of Tah An Commercial
Bank, Chen Chien-lung of First Commercial Bank and Ke Fei-lo of Pan
Asia Bank were also present to announce the signing of a letter of
intent on the merger.</P>
      <P>He said that the merger is part of the Executive Yuan's financial
and monetary reforms and will further strengthen the competitiveness
of local banking institutes.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current financial and monetary situation, Chang
said that Taiwan needs only 10 banks and the government will
encourage the 58 local banks to merge into larger units.</P>
      <P>The latest merger will be the second, following the merger last
December of the Cooperative Bank with the ChinFon Commercial Bank and
Yen said more mergers can be expected.</P>
      <P>A merging promotion committee comprising of three bank officials
will be set up shortly to make plans and draw up rules for the merger
and a merging evaluation committee will be set up in March to discuss
share exchange measures.</P>
      <P>After the merger, the new bank will have a total assets amounting
to NT$1,599 billion, making it the second-largest local bank behind
the Bank of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yen also prom4sed that the merger will not lead to any
redundancies, but this was dismissed by First Commercial Bank
Chairman Chen Chien-lung and Tah An Commercial Bank Chairman Kao
Chih-shang, both of whom said that people will indeed lose their jobs

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WARNS ABOUT POSSIBLE THREATS FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's refusal to renounce the
use of force against Taiwan remains the largest threat to Taiwan's
continued development and survival, President Chen Shui-bian said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that a misguided judgment by mainland China might lead
to the outbreak of war across the Taiwan Strait, Chen said Taiwan
must upgrade its combativeness in order to deter any military attack
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The focus of the Republic of China government's mainland China
policy at present is to stabilize bilateral relations and achieve
reconciliation and cooperation between the two sides, the president
said during an address at a seminar sponsored by the Ministry of
National Defense for military officers.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that he made his cross-strait policy clear in his May
20 inaugural speech last year, Chen said that as head of state, he
deeply understands that the state of Taiwan's relations with mainland
China has a profound impact on all national fronts ranging from
foreign affairs to national defense.</P>
      <P>The president said he is very aware that "the Taiwan people
strongly hope for peace" with mainland China and pointed out that the
ROC government's establishment of the "three mini links" between
Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu Islands and certain Fujian ports
at the beginning of this year has helped stabilize cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>In a Dec. 31 speech to welcome the coming of the 21st century,
Chen said, he publicly called on mainland Chinese leaders to respect
the ROC's presence and status in the international community and to
drop military intimidation against Taiwan in order to break the
impasse and allow for the resolution of disputes between the two
sides with vision and wisdom.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China should gradually create mutual trust by
first integrating economic and cultural affairs of the two sides as a
way of laying a solid foundation for the establishment of a new
framework for an eventually peaceful integration on the political
front, Chen suggested.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that war may break out in the Taiwan Strait
should mainland China, fueled by nationalism, misjudge the situation
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The president reaffirmed Taiwan's unwillingness to engage in an
arms race against the mainland, but made it clear that Taiwan must do
its best to maintain a military balance across the strait so as to
prevent a military conflict in the region.</P>
      <P>Touching on the present political situation in Taiwan, Chen
voiced his hope that the ruling and opposition parties will reconcile
and cooperate to jointly create greater prosperity for the nation and
the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AEC DENIES TALKS WITH RUSSIA ON STORAGE OF TAIPOWER NUCLEAR WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council
(AEC) denied Tuesday that it has talked with Russian officials about
storing state-run Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) nuclear waste in
Russia.</P>
      <P>AEC Vice Chairman Chou Yuan-ching issued the denial in reaction
to rumors that AEC officials have gone to Russia in the past year for
talks on the issue.</P>
      <P>Nuclear waste can be divided into two kinds -- high radiation and
low radiation. At present, Taipower disposes of high radiation waste
by storing it in nuclear plant areas, Chou said, adding that as
Taipower could build an interim storage facility for a storage period
of 40 years, it is not a matter of great urgency to seek storage
areas for high radiation nuclear waste, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He said that Taipower now badly needs low radiation waste storage
sites and noted that even if Russia loosens restrictions on the
import of high radiation waste, as has been reported, it will do
little to help solve Taipower's problem of low radiation waste
storage.</P>
      <P>Taipower in the past has dumped its low radiation nuclear waste
on offshore Orchid Island, but increasing opposition by the
indigenous residents of the island put a stop to the practice.</P>
      <P>Chou said the AEC has picked a small island in the Matsu
island group named Hsiao Wuchiu as a possible dump site, but an
evaluation of the nuclear waste's effect on the environment must be
completed before the small island can be used to store the nuclear
waste.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu and Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local senior high school
students remain unaware that sex crimes have become offenses
prosecutable without complaint since Jan. 1, according to the results
of a survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,079 students at senior high schools and
vocational schools in the greater Taipei area, conducted by the
Awakening Foundation from Dec. 22-30 last year, found that 62.5
percent of the respondents have no knowledge about this significant
change in the country's revised anti-sex crime law.</P>
      <P>Under the new law that took effect Jan. 1, prosecution of sex
offenders can be instituted even if the victim refuses to press
charges. In the past, such prosecutions could be instituted only if
the victim brought charges against the attacker.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, founder of the Awakening Foundation, which is
dedicated to promoting women's rights, said the survey was mainly
designed to explore local high school students' understanding of the
country's anti-sex crime measures.</P>
      <P>"The survey results show that 676, or 62.5 percent, of the 634
female respondents and 445 male respondents were still unaware of the
great change in the key elements to instituting proceedings against
rapists and other sex offenders," said Pan, who is also a legislator
of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the survey results, Professor Yen Han-wen of
National Taiwan Normal University said he was not surprised by the
findings, but added that as the amended law requires strengthening of
sex education in the nine-year compulsory education stage, local
teenage students' sex knowledge will gradually increase in the
future.</P>
      <P>Yen further said the revised law will ensure that suspects will
no longer be easily able to escape prosecution by "under-the-table
means."</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the disadvantage of the new law lies in the
fact that victims of sex crimes might experience further
psychological harm when their cases are opened to the public during
the litigation process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROW OVER NUCLEAR POWER PLANT TO END WITH FORMAL CABINET ANNOUNCEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  13  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three-month-long political standoff
over the controversial fourth nuclear power plant ended Tuesday after
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng signed an agreement to restart the project.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Chang must make a formal announcement
after calling a Cabinet meeting Wednesday to reverse his Oct. 27
decision to scrap the project.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was authorized by the legislative opposition to forge
the agreement, said after the signing that the constitutional dispute
brought on by the Cabinet's unilateral decision had sent tremors
through the domestic political situation and adversely affected the
stock market as well as public confidence.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to express his respect for the Cabinet's
final decision to "abandon its ideologies" and "abide by the
constitutional spirit."</P>
      <P>Chang said before signing the agreement at 7 p.m. at the Taipei
Guest House that the Cabinet "held its ground on certain issues" and
also made concessions on others out of consideration of political
stability and economic development.</P>
      <P>Bowing to opposition pressure, Chang withdrew his earlier demand
to allow the new legislature to be elected at the end of this year to
decide whether follow-on budget for the power plant would be
ratified. Instead, the agreement calls for budget issues to be
decided "according to related laws."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet retained its demand to hold negotiations with the
opposition over an energy bill and arrive at a settled version before
sending it to the legislature for deliberation.</P>
      <P>The opposition alliance, which claims a majority in the
legislative body, agreed to the demand after adding the condition
that such negotiations will be limited to only a nuclear
energy-related bill.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chiao, a spokesman for the opposition People First
Party's legislative caucus, explained that his caucus did not want to
see such negotiations become routine as that would make all future
bills unable to pass the legislative process without negotiations
first being necessary.</P>
      <P>Huang went on to say that the words: "The following conclusions
were reached after coordinating between the Executive Yuan and the
Legislative Yuan" were struck out of the final version of the
agreement because the relationship between the two government bodies
demands them to follow a "division of power" and that it was actually
"inappropriate" under the constitutional spirit to conduct bilateral
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Spokesman Jason Hu, whose party ruled the island
for five decades before losing to the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in the presidential elections last March, expressed his party's
approval of the outcome of the 110-day standoff.</P>
      <P>Hu added that the KMT did not hope to see anyone from "some other
party" -- referring to the DPP -- continue to make up excuses to
cause further delays or play "word games" over the issue.</P>
      <P>Quietly indicating disapproval of the agreement, DPP Whip Chou
Po-lun said that his caucus did not participate in the negotiations
between the legislative opposition and the Cabinet, which he said
signified his party's "lack of identification" with the final
decision to restart the project.</P>
      <P>Chou added that he would boycott President Chen Shui-bian's
nine-person advisory group meeting later in the evening, calling the
meeting "meaningless" unless a new policy-changing development were
to happen at this stage.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said that his ministry
will immediately instruct state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to
resume construction on the partially completed nuclear power plant
after the Cabinet relays orders to that effect.</P>
      <P>He added that Taipower has informed him of a one-year delay to
the starting dates for business operations for each of the plant's
two nuclear reactors. Reactor No. 1 will now go online in July 2005,
and reactor No. 2 will be operational in July 2006, he added.</P>
      <P>An Economics Ministry official in charge of state-run enterprises
said that resumption preparations will take less than three months to
complete, but issues of compensation, contract details and
construction site assessments must be handled before work can resume.</P>
      <P>Atomic Energy Council Vice Chairman Chou Yuan-chin added that a
full-scale safety assessment must be conducted to determine whether
the three-month interruption in the plant's construction has affected
building strength and necessitated fortifying measures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI PROPOSES DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT AT APEC MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb.  13 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A proposal by a Taiwan delegation to the
Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC) forum to promote the development of
digital technology has won wide APEC support, Deputy Director-General
K. H. Liang of the Board of Foreign Trade said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liang, who is a member of the Taiwan delegation to an APEC senior
officials' meeting which ended that day in Beijing after four days of
discussions, made the remarks in a telephone interview with CNA.</P>
      <P>Liang said that his report, titled "Turning the Digital Divide
into a Digital Opportunity" and delivered on the last-day session of
the meeting, won positive responses from delegates of other APEC
economies, including mainland China's Vice Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya, who presided over the meeting.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's delegates praised Taiwan's role in helping narrow the
digital divide among countries in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Liang said Taiwan will invite delegates of all 21 APEC member
economies to gather in Taipei on July 24-27 to discuss ways and means
of reducing the digital divide by helping the region's small- and
medium-sized enterprises go digital and public services to become
computerized.</P>
      <P>Liang and Shen Ssu-tsun, director-general of the Foreign
Ministry's Department of International Organizations, were joint
leaders of the Taiwan team at the meeting. Shen was scheduled to
return home Wednesday, while Liang will remain in Beijing for two
more days to take part in an APEC joint forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN  PM  ADDRESSES NATIONAL JUDGES COLLEGE IN BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb. 13 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien told
mainland China's future judges Tuesday that an independent judiciary
is essential to the rule of law.</P>
      <P>"It must be free from undue influence of any kind -- be it from
those with money or power," Chretien said in a speech at the National
Judges College in Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In Canada, our judges are completely independent. And there are
very strict mechanisms in place to protect their independence.
Contacts between politicians and judges on matters before the courts
are forbidden. And breaches of this rule have forced resignations,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Canada is more than willing to share its "experiences and
expertise with you, if you deem it to be of assistance," he told his
audience.</P>
      <P>Exchanges already take place at a very high level between the two
countries' supreme courts. He noted that chief justice of the Supreme
Court of Canada has already visited mainland China twice.</P>
      <P>Among the law experts who have helped train mainland Chinese
officials is Tung-Pin Chen of Queen's University in Kingston,
Ontario, who will assume the post of representative at the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office, Canada, in March.</P>
      <P>Chretien touched a sensitive point when he said Canadians "have
been disturbed by reports of the lack of such respect" for the rule
of law in the past.</P>
      <P>Changes in the laws arising from mainland China's membership in
the World Trade Organization (WTO), which is expected soon, and
mainland China's signing of two U.N. covenants on human rights will
"have to be enforced by the courts," he said.</P>
      <P>For no matter how well the laws are written, he pointed out,
there can be no justice without a fair trial overseen by a competent,
independent, impartial and effective judiciary.</P>
      <P>Again, he turned to Canada for an example, saying that in Canada,
the "rule of law" has been "a pillar of our development. It has
enabled our economy to grow and adapt to change. It has ensured
individual and collective freedom, social stability and peace. It has
made Canada an effective and creative force in the international
community."</P>
      <P>"I believe that the `rule of law' offers the same promise for
China and the Chinese people. And as judges, it will, in many ways,
fall to you to deliver on that promise,"</P>

      <P>Executives of 1,000 global companies
consider Taiwan the 19th-best location for investment, according to
the newest findings released Tuesday by noted management consulting

      <P>According to the results of the Chicago-based company's Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) Confidence Index, an annual assessment of
CEOs, CFOs and other senior executives of the world's largest

China overtook Britain to become the second-most favorable place for
FDI over the next three years.</P>
      <P>Nearly 33 percent of the respondents said they believe the
investment prospects in mainland China are improving, and only 5
percent said that they believe the prospects are worsening.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Singapore jumped from No. 21 to No. 13,
followed closely by Thailand at No. 14. South Korea ranked No. 17.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Wednesday, Feb. 14, or the 22nd
day of the first month of the Year of the Snake according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Essay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine, or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming"
many islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Admiral John Jervis and Captain
Horatio Nelson defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St.
Vincent.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

1893: Hawaii is annexed to the United States by a treaty.

the National Cash Register Company (now NCR Corporation) for 15
years, is made president of a company that later becomes
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Chinese communist regime and the Soviet Union sign the
"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies
of Joseph Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party.

1962: General Hu Chung-nan, strategic adviser to President Chiang
Kai-shek, dies in Taipei at the age of 68.

1972: Mexico establishes diplomatic relations with mainland
China.

1972: The Soviet Union launches its Luna 20 spacecraft to the
moon.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing,
putting it on the same basis as Moscow.

1973: Walter Benche Medina, newly-appointed ambassador of El
Salvador, arrives in Taipei to assume his post.

1974: A six-member Jordanian trade mission led by S.A. Matouk,
president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a
weeklong visit.

1974: Commissioner W. Stanley Cottrill, international secretary
of the Salvation Army International Headquarters, leaves Taipei after
a three-day visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific becomes a territory of
the United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted Republic of China musician, dies in
Taipei at the age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa," or death sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for
what he deemed to be blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic
Verses," sending him into years of hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the
age of 73. He served 18 months in prison for his role in the
Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant
Star with Grand Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips
Electronics, in recognition of his company's contribution to Taiwan's
economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian says that he will visit Beijing and invite mainland Chinese
leaders to visit Taipei if he wins the March 18 election.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Earnestness without judgment
becomes pedantry; caution without judgment becomes timidity; courage
without judgment leads to crime; uprightness without judgment makes
men tyrannical."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ANNOUNCES RESUMPTION OF CONSTRUCTION ON N-PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced
resumption of construction on the island's fourth nuclear power
plant Wednesday, ending a protracted standoff between his Cabinet and
the opposition-dominated legislature over the project.</P>
      <P>"This was an agonizing decision," Chang said at a news
conference, adding that the Cabinet has to temporarily sacrifice its
sacred policy goal for maintaining political and economic stability.</P>
      <P>While establishing a nuclear-free homeland is his unswerving
goal, Chang said it is also his unavoidable responsibility to create
a stable environment for sustainable national development.</P>
      <P>"If we allow the simmering Cabinet-legislature standoff to
continue, it will cause economic and social chaos," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>He cited three major considerations behind the Cabinet's decision
to restart construction on the controversial plant -- responding to
the public aspiration for political stability, inter-party harmony
expected to benefit domestic economic development, and respecting
the agreement between the Executive and Legislative Yuans.</P>
      <P>"Based on all these considerations, the Cabinet has decided to
reactivate the legislature-approved budget for the fourth nuclear
power plant and to continue construction work instantly," Chang said,
adding that the Cabinet has ordered relevant government agencies to
carry out the project under maximum safety standards.</P>
      <P>The announcement came a day after Chang cut a deal with
Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, capping days of tense
negotiations. The agreement signed Tuesday included a pledge to
work together on a new energy bill, which the government hopes
will phase out nuclear power.</P>
      <P>Since the coalition of opposition caucuses in the legislature has
promised to reopen the door of consultations with the Cabinet so long
as construction on the plant is resumed, Chang said he hopes the two
branches can discuss the legislation of a plebiscite bill as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>"We should enact a law to pave the way for a referendum vote by
the general public on a contentious policy issue like the nuclear
power plant project," Chang said. "By so doing, we'll be able to
repeat the similar chaos caused by the nuclear power plant project."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said that after more than 20 years of efforts by
environmentalists, the concept of "nuclear-free" homeland has finally
become a common consensus in Taiwan. "We should treasure this
hard-won achievement."</P>
      <P>Chang said he has ordered the Government Information Office
to join forces with the Ministry of Education, the National Science
council, the Ministry of the Interior, the Environmental Protection
Administration, the Atomic Energy Council and private environmental
groups to launch nuclear-free publicity campaign around the island.</P>
      <P>Restarting the nuclear project marked the first major defeat for
President Chen Shui-bian's minority administration, which infuriated
the opposition-controlled legislature by abruptly announcing a
decision on Oct. 27, 2000 to cancel the plant without seeking
lawmakers' approval. The US$5.4 billion power plant was a pet
project of the previous Kuomintang (KMT) government.</P>
      <P>Since then, the KMT-led opposition coalition refused to
cooperate with President Chen's administration on other issues,
causing gridlock that led to a 44 percent decline in the local
stock market value last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>4TH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT OPERATIONAL STATUS TO BE DELAYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversial fourth nuclear power
plant will not become operational until the summer of 2005, Taiwan
Power Co. (Taipower) officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks after Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's
announcement earlier that construction of the plant will be
restarted, ending the more than three-month standoff between the
executive and legislative branches over the project, scrapped in late
October.</P>
      <P>They noted that the 110-day hiatus in the construction timetable
of the plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, will result in a delay of at
least a year in the operational status, even at the most optimistic
estimate.</P>
      <P>They also said that they will notify local and foreign
contractors of the resumption of construction work after receiving
official notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The officials noted the first reactor of the plant was originally
scheduled to be completed by July 2004 and the second reactor to be
completed by July 2005, to accommodate the peak summer demand, but
added that the schedule had been delayed until December 2004 and
December 2005, respectively.</P>
      <P>As power demand peaks in the summer, the completion of the
reactor in the winter will have no real effect on the power supply
and in fact will not be useful until the following year.</P>
      <P>Following the restarting of construction, Taipower is expected to
see a backlash from anti-nuclear groups, but the most thorny question
will be the compensation to local and foreign contractors for the
delay. To ensure a smooth restart, the officials said Taipower will
ask the contractors to resume construction and conduct compensation
negotiations at the same time.</P>
      <P>They said that General Electric Co. of the United States, which
was awarded a US$1.799 billion contract in 1996 to supply the two
reactors and the initial fuel to be used for the fourth nuclear
plant, has been notified that work is to restart on the first
reactor, which was 95 percent complete when construction was
suspended.</P>
      <P>However, they went on, even if the construction of the reactor is
completed, there will be problems in shipping the reactor, as the
contractor hired to build the special wharf needed to land the heavy
reactor has acted in line with his contract stipulations by pulling
out of the deal because of the three-month hiatus.</P>
      <P>If the contractor refuses to resume work, there will have to be a
fresh tender and the ideal time for building -- April or May -- will
be missed, resulting in further construction delays.</P>
      <P>But the Taipower officials also said that as harbor construction
is now largely completed, even if the original contractor chooses not
to continue the construction, they will "somehow manage" to get the
reactor to Taiwan in September as scheduled. They did not say how
they plan to do this.</P>

      <P>Acer Incorporated -- Taiwan's largest

    <HEADLINE>NO MORE IMPROMPTU POLICY U-TURNS: KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first and foremost lesson Taiwan should
learn from the fourth nuclear power plant chaos is that the
government should exercise extreme prudence in making policy
about-faces, an opposition leader said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan made the remarks
at the end of a 111-day bitter stand-off between the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led government and the opposition-dominated
legislature over the nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, pointed out that the country has
paid an enormous price, both tangible and intangible, over the past
111 days because of the furor over the project.</P>
      <P>"And now is the time for us to review the significance of this
episode," Lien noted, adding that the DPP minority government should
learn the lesson that major policy shifts should not be made without
careful scrutiny.</P>
      <P>"At a time when the world is dashing ahead, we have wasted more
than 100 days in gridlock over whether construction on a partially
built plant should be continued or not," Lien lamented, adding that
the wrangling has dampened investor confidence and led to a 44
percent drop in the stock market value last year.</P>
      <P>Lien further said he is hopeful that the chaos will be the last
time that the country must pay the price for major government policy
about-turns.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the fourth nuclear power plant is essential to cope
with a potential threat of power shortages in Taiwan's pursuit of a
diversified energy policy, Lien said the KMT has consistently
supported the fourth nuclear power plant project and the gradual
decommissioning of the existing first, second and third nuclear power
plants in tandem with progress in various alternative energy
development projects.</P>
      <P>"I briefed President Chen Shui-bian on this basic KMT stance when
I met him at the Presidential Office on Oct. 27, 2000," Lien
recalled, adding that the KMT has never wavered on this position.</P>
      <P>As Wednesday was Valentine's Day, Lien noted that love is the
core of the celebration of this festival. "I hope that all local
politicians can shed confrontation and work together with true love
for our homeland and people."</P>
      <P>Lien also called on all major opposition parties to continue
cooperation to push the DPP administration to abide by the
constitutional spirit and provisions and safeguard the dignity of the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>The US$5.4 billion nuclear power plant is the pet project of the
previous KMT government but the DPP-led Cabinet abruptly announced a
decision late last October to scrap the project, triggering an
immediate uproar in the Legislative Yuan, in which the KMT still
controls a comfortable majority.</P>
      <P>Enraged by the Cabinet's failure to consult with it before
announcing such a critical policy change, the legislature had since
declined to talk with the Cabinet about all other issues. Bowing to
the pressure from the KMT-led opposition coalition, the Cabinet
finally agreed to restart construction on the plant Wednesday, ending
the deadlock.</P>
      <P>The resumption of the project was seen as a major defeat of the
DPP administration because the anti-nuclear position has long been
enshrined in the party's platform.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DEMANDS STUDY  OF AIRBORNE FOREST FIREFIGHTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung has instructed
the Council of Agriculture (COA) to learn from forest firefighting
techniques used in other countries to develop airborne firefighting
technology to combat forest fires.</P>
      <P>The premier issued the instruction after being briefed on the
firefighting efforts of the COA in the forest fire that swept the
Lishan area of central Taiwan from Sunday.</P>
      <P>By Tuesday night, the fire was more or less extinguished, but
some 80 hectares of forest, mostly Taiwan red pine, have been
consumed in the worst fire in the mountainous area for the past five
years, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>They also noted that the fire did not spread to a wider area,
which might have endangered the habitat of the endangered Formosan
salmon, which is only found in that area.</P>
      <P>Rescue workers and army special forces who pitched in to fight
the fire remained in the area to prevent the embers from flaring up
and reigniting the blaze.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Chen Hsi-huang said that the council will start
reforestation work in the burned areas, planting hardwood species
such as camphor instead of the Taiwan red pine, as the red pines are
susceptible to fire on the dry slopes of Lishan due to their high
resin content. He estimated that the work will cost NT$16 million
(US$493,827).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung District Court said that it is sending
prosecutors to the fire scene to conduct an investigation and
question two workers who were laying water pipes in the area prior to
the blaze and might have been responsible for the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Firefighters had earlier ruled out the possibility of arson and
believe that negligence caused the fire.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH TO UNVEIL NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR HIRING FOREIGN CARETAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will unveil
new standards for employing foreign caretakers next week at the
request of the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA), government sources
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu has asked DOH
Director-General Lee Ming-liang to assist in working out new
requirements for hiring foreign caretakers as the labor council
has decided to ease restrictions on the employment of foreign
caretakers.</P>
      <P>At present, the CLA relies on the Barthel's score as the sole
standard in screening applications by local families with handicapped
and mentally-challenged members for hiring foreign caretakers. The
measure has drawn much criticism as the score cannot accurately
reflect the patients' real need for help. Many people also complained
that the current quota system cannot meet the actual demand for
foreign caretakers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the CLA lacks qualified professionals to draft
relevant measurement standards, CLA Chairwoman Chen said the council
needs the DOH's assistance in working out comprehensive evaluation
standards.</P>
      <P>In addition to promising to come up with a new evaluation scale
next week, the DOH has also agreed to designate several hospitals to
conduct double checks on applications for hiring foreign caretakers.</P>
      <P>According to a DOH estimate, at least 130,000 local elderly,
disabled and mentally-challenged people need the help of caretakers.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said the relaxation of restrictions on hiring
foreign caretakers will make it even more difficult for President
Chen Shui-bian to honor his campaign promise to cut the number
of foreign laborers by 15,000 annually.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-NUCLEAR ACTIVISTS, LAWMAKERS DEMAND REFERENDUM OVER NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Anti-nuclear activists and lawmakers,
calling for a year-end referendum to "let the people decide," blasted
the Executive Yuan Wednesday for reneging on its Oct. 27 decision to
scrap the fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>In response to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration's decision earlier in the day to resume the project
under opposition pressure, members of the Green Party, several
environmental groups, and residents of the area where the plant is
being constructed rallied in front of the Executive Yuan to protest
the move.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, hardline DPP legislators Chou Shu-ya, Lai Ching-lin
and Chung Chin-chiang demanded a plebiscite to decide the ultimate
fate of the plant.</P>
      <P>Chou predicted that the controversy over the project will not
simply end with Wednesday's Cabinet announcement that it will
immediately resume construction, but will rather cause "serious
social confrontations" and internal conflicts within the DPP.</P>
      <P>Calling for the rapid passage of a referendum bill in the
legislature, she added that if Premier Chang Chun-hsiung is not
willing to hold the issue to a nationwide vote at the end of the
year, then "the only thing to do would be to ask for him to step down
to shoulder responsibility."</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that the reasons the Cabinet made its Oct. 27
decision "still exist," and that the most recent decision to reverse
that earlier move was only made "because the DPP is a minority party
in the legislature."</P>
      <P>He urged members of the public who are against nuclear power to
join in a protest march scheduled for Feb. 24 and called for a
referendum to allow the people to decide an issue that "concerns the
safety of the 23 million people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Declaring support for the march, the DPP Central Standing
Committee announced that it has appointed the DPP secretary-general
and five central committee members to participate in the march. The
committee also encouraged all party members to attend to show support
for their ideals.</P>
      <P>Representing the residents of Kungliao Township, where the fourth
nuclear power plant stands, one-third completed, township chief Chao
Kuo-tung said that the residents are "disappointed" by the DPP, which
he charged has "betrayed the anti-nuclear cause" and "gone back on
its promise."</P>
      <P>He added that the residents are also "saddened" by the "political
figures who betrayed their voters and abandoned their anti-nuclear
ideals."</P>
      <P>Chao said that 96 percent of the people in his township declared
in a township-wide vote that they are against the continued
construction of the power plant.</P>
      <P>Claiming that 60 percent of the people nationwide are against
nuclear power under the condition that alternative energy sources are
available, he urged the ruling and opposition parties to continue
negotiations and allow the use of a referendum to "achieve the ideal
of building a nuclear-free homeland."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KINMEN GROUP MAKES DIRECT VOYAGE TO XIAMEN ON WAY TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 63-member Kinmen delegation, led by
opposition New Party Legislator Lee Chu-feng, made a direct voyage
to mainland China's Xiamen Thursday on its way to Beijing to take
part in an international road race.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Kinmen athletes traveled directly to
the mainland for sports exchanges since the Republic of China opened
its two frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu for direct trade, mail
and shipping links with mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou in the
southeastern province of Fujian, commonly known as "mini three
links," on Jan. 1.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-fang, a marathon race ace, said she took great pleasure
in making her first trip to the mainland via ship.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee said mainland authorities have approved the
direct sail by his group on a case-by-case basis. "I hope this will
help break the current cross-strait deadlock and usher in a new era
of brisk cross-strait cultural and sports exchanges," he added.</P>
      <P>As Beijing is pushing for full-fledged direct trade, transport
and postal links with Taiwan, also known as "big three links," it has
only grudgingly went along with the Taiwan-initiated "mini three
links" program.</P>
      <P>It has so far only approved four groups to sail directly from
Kinmen to Xiamen, including Thursday's running race delegation. Last
week, it also allowed a mainland ferry to make the first
direct legal crossing to Kinmen in 51 years, carrying 75 elderly
Kinmen residents, who have been stranded on the mainland since the
civil war in the 1940s, for a four-day visit to their homeland.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is hopeful that mainland China will allow direct
Kinmen-Xiamen and Matsu-Fuzhou shipping services on a regular basis
as soon as possible so that the "mini three links" program can take
off to pave the way for the opening of "big three links" in the near
future.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen running race group is scheduled to leave Xiamen
Saturday for Beijing via air to participate in an international
road race scheduled to open Sunday. Delegates from 45 countries will
take part in the annual event.</P>

      <P>The Executive Committee of Liberal

Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The Liberal International, a London-based organization that was
founded in 1947, is one of the three major international political
party groups in the world.</P>
      <P>The Liberal International Congress and the general meeting of
the Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats were held simultaneously
in Taipei in February 2000.</P>
      <P>The Dutch Group of Liberal International confirmed Wednesday that
at the recommendation of the group, the Dutch Party For Freedom and
Democracy, and the British Liberal Democrats, the Executive Committee
of Liberal International unanimously decided during its meeting in
Andorra Feb. 9-10 to bestow the award on Chen for his outstanding
contribution to freedom and liberalism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Sources in the Dutch Group of Liberal International said that the
prize is significant in that recipients, including Hong Kong
democracy activist Martin Lee, have taken their own risks and have
made great contributions to the freedom of their nations.</P>
      <P>Sources said that a total of 10 individuals were recommended for
this year's prize.</P>
      <P>The Executive Committee of Liberal International plans to

    <HEADLINE>U.S.-TAIWAN SUMMER PLANE TICKET PRICES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Airlines significantly dropped their plane
ticket prices for flights between Taipei and destinations in the
United States for the summer season because of the new open-skies
agreement between Taiwan and the U.S.</P>
      <P>The new agreement has put pressure on American airline companies
to lower their airfares because of increased competition, resulting
in the lowest prices in 20 years, according to travel industry
sources.</P>
      <P>In the recent past, a round-trip ticket between Washington and
Taipei would cost a passenger about US$1,200 during the summer
season. The price of such a ticket however has been cut by 50 percent
for the summer of 2001, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Canadian Airlines has added routes from Washington to Taipei,
with a transfer in Vancouver, since the ratification of the agreement
between the U.S. and Taiwan, they said.</P>
      <P>American Airlines will offer Washington-Taipei flight services
beginning April 1, 2001. The flight will include stops in Dallas and
San Jose.</P>
      <P>United Airlines is now offering a round-trip Washington-Taipei
plane ticket for US$600, with a stop in San Francisco. The lower
ticket price however is restricted to flights booked before Feb. 16
and which depart on a weekday before the end of June.</P>
      <P>The lowest ticket price for a round-trip ticket to Taipei from
Washington is being offered by Northwestern Airlines for only US$580.
Travelers who want to enjoy the inexpensive flight will have to book
their ticket before Feb. 16 and depart on a weekday before the end of
May.</P>
      <P>China Airlines' manager in Washington, Shen Wei-hsin, said that
the airline is offering a special promotion, with its
Washington-Taipei ticket being priced at US$690 minus the passenger's
age. Shen added that the airline also caters more to Chinese
travelers by offering Chinese meals during the flight.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONGRESS WANTS U.S. TO CONDEMN BEIJING AT U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A bipartisan group of members of the
U.S. Congress on Wednesday urged the Bush administration to sponsor a
resolution during a United Nations conference calling on Beijing to
"end its human rights abuses in China and Tibet."</P>
      <P>In two similar measures introduced simultaneously in the House
and the Senate, the members of Congress also said that "the U.S.
government should take the lead in organizing multilateral support to
obtain passage" of such a resolution during the next meeting of the
U.N. Commission on Human Rights (UNHRC).</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
the administration is still considering whether to sponsor a
resolution condemning Beijing's human rights record as it has done
nearly every year for the last 10 years.</P>
      <P>On each occasion, Beijing managed to either kill the resolution
before it was put on the conference agenda or have it defeated when
it came to a vote. The next annual UNHRC conference is due to open on
March 19 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), leaders of
mainland China's democracy movement, including Wei Jing-sheng, and
representatives of various human rights groups called on President
George W. Bush to fulfill his campaign promise to take action on the
issue of human rights in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wellstone said inaction by Bush would be "devastating to the
defenders of human rights," while Wei Jin-sheng pointed out that
European governments are looking to the new U.S. administration to
take the lead.</P>
      <P>The Senate resolution urging the U.S. to take action in Geneva is
sponsored by Wellstone and has the support of Senators Tim Hutchinson
(R-Ariz.), Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), and Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.),
among others.</P>
      <P>The companion resolution from the House of Representatives is
sponsored by Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Tom Lantos, both Democrats from
California.</P>
      <P>Wellstone predicted that Congress will adopt the measures by a
strong majority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO SPEED UP REFORM FOLLOWING N-PLANT SOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday his
administration will speed up political and economic reforms
and reconstruction of the earthquake-stricken areas following an end
to the furor over the island's fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Laurence MaCabe,
president of the International Real Estate Federation, who is
currently on a market inspection visit to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chen said although the ROC has seen some partisan frays following
its first-ever democratic transfer of power between different
political parties last May, the conflict and contradiction between
the ruling and opposition parties are expected to ease after the
settlement of the nuclear power plant row.</P>
      <P>The president further told his guest that he has full confidence
in Taiwan's political stability and development prospects. "I'm
confident that my administration will be able to maintain a stable
environment for investment and economic development," he added.</P>
      <P>With the end of the nuclear power plant deadlock between his
minority administration and the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan, Chen said he will from now on devote more efforts to political
and economic reforms to ensure Taiwan's sustainable economic growth.</P>
      <P>"And another focus on our working agenda will be acceleration of
various reconstruction projects in the areas hard-hit by a
devastating earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that President Chen has spoken of his
administration's work plans since Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
announced the restart of construction on the controversial nuclear
power plant Wednesday, ending the 111-day Cabinet-legislature
standoff over the project.</P>
      <P>The resumption of the project marked a major defeat of Chen's
administration because his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has
long been promoting a nuclear-free environment.</P>
      <P>As the DPP controls barely one-third of seats in the Legislative
Yuan, Chen said he must choose a "third way" or adopt a "middle of
the road" principle to seek a compromise with the powerful
opposition and maintain balance and stability in the domestic
political arena.</P>

      <P>Hewlett Packard Company (HP) plans to
increase its procurement to US$5.7 billion in Taiwan this year, Chen
Chiou-ming, general manager of HP's Greater China Region Global

      <P>Chen said that as the infrastructure of Taiwan's information
industry is strong and its response to international demands is
swift, his firm will increase its purchasing in Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that HP's procurement in Taiwan totaled US$5 billion
last year, up some 60 percent from the previous year's level of US$3
billion.</P>
      <P>With the economy expected to rebound in the latter part of 2001,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Many old and new members of Canada's
Parliament have joined the Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship
Group in a bid to gain a better understanding of Taiwan and to help
promote economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The group's newly elected chair, John McKay, on Wednesday praised
Taiwan as "arguably the first multi-party democracy in Asia" after
having evolved from a rural-based economy into high-tech and
multi-faceted economic powerhouse.</P>
      <P>With 120 members from all the different political parties and
both Houses of Parliament, the group was the biggest of its kind in
Canada's last Parliament. The out-going chair, Paul Szabo, said he
believes that it will remain the biggest parliamentary friendship
association in the coming years and that members will remain active
in important ways.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chin-yen Fang, representative of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Canada, hosted a dinner party in honor of the
group's new board of directors as well as existing members and their
spouses.</P>
      <P>Fang will retire next month after 45 years in Taiwan's foreign
service. He thanked the MP's and senators for their support over the
past four and a half years and said he hopes they will continue
working with his successor, Dr. Tung-pi Chen.</P>
      <P>John Reynolds, a politician with 30 years experience, said Canada
is proud to be a trading partner of Taiwan, pointing to the fact that
so many of his parliamentary colleagues being present on the evening
of St. Valentine's Day demonstrates their interest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Canadian Alliance's Finance Critic Jason Kenney said Taiwan
is worth supporting not only because its has a strong economy, but
also because it is a strong example of democracy in Asia.</P>
      <P>Communist China's bullying of an emerging democracy like Taiwan
may be another reason so many peace-loving Canadian parliamentarians
want to "balance" Canada's relations with the two Chinas under their
government's "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Other MP's are in the Canada-Taiwan group because of their
private business interests. For example, Gerard Binet from Quebec's
eastern region said he would like to see Taiwan tourists visit the
snowmobile skiing resort in his riding of Frontenac-Megantic. MP's
from southern Ontario's rural and urban communities have also told
TECO officials they're interested in selling their region's wine and
other products to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien had
some strong words for Communist China during a speech to law students
in Shanghai Thursday, suggesting that the mainland is guilty of
"transgressions."</P>
      <P>According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., the prime minister
said Canadians are concerned when they hear reports from China of
interference in the right to free expression.</P>
      <P>Chretien said there is also concern over reports that people are
imprisoned or badly treated for observing their spiritual beliefs.
"Those reports transgress our most deeply-held convictions," he said.</P>
      <P>But in an apparent effort to soften the criticism, Chretien added
that true friends are never shy about exchanging views on important
issues.</P>
      <P>Later, in a question-and-answer session, Chretien told the East
China University of Politics and Law students that human rights
abuses are bad for business.</P>
      <P>"You have to make sure that the people who come and invest money
in China will have the lawyers like you who will be able to defend

there is nothing more nervous than a million dollars."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FULL RESUMPTION OF NUKE PLANT CONSTRUCTION TO TAKE 3 MONTHS: TAIPOWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It will probably take three months before
the stalled fourth nuclear power plant project can be returned to its
state of last October, when the administration decided to scrap the
construction, the president of Taiwan Power Company said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipower President Kuo Chun-huei made the remarks at a breakfast
meeting with opposition People First Party (PFP) legislators
Thursday. They had invited him to report on matters concerning the
resumption of the stalled project.</P>
      <P>Also attending the meeting were Vice Economic Affairs Minister
Lin Yi-fu, Executive Secretary of the Energy Commission Chen Chao-yi
and other officials.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that so far five contractors of the fourth nuclear power
plant in Kungliao, Taipei County have said they intend to cancel
their contracts. The five firms include the company in charge of
building a special wharf to handle unloading the heavy nuclear
reactors built by General Electric Co. of the United States.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that he could not yet tabulate the losses caused by the
interruption of the construction, saying that as negotiations and
consultations with contractors are still ongoing, he is unable to
determine the exact losses.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that he would notify the contractors about the
resumption of the project and ask them to submit resumption work
plans and negotiate about compensation at the same time.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the construction will be restarted within one
month, and that it would take about three months to return to the
state when the construction was scrapped on Oct. 27.</P>
      <P>He also said how or whether Taipower should shoulder the losses
incurred by the three-month suspension of the project will only be
decided after Taipower finishes negotiating with its contractors.</P>
      <P>PFP legislators have said that the losses should not be
shouldered by Taipower, adding that it should be covered by
government appropriations or by those who made the decision to scrap
it in the first place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MARRIAGE RATE IN 2000 HIT 10-YEAR HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of more than 181,600 couples got
married in Taiwan last year, or 8.19 out of every thousand people in
the nation, according to statistics released recently by the
Department of Health (DOH).</P>
      <P>The 2000 ratio represents a 10-year high in the country's
marriage rate, well above the 7.87 out of every 1,000 people
registered in 1999, and the 6.69 per 1,000 residents who got married
in 1998, the DOH said. The department added that it might be because
2000 was the Year of the Dragon, viewed by Chinese as an auspicious
year in lunar calendar.</P>
      <P>However, the 10-year high in the marriage rate did not result in
a particularly high birth rate, the DOH noted. It pointed out that
last year's birth rate -- 13.76 out of every 1,000 -- was higher than
1999's 12.89 and 1998's 12.43 out of every 1,000, but was far lower
than 1996's rate of 15.07 and the 17.24 of 1988, which was also a
Year of the Dragon.</P>
      <P>Last year, the average Taiwan family had 3.33 people, down from
1991's 3.94, an indication that small families with few children are
the prevailing trend across the island, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>DOH statistics show that the number of households in Taiwan has
increased some 28 percent over the past 10 years.</P>
      <P>In face of the fast-changing structure in local families, the DOH
warned that subsequent problems such as an imbalanced population
structure, reduction of the labor force and economic slowdown may
follow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NOTIFIED CHANGE TO FLEET VISIT: ROC AMBASSADOR TO MARSHALL ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to Marshall
Islands Liu Fu-tien said Thursday that he did not receive any
notifications from the Marshalls government calling for changes to a
planned goodwill visit by a ROC navy training fleet.</P>
      <P>Liu added that the Marshalls government has so far indicated that
it welcomed the proposed visit.</P>
      <P>Liu was responding to wire service reports that the U.S. State
Department had invoked its veto power under the Compact of Free
Association between the United States and the Marshall Islands to
prevent the visit from taking place as scheduled.</P>
      <P>U.S. Ambassador to Marshall Islands Michael Senko was quoted as
saying that the sensitive U.S. relations with mainland China would
not be helped by the port visit of naval vessels from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Marshalls Foreign Minister Alvin Jacklick was quoted as
saying that he did not believe a security issue was involved in this
type of friendly visit.</P>
      <P>Stressing that he has not been informed of any changes to the
formally agreed visit, Liu said that it would be inappropriate for
Taiwan to intervene in how the United States and the Marshall Islands
choose to coordinate with each other on the issue.</P>
      <P>The spokesmen for the ROC Defense Ministry and the ROC Navy
General Headquarters remained tight-lipped over the issue and other
details of the journey.</P>
      <P>The Marshall Islands established diplomatic ties with the
Republic of China in November 1998. The ROC "Friendship Fleet," a
training armada that has sailed as far as the Middle East and South
Africa in recent years, was warmly received by the Marshall Islands
last year during a similar port call.</P>
      <P>This year's flotilla is comprised of a U.S.-built Perry-class
missile frigate, a French-built Lafayette missile frigate, and a
17,000 ton fleet oiler. Crewed by over 380 cadets and sailors, the
fleet set sail from Taiwan Feb. 5.</P>
      <P>The 20,000-nautical mile journey will take the sailors to Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El
Salvador, in addition to the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>During the long voyage, future naval officers will be given a
chance to practice their combat skills and tactics, with an emphasis
on resupplying on the high seas and practicing fleet maneuvers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Salvadoran Embassy in the Republic of
China set up two special bank accounts Thursday to handle donations
from the general public for the relief of the thousands of quake
victims in the Central American country.</P>
      <P>A quake measuring 6.6 on the Richter scale shook El Salvador at
10:25 p.m. Tuesday, Taipei time. According to current Salvadoran
official statistics, 274 people were killed and 2,432 were injured by
the quake.</P>
      <P>The quake jolted El Salvador exactly one month after a
7.6-magnitude tremor hit the country on Jan. 13, claiming more than
800 lives.</P>
      <P>The Salvadoran Embassy in the Republic of China set up two
special accounts at the Tienmu branch of First Commercial Bank for
the purpose of accepting donations for the victims. An account
numbered "19010107004" was set up for those who wish to donate New
Taiwan dollars, while an account numbered "19040005986" was set up to
handle donated foreign currencies.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the government of El Salvador also thanked the
government and the people of the Republic of China for their kind
assistance for the victims of the Jan. 13 quake.</P>
      <P>Embassy officials expressed the hope that people in Taiwan will
continue to provide donations to facilitate the procurement of
emergency materials, such as trucks used for transporting relief
goods, construction materials, tents, medicine, stretchers,

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD NOT MISS THE BOAT: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged mainland
China Thursday to harness the opportunity offered by the Republic of
China's transition of power last May to break the stalemate across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"If Beijing continues to miss the boat, I don't think that my
successor will be in a better position to improve cross-strait
relations," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Stanley Roth, a former
U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was inspired by a recent speech Roth made that
criticized Beijing for refusing to have contacts with the new ROC
government while actively courting Taiwan's opposition politicians.</P>
      <P>"Since policy formation and implementation are the official
duties of those in power, it is really unwise for the mainland
leadership to reject contacts with my administration," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that since he won the ROC's presidential
election last March, he has on many occasions held out olive branches
to Beijing and expressed his determination to normalize cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"Mainland leaders, however, have turned blind eyes and deaf ears
to our goodwill gestures," Chen lamented, adding that mainland
Chian's failure to grasp the "window of opportunity" provided by
Taiwan's first-ever democratic transfer of power between different
political parties was a "serious mistake."</P>
      <P>Mainland China distrusts Chen because his Democratic Progressive
Party favors allowing Taiwan people to vote on whether the island
should permanently split from the mainland. However, Chen promised in
his inaugural speech that he wouldn't hold such a vote as long as
mainland China has no intention to launch a military attack on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former maritime lawyer and defender of political
dissidents, reminded Beijing that he would be a good person with whom
to negotiate. "Because of my background as a lawyer, I have a very
practical, rational and problem-solving personality," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he hopes mainland China can understand the
significance of the opportunity offered by Taiwan's peaceful transfer
of power and begin to forge contacts with his administration.</P>
      <P>He stressed that both sides should endeavor to foster a consensus
and put aside their arguments. "I believe that dialogue, exchanges
and shelving disputes hold the key to settling our differences and
improving bilateral relations."</P>
      <P>Touching on Roth's previous suggestion that Taiwan and mainland
China sign a 50-year "interim agreement" to ensure peace in the
Taiwan Strait, Chen said he thinks that the "interim agreement" is
basically a concept and process. "I agree with the idea that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should let time resolve their more
intractable disputes while seeking solutions to issues that are
easier to resolve."</P>
      <P>Chen also said he favors expansion of cross-strait economic and
cultural exchanges before working on eventual political integration.</P>
      <P>In his talks with Roth, Chen further said Taiwan is a source of
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. "Taiwan's existence and
development is a critical pillar to Asia-Pacific peace and security
and serves the interests of the United States and all relevant
Asia-Pacific countries," he added.</P>
      <P>Roth arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a four-day visit. He is the
first former Clinton administration official to visit Taiwan since
the Jan. 20 transition of power in the United States. During his
stay, Roth will attend a seminar on the Asia-Pacific political and
economic situation and meet with senior ROC officials and opposition
leaders.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that the government will
punish the Matzu officials who have signed an exchange accord with
the mainland's Mawei, a port city of mainland China located near
Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsao Erh-chung (KMT-Matzu), who headed a Lienchiang
County government mission to Mawei, signed a civil exchange accord
between Matzu and Mawei on Jan. 28. Members of the delegation
included Chen Chen-ching, speaker of the Lienchiang County Council,
and Liu Teh-chuan, director of the Lienchiang County Construction
Department.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Teng Chen-chung said that Lienchiang County
officials had violated regulations on cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Cabinet-level Central Personnel Administration
(CPA) will punish them in accordance with the law, Teng said.</P>
      <P>Teng made the remarks in response to local press inquiries after
officiating at a seminar on mainland policy and cross-strait
relations for congressional aides.</P>
      <P>Teng further pointed out that the power to sign such an agreement
belongs to the central government, which also must supervise any
agreement with mainland China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan consumer confidence slid to a
historic low of 21.7 points in 2000, according to the results of an
international survey.</P>
      <P>The "MasterIndex" survey conducted by the credit card giant
Mastercard International last December finds that consumers in
Taiwan, Japan and South Korea are the most pessimistic in the
Asia-Pacific region, while those in Singapore and mainland China are
the most optimistic.</P>
      <P>Singapore topped the consumer confidence index in the region with
84.2 points in the survey, which sets 100 as its best possible
rating, while mainland China scored 78.6 points, its highest-ever
level. The mainland is also the sole market in the region to have
registered continued positive growth in the past six MasterIndex
surveys.</P>
      <P>"The most interesting observation from the latest MasterIndex is
that there is no apparent single trend in consumer confidence across
the region," said Senior Vice President Stuart McDonald.</P>
      <P>He explained that although past surveys showed that events in one
country tended to have a considerable impact on neighboring
countries, the latest poll discovered that "widespread political,
economic and social changes produced a greater impact on the domestic
front, rather than at the regional level."</P>

Chan was the only candidate who had finished the registration process
in the race for the party chair by the deadline of Thursday, almost
assuring him of victory.</P>
      <P>Lien had collected the signatures of more than 100,000 party
members who support his candidacy by Feb. 9, far more than the 28,585
sponsors -- 3 percent of the party membership -- needed for
registration.</P>
      <P>Tuan Hong-chun, who had hoped to run, was about 10,000 signatures
shy of the minimum, excluding him from the race. He had protested
bitterly that the sponsorship requirement was "a ploy to block his
candidacy."</P>
      <P>The first election of the KMT chairman through popular vote will
be staged on March 24, along with the elections of party deputies.
Lien and his supporters are gearing up to stump throughout the

    <HEADLINE>FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE CALLS ON KMT CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior former U.S. official said here
Thursday that Beijing is playing a "united front game" by making
contact only with opposition political parties rather than the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party government.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State in charge of
Asian-Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth made the remark when he called on
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Lien said that although the KMT is part of the opposition, it
will continue to make contact with mainland China in the hope that
contacts will help settle disputes between the two sides of Taiwan
Strait. He added, however, that the KMT will not step into any
substantial negotiations.</P>
      <P>Roth, accompanied by KMT Deputy Secretary-General Shaw Yu-ming,
met with Lien for 40 minutes, after which Shaw told local reporters
that they exchanged views on a range of issues from the domestic
political situation to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>According to Shaw, Roth expressed concern over the domestic
political situation under President Chen Shui-bian and showed
interest in the formation of the opposition alliance.</P>
      <P>Touching on cross-strait ties, Roth was quoted by Shaw as saying
that Beijing is employing a "united front scheme" to handle
cross-strait relations, which Shaw said should be maintained in
harmony and stability to safeguard the safety of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, meanwhile, Beijing's biggest concern is the
DPP's platform, which advocates Taiwan independence. This, he said,
was one of the key factors in the cross-strait stalemate since Chen
assumed power May 20, 2000.</P>
      <P>He also said the ruling party should hold more consultations and
communications with the opposition alliance, as it holds a majority
of seats in the Legislative Yuan. He cited the just-resolved fourth
nuclear power plant issue as an example of how the confrontation
between the ruling and opposition parties "brought the nation to a
halt" for three months.</P>
      <P>Lien also suggested that the DPP-led government should not cope
with issues from an ideological point of view.</P>

      <P>Anticipation of the conveniences resulting
from the "mini three links" with mainland China has brought about a
sharp increase in population for the offshore islands of Kinmen and
Matsu, according to statistics released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statistics compiled by the Directorate General of Budget,

Kinmen and Matsu in 2000, an increase of 1,518 people compared with

profitable items such as video games and anti-virus programs will
form the bulk of its outbound shipments.</P>
      <P>Huang further pointed out that the local industry should seek to
expand its export markets from Asia to the United States in 2005 in
order to make its scale of overseas markets account for 25 percent of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, ending a
high-profile four-day visit to Hong Kong, said Thursday that his city
will invite Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to Taipei for a
Taipei-Hong Kong forum scheduled to be held at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>During a courtesy call on Tung Tuesday, Ma was told only that
Tung was willing to visit Taiwan "at an appropriate time."</P>
      <P>Describing his visit at a press conference held at Taipei City
Hall, Ma said that the third "Twin-City Forum" would be an
"appropriate time."</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the first two forums yielded "productive
results," and that Taipei hopes to host the third forum within a
year. The second forum took place Monday in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Ma added that the Hong Kong Policy Research Institute, which
co-organizes the forum, hopes to see the forum held at the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>Immediately upon his return to Taipei, Ma called on Mainland
Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, whose Cabinet-level agency
is in charge of charting Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>After Ma described to her the results of his visit, Tsai said
that they were "a good start."</P>
      <P>She urged city-to-city exchanges to maintain a "relative level"
of transparency and a lower level of political sensitivity. She added
that she hopes city officials who plan to conduct such exchanges with
mainland cities can inform her council before and after the visits so
that it may be kept abreast of the pace of cross-Taiwan Strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Noting that city-to-city exchanges have been handled on a
case-by-case basis in the past, Tsai pledged to fully evaluate
related policies and laws to allow local government officials to
visit mainland cities with a "healthy basis in law."</P>
      <P>Ma also called on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
to brief him on the Hong Kong visit. Ma is a member of the KMT
Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, before his departure from Hong Kong, Ma told
reporters at the airport that he did not believe Beijing was using
his well-received visit to Hong Kong as a way of putting down
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian, as a foreign media report
had speculated.</P>
      <P>Chen's Democratic Progressive Party has long touted a
pro-independence platform, riling Beijing, which sees Taiwan as a
rebellious province of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ma said that his visit was forging closer ties between Taipei and
Hong Kong and indirectly improving the atmosphere of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>He added that Chen's ability and flexibility in handling
cross-strait issues should not be underestimated, and urged Beijing
not to ignore the numerous olive branches that Chen has held out
since taking office last May.</P>
      <P>Back in Taipei, Ma denied that he was intentionally creating a
new "battlefield" overseas to challenge Chen. He added that the
"unforeseen success" of his visit was the result of two years of
bilateral exchanges between his city and Hong Kong.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong called Thursday for a resolution of the
cross-Taiwan Strait dispute through a peaceful framework based on an
accord that could be signed between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Soong made the proposal when he met with former U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for Asian-Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth, who was in
Taipei for a fact-finding visit.</P>
      <P>Roth called on Soong at the PFP headquarters and held a 90-minute
discussion with Soong, PFP Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi and
Special Assistant to the PFP Chairman Wu Jui-kuo on the domestic
political situation and U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong claimed that only if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
built a peaceful framework based on a peaceful accord can the
security of Taiwan be really secured.</P>
      <P>In addition to expressing what he said is the expectation of
Taiwan's populace on cross-strait peace, he also proposed to
integrate the two sides in three stages -- economic exchanges, social
integration and eventually political integration.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a proposal by Roth for the signing of a
"medium-term" accord between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the basic preconditions for a peaceful
framework would have to include acceptance of the "1992 consensus"
reached between Taiwan and the mainland, and the proviso that any
changes to the Guidelines for National Reunification or any changes
in the current status quo would need the consent of the Taiwan
people. Expressions of goodwill without concrete action will not help
resolve the current stalemate, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE TO IMPLEMENT RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Air Force began
embracing the concept of risk management last year and is expected to
be fully compliant by 2004, Air Force Deputy Commander-in-Chief Lt.
Gen. Liu Kuei-lee said Thursday.</P>
      <P>He added that air safety has been vastly improved since the air
force brought in the concept from the civilian sector.</P>
      <P>From this month, civilian aeronautics risk analysts working for
Eva Airways and China Airlines have been lecturing at various air
force bases to drill in the concept, he went on.</P>
      <P>Cooperating with the Republic of China Risk Management
Association to train analysts and establish a system of official
certification, the air force plans to have its first risk management
analyst by November this year, said Liu.</P>
      <P>The Air Force Academy's Air Safety Institute will become the
nation's only educational institution conferring accredited air
safety risk management certification following approval from related
government agencies, he said.</P>
      <P>Air Force General Headquarters Air Safety Division Chief Col.
Ching Ping-ho said that the new risk management policy is initially
aimed at flight personnel but will be extended to cover maintenance
and ground crews, flight control, as well as high-echelon staff units
throughout the service.</P>
      <P>Ching said that risk assessment procedures are followed before
every flight, involving the evaluation of the physical and mental
condition of personnel, aircraft condition, airfield conditions,
weather conditions, personnel ability levels and training course
difficulty levels.</P>
      <P>High risk factors are pinpointed and flight supervision officers
alerted to a precisely calculated risk index for each particular
mission, he added.</P>
      <P>Risk prevention and possible response measures are also outlined
during the risk assessment process to allow for necessary actions to
be taken immediately at appropriate moments, Ching said.</P>
      <P>Training for air force risk analysts has already begun, he
continued, adding that the army and the navy's flight and maintenance
personnel will be invited to attend the courses if there are
sufficient openings.</P>

unrealistic expectations.</P>

have not been active enough since the inauguration of President Chen
Shui-bian, especially when compared with the exchanges conducted
during the previous Kuomintang governments.</P>

exchanges with Japan with "a fresh mood," so as to promote mutual

    <HEADLINE>REMOVAL OF STRANDED FREIGHTER WILL TAKE AT LEAST 2 MONTHS: MOTC</HEADLINE>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It will take at least two months to remove
the Greek freighter "Amorgos," which has been grounded off the
southeastern tip of Taiwan for the past month, sources with the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting called to discuss the removal of the freighter, MOTC
officials instructed the Hualien Port Authority to demand the
shipowner to come up with a removal plan within a week, the MOTC
sources said.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-guey, director of the MOTC's Navigation and Aviation
Department, said that after communications with the shipowner's
insurer, the insurer had agreed to remove the 35,000-ton freighter
that has leaked a large quantity of fuel oil, polluting the waters
and areas of shoreline in the Lungkeng nature preserve.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has also insisted that the body of the ship should be
sunk in at least 200 meters of water and at least three nautical
miles away from the coastline. The vessel must not compromise the
safety of maritime traffic in the area and there must be the minimum
impact on the environment and ecology of the area.</P>
      <P>Prior to the removal, the shipowner must also clean up the
remaining 200 tons of fuel oil and the ship's cargo of iron ore, the
MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>Presently, the insurance company is preparing to invite
international tenders for the removal operation, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged domestic
manufacturers to promote their own brands and expertise overseas to
increase trade opportunities when he addressed the opening of the 2nd
Taipei International Chain &amp; Franchise Exhibition on Friday.</P>
      <P>More than 110 local and foreign manufacturers are taking part in
the 4-day exhibition, which is being sponsored by the Association of
Franchise Promotion of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that the economy is Taiwan's lifeline and
that the exhibition is significant in that it offers local and
foreign manufacturers the opportunity to exchange information and
provides those who want to start a business with comprehensive
information.</P>
      <P>He said that through the guidance of brand name manufacturers,
franchise and chain stores can cut starting costs and management
risks, creating a win-win situation for both the manufacturers and
the chain and franchise stores.</P>
      <P>Manufactures from Singapore, Hong Kong, the United States,
Malaysia and Indonesia have also been invited to take part in the
exhibition to share their experiences regarding business trends and
the business environment of chain and franchise stores around the
world.</P>
      <P>As chain and franchise stores have been operating in Taiwan for
more than 10 years, many manufactures have said that expansion may
have reached its limits and that they want to make inroads in the
mainland Chinese market. The sponsor has therefore provided
information on opening chain and franchise stores on the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER PITCHES FOR DIRECT AIRLINKS WITH RUSSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Chang Hung-kwang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opening of direct airlinks is the top
policy goal of the Republic of China's current diplomatic work with
Russia, ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said in a recent interview
with a Russian newspaper.</P>
      <P>The interview, conducted by the Nezavisimaja (Independence) daily
reporter Dmitry Kosyrev last December in Taipei, was published in the
paper's Wednesday issue.</P>
      <P>Tien said in the interview that Russian President Vladimir
Putin's pragmatic diplomacy complies with the basic spirit of
the ROC's diplomatic policy.</P>
      <P>The minister recognized that Taiwan-Russian exchanges and
cooperation in trade, economic, cultural, news, sports and arts
fields have made progress since the two countries began to forge
substantive ties seven years ago.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tien said, the bilateral relationship still faces
serious restrictions under Russia's rigid "one China" policy, which
recognizes Beijing and bans official contacts with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that several mutually beneficial exchanges
have been hampered by Russian's "one China" policy. "I'm hopeful
that the two countries can work together to overcome current
difficulties."</P>
      <P>The minister went on to say that the two sides should place
their short-term goal on opening direct flight services between
the two countries to facilitate commercial and tourist exchanges.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tien said he hopes that Russia can give positive
response to Taiwan's call for signing bilateral agreements on
investment protection and exemption of double taxation on investors
to boost investment and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tien said the ROC looks forward to forging a framework
for regular dialogue to lay a legal basis for upgrading bilateral
economic cooperation on a reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>Tien also urged Russia to lift its ban on the exchanges of
visits by high-ranking officials from both sides. "By so doing,
we'll be able to remove a great barrier to enhancing mutual
understanding and create a better climate for bilateral
cooperation," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  15  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's envoy to
Washington on Thursday played down the significance of the position
that the United States has taken regarding a scheduled port call by a
ROC Navy flotilla to a U.S. ally in the Pacific.</P>
      <P>Apparently bowing to pressure from Beijing, the United States has
asked the government of the Marshall Islands not to allow the
three-ship flotilla to make a scheduled visit to that country.</P>
      <P>Chien-Jen Chen, Taipei's chief representative to the United
States, disputed a press report describing the move as an
"unfriendly" gesture toward Taiwan on the part of the Bush
administration. He added that the U.S. position is in no way
connected to on-going considerations about arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He described the Bush administration's attitude toward Taiwan as
"fundamentally friendly "</P>
      <P>Chen also said that, under the security arrangement between the
United States and the Marshall Islands, the United States can have
its say on port visits by foreign military vessels to the island
nation.</P>
      <P>He added however that whether the ships do make the visit will
ultimately depend on the position of the governments of both Taiwan
and the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a State Department official said that the
United States does not view such visits "as consistent with our
unofficial relations with Taiwan and with our responsibilities" under
the terms of the Compact of Free Association between the United
States and the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>"We have conveyed our views to the Marshall Islands government,"

    <HEADLINE>FIRST STAGE OF LUNGKENG SHORE CLEANUP COMPLETED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtong, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first stage of the cleanup of the oil
spill that has contaminated parts of the Lungkeng Ecological
Conservation Preservation Area in southern Taiwan was completed
Friday with the help of the Republic of China Army.</P>
      <P>The first stage of the cleanup was completed at noon, with 6,395
soldiers and local cleanup workers involved in the task. A total of
404.6 tons of oil has been collected to date.</P>
      <P>At least 1,150 tons of oil has leaked from the sunken Greek
freighter M.V. Amorgos into waters near the coast of Kenting National
Park in southern Taiwan since the ship ran aground Jan. 14.</P>
      <P>Lin Jun-yi, head of the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA), said the first stage of the cleanup was directed at
contaminated waters within the coastal cave area.</P>
      <P>He said that the waters in the area have been made much cleaner
by the efforts but added that there is still a chance that small
amounts of oil floating on the water's surface might end up on the
shore or become affixed to the area's coral reefs.</P>
      <P>The second stage of the cleanup work will begin immediately after
Lin meets with experts and scholars at 11 a.m. Saturday to talk about
the technical problems regarding further cleanup efforts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said during a press conference Friday morning that
the Coast Guard and Command Administration, the Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau and a fishery association investigated the southern bay area
immediately after a reported sighting of oil in the area.</P>
      <P>However, no oil pollution was found, Lin confirmed. Fishermen
working the area also said that oil has not polluted the southern bay
area.</P>
      <P>The chairman and deputy chairman of the fishery association in
the Pingtong region, Chu Ping-ho and Wu Chin-hui, also reiterated
that the southern bay area has not been contaminated at all and that
an oil-blocking apparatus has been built in the waters of Oluanpi.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the National Museum of Marine Biology and
Aquarium, the National Pingtong Technology University, and the Whale
and Dolphin Association carried out an autopsy on a Fraser's dolphin
found dead on the coast near Lungkeng on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Biologists said that the cause of the dolphin's death was heart
disease that led to lethal liver and lung illnesses. The animal's
respiratory and digestive systems were not contaminated by oil, they
stressed, adding that the dolphin had already died before being
washed ashore near Lungkeng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. PRESIDENT'S LETTER DOES NOT TOUCH ON ARMS SALES: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China Presidential Office
official denied Friday a local media report that U.S. President
George W. Bush touched on the sensitive arms sales issue in a recent
letter to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The official said Chen did not mention any weapons issues in a
personal letter he sent to Bush on the new U.S. president's inaugural
day.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, why would Bush touch on this topic in his
return letter?" the official asked.</P>
      <P>Chen asked Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to forward a
congratulatory letter to Bush when Wang attended the Bush
inauguration ceremony in Washington, D.C. Jan. 20 on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Previous reports said Chen had expressed hope in his letter that
the United States would sell advanced Aegis-class frigates to Taiwan
to help upgrade its defense capabilities, while a Friday media report
said Bush sent a "thank you" letter to Chen recently expressing U.S.
goodwill in its arms sales policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"All those reports are wrong," the Presidential Office official
said, adding: "President Chen was unlikely to mention the arms sales
issue in his letter in the first place."</P>
      <P>Sources said Chen only expressed his hope that the United States
can continue helping to maintain Taiwan Strait security in line with
the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, Bush sent a personal letter to Chen
last week via the Taipei office of the American Institute in Taiwan,
which represents U.S. interests in the Republic of China in the
absence of official ties. In his letter, the sources said, Bush
reaffirmed America's security commitment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sources further said Bush did not mention U.S. expectations
regarding the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait. He
only reaffirmed the U.S. friendship and commitment to Taiwan,
according to the sources.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung visited the
Legislative Yuan Friday and presented 17 bills, including a
referendum bill, that he hopes the legislature will put on a priority
list for review.</P>
      <P>Chang called on the legislature and caucuses of every political
party in preparation for his administrative report to the legislature
Feb. 20, when the new legislative session opens.</P>
      <P>This was also his first visit since the executive and legislative
yuans ended their three-month standoff over the Executive Yuan's
abrupt decision to scrap the partially completed fourth nuclear power
plant.</P>
      <P>The premier announced the restarting of construction of the plant
Wednesday, saying that although the establishment of "a nuclear-free
homeland" is his unswerving goal, he had made the "painful decision"
to continue with construction in consideration of national stability.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that although he is premier, he has to face the
fact that he heads a minority government in the legislature, and
expressed the hope that cooperation will replace confrontation to
move Taiwan toward a more mature democracy.</P>
      <P>He presented the 17 bills, including the referendum bill, deposit
insurance regulations, a public debt bill, a revised criminal code,
and revised corruption regulations, in the hope that the legislature
will give them top priority in review.</P>
      <P>This will help the Executive Yuan to push for economic reforms,
expand domestic demand and help develop the national economy, Chang
said, adding that without the cooperation and support of the
legislature, the Cabinet will find its hands tied.</P>
      <P>He also defended the introduction of the referendum bill, saying
that only referendums can solve major policy rows over issues such as
the construction of a controversial reservoir in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For his part, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said that
he hopes Chang will stick to his decision, however painful, adding

    <HEADLINE>NO CHANGE IN ROC FLOTILLA PORT CALL TO MARSHALL ISLANDS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday that a Republic of China naval flotilla's plan to visit the
Marshall Islands in the Pacific remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director of MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, made the remarks after the U.S. Department of State
confirmed Thursday that it had asked the Marshall Islands to reject
an ROC flotilla's scheduled port call in May.</P>
      <P>Shih told a routine news conference that the Marshall Islands has
invited the ROC flotilla to take part in its May 1 Constitution Day
celebrations in line with a practice set last year.</P>
      <P>"The Marshall Islands has so far not changed its stance," Shih
said, adding that the ROC flotilla therefore has no plans to change
the schedule of the trip.</P>
      <P>Shih said the Marshall Islands is negotiating the issue with the
United States. According to the U.S.-Marshall Islands Compact of Free
Association signed in 1986, the United States can veto any of the
Pacific island nation's foreign affairs actions that "conflicts with
U.S. security interests."</P>
      <P>Shih said the ROC is not in a position to comment on relations
and agreements between the Marshall Islands and the United States,
but added that the ROC representative office in Washington, D.C. is
explaining the issue to relevant U.S. authorities.</P>
      <P>The ROC flotilla, made up of two frigates and a supply ship
crewed by 380 officers, sailors and Navy Academy cadets, left
southern Taiwan Feb. 5 for a personnel training voyage that would see
it make goodwill port calls to seven of the ROC's diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Military sources said the flotilla visited the South Pacific
island nation of Palau Feb. 10-12 and is presently on its way to
several ROC allies in Central America, inclduing Saint Vincent and
the Grenadies, the Dominican Republic, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras
and El Salvador.</P>
      <P>A total of five South Pacific nations have signed the Compact of
Free Association with the United States, and two of them -- Palau and
the Marshall Islands -- maintain formal diplomatic ties with the ROC.</P>
      <P>Shih would not speculate as to why the United States opposed the
ROC flotilla's planned port call to the Marshall Islands after the
visit to Palau went off without a hitch.</P>
      <P>Shih instead said that the ROC had communicated with U.S. and
Palau authorities through similar procedures and channels before the
flotilla visited Palau.</P>
      <P>The ROC established formal diplomatic ties with the Marshall
Islands in 1998. Last year, the ROC Navy included the island nation
on the itinerary of its annual goodwill flotilla visit for the first
time.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the ROC flotilla also made port calls to the Solomon
Islands, ASEAN nations and several Central American allies.</P>
      <P>According to an AFP report, Foreign Minister Alvin Jacklick of
the Marshall Islands said Thursday that he noticed Wanshington had
come under pressure from Beijing following last year's visit. The
report said Jacklick hopes the United States will reconsider its
position.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou was enraged
Friday by a sharp rise in the city's traffic accidents and resultant
human casualties last year.</P>
      <P>Ma, who had just concluded a high-profile visit to Hong Kong,
said he felt uneasy comparing Taipei's traffic accident rate with
that of Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"While Hong Kong's population is 2.5 times Taipei's, its traffic
death toll is only 1.5 times that of Taipei," a frustrated Ma said,
adding that relevant city government agencies should complete an
overall review of the situation within one month.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the municipal traffic police
squad, a total of 181 serious traffic accidents were reported in
2000, marking an increase of 17 cases from the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>The tallies also show that 124 people were killed and 67 others
critically injured in all those cases. The number of deaths increased
by 17 from the 1999 level and the number of those critically injured
increased by two.</P>
      <P>Drunk driving and driver negligence were the main causes of
traffic accidents reported last year, municipal officials said,
adding that the most accident-prone vehicles were bicycles and heavy
trucks.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was "outraged" at the high traffic casualty rate in
Taipei. "We must take immediate steps to improve the situation," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>The Harvard-educated mayor further said he feels unease whenever
he thinks that Taipei is lagging behind Hong Kong and even mainland
China's Shanghai in terms of urban development and administrative
efficiency.</P>
      <P>"It takes only a year or two to build a skyscraper in Hong Kong,
while it took us 10 years to complete the Taipei City Hall building.
We must brace up, otherwise, we'll lose our niche in the increasingly
competitive global market," Ma warned.</P>

      <P>Two reporters from mainland China's
official Xinhua News Agency paid a visit to Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin Friday to discuss some issues
related to cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Fan Liqing and Chen Binhua, the
first batch of mainland journalists allowed to stay in Taiwan for up
to one month for news coverage, has visited the MAC, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>After their brief meeting, Fan and Chen attended an MAC routine
news conference, chaired by Lin.</P>
      <P>Both Fan and Chen questioned Lin about the Republic of
China's plan to open its door for sightseeing tours by mainland
people later this year.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said the ROC government is actively
preparing for the new "open-door" policy and expects to implement
the new measure around late June.</P>
      <P>In reply to other inquiries, Lin reaffirmed the ROC new
government's stance on pushing for resumption of cross-strait
dialogue without any strings and its desire to promote cross-strait
exchanges and cooperation in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Lin also stressed that the Beijing-proposed "one country, two
systems" is a hard sell in Taiwan at the moment as a number of
public opinion polls indicated that 80 percent to 90 percent of
local people oppose such a unification scheme.</P>
      <P>The two Xinhua reporters arrived in Taipei last Thursday for

    <HEADLINE>OVERDUE LOANS AMOUNT TO US$ 23.87 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Overdue loans of domestic banks climbed to
NT$773.5 billion (US$23.87 billion) as of the end of December,
setting a new record high, the Central Bank of China (CBC) announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said that as of December, domestic banks recorded
total loans of NT$14.47 trillion, with overdue loans totaling
NT$773.5 billion for an average of 5.34 percent, the first drop since
December 1999.</P>
      <P>Statistics show the highest ratio of overdue loans -- 22.3
percent -- in the private manufacturing industry, followed by 12
percent in the private business sector, 10 percent in the private
construction industry, 44.6 percent among individual accounts and
11.1 percent in sectors outwith these areas.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the 0.02 percentage point decrease in
the ratio of overdue loans in December from September to the fact
that the increase of overall loans exceeded that of overdue loans.</P>
      <P>The overall loans of domestic banks in December grew by 3.31 
percent from September, mainly because of increased government
borrowing and an increase in loans extended to major private
investment projects.</P>
      <P>The value of overdue loans in December grew by 3 percent from
September because of the poor business and financial strains of
manufacturers, a continued rise in unemployment and the decreased
debt performing ability on the part of individuals, which, together
with banks' difficulty in disposing of collateral, slowed the pace of
debt repayment.</P>
      <P>The CBC estimated that domestic banks wrote off bad loans
totaling NT$292.6 billion (US$90.3 billion) over the past two years,
which breaks down to NT$136.3 billion in 2000 and NT$156.3 billion in
1999.</P>
      <P>CBC officials said that with the end of the protracted standoff
between the legislature and executive over the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant, they hope continued development of the
economy and reassured public confidence will improve debt repayment
ability, further cutting the bad loan ratio.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER DEFENDS ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Richard V. Allen, a former U.S. national
security adviser, said Thursday at a panel discussion on U.S. foreign
policy that President George W. Bush should agree in April arms talks
to sell advanced defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Allen urged Bush to handle the issue according to the security
commitments outlined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which
specifically mandates the United States to provide Taiwan with arms
of a defensive character.</P>
      <P>In over 100 minutes of intense discussion organized by the
Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank,
Washington-Beijing and Taipei-Beijing relations received particular
attention from the panel, which also included former U.S. national
security advisers Henry Kissinger, Robert C. McFarlane and Brent
Scowcroft.</P>
      <P>Allen denied panel moderator Richard Holbrooke's charge that his
vocal support for arms sales to Taiwan was overly provocative and
controversial. Holbrooke is a former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>Allen said that he was not trying to trigger a Taipei-Beijing
conflict or escalate tensions but rather to promote a peaceful
resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait issues while at the same time
maintaining a policy of constructive relations between Washington and
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He added that the Bush administration should carefully assess
mainland China's long-range objectives and come up with new policy
conclusions. However, the current policy does not necessarily need to
be changed, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kissinger, who is also a former secretary of state,
said that the Taiwan issue will be one of the major issues facing the
Bush administration. He added that Bush should adhere to the two key
principles that the past six U.S. presidents have followed -- support
for the "one China" policy and insistence on the peaceful resolution
of any cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Scowcroft, who served in the Ford and Bush administrations, said
that the Asia Pacific region is a potentially unstable area, and that
the United States should continue to maintain troops in Japan and
South Korea to ensure regional security.</P>
      <P>Over 100 participants, including former Assistant Secretary of
State for Asia Pacific Affairs Winston Lord, attended the discussion.

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
he hopes a military procurement meeting with the United States
scheduled for April will make some breakthroughs.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received former U.S.
Congressman Stephen Solaz at the Presidential Office for an exchange
of views on the situation in the Taiwan Strait, ROC-U.S. relations
and military procurement.</P>
      <P>The ROC has requested to buy Aegis-equipped destroyers from the
United States, but has faced pressure from mainland China, with
mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen reportedly hoping to prevent such
procurement from taking place when he visits the United States in
March.</P>
      <P>The president said he is confident of upgrading the substantive
relations between Taipei and Washington, noting that U.S. President
George W. Bush has maintained good relations with the ROC since his
inauguration Jan. 20.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he hopes the United States will realize that
Taiwan is a "major fortress of the free world in East Asia" and a
force to maintain peace, stability and security in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also an important link in the strategic concept of the
United States in East Asia, Chen continued, expressing the hope that
Washington will continue to help maintain peace and security in
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that sophisticated defensive weapons are crucial to
safeguarding Taiwan democracy and maintaining peace in the Taiwan
Strait, and that U.S. arms sale to Taiwan are important.</P>
      <P>The president again offered goodwill toward Beijing and expressed
hope that both sides could resume cross-strait dialogue and engage in
talks on issues such as the "mini three links" between Taiwan's
offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland, or the full
direct trade, postal and transport links between the mainland and
Taiwan proper.</P>
      <P>He said that if cross-strait relations are smooth, it will help
the safety and stability of the Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>It was the second day in a row that Chen had received former U.S.
officials and congressmen to express his concern about military
procurement.</P>
      <P>He met a day earlier with Stanley Roth, a former U. S. assistant

      <P>The officials said that although President Chen has not been
officially notified of the award by London-based organization Liberal
International, the president still feels deeply honored by the
organization's decision.</P>
      <P>The Executive Committee of Liberal International recently decided
to bestow its 2001 Prize for Freedom on Chen during a meeting slated
for November 9-10 in Copenhagen, Denmark. The organization will grant
Chen the award for having risked his personal safety in the pursuit
of greater freedom for the nation and its people.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the president considers the award to
be a recognition of the Taiwan people's determination to strive for
freedom and democracy, rather than praise for him personally.</P>
      <P>Liberal International President Annemie Neyts is expected to
travel to Taiwan to present the award to Chen, as the Republic of
China president may not be able to attend the November meeting in
Copenhagen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE ECONOMICS MINISTER RETURNS FROM MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Upon his return from a 12-day visit to
mainland China Friday, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yiin Chii-ming
said that conditions are ripe for Taiwan and mainland industries to
create a win-win situation through cooperative efforts.</P>
      <P>Yiin, who is in charge of Taiwan's industrial policy, said that
mainland China has the advantage of massive resources and a huge
market, in addition to a government that is willing to cooperate with
industries.</P>
      <P>The mainland has far more people and land than Taiwan, and
production costs are lower there as well, he continued.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has the capital, the technology, and a much more
liberal financial system with greater experience in the semiconductor
and other high-tech industries, said Yiin.</P>
      <P>Industries from the two sides can fill in each other's gaps to
create mutually beneficial relationships, he added.</P>
      <P>Yiin noted that Beijing has been purposely enticing Taiwan
businesses to set up manufacturing centers in the mainland through
generous offers of incentives.</P>
      <P>As a result, Taiwan-invested factories now dot the landscape, not
only in southern China's Shenzhen and Dongguan but also Shanghai,
with an increasing trend in high-tech investments, he said.</P>
      <P>Yiin's visit came at a time when the Economics Ministry's
adjustment plan for the existing "no haste, be patient" investment
policy toward mainland China is almost ready to be submitted to the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Attention has been focused on whether investment on upstream
petrochemicals and eight-inch wafer fabrication will be permitted in
the future on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Yiin said that the government's insistence on a "no haste, be
patient" policy in the past was the "correct" decision, as is the new
policy aimed at opening up the number of items allowed to be produced
on the mainland while tightening control of capital risk management.</P>
      <P>He added that he did not visit a Shanghai-based eight-inch wafer
foundry set up jointly by Winston Wang, the son of Taiwan tycoon Wang
Yung-ching, and Jiang Mianheng, son of mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, as rumored.</P>
      <P>The government initiated the "go slow, be patient" policy in 1996
under the rationale that Taiwan investment in mainland China had
become too feverish at a time when Beijing still harbored hostility
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, the government categorizes investment items
into allowed, case-by-case and prohibited categories. The new policy
is expected to cancel the "allowed" category, effectively allowing
all investments that are not listed in the "case-by-case" and
"prohibited" categories.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN DENIES IT WILL HOLD PLEBISCITE ON NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government denied Friday that Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung will announce a plebiscite on the fourth nuclear
plant by the end of the year to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Su Cheng-ping, director general of the Government Information
Office, told the press that Chang will call for lawmakers' support
for the enactment of a plebiscite law, but has no plan to hold a
plebiscite thus far for the fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>A plebiscite without legal basis is no other than a opinion
survey, which might be used to gauge public opinion, but is not
legally binding, said Su.</P>
      <P>He made the comments after a local press report said that Chang
would announce a plebiscite with or without a plebiscite law to calm
the backlash from his Democratic Progressive Party against the
administration's decision Wednesday to restart the construction of
the fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Noting that the controversial nuclear power plant has plagued the
government for two decades, Su said the bitter fighting between the
anti- and pro-nuclear camps would be in vain unless the country can
learn a lesson from it and enact a plebiscite law, which would enable
the voters to decide on controversial public projects.</P>
      <P>Chang announced the resumption of the fourth nuclear plant under
pressure from the opposition-controlled legislature, which holds the
project dear and was angered by the government's abrupt decision on
Oct. 27 to abolish it without consulting the legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2001 ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST AT 5.25%: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy may grow by just 5.25
percent or even lower this year, Lin Chuan, Director-General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the target of 5.25 percent can be achieved only if
the Legislative Yuan agrees to a budget increase of NT$111.5 billion
(US$3.48 billion), which includes NT$50 billion (US$1.56 billion) for
public construction projects.</P>
      <P>If the proposal of additional budget is denied by the
legislature, then the nation's economic growth might fall to as low
as between 4.85 percent and 4.75 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development forecast in
December that Taiwan's economy would grow by no less than 5.3 percent
in 2001, even though the government had not adopted stimulative
measures to increase domestic demand.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said that the downward adjustment was made in view
of last year's poor fourth quarter economy, which increased just 4.08
percent compared to the same quarter in 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, last year's poor economic performance can
be attributed to the slower global economy, as well as reduced
investment from major international computer companies. Taiwan's
manufacturing sector production growth rate slid to 2.7 percent
during the fourth quarter last year, while local investment shrank by
0.6 percent, according to DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, due to the unstable stock market and an increasing
unemployment rate, last year's private consumption rate grew by a
mere 3.8 percent, according to DGBAS figures.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, DGBAS officials anticipate that this year's gross
national product (GNP) will reach a record 10.46 trillion (US$323.5
billion), which translates into per capita GNP of US$14,516.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO PLAN FUTURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH `NEW VISION': PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that the new government will plan the nation's future
economic development with "a new vision."</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the previous ROC government's adoption of the "no
haste, be patient" policy restricting the ceiling on capital to be
invested by Taiwan investors in mainland China was due to the
prevalent factors of that time.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the imminent entry of Taiwan and the
mainland to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will result in lower
tariffs and duty, while the amount of capital being freely circulated
will deal a shock to the Taiwan's present economic order.</P>
      <P>The present government, therefore, will plan the nation's future
economic development with "a new vision" by positively implementing
market opening and effective management, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a keynote speech delivered at a seminar
titled "Emerging Markets, Emerging Technologies II - Asia: Fragile
Phoenix" jointly sponsored by the Intellibridge Corporation of the
United States, Bank SinoPac, the China Development Industrial Bank,
Taiwan Cellular Corp., Walsin Lihwa Corp., Yulon Group and Yung Shin
Securities.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan has emerged on the international
economic scene with excellent technology and product quality, and
information technology, following what he described as "the second
industrial revolution."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industry is facing the shock of the world's
technological progress in the new digital era, Chen said, adding that
finding ways to sustain new creativity and sharpness will become a
key factor in Taiwan's bid to develop superior competitiveness in the
world economy.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's role in the international arena, Chen said
that Taiwan will have to observe WTO rules once it is admitted into
the world trade regulatory body and join in the international
economic system. Facing international restrictions, Taiwan is unable
to take part in international organizations such as the United
Nations, he pointed out, adding that this will be a loss for both the
international community and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen further pointed out that as leader of an independent and
sovereign country, he has obligations and responsibilities to promote
Taiwan's international presence so as to upgrade Taiwan's
international profile.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ROC government will strengthen exchanges
with the international community based on its democracy, freedom,
human rights protection and economic and technological development
experience.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, former U.S. National Security Adviser to the
President Anthony Lake and former Assistant Secretary of State for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth have headlined the
discussions on technology in Asia and its impact on economic growth.</P>
      <P>China Development Industrial Bank President Benny Hu, Acer Inc.
Chairman and CEO Stan Shih, former South Korean Minister of Foreign
Affairs Yoo Chong-ha, former special adviser to the Japanese prime
minister Yukio Okamoto, former Deputy Assistant to the President of
the United States James B. Steinberg and former U.S. Congressman
Stephen Solarz, among other distinguished participants, led
discussions at the one-day seminar.</P>
      <P>The seminar brought together roughly 80 senior government,
business and academic leaders to examine the risks and opportunities
of the new economy in Asia, as well as the causes and implications of
the "digital divide." In one session, participants explored possible
scenarios relating to the Internet and how it is transforming
business and society in Asia, while another session focused on
technology, trade and impending accession to the WTO of the ROC and
mainland China.</P>

      <P>The output of Taiwan's information software

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Friday that he hopes the United States will help bring about a
dialogue between leaders in Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>While receiving former U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser
James Steinberg, Chen said that the best method to improve
cross-Taiwan Strait relations was through peaceful dialogue, and that
Taipei hopes to reopen negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The talks would be the beginning of consultations on issues such
as the opening of the two markets after both sides' World Trade
Organization accession and direct trade, postal and transport links
between Taiwan and mainland China, Chen added.</P>
      <P>However, Chen continued, the key to such an improvement does not
lie in a lack of sincerity or good will on the part of Taipei, but
rather on the lack of confidence on the part of Beijing.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he urged the United States to help build a bridge of
friendship and peace between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan security is not merely a local issue
but also a topic of common concern for all countries in the Asia
Pacific region, because of Taiwan's strategic location.</P>
      <P>The United States should continue to supply Taiwan with necessary
defensive weapons, not only to defend democracy and guarantee the
security of the Taiwan Strait, but also to protect U.S. interests in
the area, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that globalization is a worldwide trend that has
blurred the traditional boundaries between nations. In their place
are the universal values of peace and prosperity, he said, adding
that democratization and open markets are the correct and necessary
roads for every country to take.</P>
      <P>He said strong countries should assist insufficiently democratic
nations to implement political reform, and help countries with lower
living standards strive for prosperity. Chen said that the Republic
of China is very willing to provide such services and fulfill its
responsibilities as a member of international society.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the ROC government and its people have already
proved that they are not liabilities but assets, not "trouble

      <P>Prosecutors probing the scandal surrounding
the Navy's purchase of six French-made destroyers in 1991 have lifted
the overseas travel restriction they had imposed on former Chief of
General Staff Liu Ho-chien.</P>
      <P>Liu received a message to that effect on Feb. 5, sources close to
the retired admiral said.</P>
      <P>Liu was put under the travel restriction in last August, under
the suspicion of committing fraud while presiding over the purchase
of the six Lafayette frigates as armed forces chief.</P>
      <P>The admiral considered the prosecutors' ban a great insult to his
reputation and promised to commit suicide if found guilty of any
wrongdoing in the case.</P>
      <P>The fact that the investigators lifted the ban has vindicated his
claims of innocence, and Liu plans to travel to Australia and New
Zealand next month, said the sources. They added that the travel plan

      <P>The issuance of a new NT$2,000 note next
July will not trigger inflation, a financial official said Friday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay fears that the debut of the

inventories, has more to do with the amount of money circulating than
the denomination of bills, said Wu.</P>
      <P>As to the rate between the maximum denomination of the note and
the gross national product, all of Taiwan's NT$1,000 notes total just
0.24 percent of the nation's GNP, the second lowest percentage in the

      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
reiterated in a recent written report to the Senate Foreign Affairs
Committee that the U.S. government remains against public activities
by senior Republic of China officials during transit visits on U.S.

high-level ROC officials to stop over in U.S. cities en route to a

added.</P>
      <P>According to the same policy, the ROC officials may not meet

      <P>Analysts said that although the written report appears to
indicate that the Bush administration will not improve the treatment

    <HEADLINE>MORE AMERICANS HAVE GOOD OPINION OF TAIWAN: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  16 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More Americans have a good opinion of
Taiwan and fewer Americans are ill-disposed toward the country,
according to the results of a Gallup poll released Friday.</P>
      <P>The survey results indicate that 63 percent of the respondents
have a good opinion of Taiwan, compared with 47 percent in a similar
poll conducted in March last year.</P>
      <P>The same survey shows that 22 percent are ill-disposed toward
Taiwan, compared with 37 percent in March last year.</P>
      <P>The poll also reveals that 45 percent of those polled have a good
opinion of mainland China, compared with 35 percent last March, while
48 percent are ill-disposed toward the mainland, compared with 56
percent last March.</P>
      <P>During the Taiwan Strait crisis of March 1996, 59 percent of
respondents to a poll carried out at that time had a good opinion of
Taiwan, while 22 percent were ill-disposed toward Taiwan. Thirty-nine
percent had a good opinion of mainland China, while 51 percent were
ill-disposed toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by telephone, sampled 1,003 adult Americans
during the Feb. 1-4 period. It found that although many of those
polled had never traveled abroad, most of them expressed opinions on
the 26 countries covered by the poll.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, most of those surveyed most dislike Iraq
(85 percent), followed by Iran, Libya, Cuba, the Palestinian
authorities, Colombia, North Korea and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Canada is the country that most respondents favor (90 percent),
followed by Australia, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany,
Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Israel, the Philippines and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite only 6 percent of the respondents having an "extremely
good" opinion of Russia, at least 52 percent have a positive
impression toward the United States' arch enemy during the Cold War,
according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The error range of the poll was given as plus or minus 3 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH ADMINISTRATION URGED TO FACILITATE CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former State Department Spokesman Alan
D. Romberg said in a recent article on the Taiwan issue that the Bush
administration should go beyond publicly urging Taipei and Beijing to
seek "meaningful dialogue" by privately offering to facilitate it.</P>
      <P>Such a move would help the administration avoid the "trap of
mediation," Romberg wrote in the most recent newsletter published by
the Pacific Forum CSIS, the autonomous Pacific arm of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Pacific Forum CSIS
is headed by James A. Kelly, a possible candidate for the post of
assistant secretary of state in the Bush administration.</P>
      <P>Romberg, who is now a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson
Center, a Washington-based think tank, added that if Beijing
continues to refuse dialogue with Taipei while remaining set on its
course of military enhancement, pressure will build on the
administration to "do more" for Taiwan on arms sales and perhaps "in
other ways."</P>
      <P>Romberg advocated a balanced play of heeding mainland Chinese
Vice Premier Qian Qichen's warnings over the most sensitive arms
sales to Taipei while at the same time cautioning Beijing about its
arms buildup opposite Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This will allow the recent "positive signs" a chance to mature,
he added, referring to Qian's claim that "anything can be discussed"
and Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's recent reference to
"a new mechanism for political integration."</P>
      <P>ROC opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan also proposed a
confederation as a way to break the current cross-Taiwan Strait
impasse, Romberg said.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, differences in interpretation over these
positions still exist, including Beijing's insistence on Taiwan's
acceptance of the "one China" principle before anything can be
discussed.</P>
      <P>Romberg suggested that if the two sides can begin a "quiet,
serious conversation" about these issues, Taipei and Beijing might
realize without compromising on principles that "what seems so
elusive today becomes more realistic tomorrow."</P>
      <P>He wrote: "In speaking of Taiwan's security at his confirmation
hearing, Secretary of State Colin Powell focused primarily on the
island's defense. That is understandable. But in the long run,
Taiwan's well-being will depend on how Taipei and Beijing manage
their political relationship."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF IRONICALLY DESCRIBED AS `NO. 1 ANTI-COMMUNIST FORTRESS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) has
become an "anti-communist fortress" because of Beijing's boycott of
it, a senior official of the quasi-official intermediary body said
cynically Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait relations sponsored
by the Taiwan Research Institute, SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan
Jyh-horng said mainland China has rejected applications by SEF
officials to travel to the mainland for goodwill exchanges and
consultations.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Jan went on, mainland officials in charge of
Taiwan-related affairs and staff members of the SEF's mainland
counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) -- are also unwilling to make any contacts with SEF
officials.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS were established in the early 1990s and
authorized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>"It is rather unreasonable that Beijing bans SEF-ARATS
interaction and rejects SEF staff visits to the mainland," said Jan,
who concurrently serves as director of the planning department of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy
toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Jan also criticized Beijing's refusal to have any contact with
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its eagerness
to court the island's main opposition parties -- the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>He pointed out that civilian exchanges have helped keep
cross-strait relations stable at a certain level over the past 13
years. "However, the quality of cross-strait exchanges have not been
upgraded along with the increase in exchange volume, due to Beijing's
hostility toward the Republic of China government," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing traditionally regards itself as the
"legitimate ruler of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu," Jan said this
hegemonic attitude has hindered the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
from forging mutual trust. "And mistrust has in turn prompted each
side to adopt every possible self-defense measure to protect itself
from being hurt by the other side," Jan lamented.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>EVA Airways Corp. will reduce the flight
time on the Taipei-Paris route from 16 hours to 11.5 hours from March
2, a representative announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>The representative said EVA will provide non-stop routes from
Taipei to Paris across Siberia, cutting 4.5 hours off the flying
time, in order to compete with other airline companies. The change
was made possible after Russia reached an agreement with Taiwan after
years of negotiations to allow EVA flights to cross its air space.</P>
      <P>EVA has been operating three flights a week between Taipei and
Paris with a one-hour fueling stop in Dubai since November 1993. The
long flights have not only resulted in customer complaints but have
also added extra costs to the company.</P>
      <P>The EVA representative said that other flights of the company

    <HEADLINE>PROTECTED JACANAS WINTERING IN TAINAN COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan   County,   Feb.   17   (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 10 protected
pheasant-tailed jacanas are presently spending the winter in Taiwan's
first jacana preservation area in Tainan County, according to Bureau
of Agriculture officials.</P>
      <P>The officials said the bureau will adjust the water level in the
preservation area in order to bring in more jacanas and to prevent an
invasion of black-winged stilts, a common wading bird that competes
with the jacana for food but requires slightly different water levels
to thrive.</P>
      <P>The county government set aside a 15-acre plot of land in 1999 as
a base for the jacana preservation area in Kuantien, Tainan County,
in order to ensure that the ecology of the area will not be damaged
when the high speed railway system project begins operations.</P>
      <P>According to data released by the county government's
agricultural bureau, a total of 50 to 60 pheasant-tailed jacanas have
taken up residence in Tainan's Shinying, Shiaying and Kuantien areas.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian visited the preservation area with an
animal preservation expert last year and said at the time he would
like to make a second visit to see the progress made by the county
government in preservation and protection work regarding the jacanas,

    <HEADLINE>DPP, INDEPENDENT LEGISLATORS ADVOCATE REFERENDUM OVER NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   17  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators Lee Wen-chung and Cho Jung-tai and independent lawmaker
Jao Yung-ching advocated Saturday the passage of a referendum bill to
allow for the public to decide on the future of the fourth nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, Lee said that the
DPP can negotiate with the opposition parties over three major issues
related to the referendum bill:</P>
      <P>-- The possibility of specifying an exemption clause to prevent
the bill from being used to put the independence-unification issue to
a vote;</P>
      <P>-- The required number of public signatures and percentage of
legislator approval before the bill can be proposed, deliberated and
passed; and</P>
      <P>-- The restriction that a referendum should be held in
conjunction with an existing election in order to lower social costs
and to prevent such plebiscites from becoming a tool for individual
parties to carry out their agenda and interests.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jao claimed at the same press conference that former
Premier Tang Fei, an opposition Kuomintang stalwart, was also in
support of putting the nuclear power plant issue to a public vote.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tang's successor Premier Chang Chung-hsiung's
unilateral decision to scrap the partially completed plant soon after
taking office last October, Jao said that Chang's new DPP
administration had miscalculated and thought that executive powers
could overrule "everything else."</P>
      <P>Jao went on to say that the entire nuclear plant issue has become
too political. He suggested returning to rational evaluations on the
policy level and then allowing the people to decide on the fate of
the plant.</P>
      <P>He urged the administration to "let go" and all other parties to
stop commenting on the issue so that the people can have a chance to
discover enough about the "real truth" behind nuclear power and its
global trends to engage in rational discussion.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether a referendum over the issue or any other legal
means may be retrospectively applied to the fourth nuclear power
plant, which has already gone through years of reassessment, Jao said
that it is "ridiculous" to say the results of a referendum cannot be
applied to an ongoing project.</P>
      <P>The controversial power plant has gone through budget freezes, a
three-month suspension in its construction since October, and
ultimately a Grand Justice ruling followed by subsequent
executive-legislative negotiations that led to an announcement
Wednesday that construction would resume after necessary
reassessments are completed.</P>
      <P>Anti-nuclear activists and lawmakers have since called for a
referendum to be held at the end of the year, while others have
declared that an unofficial referendum may be held in the event that
the referendum bill cannot be readied in time.</P>
      <P>However, Jao said that such an unofficial vote for advisory
purposes would be "meaningless" because public participation in the
vote would be low and it would not be legally binding.</P>
      <P>Jao's position on the inadvisability of carrying out such an
unofficial vote was seconded by DPP Policy Committee Director Shen
Fu-hsiung, who said earlier in the day that the vote would not be
legally effective even if the anti-nuclear position won. He added
that if the DPP-backed position lost in the unofficial referendum,
anti-nuclear elements would only suffer greater defeat.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, claiming that if the referendum mechanism is not
established, the country would go through the same "time-consuming
and non-conclusive debates" every time a major issue of contention
arises, Cho urged the public to put more pressure on the opposition
alliance to ensure the passage of the referendum bill.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TZU CHI BONE MARROW DATABANK HELPS SAVE MAINLAND CHINESE STUDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Taiwan,  Feb.  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bone marrow donated by Taiwan's
Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation has helped save the
life of a mainland Chinese college student, Beijing's official Xinhua
News Agency reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Deng Shouning, a 24-year-old student at
the University of Chinese Medicine in Nanjing, who was afflicted with
the most critical type of leukemia, had passed the most dangerous
period after receiving a bone marrow transplant earlier this month
with Tzu Chi assistance.</P>
      <P>It was the 254th bone marrow transplant Tzu Chi has helped match
since the non-profit Buddhist organization established a databank in
October 1993, a foundation staff member said.</P>
      <P>"The databank has so far provided bone marrow for 109 transplant
operations in Taiwan and 143 similar cases abroad," the staff member
said, adding that more than one-third of the Tzu Chi-assisted
overseas transplants were performed in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He further said two more transplants with bone marrow provided by
Tzu Chi are scheduled to be conducted Feb. 21 in the mainland cities
of Hangzhou and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>According to the staff member, the Tzu Chi databank has collected
information about some 200,000 prospective bone marrow donors, making
it the third-largest of its kind in the world and also the world's
largest Chinese bone marrow databank.</P>
      <P>Since the Tzu Chi foundation, also Taiwan's largest charity,
introduced a DNA-based blood classification method, the staff member
said, the success rate for bone marrow matches and transplants has
increased significantly.</P>
      <P>"The transplant success rate at home and abroad has risen to 80
percent from the previous 40 percent," he went on, adding that the
number of volunteer donors has also increased steadily under the
promotion of the foundation's venerable founder, Master Cheng Yen.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan was stumping in Hsinchu Saturday, despite being the only
contender in the first direct election of the KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>At a "spring greeting" sponsored by the party's Hsinchu chapter,
Lien called for his party comrades in the Hsinchu area to stand
united to help the party carry out its current reforms.</P>
      <P>He also called for their support for his bid for the KMT
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the destiny of the KMT is inextricably linked
with that of the Republic of China. Therefore, he said, "we (KMT
members) bear the responsibility and driving power for the progress
of nation."</P>
      <P>In a thinly veiled criticism of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government of Chen Shui-bian, Lien said that the nation's
economic growth rate sharply declined from 7.9 percent in last year's
first quarter to 6 percent for the whole year. The Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development has readjusted the
projected economic growth rate for 2001 to 5.2 percent.</P>
      <P>He accused the government of using the international situation to
shirk its responsibilities, adding that the DPP should cease standing
by its established ideologies to administer the nation.</P>
      <P>Lien called on KMT members to vote him into the party
chairmanship March 24, and to vote for KMT-backed candidates in the
year-end legislative and county magistrate elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER ACCUSES GOVERNMENT OF APPROVING LEAKY GAS RESERVOIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party legislator Hsieh
Chang-chieh charged Saturday that the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
has illegally eased safety restrictions on two "leaky" natural gas
storage tanks for the benefit of the Japanese providers of the tanks.</P>
      <P>In response to Hsieh's charges, a CLA spokesman said in a press
conference that it was not trying to help Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
avoid having to pay compensation for the tanks, and that the entire
issue may have stemmed from a misunderstanding over the use of the
technical terms "leakage" -- which is a more serious problem -- and
"seepage."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said at a press conference that the previous administration
of former President Lee Teng-hui detected leaks during numerous tests
in two out of three China Petroleum Co. (CPC) natural gas storage
tanks in southern Taiwan since their completion in 1996.</P>
      <P>According to figures provided by Hsieh's office, one of the tanks
was discovered to have been leaking on four separate evaluations,
while the other did not meet safety requirements in 33 separate
evaluations.</P>
      <P>The CLA ruled later that year that the NT$9 billion (US$270
million) tanks would be designated as "approved" only when no leaks
were detected.</P>
      <P>However, the council went back on that position last December
when it told the court that "leaks may be permitted" and that the
tanks may be ruled fit for operation as long as the leaked gas
concentration does not exceed the lowest explosive limit of 25
percent.</P>
      <P>The CLA based its new safety requirements on European, U.S. and
Japanese standards, which allow the use of other gases to lower the
density of leaked natural gas, Hsieh said, adding that the contract
specifically calls for local laws to be implemented instead.</P>
      <P>Hsieh accused the CLA of ignoring public safety in order to
illegally save Mitsubishi a contract-stipulated compensation payment
of NT$12.8 billion (US$396 million) that CPC filed for in court last
year after four years of contention.</P>
      <P>Last November, Hsieh continued, the Control Yuan also formally
censured the CPC and the CLA by ruling that no leakage would be
allowed in the natural gas storage tanks.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Mitsubishi tried to lobby the CPC in a
high-level negotiation meeting Nov. 24 to urge the CLA to lower its
safety requirements, but CPC Chairman Chen Chao-wei refused.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED TO RESPECT ROC TO PAVE WAY FOR 'FUTURE ONE CHINA'</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The concept of "integration" pitched by
President Chen Shui-bian in his Lunar New Year's Eve message
was mainly aimed at signifying a process for the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the remarks at a seminar on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ultimate goal of President Chen's call for
promoting cross-strait integration is forging a new framework for
peaceful co-existence and co-prosperity of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the new framework will provide a 'common
ground' for cross-strait integration from the grass-roots level to
the upper class, from economic and social to political
spheres," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>He also urged Beijing to respect the Republic of China's
existence and its legitimate rights to wiggle in the international
arena. "Let's forge more cooperation and reduce confrontation so
that we can move toward our eventual goal of creating a 'future one
China.'"</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC's new Democratic Progressive Party-led
government has held out olive branch by adopting a series of
"open-door" measures, including opening direct "mini three links,"
preparing for direct "big three links," allowing mainland news
organizations to post reporters in Taiwan and legalizing sightseeing
trips by ordinary mainland people.</P>
      <P>"We hope mainland China can make goodwill response to foster
mutual trust," Chen said, adding that the goal of creating a "future
one China" cannot be realized with Taiwan's unilateral efforts and
need Beijing's cooperation. "Let's replace confrontation with
cooperation to pave the way for a 'future one China,'" he added.</P>

      <P>The establishment of a "common market" or
"Chinese economic community" mechanism would ensure peace in the
Taiwan Strait and promote the prosperity and stability of mainland
China, according to a group of scholars.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the statement Saturday at a public hearing held
by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on the elimination of obstacles to
the "three direct links" with mainland China and on ways to build a
cross-strait common market. The hearing was jointly presided over by
several KMT legislators.</P>
      <P>Some participating scholars said the three direct links will be
an inevitable subject for discussion between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The legislators urged that the "no haste, be patient" policy
toward investment in mainland China drawn up during KMT rule be
adjusted to suit the changing environment.</P>
      <P>They cited official statistics as indicating that Taiwan's trade
with mainland China in last year stood at around US$30 billion,
accounting for 11.2 percent of the island's overall foreign trade and
representing a trade surplus of US$18.27 billion in Taiwan's favor.</P>
      <P>They suggested that both Taipei and Beijing prepare for the
establishment of a "common market" mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, a high-ranking KMT official, criticized the
government of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for its
reluctance to accept the "one China" principle while implementing the
"mini three direct links" between the Taiwan-controlled islands of
Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland ports.</P>
      <P>Beijing insists that "one China" be an non-negotiable principle
upon which the resumption of cross-strait talks must be based, while
the DPP-led government claims that the "one China" is one of the
topics that can be discussed by both sides.</P>
      <P>Chang urged the government to take a pragmatic attitude toward
the direct three links by first revising economic and trade
regulations.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin Chih-hung of Tamkang University said that Taipei
and Beijing should forge a "Chinese economic community" formula to
pave the way for the creation of everlasting peace and prosperity
across the Taiwan Strait with the ultimate goal of China's
unification.</P>
      <P>The "three direct links" refer to direct trade, transport and
postal service between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD NOT BYPASS TAIWAN'S DPP GOVERNMENT: ROTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should deal directly with
the Republic of China's new Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government instead of bypassing it, a former senior U.S. official
said here Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs, made the remarks in a speech on the
delicate triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations, sponsored
by the Institute for National Policy Research, a local think
tank.</P>
      <P>Roth praised the "flexibility" and "pragmatism" of ROC President
Chen Shui-bian, saying Chen "deserves a tremendous amount of credit
for the steps he took and the steps he didn't take" on the volatile
cross-Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Before Chen was elected one year ago, many feared that he would
spark a war with mainland China because he had advocated Taiwan
independence. But Chen has greatly softened his position and has
offered a series of goodwill gestures to Beijing since he assumed
office last May.</P>
      <P>Roth said Beijing should not miss the opportunity offered by
Taiwan's transfer of power between from the Kuomintang to the DPP
and should forge direct contacts with the DPP administration.</P>
      <P>Roth further said it seems to him that the prospects for
cross-strait relations have become better than a year ago when
Beijing conducted military drills and made bellicose rhetoric to
intimidate Taiwan voters in the run-up to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Roth said Beijing has displayed new "flexibility" when
mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen said recently that
"both Taiwan and mainland China are part of China."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should take more active steps to improve
relations with mainland China. "Taiwan needs to concentrate on
cross-strait relations that are broken and need to be fixed," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Turning to ROC-U.S. relations, Roth said he disagreed with a
common view in Taiwan that the Clinton administration was "hostile"
to Taiwan's interests and that the new Bush administration
would be more friendly toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Roth reminded Taiwan of the "continuity" in U.S. policies toward
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, stressing that no matter who
controls the White House, policy continuity is a major concern of U.S.
policymakers.</P>
      <P>Roth went on to say that Taiwan should worry more about improving
relations with mainland China than with the United States because
ties with Washington are already "excellent.</P>
      <P>"I don't believe that U.S.-Taiwan relations are broken. I think
they are 'excellent,'" Roth said, adding that relations between
Taipei and Beijing are much more important now than U.S.-Taiwan ties.</P>
      <P>Roth declined to suggest ways the two rivals could settle their
differences. But he said the most important thing was having the
political will to solve the dispute, not finding the "magic
formula."</P>
      <P>According to Roth, the United States cannot play a go-between
in cross-strait relations. The people on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should work out their dispute themselves, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait ties are not a "zero-sum" game, Roth
said Taipei-Beijing ties would move in a positive direction so long
as Washington-Beijing ties and U.S.-Taipei ties are both in good
shape. Taipei couldn't benefit from deterioration of U.S.-mainland
China relations, he added.</P>
      <P>Roth arrived in Taipei Wednesday for a four-day visit. is the
first Clinton administration official to visit Taiwan since the
transition of power in the United States on Jan. 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MIGRANT WORKERS FIND SUNDAY RESPITE FROM DAILY GRIND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 17 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>You could be forgiven for thinking you are
in Manila when you pass by the Ching Kuang market and the Catholic
St. Christopher Church on Taipei's Chungshan North Road each Sunday,
for almost all the people you come across are Filipinos, chatting
with one another in English or Tagalog.</P>
      <P>Do not be misled, however, because you are still in Taipei and
the Filipinos thronging the streets and alleys are some of the many
migrant laborers working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government in Taipei opened its doors to foreign workers in
the early 1990's as living standards improved and local labor costs
skyrocketed making it harder and harder to find local people willing
to work as maids, family nurses or construction workers.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, there were 326,515 foreign
workers in Taiwan, representing the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand
and Vietnam, as of the end of December last year. Of these foreign
workers, more than 34,000 work in Taipei City, accounting for over
half the alien residents of the city, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Filipino workers make up the biggest single grouping of migrant
laborers and as citizens of a devoutly Catholic nation, many of them
go to Mass each Sunday.</P>
      <P>These Sunday church gatherings have become perhaps the most
important part of the week for Filipino workers in Taiwan. They
usually take advantage of the opportunity to exchange gossip,
information and meet newcomers from their home country after a week
of onerous household chores, nursing and construction work.</P>
      <P>The St. Christopher Church has long been a spiritual center for
the city's Filipino workers. Each Sunday morning sees hundreds of
them entering the church in turn to celebrate one of the five Masses
held each Sunday.</P>
      <P>After worshipping, they spend the rest of the day shopping,
eating, strolling along the streets or going on a picnic in the park
nearby, which translates into a lot of business turnovers for the
stores in the area.</P>
      <P>Another special phenomenon among the Filipino workers is that
unlike their Indonesian and Vietnamese counterparts, almost everyone
owns a cellular phone. "The phone is very cheap and I use it to
communicate with my friends. I usually use the prepaid cards," said
Ragmac, a young Filipino woman who gave only her family name.</P>
      <P>A grocery near the church that sells Filipino produce is always
crowded with Filipino workers on Sundays. In addition to selling
groceries, the shop assistants also help the workers deal with
remitting money and the mailing of goods to their hometowns.</P>
      <P>"In the early 1990's, these foreign workers used to cause us some
trouble," said Roger Yang, an official of the Taipei city
government's Foreign Workers' Counseling Center. "Nearby residents
often complained that the migrant laborers made too much noise and
relieved themselves in improper places each Sunday due to the lack of
public toilets in the neighborhood. After discussions, however, these
issues were solved," he added.</P>
      <P>With efforts by Taiwan's two special municipalities under the
directly jurisdiction of the Cabinet -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- as
well as by counties and cities under the jurisdiction of Taiwan
Provincial Government, foreign workers have recently begun to enjoy
sound protection of their rights and they are now also aware of the
channels to go through in order to file complaints, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Today, Taipei City, Kaohsiung City, and all provincial counties
and cities have set up foreign workers' counseling centers to provide
their charges with necessary assistance. In addition, the Taipei city
government published a "Cultural Map for Migrants" in December last
year.</P>
      <P>These measures provided by the government are helping foreign
workers to make the most of their Taiwan sojourn and are also helping
stave off the pangs of homesickness among these hardworking people so
far away from their loved ones.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'OLD GOVERNMENT' OUTSHINES 'NEW GOVERNMENT' IN APPROVAL RATING: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The previous Kuomintang (KMT) government
outshines the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
government in approval ratings, according to the results of a public
opinion poll released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,037 randomly selected adults residing
throughout the island, conducted by the non-profit 21st Century
Foundation from Jan. 17-20, found that the "old government" received
higher approval rating than the "new government" in nearly all major
policy fields, ranging from industrial, financial and banking
issues to cross-Taiwan Strait relations and labor affairs.</P>
      <P>Poll results show that party affiliation played a role in the
respondents' evaluation of the previous and present governments'
performances.</P>
      <P>Those who support the opposition KMT, the People First Party and
the New Party have given higher scores to the KMT government's
performance in all of the fields under study. In contrast, the
present government enjoys a far higher approval rating among pro-DPP
respondents.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, former economics and finance ministers
outpaced their successors in terms of approval ratings, but
the incumbent mainland affairs policy planner and top labor affairs
administrator outperformed their predecessors.</P>
      <P>Current Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi received a 20.7 percent
approval rating in the poll, less than half of his predecessor Wang
Chih-kang's approval rating.</P>
      <P>While only 10.4 percent of those interviewed said they
are satisfied with incumbent Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang's
performance, former Finance Minister Chiu Cheng-hsiung received a
29.1 percent approval rating in the same survey.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, incumbent Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen outshone her predecessor Su Chi, 39.4 percent vs. 25.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Labor Affairs Council Chairwoman Chen Chu enjoyed a
40.6 percent popularity rating, far higher than her predecessor Chan
Hou-sheng's 10.4 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA MAY BE ASKED TO MOVE MISSILES AWAY FROM TAIWAN STRAITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Washington Post wrote that the elements of U.S. policy
toward Communist China have remained constant since diplomatic
relations were established in the 1970s, but key Bush
administration officials have a markedly tougher tone on Beijing.</P>
      <P>The report said that the new roster includes Vice President Dick
Cheney's chief of staff and national security adviser, I. Lewis
Libby, who was general counsel to the Cox Committee. The committee
was a congressional panel chaired by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.)
which investigated alleged PRC theft of U.S. nuclear secrets.</P>
      <P>The Post said Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has assigned
Pentagon's strategic review to Andrew Marshall, who believes that the
United States must be better prepared for a possible war in Asia and
has drawn up hypothetical scenarios for war with Communist China.</P>
      <P>Paul D. Wolfowitz, the nominee for deputy defense
secretary, and Richard Armitage, deputy secretary of
state-designate, joined 21 other renowned conservatives in 1999
in recommending that Washington "declare unambiguously that it
will come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack or a
blockade," it added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has become a democracy, and that's inconvenient for
some," Armitage told an Asia Society meeting last year. "We look
at Taiwan not as a problem but as an opportunity to show that
democracy counts."</P>
      <P>The report said one possible goal for U.S. policymakers is
getting Beijing to move away the M9 and M11 missiles that are
deployed within range of Taiwan. A senior Defense Department
official pointed out that if Beijing learns how to make the
missiles more accurate, it would alter the cross-strait strategic
balance and justify new arms for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Trade is another area that might soon disrupt U.S.-PRC
relations, according to the Post. Although the Clinton
administration signed a trade agreement with Communist China last
year that paved the way for the latter's entry into the World
Trade Organization, Beijing has not yet join the WTO and bring
the agreement into force.</P>
      <P>National missile defense programs also loom large. Some Bush
administration officials want to include Beijing in negotiations
on arms control and missile defense, but others see Communist
China, which has been modernizing its two dozen nuclear missiles,
as a rogue state, not a cooperative power, said the report.</P>
      <P>"I tend to believe that it is not a good thing for a country
to seek to destroy 20 percent of America," one newly appointed
U.S. official was quoted as saying. "Do I have some understanding
of why they do? Yeah, but I don't have to like it," he added.

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SAID REVIEWING MILITARY EXCHANGE PROGRAM WITH PRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By  Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is learned that the United States has
quietly begun a review of its military exchange program with mainland
China and, pending the outcome of the review, all exchange activities
scheduled for this year will be suspended as of March 1.</P>
      <P>An informed source told the Central News Agency that Beijing has
been notified of the decision to suspend what remains on the schedule
for the current calendar year.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon has no immediate comments. An official reached by
the CNA would neither confirm nor deny that a review of the exchange
program with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is under way.</P>
      <P>The official said, however, that with "a new team" in place,
to have the original plan "re-validated" is "something to be expected
and anticipated". He was referring to the on-going transition after
the new administration was sworn in about a month ago.</P>
      <P>The game plan for military exchange activities for this year was
drafted during the last round of bilateral defense consultative talks,
which was held in Beijing last fall.</P>
      <P>Details of the plan has not been made public but the items are
believed to include ship visits and table-top exercises in joint
humanitarian efforts.</P>
      <P>The suspension came shortly after the new Secretary of Defense,
Donald Rumsfeld, ordered a review of U.S. strategic planning, but it
is not clear whether the suspension results directly from that
review.</P>
      <P>Elements within the U.S. defense establishment, many members of
Congress, and experts are skeptical about the benefits of military
exchanges with the PLA.</P>
      <P>They believe that, through the program, the PLA could learn how
to improve their war-fighting capabilities, thus posing greater
potential threats to the United States.</P>
      <P>Many have also complained that due to a lack of reciprocity, the
United States has not achieved the goal of increasing the
transparency of the PLA's modernization program.</P>

      <P>Taiwan plastics giant the Formosa Plastic
Group (FPG) has decided to set up a branch headquarters in Shanghai
to coordinate its increasing investments in mainland China.</P>
      <P>FPG Vice Chairman Wang Yung-tsai, who returned Friday from a
three-day trip to mainland China, was quoted by local press as saying
that the Shanghai headquarters is intended to integrate the mainland
subsidies of Formosa Plastics Corp., Nan Ya Plastics Corp. and
Formosa Chemicals &amp; Fiber Corp., the three major firms which
constitute the pillars of the conglomerate.</P>
      <P>The branch headquarters, which will also manage the group's
finance and personnel in mainland China, is an indication of the
group's determination to repeat in mainland its business success in
Taiwan and become a plastics giant in the mainland, according to the
local press.</P>
      <P>During his just-finished trip, Wang is reported to have sealed a
deal to set up a petrochemical industry zone on Meishan Island,
Zhejiang Province, including four polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plants, at
a cost of US$300 million.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the limitations imposed by the Taiwan
authorities on investment in the mainland, Taiwan firms cannot pump
more than 20 percent of their total assets into mainland projects,
which for FPG translates into some NT$18 billion (about US$600
million), said FPG sources.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  17  (CNA)
(By Jane Huang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three U.S. Congressmen urged the U.S.
government Saturday to continue providing Taiwan with necessary
defensive weapons in efforts to ensure peace and security in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>House representatives David Wu (D-Ore.), Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.)
and Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.) made the call in a two-hour meeting with
scores of local Chinese community leaders.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-born Wu, also the first ethnic Chinese member of the
U.S. House of Representatives, told CNA that finding ways to satisfy
Taiwan's defensive needs is a vital issue.</P>
      <P>Stressing his belief that it is correct for the U.S. government
to provide defensive weapons to Taiwan, Wu said that the Bush
Administration should approve this year's arms sales proposals to
Taiwan on a case-by-case basis and in compliance with the island's
actual needs, in a bilateral arms sales meeting held in April every
year.</P>
      <P>Calling the U.S. government's restrictions on Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian's meetings with ethnic Chinese and some U.S.
opinion leaders during a stopover in America last year "shameful," Wu
expressed his hope that a similar situation will not happen again and
that ROC officials will be able to travel to the United States
freely.</P>
      <P>"Increased people-to-people contacts will help dissolve bilateral
misunderstanding," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Crowley, who paid his first visit to Taiwan in November, told CNA
that he cast a vote for the passage of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) last year and voiced his clear support of
continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan when meeting with Chen and other
ranking ROC officials during his Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>Revealing that he and other congressmen are drafting a letter to
ask President George Bush to continue selling defensive arms to
Taiwan, Crowley said Washington's "one China" policy will not be
changed during Bush's tenure.</P>
      <P>As a free and democratic country, Taiwan should not be isolated
in the international community and the Bush Administration should
allow for more exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan in order to let
Taiwan's voice be heard, he added, urging Washington to ease
restrictions on visits by the two countries' officials to either
side.</P>
      <P>Meeks, who visited Taiwan for the first time in January, told CNA
that he was deeply impressed by Taiwan's outstanding political and
economic achievements.</P>
      <P>Noting that his recent Taiwan trip made him realize the
importance of supporting the TSEA, Meeks said the U.S. should help
safeguard Taiwan's security and interests free from mainland China's
military threats, and push for the resumption of negotiations between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>Regarding the issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, Meeks said he
backs sales of defensive weapons to Taiwan to help the island stand
up to mainland China's military intimidation.</P>
      <P>According to Meeks, the U.S. should engage with Taiwan and
mainland China at the same time in order to reduce the possibility of
potential conflicts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He also called on Washington to play the role of mediator across
the Taiwan Strait and to push the leaders on the two sides to sit

      <P>An agricultural official warned consumers
Sunday against buying pork from unlicensed abattoirs amid reports
that carcasses of ailing or deceased pigs were found in an
underground slaughterhouse in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In order to steer consumers away from potentially unsanitary
pork, Soong Hua-chung of the Council of Agriculture (COA) urged
customers to ensure that the pork they buy bears the benchmarks of
approval indicating that it comes from a licensed slaughterhouse and
has been cleared of harboring disease.</P>
      <P>Saying that the discovery of the illegal abattoir in Pingtung was
the result of a joint operation between the local government and the
COA, Soong said his council will continue its bid to wipe out the
underground abattoirs which are common across the island.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the COA has come a long way since it replaced the
Department of Health last June as the regulator overseeing the
sanitary conditions at slaughterhouses and has raised the number of
pigs butchered at legal abattoirs to 680,000 head per month from the
380,000 head at the time it took over its duties.</P>
      <P>Citing the Taipei metropolitan area as an example, Soong said
pigs handled by legal abattoirs have increased from a few hundred
head last June to about 4,000.</P>
      <P>Soong said it is local consumers' demand for fresh pork that gave
rise to illegal abattoirs turning out unrefrigerated pork.</P>
      <P>Owing to the crackdown by his office, Soong said that while there
are no longer any unlicensed abattoirs in Taipei, they are still
thriving in southern Taiwan.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Sunday that it keeps a close eye on Beijing's arms program and has
developed preemptive weapons, strategy and tactics to counter
Beijing's military building up.</P>
      <P>One day after a Japanese newspaper reported from Moscow that
Beijing has successfully tested its newly acquired Russia-made
Sunburn anti-ship missile, the MND said it is only natural for
Beijing to test its new weapons, but stressed that the public should
not panic over the issue.</P>
      <P>Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Lee Chieh said recently in an
interview that any weapon, no matter how advanced, has its
shortcomings and can be neutralized by weapons and strategy properly
designed to counter it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN TO PUT REFERENDUM BILL UP FOR PRIORITY REVIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has made the draft
referendum bill the first bill that the legislature will review in
its new session.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to spark another confrontation between the
legislative and executive branches after their row over the
construction of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant ended
after a three-month standoff.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan said that the bills that it hopes the
Legislative Yuan will put on its priority list for review will
include 17 bills in three categories.</P>
      <P>The first category concerns major policy and lists only the draft
referendum bill. The Executive Yuan said that to prevent the policy
making body from abusing its power and to solve the problem of
conflicts of interests during policy making process, it has aimed at
establishing a mechanism of public consultation and public
participation in policy making.</P>
      <P>The second category concerns the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's goal of cracking down on "black gold" and the "sunshine bill"
and lists seven bills, while the third category concerns the general
public and lists nine bills.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the central policy committee of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) began a two-day exchange of views Sunday on the
focus and priority of the bills in the new session and on the forging
of consensus within the party.</P>
      <P>The KMT plans to submit 50 bills for the new sessions this year,
but has excluded the referendum bill and the energy bill.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, KMT secretary-general, said that although the DPP
still would not admit defeat in the row over the fourth nuclear power
plant, the KMT will not allow the DPP to mix the plant with the
referendum, in order to avoid another disaster.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that the DPP, for the sake of soliciting the support
of voters who are opposed to nuclear power, announced the scrapping
of the nuclear power plant in late October at the expense of the
national interest.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also the vice
chairman of the KMT, said that the ruling party has exercised little
influence in the legislative process, adding that the legislature
passed 110 bills in the previous session, most of which were
orchestrated by the opposition alliance.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the ruling party has dwelled too much on details
and has failed to objectively observe the needs of the nation.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A forest fire erupted
again Sunday in Taiwan's central mountain range, prompting the
authorities to dispatch more than 40 firemen to extinguish the blaze.</P>
      <P>As the fire broke out in a remote, hard to reach area near the
Lishan village of Hoping Township within the Shei-Pa National Park,
the firefighters were taken to the site in three helicopter loads
mobilized by an air force rescue relief branch.</P>
      <P>Lin Yeong-fa, superintendent of the Shei-Pai National Park
Headquarters, said following an inspection tour aboard a helicopter
that about five hectares of woodland had been damaged and that more
firemen would join the battle later in the day as the wind was
picking up and fanning the conflagration.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the plants growing in the area destroyed by the
fire, the second in a week, were "weeds without economic value."</P>
      <P>A forest fire that raged earlier in the week on mountain slopes
opposite Lishan Village burned around 80 hectares of Formosan red
pine.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a mountain climber from Taipei turned himself in to
the police station in Hoping Township to confess that he caused the
forest fire while trying to light a fire at around noon that day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER CHAIRS MEETING ON IMPACT OF AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
called a meeting of Cabinet ministers Sunday to discuss possible
repercussions following last Friday's air strikes against Iraq by the
United States and Britain.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Su Cheng-ping told
reporters after the meeting that Chang asked the Foreign Ministry to
instruct ROC missions abroad to continue keeping a close watch on the
situation and to "assure the safety of Chinese residents overseas."</P>
      <P>According to Su, the premier foresees no significant impact on
the domestic stock market or oil prices and asked relevant government
institutions to study the necessary steps in case the stock and oil
prices should fluctuate abnormally.</P>
      <P>Chang also warned ROC citizens to pay more attention to their
safety when they travel to the Middle East.</P>
      <P>The ministers heard reports on the incident from the defense and
foreign ministries and came to the conclusion that the air attack was
mainly carried out to weaken Iraqi air-defense capabilities and that
"no further air raids" are foreseen.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said that the air strikes might
affect Taiwan's stock market for only a few days, but added that any
impact will be slight.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan said that
the incident will not affect Taiwan's air services to European
countries.</P>
      <P>Su said that the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) predicts
no significant effect on domestic oil prices, as CPC and Taiwan Power
Company have sufficient stores of crude oil.</P>
      <P>Central Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan said that all stock
markets are sensitive to military conflicts, but stressed that the
central bank will be able to stabilize the domestic stock market.</P>
      <P>Other Cabinet minister at the meeting included Vice Premier Lai
In-jaw, Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, Council for

    <HEADLINE>MAC STRESSES DEMOCRACY, PARITY FOR RESOLVING CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any solution to sovereignty dispute
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should comply with the
principles of democracy and parity, the Republic of China's top
mainland policy planner reaffirmed Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
made the remarks while meeting with visiting Paraguayan Vice
President Julio Cesar Franco Gomez.</P>
      <P>Tsai briefed Franco on the MAC's main functions and the ROC's
current policy on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait relations have been a major focus of
domestic and foreign attention since the inauguration of the ROC's
new government last May, Tsai said Taipei and Beijing face now face
many practical problems in the development of bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that all these issues can be settled through
peaceful dialogue and consultations," the soft-spoken mainland
policy planner said.</P>
      <P>Tsai further told Franco that the ROC government has never
suspended preparations for resuming cross-strait dialogue
unilaterally broken by Beijing in 1999 after former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui said cross-strait ties should be conducted on a "special
state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>Touching on the MAC's role, Tsai told her guest that the
MAC is the ROC's key agency handling cross-strait affairs. "In
addition to offering counsel to the premier in formulating policy
toward mainland China, the MAC also assists the president in
drafting policy guidelines for cross-strait affairs," she added.</P>
      <P>Franco, leading a nine-member delegation, arrived in Taipei
Saturday for a weeklong visit. This is his first trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After meeting with Franco, Tsai also answered a press inquiry
about the ROC's stance on opening direct trade, mail and transport
links with the mainland, commonly known as the "big three links."</P>
      <P>Tsai said the ROC will take steps to promote direct cross-strait
trade link after both sides of the Taiwan Strait are admitted into
the World Trade Organization (WTO). "We are hopeful that Beijing
resumes cross-strait dialogue as early as possible so that the two
sides can discuss concrete measures for opening direct commercial
exchanges," she added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a suggestion by ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Frank Hsieh that the direct "big three links" be
opened before the WTO entry, Tsai said she thinks what Hsieh means
is that if Taipei's and Beijing's WTO entries are delayed, Taiwan
can begin considering opening the "big three links" before WTO
accession.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has finalized negotiations concerning its WTO entry, but
Beijing has yet to work out several critical market opening issues to
qualify for its WTO accession. As most WTO members favor simultaneous
entry by Taipei and Beijing, Taiwan is still waiting for Beijing to
finalize its accession terms with its major trade partners.
Some optimistic observers said the two sides may be able to join the
world trade regulatory body in mid-2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IT DISTRIBUTORS AIM TO EXPAND INTO M'LAND MARKET</HEADLINE>

(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's information technology
distributors said Monday that they aim to expand their operations in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Although some IT distributors have already setup operations on
the mainland, they are still having difficulty implementing their
plan to develop multi-brand sales agencies in the market because of
mainland China's restrictive regulations, sources said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investments are presently confined to local assembly,
production, and the sale of products or services for the mainland's
IT jobbers, sources added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's IT distributors said that the IT market has the
potential for expansion after the island becomes a member of the
World Trade Organization and the deregulation of mainland China's IT
market is carried out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the IT distributors, Taiwan's personal
computer makers are focusing on promoting sales in mainland China and
India because of the high growth rates in those countries' PC user
populations. The mainland PC market's 30 percent annual growth rate
has stimulated investment in China by Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based Ability Enterprise and Aurora Corp. have reaped
profits from their investments in assembly, sales, and jobber agency
services on the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to Aurora Corp., the company's profits reached a level
of NT$60 million (US$1.87 million) for 2000. Aurora said that it will
increase its outlets on the mainland to 250 and focus on the
development of its digital products, such as calculators, electronic
translators and digital cameras.</P>
      <P>Ability Enterprise's liaison on the mainland, BVI Holding, had
profits totaling NT$279 million (US$8.71 million) for 2000. The
company said it predicts that 60 percent of its profits will come
from its branches on the mainland this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Synnex Tech. International Corp. and Hung Ko, two
other Taiwan-based IT companies, have also invested in mainland
China's IT market, sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE JOLTS TAIWAN BUT NO DAMAGE, CASUALTIES REPORTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi  County,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been rocked by an
earthquake five times over the past five days, but no damage nor
casualties have been reported, officials said.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau reported that the latest quake,
measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale, struck Tsaoling, Yunling County,
on Monday at 4:25 a.m., with its epicenter located about 5.2 km east
of the town.</P>
      <P>Tsaoling has been shaken by temblors five times since Feb. 14,
with each measuring over 4.0 on the Richter Scale.</P>
      <P>According to Tsaoling police, telecommunications and
transportation systems were functioning normally after the quake.
Police officers investigated local areas Monday morning and found no
potential dangers nor damage.</P>
      <P>Other areas jolted by the quake included the counties of Nantou,
Chiayi, Changhua, and Tainan.</P>
      <P>A professor from the National Chung Cheng University's Earthquake
Study Institute told the press that the latest temblor is related to
the major quake that struck Taiwan Sept. 21 1999. He added however
that the recent temblors have been the result of energy releases and
that there is no danger of serious harm to the island.</P>
      <P>The professor said more than a hundred temblors measuring over
4.0 on the Richter Scale strike the island each year.</P>
      <P>The devastating magnitude 7.3 quake that hit Sept. 21, 1999,
killed more than 30 people in Tsaoling and over 2,400 islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR URGES ROC GOV'T TO STEP UP ITS EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Republic of China
has to step up its efforts lest Taiwan fall behind mainland China in
terms of economic development and competitiveness, Cheng Chu-yuan,
professor of economics at Ball State University in Indiana, warned
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Professor Cheng made the remarks while speaking in Manhattan, New
York on the topic of mainland China and Taiwan's economic situation
and their future prospects.</P>
      <P>Cheng criticized Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party for
putting politics on a pedestal and said that the three-month
suspension of construction on the fourth nuclear power plant has
undermined foreign investor confidence.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who has visited the mainland several times recently, said
that after adjusting the economy downward for the seventh consecutive
year, the mainland has seen its economy start to rebound since the
latter part of 1999.</P>
      <P>He noted mainland China's two-way trade totaled US$474.3 billion
last year, up 31.5 percent from the previous year, triggering a
rebound in the overall economy.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial storm, growth in mainland China's
gross domestic product (GDP) dropped sharply to 7.1 percent in 1999,
rebounding to 8 percent last year. It is estimated that economic
growth this year will be maintained at between 7.5 percent and 8
percent due to the sluggish economy of the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the professor said that domestic political
squabbling in Taiwan has not ceased since the first transfer of power
on the island in more than five decades last May.</P>
      <P>Cheng continued that if the fourth nuclear power plant is
scrapped, northern Taiwan will face a short supply of electricity in
four year's time and high-tech industry will be forced to move to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, as wages on the mainland are much lower than in
Taiwan, domestic businesses will be forced to move to the mainland,
adding that Taiwan's economic growth for this year is expected to be
lower than 5 percent.</P>
      <P>He also touched on relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, saying that cross-strait trade amounted to US$32 billion last
year and pointing out that Taiwan is now the mainland's second
largest import market while the mainland is Taiwan's third largest
export market.</P>
      <P>He said that the fact that large numbers of Taiwan
businesspeople have begun investing in the mainland has become a new
important element in cross-strait cooperation, with orders being
received in Taiwan and products being manufacturing on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade with Hong Kong also increased sharply, with
exports to Hong Kong accounting for around 21 percent of the island's
total exports last year. Taiwan enjoyed a trade surplus of US$29.1
billion with Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that he was happy to see ROC Vice Economic Minister
Yiin Chii-min visit the mainland recently, adding that the trip will
help Yiin, who is in charge of Taiwan's industrial policy, map out a
more pragmatic policy.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that if Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China can join
forces to create a common market based on Chinese, then the greater
China economic region will become among the world's largest economic
blocs, on par with those of North America and the European Union.</P>

      <P>The opposition party will also set up an overseas center to count

      <P>The KMT Central Committee has been carefully preparing its 16th

      <P>However, the KMT has yet to decide the date of the party

    <HEADLINE>CPC CLOSELY MONITORING GLOBAL OIL PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Petroleum Corp. officials said
Monday that they are closely monitoring global oil prices following
the U.S. and British air strikes on Baghdad last Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted only short-term fluctuations in
international oil prices as long as military action is not expanded.
They said that international prices are likely to be unstable for
only one or two weeks, and that domestic oil prices will most likely
not be affected.</P>
      <P>But if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein responds with military
force, warfare may continue for some time, which would trigger a
long-term surge in international oil prices, they said. Such a
development would affect domestic oil prices, they stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu Chao-chuan, chairman of the Securities and Futures
Commission under the Ministry of Finance, said that the impact of the
military strikes on the local oil and stock markets will be brief.</P>
      <P>Chu said that the impact is still manageable, and there is no
need to adopt any measures at present.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang met with Vice Finance Minister
Lin Tzong-yeong and Chu Monday to discuss the stock market situation
after share prices plunged sharply upon the opening bell the same
morning. Share prices plummeted 108.37 points to close at 5,937.3
Monday.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the ministry will closely monitor any further
conflict in the Persian Gulf region, and will consider taking
responsive measures if military action becomes more widespread.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET UNVEILS NEW STIMULUS PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung unveiled an
eight-point action plan Monday with a view to stimulating domestic
economic growth amid a global slowdown.</P>
      <P>Chang said at a news conference that the stimulus package was
drafted in line with the conclusions reached at a national economic
conference held in January.</P>
      <P>Noting that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has adjusted
downward its forecast of the 2001 global economic growth rate to 3.4
percent from 4.2 percent, Chang said Taiwan's export-driven economy
will certainly be affected.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we'll step up improving domestic
investment climate and expanding domestic demand to bolster our
economic growth," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He outlined the eight action guidelines included in the package:</P>
      <P>-- Promoting stable supply of electricity by completing the
central-southern section of the island's third high-voltage power
distribution system by June 2002;</P>
      <P>-- Investing NT$22.6 billion (US$697.53 million) for the Hushan
Reservoir, which is scheduled to be completed by 2008 to ensure
adequate water supply;</P>
      <P>-- Easing restrictions on employment of foreign white-collar
workers or professionals;</P>
      <P>-- Revising the land law to pave the way for foreign investment
in the local real estate market;</P>
      <P>-- Delegating more power to the county and city governments in
handling land rezoning issues;</P>
      <P>-- Canceling the existing 0.1 percent education tax on corporate
bond transactions;</P>
      <P>-- Extending the deadline for income tax reporting from March to
May;</P>
      <P>-- Changing the basis for convicting a civil servant allegedly
using his or her authority to allow ordinary folks to gain illicit
benefits from "behavior" to the "actual results," namely whether the
relevant third party actually benefits from the accused civil
servant's administrative action.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Executive Yuan or Cabinet will also evaluate the
domestic demand for mainland Chinese technicians and engineers. "If
necessary, we'll open the local job market for mainland technical
workers under a well-planned quota system," he explained.</P>
      <P>Most of the measures proposed in the guidelines package need to
be approved by the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan as well as
revisions of the existing laws.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Finance has finalized an income tax
law amendment bill. "As it takes time for the legislature to
complete screening of the draft bill, the extension of the deadline
for tax reporting to May is not expected to be implemented until
2001," he added.</P>
      <P>Touching on the controversial fourth nuclear power plant, Chang
said the Cabinet is still evaluating whether to hold a referendum
vote on the project if the legislature fails to pass a plebiscite
act in its new session, scheduled to begin Tuesday.</P>

      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday he
cannot completely rule out the possibility of partially reshuffling
his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang stressed that there is no concrete timetable
for a partial Cabinet reshuffle at the moment.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to a press inquiry during a
news conference where he unveiled an eight-point action plan aimed
at boosting the sluggish domestic economy amid a global economic
slowdown.</P>
      <P>Chang divulged for the first time in a recent media interview
that the Cabinet may be partially reshuffled in the run-up to the
year-end parliamentary and local government chiefs elections.</P>
      <P>Noting that his Cabinet is a working team with ethics,
discipline, efficiency and vision, Chang said the Cabinet holds the
key to maintaining domestic political stability.</P>
      <P>"As the premier, I have always encouraged all Cabinet members to
work together with me and do their utmost to meet the public
expectations," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Cabinet is likely to undergo a partial
reshuffle before the year-end elections, Chang said logically, he
cannot rule out that possibility.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, I still have no idea at present about when the
reshuffle should take place or who should be replaced," he

    <HEADLINE>U.S. THINK TANK HEAD EXPECTS NO CHANGE IN U.S.-TAIWAN-CHINA TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The relationship between Beijing and Taipei
is "good," and no change in Washington's policy toward Taiwan is
expected in the near future, said the chief of a U.S. think tank in
Taipei Monday.</P>
      <P>Edwin J. Feulner Jr., president of the Washington-based Heritage
Foundation, told the press that U.S. President George Bush will
follow the line laid down by his predecessor Bill Clinton when it
comes to his policy toward Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>He said there is no indication that Bush will shift in the
near future from supporting the entries of both Beijing and Taipei
into the World Trade Organization, or from maintaining the "three
noes" stance -- no support for Taiwan's separation from China,
independence or membership in international organizations that
require statehood.</P>
      <P>He predicted that Washington will continue to pay close attention
to the cross-Taiwan Strait situation. He characterized present
cross-strait ties as "good," despite Beijing's repeated rejections of
any contacts with Taipei since President Chen Shui-bian took power
last May.</P>
      <P>Feulner arrived in Taipei Sunday along with Kenneth E. Sheffer
Jr., the foundation's Hong Kong branch office director, for a
three-day visit. While in Taiwan, they will meet with President Chen
Shui-bian and other government leaders.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Foundation, established in 1973, is a conservative
bastion of U.S. political thought. The organization traditionally
maintains close ties with Taiwan, and has staged international
symposiums in conjunction with authorities in Taipei on
Taiwan-related issues since 1988.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES 2001 BECOMES 'YEAR OF CROSS-STRAIT RECONCILIATION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Presidential Office member of staff said
Monday that President Chen Shui-bian earnestly hopes that 2001 can
become the "year of reconciliation between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>In Chen's view, the official said, the two sides should shelve
their "big disputes" and resume dialogue. "There are many practical
issues we can discuss," said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chen has on many occasions held out olive branches to
Beijing since his inauguration last May, the official said the Ball
is now in Beijing's court.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that several U.S. officials under the Clinton
Administration, including former Assistant Secretary of State for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Stanley Roth and former Deputy
National Security Adviser James Steinberg, had credited Chen's
goodwill gestures and flexibility for the lowering of cross-strait
tension in the past nine months.</P>
      <P>According to the official, mainland China has apparently adopted
a negative attitude toward the Republic of China's current Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led government.</P>
      <P>"Mainland policymakers might be thinking that our new government
is unstable and under siege by the powerful opposition, which
dominates the legislature," the official analyzed, adding that
Beijing might be pinning its hopes on the next ROC president.</P>
      <P>"Many U.S. China affairs experts, however, have expressed doubts
about Beijing's wisdom in resisting contacts with Chen's
administration," the official said.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the official went on, Chen will remain in office
for three more years. "I believe that the new U.S. administration
also looks forward to seeing Beijing pragmatically forge contacts and
resume talks with Chen's administration," he noted.</P>
      <P>The official further said Chen's appeal in his Lunar New Year's
Eve message for a promotion of cross-strait economic, social,
cultural and political integration was a response to mainland Chinese
Vice Premier Qian Qichen's softening of rhetoric concerning Taiwan.
Qian said late last year during a meeting with a Taiwan delegation
that both Taiwan and mainland China are part of "China." In the past,
mainland leaders consistently said Taiwan is part of China and that
the PRC is the sole legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that Chen's policy on cross-strait
affairs is consistent and coherent. "The key points of our mainland
policy include that the two sides can jointly deal with the issue
regarding a "future one China" and seek a new framework for
cross-strait political integration and lasting peace through economic
and cultural integration," he added.</P>
      <P>The official also said that although Beijing has so far given the
cold shoulder to Chen's olive branches, the president's determination
to push for cross-strait reconciliation and rapprochement in the new
year has not wavered.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung also reaffirmed at a
press conference Monday the ROC's commitment to opening the door
wider to cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Mainland
Affairs Council have formed a joint task force to evaluate the pros
and cons for the "no haste, be patient" policy toward mainland
China-bound investment adopted by the previous Kuomintang
government.</P>
      <P>"We'll ease restrictions on the mainland-bound investment under
a risk management system to ensure our national security and
simultaneously help our entrepreneurs expand market shares in the
mainland," he noted.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said the government is also evaluating the timing
and conditions for allowing mainland investment in the local real
estate market and hiring of mainland Chinese engineers and
technicians.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONS WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES: ROC VICE FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Lilongwe,  Malawi,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Yang Hui-chen and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice Foreign
Minister Wu Tzu-dan said Monday that the ROC will further strengthen
its relations with African countries so as to give ROC citizens a
better understanding of African people.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remark after presiding over the 19th meeting of the
heads of the ROC diplomatic missions and representative offices in
the African region.</P>
      <P>Touching on the ROC's foreign policy, Wu stressed that the
ministry has promoted foreign relations in a balanced manner, in
which the government has paid equal attention to nations throughout
the world. The government will implement a variety of foreign
relations measures according to specific situations, Wu said.</P>
      <P>While stressing the importance of Europe and the United States in
the international political arena, Wu said that he has been moved by
the third world countries that maintain friendly relations with the
ROC for their firm support of the nation in the international
comunity.</P>
      <P>The ROC, which maintains diplomatic relations with 29 nations
around the world, gives equal attention to each of its allies because
they are very important to the ROC, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>He lamented that ROC citizens scarcely know anything about the
people and affairs of Africa, and tend to believe that the African
countries simply rely on the ROC's economic assistance while lagging
behind in terms of economic development.</P>
      <P>Wu said that actually, the ROC's diplomatic allies in Africa are
filled with love for Taiwan, as can be seen by the crowds of African
people who flooded the streets to greet President Chen Shui-bian
during his official visit to three of Taiwan's African diplomatic
allies last year. Their enthusiasm was a response to the efforts of
ROC diplomatic personnel and technical missions over the past
decades, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said that the government will work to introduce
these African countries to the people of the ROC, so as to help them
better understand the people and governments there.</P>
      <P>Mentioning the ROC's economic assistance to its African allies,
Wu stressed that the ROC does not offer aimless economic assistance,
but rather provides financial aid for proposed projects only after
implementing a strict screening process.</P>
      <P>Wu cited a hospital which was built in Malawi with ROC economic
assistance under the tight control of ROC and Malawi government
officials. Rather than simply throwing money at the project, the ROC
paid for the hospital in accordance with its construction schedule,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that he had met with Malawi President Bakili Muluzi on
his recent trip to Malawi. He said that Muluzi expressed his thanks
for the ROC's assistance in the project and said that the hospital
has greatly helped health conditions in Malawi.</P>
      <P>On the outcome of the one-day meeting of heads of the ROC
diplomatic missions stationed in Africa, Wu said that participants
thoroughly reviewed their work in the African region during the past
year and also spoke about future aid projects. They reached the
conclusion that they will try to strengthen economic and cultural
interchanges between the ROC and its African diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>Discussions also centered on the government plan to implement
diplomatic service as a substitution for mandatory military
conscription for the first time this year, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that he had also signed a ROC-Malawi pharmaceutical and
public health agreement with the Malawi health minister during his
recent stay in Lilongwe. Under the agreement, the ROC will provide
Malawi with medicine and help research and study on aids prevention.</P>

Taiwan still has much to do to create an equal, discrimination-free

inequality or gender discrimination in job opportunities, pay scales,
promotion and fringe benefits.</P>
      <P>In the face of changing social trends and new values, Chen said
his administration is pushing for legislation of an equal employment
law to encourage local women to enter the job market and
create a discrimination-free, gender-harmony working climate.</P>
      <P>Chen also lauded the prize-winning companies for their devotion
to offering discrimination-free working terms and flexible time
schedules for female employees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu also recognized the
prize-winning companies' efforts to eliminate workplace gender
discriminations in a separate meeting with the corporate executives.</P>
      <P>Lu said she appreciated Taiwan voters' generosity to send her
into the Presidential Office with ballots in last March's
presidential election.</P>
      <P>"Although the immature local social environment has caused me
some difficulties simply because of my gender, I still recognize our
country's achievement in turning a new page in gender equality and
harmony through last year's election," said Lu, the ROC's first
female vice president.</P>
      <P>Lu said she hopes Taiwan will make even faster progress toward
gender harmony and equality in the 21st century.</P>

discriminations in a separate meeting with the corporate executives.</P>
      <P>Lu said she appreciated Taiwan voters' generosity to send her
into the Presidential Office with ballots in last March's

      <P>"Although the immature local social environment has caused me
some difficulties simply because of my gender, I still recognize our
country's achievement in turning a new page in gender equality and
harmony through last year's election," said Lu, the ROC's first

      <P>Lu said she hopes Taiwan will make even faster progress toward

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FILMS RECEIVE SILVER BEAR AWARDS AT BERLIN FILM FESTIVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's "Betelnut Beauty" and "Beijing
Bicycle" each claimed a Silver Bear and a new talent award at the
51st Berlin Film Festival Sunday, emerging from competition among 23
entries from around the world.</P>
      <P>The nine-member international jury awarded a Silver Bear for Best
Director to Lin Cheng-sheng for his film "Betelnut Beauty," while the
Jury Grand Prix went to "Beijing Bicycle," directed by mainland
China's Wang Xiaoshuai. Both films were produced by Taiwan's Peggy
Chiao and Hsu Hsiao-ming.</P>
      <P>Singer Angelica Sinje Lee received the Piper Heidsieck New Talent
Award for her first major role in "Betelnut Beauty," a film about
young people's search for individuality and exploration of values in
a rapidly changing Taipei society.</P>
      <P>Best young actors were Cui Lin and Li Bin for their roles in
"Beijing Bicycle," which also looks at mainland Chinese society from
a new perspective.</P>
      <P>Chiao said that the films are the first two in a series of six
films exploring the social phenomena that stem from Taiwan's
development from a capitalist society into one that begins to look
upon social issues with greater importance; the gradual introduction
of capitalism into mainland China's socialistic society; and Hong
Kong's transition from a British colony to a part of mainland China.</P>
      <P>She added that she did not expect the films to receive such high
acclaim at the very beginning of the project, which boasts brand new
production concepts, themes, directors and actors from the three
Chinese-speaking regions.</P>
      <P>Chiao said that she felt "especially lucky" that each of the two
films received two awards, almost unheard of because the festival's
juries normally present only one award to each film.</P>
      <P>The themes of the two films and the four more being planned for
the series focus on the thoughts and behavior of young Chinese people
in urban environments, signaling a break from traditional Chinese
language films that focus on tragedy and historical reviews.</P>
      <P>Chiao said that the two films combine both market appeal and
artistic expression and are able to draw the audience closer than the
more "artsy" films of the past.</P>
      <P>"Betelnut Beauty" follows the lives of Fei Fei (played by Lee), a
runaway high school graduate who flaunts her beauty to sell betelnuts
from roadside stalls, and her lover Hsiao Feng, a baker who is
straight out of the army and goes looking for more adventure than his
job can offer him -- in all the wrong places.</P>
      <P>The film describes the reality and feeling of helplessness facing
young lower-middle class people who seem a little lost in their
search for individuality amidst rapid across-the-board changes in
society.</P>
      <P>"Beijing Bicycle" describes a young courier whose tool of the
trade is stolen on the day he finally pays off the debt on the
bicycle. He accidentally discovers another young man who buys the
stolen bicycle from a second-hand store, and tries to steal it back.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.  OFFICIAL  SAYS  NO  CHANGE IN U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Washington's opposition to a
visit of a Taiwan naval flotilla to the Marshall Islands, a senior
U.S. official denied Sunday a suggestion that this indicates a change
in Washington's policy.</P>
      <P>Asked why Washington has apparently reversed its position from
last year, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Darryl N. Johnson said
that he was "not aware of any reversal."</P>
      <P>"There has been no change in our policy," he told reporters. He
declined to elaborate.</P>
      <P>The United States has recently conveyed its views to the Marshall
Islands government that the scheduled port call would be inconsistent
with the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the United States or
with Washington's security arrangement with the Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>Washington did not take a public position last year, when a
Republic of China Navy flotilla made its first visit to the islands.
The ROC and the Marshall Islands established diplomatic ties in 1998.</P>
      <P>Washington's opposition to the port call is seen by some in
Taipei as a sign of an "unfriendly" attitude toward Taiwan on the
part of the administration of President George Bush.</P>
      <P>The flotilla, consisting of three ships, left southern Taiwan
Feb. 5 and is scheduled to visit five Central American countries
before calling on the Marshall Islands in May.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions while waiting at a Washington airport for the
arrival of Yang Jie-chi, Beijing's new ambassador to the United
States, Johnson said that mainland Chinese Vice Prime Minister Qian
Qichen is expected to visit Washington soon.</P>
      <P>He said that details of the visit, including whether Bush will
receive him, remain to be worked out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
met at the Executive Yuan Monday with Edwin Feulner, president of the
Heritage Foundation, U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taiwan's industry is export-oriented and as a
result, the country's World Trade Organization (WTO) entry is vital.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan joins the WTO, he went on, it can implement the
"three direct links" -- postal, transport and trade -- with mainland
China under the framework of international rules so as to ensure the
country's security.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, WTO membership will give not only economic
significance but also cross-Taiwan Strait stability, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that the cross-strait situation has
gradually lost balance, not only militarily but also in terms of
international organizations. He expressed the hope that the new U.S.
administration will pay attention to these issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to calling on the U.S. government to continue
supplying defensive weapons to Taiwan, Chang said he hopes that the
U.S. government will help Taiwan enter the WTO and WHO, and help
promote balanced power between the two sides of Taiwan Strait so as
to ensure peace and security across the Taiwan Strait and in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chang also expressed regret that Beijing has ignored the goodwill
shown by President Chen Shui-bian and has neglected the established
consultation channel between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, thus
losing the opportunity to improve cross-strait relations.</P>

      <P>Weathermen predicted Monday that there is
little chance of central Taiwan's Yunlin County suffering an
earthquake measuring over six on the Richter Scale in the foreseeable
future.</P>
      <P>The prediction came shortly after an earthquake measuring 5.2 on
the Richter Scale rattled Yunlin early Monday morning.</P>
      <P>Kuo Kai-wen, director of the Seismology Center of the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB), said that according to statistics, no
earthquake measuring over six on the Richter Scale has occurred in
Yulin in the past 100 years, suggesting that the chances of another
are "very small."</P>
      <P>However, he also admitted that because the quake cycle in western
Taiwan is very long and complicated -- ranging from 100 years to
1,000 years -- the CWB is actually unable to forecast quake activity

      <P>The Republic of China mission in Seoul
Monday issued a statement saying that "no progress has been made" on
a project that could see North Korea storing Taiwan's nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>The statement reiterated that the ROC government will take a
cautious attitude toward the nuclear waste issue, as the ROC, like
other members of the international community, attaches much
importance to the protection of the environment.</P>
      <P>It said that ROC President Chen Shui-bian asserted last year that
he is strongly against the shipment of nuclear waste to neighboring
countries.</P>
      <P>In the previous few days, the South Korean media had reported
that a shelved plan that would see Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower)
dumping its nuclear waste in North Korean "had been revived."</P>
      <P>Members of South Korean environmental protection groups
immediately gathered outside the ROC mission to protest the move.</P>
      <P>According to the statement issued by the ROC mission, Taipower
indicated Feb. 17 that "no progress has been made regarding
cooperation with North Korea on nuclear waste disposal."</P>
      <P>The statement said that a 1997 agreement signed by Taipower and
North Korea was a "commercial action" without government
authorization.</P>
      <P>It continued that "the government will not grant a permit for
Taipower to export nuclear waste in the future if international
standards are not complied with."</P>

      <P>Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Po-chih said Monday that Taiwan's
economic growth this year may be affected by the slowdown of the
international economy.</P>
      <P>He said that the U.S. economy may not be able to achieve a "soft
landing" in the first quarter this year and if the international
economy is adversely affected, Taiwan's growth rate this year,
predicted at 5.25 percent, might be revised downward.</P>
      <P>Chen warned that "we should not harbor blind optimism" because
almost all other countries around the world fear that if the U.S.
economy encounters a "hard landing," it will be very difficult for
the world to recover from the current sluggishness.</P>
      <P>But the CEPD chief pointed out that past experience indicates
that it is very rare for Taiwan to suffer a stagnant period of more
than one year, as the country is a supply-oriented economic entity,
with its people acting fast to produce necessary products for
domestic and foreign markets.</P>
      <P>He said that some local enterprises wanted to put off their
large-scale investment projects, but added that Economics Minister

ship Amorgos should be towed off the rocks in southern Taiwan and
scuttled on the high seas, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said Monday.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with relevant government agencies, the ministry
asked the owner of the ship, which ran aground Jan. 14 one mile off
the coast of Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip, to pump out the
remaining fuel still on the ship before removing it from the
coastline to a place some 6.4 miles from the coast for scuttling.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials said that the water in the area targeted for
the scuttling operation is about 1,000 meters to 1,300 meters deep,
so sinking the wreckage there will not affect sea lanes.</P>
      <P>It will cost the owner between US$3.12 million and US$6.24
million to carry out the operation, in addition to the cost of
pumping out the remaining fuel. The figures are far beyond the US$2.4

    <HEADLINE>`LOW PROBABILITY' THAT M'LAND TESTED NEW MISSILES: ROC MILITARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's military spokesman
said Tuesday that the defense ministry's intelligence department has
determined a "low probability" that mainland China recently tested
its newly acquired Sunburn anti-ship missiles.</P>
      <P>ROC military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said that
military intelligence did not observe the mainland's navy undertaking
any unusual vigilant actions that normally accompany such live-fire
tests. No special patrol or observation aircraft or surface vessels
were detected to indicate that the weapon testing took place, he
added.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that any newly acquired weapons system would need
to go through the process of testing and deployment before achieving
operational readiness status. Urging the public to remain at ease, he
added that the ROC military is able to closely monitor the mainland's
major military exercises and arms development.</P>
      <P>Interfax had reported that mainland China successfully conducted
live-fire testing of its Russian-made "Moskit" missiles last
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Designated as SS-N-22 Sunburn missiles by NATO forces, this
supersonic surface-to-surface missile is currently mounted on the
mainland's two newly deployed Sovremenny-class destroyers, which were
also procured from Russia to counter U.S.-made AEGIS destroyers.</P>
      <P>Some military analysts have claimed that only 1.2 Sunburns are
required to sink a destroyer and only five Sunburns are needed to
totally destroy a 20,000-ton supply ship.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Tongyong Language
Association has established liaison offices overseas with the aim of
working for the adoption of the Tongyong Pinyin system as the
standard romanization of the Chinese language in Taiwan, sources said
Monday.</P>
      <P>With the controversy over which system of romanization Taiwan
should adopt far from over, the Global Taiwan Tongyong Language
Association and its worldwide branches are calling for the adoption
of the Tongyong Pinyin system recommended by the Academia Sinica and
the Educational Reform Council.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan press reports, the Minister of Education J.L.
Tzeng supports the Hanyu Pinyin system, which is used on the Chinese
mainland and is the internationally accepted system of romanization.</P>
      <P>Tzeng's preference however does not jibe with that of the Office
of the President and the Executive Yuan, resulting in a stalemate
over the issue.</P>
      <P>The Global Taiwan Tongyong Language Association has scheduled a
press conference in San Francisco for Feb. 22.</P>
      <P>Liao Uan-fu, chairman of the association and an overseas affairs
commissioner of the Democratic Progressive Party, said Monday that
the association has established offices in Japan, Toronto, Vancouver
and Europe.</P>
      <P>He added that over the past 50 years, a unique "Taiwanese Chinese
language" has taken shape on the island, referring to the mixture of
the dialects of Beijing and Fukien province, the Hakka dialect,
native Taiwanese, as well as the languages of several foreign
countries. The purpose of the organization is to implement a suitable
and unified official language that represents Taiwan's culture and
society, he said.</P>
      <P>Liao criticized Tzeng's call last week to abolish the Executive
Yuan's Educational Reform Council, saying that Tzeng was not being
conscious of Taiwan's national security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. DENIES PITCHING FOR SHIPMENT OF TAIWAN N-WASTE TO RUSSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Energy denied
Monday that it has played a leading role in pushing for the shipment
of nuclear waste from Taiwan to Russia for permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>The department made the denial in response to reports from Moscow
that accused the United States of intending to turn Russia into an
international nuclear waste dump to accommodate radioactive waste
from Taiwan and even South Korea and Japan.</P>
      <P>C. K. Chou, a special assistant at the Energy Department, told
CNA that there are now at least six "initiatives" for international
cooperation in radioactive nuclear waste treatment and permanent
disposal.</P>
      <P>Chou said those international cooperative initiatives are being
promoted separately by Washington-based NPT Co. or companies in
Japan, Russia, Switzerland and France.</P>
      <P>Chou stressed that the U.S. government has never endorsed any of
those initiatives nor has it made public comments on those projects.</P>
      <P>Chou himself makes frequent visits to Taiwan, mainland China and
Japan to transfer to them U.S. expertise and experience in the
treatment of used nuclear fuel. After the inauguration of the Bush
administration, Chou has presented a report concerning the U.S.
policy on nuclear energy to the new secretary of energy.</P>
      <P>As the United States has been pushing Russia to cut its nuclear
weapons, several international research institutes are studying
ways to help the Russian government raise funds for disposal of
nuclear waste from its military units after disarmament.</P>
      <P>Sources said the U.S. Energy Department is fully aware of all
these research projects and has been closely watching developments
in the programs.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said the Russian Environmental
Protection Alliance and the opposition Yabloko Party staged a
demonstration outside the lower house of the Russian parliament, or
the State Duma, to protest a government plan to allow imports of
foreign nuclear waste for treatment or permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>The State Duma is scheduled to discuss a "nature protection" bill
on Feb. 22. If passed, the bill will authorize the Russian
government to import foreign radioactive waste for treatment.</P>
      <P>American sources said the State Duma passed the first reading of
the bill with a vote of 319-38, indicating that only a few Russian
parliamentarians opposed it.</P>
      <P>The Russian government reportedly plans to allow imports of
20,000 nuclear waste for treatment, which is expected to raise an
estimated US$21 billion for cash-strapped Russia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan now has three nuclear power plants in operation. After
its fourth nuclear power plant becomes operational, Taiwan's total
nuclear waste will reach 7,000 tons to 8,000 tons. Theoretically,
Russia can absorb all of Taiwan's radioactive nuclear waste.
Nevertheless, as Taiwan's nuclear materials all come from the United
States, it must obtain the U.S. consent before shipping nuclear
waste to either Russia, North Korea or any other place.</P>
      <P>American officials reiterated that the U.S. government has never
broached any initiative for shipping Taiwan's nuclear waste to
Russia for treatment or disposal. The U.S. government has only keep
a close watch on the development of any international cooperative
program for highly radioactive nuclear waste treatment, the
officials asserted.</P>
      <P>As highly radioactive nuclear waste can be recycled for military
use, the U.S. officials said even if Russia passes its new
"nature protection" bill, the United States would not necessarily
agree to the shipment of Taiwan nuclear waste to Russia for
treatment. One prerequisite for the U.S. approval is that Russia
should make assurances that it will not use the fund and highly
radioactive waste for proliferation of nuclear weapons, the officials
noted.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A forest fire that broke out on Taiwan's
central mountain range two days ago was extinguished Tuesday morning,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the fire on the eastern ridge of Snow Mountain
in Shei-pa National Park consumed 10 hectares of forest land. Most of
the area destroyed contained Yu-Shan canes, while nearby Taiwan firs
were spared.</P>
      <P>They said that though the damage is not expected to be much in
terms of forestation, the COA had to mobilize helicopters to
transport hundreds of firefighters to battle the blaze, which started
at around 11 a.m. Sunday on the steep eastern mountain ridge located
3,200 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with the approach of the dry season and also Tomb
Sweeping day, COA Chairman Chen Hsi-huang urged the public on Tuesday
to guard against inadvertently starting fires and to especially
refrain from lighting fires for cooking or warmth in mountainous
areas.</P>
      <P>Mountain climber Chien Huei-pin of Taipei City admitted that he
accidentally started the fire Sunday while trying to burn rubbish. He
was turned over to the Prosecutor's Office in Taichung, central

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MILITARY POLICE CRACK DOWN ON DESERTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Military Police Command announced
Tuesday that it has made cracking down on deserters one of its major
goals for this year in order to maintain the military's image.</P>
      <P>At a routine defense ministry press conference, Military Police
Deputy Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. Mu Tai-sheng said that the number of
deserters still at large has been dramatically lowered from a high of
over 1,200 soldiers in the past to the current level of 392.</P>
      <P>In addition to adopting more generous commendation guidelines to
encourage the active pursuit of deserters, the command has also
requested assistance from the nation's health insurance and highway
monitoring agencies as well as from state-owned but privatizing
Chunghwa Telecom to provide related information on the deserters, Mu
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in accordance with an ongoing military streamlining
project, Mu said that military police units already achieved their
goal of slimming down by July 1999 and that they are now focused on
responding to "surprise external attacks" and "surprise internal
changes."</P>
      <P>Mu also confirmed that the "Night Hawk" special military police
squad remains the military's sole anti-terrorist unit after the
streamlining plans called for similar units from other services to be
disbanded and for their members to be reassigned to training centers,
regular forces, or special units under police command.</P>
      <P>He said that the Night Hawk unit is stationed in northern Taiwan
but is capable of quickly mobilizing to execute anti-terrorist
missions anywhere in the nation when necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>90% OF TAIWAN HIGH-TECH COMPANIES TO INVEST IN M'LAND THIS YEAR: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Computer Association reported
Tuesday that 30 percent of Taiwan's 411 high technology companies
have already invested in mainland China, based on a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that nearly 90 percent of those companies
will invest in mainland China this year.</P>
      <P>After a careful cross-sectional analysis of the survey, the
computer association reported that over 50 percent of the companies
will sell their products in the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Among the 30.5 percent of the companies that have already set up
shop in China, only 22.9 percent have gained a profit from their
investments. Meanwhile, 12.4 percent have broken even on their
investments and over 60 percent are still struggling after investing
a large amount of capital, the survey suggested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 56.3 percent of the pro-mainland companies said that
their production departments and branches on the mainland will
eventually replace their Taiwan-based administrative and sales
departments.</P>
      <P>Another 32.4 percent said that the companies may even establish
mainland-based development and design departments to replace the
existing departments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, over 60 percent of the respondents said that
they will wire their profits back to Taiwan, and another 40 percent
suggested that the new government's policy has accelerated the pace
of investment in mainland China's high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Most investors said they look forward to stable and unchanging
cross-strait relations, the survey said.</P>
      <P>The survey also showed that investments by Taiwan's high
technology industry in the mainland will continue and that this trend
will expand, resulting in a chain-reaction that will lead to the
exodus of down-, medium- and upper-stream companies to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises expect sustained growth in mainland China's
industrial production but predict a decline in Taiwan's. Also, 70
percent of the respondents said they are pessimistic about the
island's economic climate in the near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC SCHEDULED TO UNVEIL 'NO HASTE' POLICY REVIEW IN MAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is
scheduled to present a report on the adjustment of the "no haste, be
patient" policy on mainland China-bound investment to the Cabinet for
implementation in May, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chou Ching-sheng, deputy director of the Economic Affairs
Department of the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward the
mainland, made the remarks in response to a press inquiry.</P>
      <P>Chou said relevant government agencies began last October to
review the "no haste, be patient" policy, which was adopted by the
previous Kuomintang government to cool a "mainland investment fever"
among local entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>"We were originally scheduled to complete the review in March,
but decided to postpone the deadline to May as various government
agencies wanted to include mainland investment-related suggestions
presented at a January national economic conference into the final
report," Chou explained.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed the government's commitment to easing restrictions
on mainland China-bound investment and opening the door wider for
cross-Taiwan Strait commercial exchanges under a well-designed risk
management system.</P>
      <P>On the mainland-bound investment, Chou said the government will
help local companies forge a framework for division of labor
and upgrade their competitiveness in the global market while
keeping their business roots in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chou said the government has also decided to allow local
companies to invest in more mainland industries and employ overseas
mainland high-tech personnel to work here under a quota system.</P>
      <P>Chou further said relevant government financial and economic
agencies are now mulling the establishment of a capital risk
management system and a mechanism for the return of capital
originally invested on the mainland.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Chou said the MAC will be able to come up
with a report on adjustment measures for further Cabinet
discussion in May. And the Cabinet is expected to work out a
timetable for implementing such measures later, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Lin I-hsiung announced Tuesday that he has quit the top
party adviser post to take responsibility for the policy decisions
that led to the revival of the fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>After a brief meeting with DPP Secretary General Wu Nai-jen, Lin
told reporters that it is now time for "related people" -- including
the media, the opposition alliance, the DPP, the legislators, the
Control Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the premier, the president, and
himself -- to reflect on "where the policy-making process went wrong"
in regards to the controversial project.</P>
      <P>In a letter to DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh and the DPP Central
Standing Committee, Lin stressed that although halting the project
last October and then bowing to opposition pressure to restart it
last Wednesday were both Cabinet decisions, the premier was following
the DPP's policies.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added that the party's policy-making unit should
also carefully reflect on its decisions and shoulder the
responsibility for what was seen as a major blow to the traditionally
anti-nuclear party.</P>
      <P>Lin reiterated his support for holding a referendum to allow the
public to determine the ultimate fate of the project. Even if the
Legislative Yuan were to decide "not to respect the people's
opinions," the Executive Yuan could still use an informal referendum
to serve as reference for policy-making, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin is slated to participate in an anti-nuclear parade scheduled
for Saturday as the demonstration's honorary convener. After the
parade, he will fly to South Korea to accept an honorary doctorate in
political science.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER MAKES ANOTHER CALL FOR CROSS-STRAIT RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Tuesday once
again urged mainland China to work with Taiwan to create an
atmosphere favorable to the resumption of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The premier made the pitch on the opening day of the new session
of the Legislative Yuan, during which he gave administrative reports
and fielded questions.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the establishment of the "mini links" between
the offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China was a
major step toward cross-strait reconciliation, and the prelude to
full trade, postal and transport links between Taiwan proper and
mainland China following the entry of both sides into the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>He said the happy reunion of some Kinmen families that had been
separated for more than five decades was both sad and moving, and
proved that the government's policy is beneficial.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the tragic events of history should not be
repeated, adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should cast
away their old hostilities, reject confrontation and think in a new
manner.</P>
      <P>In addition to the easing of the "go slow, be patient" policy
toward investment in the mainland, he also reaffirmed President Chen
Shui-bian's remarks in his New Year's Eve address, during which Chen
spoke of cultural and trade integration between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait before gradually moving toward cross-strait peace and
political integration.</P>
      <P>Saying that unilateral moves are not conducive to improving
cross-strait relations, he also expressed the hope that the mainland
will use good will and creativity in trying to push for
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The premier urged consultation instead of confrontation, and
dialogue instead of conflict across the Taiwan Strait. He urged the
mainland to work with Taiwan to create an atmosphere favorable to
restarting cross-strait talks, and said that cross-strait ties in the
new generation should be defined by reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The premier also stressed that in order to avoid controversy
similar to that surrounding the fourth nuclear power plant, he plans
to list a referendum bill on public policy during the new session.</P>
      <P>The premier again explained his decision to scrap the fourth
nuclear power plant, but noted that the grand justices ruled that it
was a major policy change, and required the participation of the
legislative branch.</P>
      <P>He said that after the legislature passed the resolution to
restart the construction, he had to make the "painful decision" to
restart the plant. He noted that the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party holds a minority of legislative seats, and that the party has
always put political stability and economic development on a
pedestal.</P>
      <P>The premier also spoke on transforming Taiwan into a green
silicon island, and urged full administrative reforms to create a
society based on justice in line with Taiwan's democratic and
economic development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GROUP RALLIES SUPPORT FOR LAWSUIT AGAINST U.S. TOBACCO INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the backing of Taipei City Council
Deputy Speaker Fei Hung-tai, the John Tung Foundation announced
Tuesday that it will lobby for the support of all Taipei city
councilors to take legal action against U.S. tobacco companies.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based foundation, which focuses on tobacco, nutrition,
health and child education issues, teamed up with 15 other civilian
anti-tobacco organizations to hold a press conference to explain its
proposed lawsuit against U.S. tobacco firms.</P>
      <P>Fei said that he will urge all city councilors to sign a petition
for the city government to file a class-action lawsuit in its name in
May.</P>
      <P>Chinese Culture University Graduate School of Law Director Yao
Szu-yuan charged that multinational tobacco companies have long
understood the harmful effects of smoking, yet continue to publish
"untrue" medical reports and waste public resources to resolve the
issue.</P>
      <P>Yao pointed out that an anti-tobacco victory in 1998 when U.S.
tobacco companies agreed to a US$206 billion settlement with 46
states encouraged anti-smoking advocates worldwide and dealt a blow
to the tobacco industry.</P>
      <P>With 30 local governments and countries such as Guatemala,
Venezuela and Nicaragua filing lawsuits against the companies for
their practices -- including allegedly adding chemical substances to
increase addiction -- Yao said that Taiwan should also begin taking
action to demand compensation for getting the youth of Taiwan hooked
on smoking.</P>
      <P>According to the research of Chen Chien-jen, dean of National
Taiwan University's School of Public Health, 15 percent of male
subjects who died during his nine-year-long study perished due to
smoking-related causes, while the same factors accounted for 10
percent of female deaths.</P>
      <P>Smokers are 1.3 times more likely than non-smokers to die of
complications related to smoking, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's international balance of payments
deficit totaled US$6.12 billion during the fourth quarter of last
year, setting a new quarterly record and representing an increase of
US$5.68 billion over the previous quarter, the Central Bank of China
announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A CBC official said that Taiwan's current account deficit totaled
US$4.23 billion in the fourth quarter of 2000, the highest quarterly
figure since 1996, while the ROC's capital account deficit reached
US$45 million during the same period. He added that monetary outflows
totaled US$10.32 billion, also a new record for any single quarter.</P>
      <P>The official attributed the tremendous increase to weak
confidence in the domestic currency, which led to an increase of
local people depositing foreign currency in domestic banks.</P>
      <P>Such deposits increased by US$8.58 billion, while local banks'
outstanding foreign currency loans declined by US$1.51 billion, the

    <HEADLINE>PFP SUSPENDS CONSULTATIONS WITH KMT ON ELECTION LAW REVISIONS: SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Tuesday that his party will suspend
consultations with the Kuomintang (KMT) on a proposed revision to the
current Law on the System of Local Governments.</P>
      <P>Soong, one of the most popular politicians in the opposition
camp, made the statement after chairing a meeting of the PFP
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Soong said the PFP has decided to temporarily stop coordinating
with the KMT in pushing for legal revisions to pave the way for
mandatory pairing of candidates for local government chiefs and
deputy chiefs in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>"We have come to this decision because PFP caucus members remain
divided over the issue and some ordinary folks are suspicious about
the purposes of PFP-KMT cooperation in the year-end elections for
county chiefs and city mayors," Soong explained.</P>
      <P>Under the existing local government structural law, county
magistrates and city mayors are authorized to name their deputies
after they win elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until last May and still
controls a comfortable majority in the legislature, is pitching for
an amendment to the present law to require parties to pair candidates
for the magistrate and mayoral positions with candidates for deputy
posts. This is seen as a bid to facilitate inter-party cooperation in
the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>As the PFP is mainly a splinter group of the KMT, the two
opposition parties share some common concepts and ideals,
particularly in policy regarding future cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and in the use of nuclear energy. Furthermore, their support bases
largely overlap.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, some influential KMT and PFP members are
advocating inter-party cooperation in the year-end elections for
local government chiefs and legislators. They believe that if pairing
of candidates for the local government chiefs elections becomes
mandatory, there will be more room for KMT-PFP cooperation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Soong said some other PFP members fret that a joint
PFP-KMT ticket may give the public the impression that the PFP is
working with the KMT to promote pork-barrel politics.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the PFP will maintain both "cooperative and
competitive" relations with other parties, Soong said the PFP will
decide whether to continue cooperating with the KMT in promoting
amendments in local government structural law after the PFP
legislative caucus holds a series of public hearings to collect
opinions from scholars, experts and ordinary folks.</P>
      <P>Soong further said the PFP will not waver on its reformist party
platform and will present well-designed policy proposals on major
issues of public concern.</P>
      <P>For the year-end parliamentary elections, Soong said the PFP will
field qualified candidates with clean images to win public support.
"It is the electorate, not political parties themselves, that will
determine the electoral results," he noted.</P>
      <P>As for the county magistrate and city mayor elections, Soong said
the PFP will follow the same principles in nominating candidates.
"There will be no under-the-table deals with any other party in
candidate nominations," he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led
Cabinet's plan to hold a referendum on the controversial fourth
nuclear power plant project, Soong said the introduction of any new
system must meet the public's expectations of political stability.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan has not enacted a plebiscite law, Soong went on, the
DPP minority government should learn a lesson from the just-ended
furor over the nuclear power plant project and avoid triggering
another standoff between the Cabinet and legislature by insisting on
holding a referendum vote.</P>
      <P>"Since the Cabinet and the legislature have already come to a
difficult agreement on resuming construction of the nuclear power
plant, the DPP government should not try to veto the decision by
illegally calling any referendum vote," Soong warned.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
Tuesday that all civil servants should change their concepts about
the government's role in dealing with the business community and
ordinary folks from "administration or management" to "service."</P>
      <P>Chen made the pitch during an inspection tour of the central
Taiwan county of Changhua where he visited an industrial park, a
floral farm, and several local development projects.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Fuhsing and Peitou industrial zone, Chen
Shih-yao, chairman of an association of companies in the industrial
zone, told President Chen that he was impressed by mainland Chinese
government officials' devoted services to prospective Taiwan
investors when he visited the mainland several years ago to seek
investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>"In comparison, I think that our government has not done enough
to serve our business and industrial community," Chen added.</P>
      <P>In response, President Chen said he shares Chen's view that
there is still much room for the government to improve services to
local business people and ordinary people.</P>
      <P>"I hope all of our government agencies and public functionaries
can change their basic concept of their role. They are require to
serve the people, not to manage them," the president said, adding
that he will join hands with all government staff members to offer
the best possible services to business people and ordinary folks.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, President Chen paid a visit to Pou Chen Co.,
the world's largest shoemaker.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded the company's management for keeping business
roots in Taiwan while expanding its production lines and marketing
footholds worldwide.</P>
      <P>Pou Chen Co. now produces more than 100 billion pairs of sports
shoes, sneakers and other types of footwear annually. Chen also
expressed his admiration for the company's heavy
investment in environmental protection, workplace safety and local
community development.</P>
      <P>Noting that traditional consumer industries are by no
means sunset industries, Chen said Pou Chen has set a good
example for the transformation of a traditional enterprise into an

    <HEADLINE>`ONE CHINA' PRECONDITION UNACCEPTABLE: DPP CADRES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will not accept Beijing's "one
China" precondition for the resumption of talks between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, officials of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Commenting in a seminar sponsored by a local radio station, both
Yen Wan-chin, vice secretary-general of the Straits Exchange
Foundation, and Yen Chien-fa, head of the DPP's mainland affairs
department, said Taiwan will not accept the precondition.</P>
      <P>However, they added that the two sides' entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) and Taiwan's participation in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum's meetings this year
will provide good opportunities for bilateral talks.</P>
      <P>According to Yen Wan-chin, dialogue is important to both sides to
boost mutual understanding and trust in order to break the current
deadlock. He said that although the Taiwan authorities think talks
can be reopened at any time, they must be opened without any
conditions attached.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's `one China' precondition contributes a major barrier
to the resumption of bilateral talks. Taiwan will be unable to
restart negotiations with mainland China if Beijing continues to
ignore the political reality existing between the two sides," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the right timing for Taiwan and the
mainland to rekindle their dialogue, Yen Wan-chin pointed out that
APEC meetings slated to take place in Shanghai later this year will
provide a good framework and a positive atmosphere for the two sides
to reopen talks.</P>
      <P>"In addition, Taiwan's and mainland China's WTO entry and
Beijing's bid to seek the sponsorship of the 2008 Olympic Games will
also help create good timing and a favorable climate for two-way
interaction," he added.</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin's remarks were echoed by Yen Chien-fa, who said it
will be impossible for Taiwan to resume talks with mainland China
under the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>Since the mainland authorities put more emphasis on politics than
on economics and think that time is on their side, Yen Chien-fa
contended that Beijing is not in as much hurry to reopen bilateral
talks as Taiwan. Against such a background, Yen said he is
"pessimistic" about the resumption of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Also pessimistic about the issue was Tseng Fu-sheng, a professor
at Tamkang University, who said that it will still take some time for
talks to open.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, it is unrealistic for Taiwan to place its
hopes on the WTO now, as the mainland is in no hurry to join the WTO
because it can obtain the same objective of improving its economy by
attracting foreign capital of US$40 billion each year even without
WTO membership.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the resumption of cross-strait talks will take
place later than the legislative election slated for December.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lai Shih-pao of the New Party, however, agreed with the
rhetoric that any time is a good time for the two sides to restart
talks. Attributing the delay in resuming two-way talks to each side's
heavy ideology, Lai said Taiwan and the mainland are equally
responsible for the present situation.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Hsi-wei of the People First Party said that Taiwan
and the mainland should not shun bilateral negotiations and that WTO
entry will produce an appropriate time for the negotiations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan official gave a cautious welcome
Tuesday to the idea of having the Olympic torch transported through
the island if Beijing were to be chosen to host the 2008 Olympic
Games.</P>
      <P>One day after Britain's Financial Times reported from Shanghai
that Beijing is mulling the idea of making Taiwan a leg of the
Olympic torch relay should Beijing be awarded the 2008 games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council would not comment on the
reports, but Yen Wang-ching, deputy secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation, said it would be "a good idea."</P>
      <P>However, he warned Beijing against reading political overtones
into the issue such as claiming that by agreeing to allow passage to
the torch, the island had conceded that it is a province of the
People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"Politics should be excluded from sports," Yen said.</P>
      <P>As to the idea of having Taipei co-host the 2008 Olympics with
Beijing, Yen said such a move would be unprecedented and that it
would be doubtful whether it would be permissible under Olympic
regulations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng Chih-fu, a spokesman for the National Council on
Physical Fitness and Sports, said if Beijing wants the Olympic flame
relayed through Taiwan, the Republic of China government should have
absolute control over the route and the manner the torch would be
carried.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said his council would reject any attempt by
Beijing to downgrade Taiwan into a province of China.</P>
      <P>He also doubted the validity of the reports, noting that the
International Olympic Council has yet to choose the host city for the
2008 Olympics.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Trong Chai urged the
government to reject Beijing's gesture but to support Beijing's bid
to host the games.</P>
      <P>Citing what he called a "secret decision" by Beijing's agencies
charged with Taiwan affairs, Tsai said Beijing intends to reach out
to Taiwan in an attempt to whitewash its tarnished image caused by
its clampdown on the Falun Gong and its attempts to brand Taiwan a
province of China.</P>
      <P>He warned the government not to play into Beijing's hands by

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHAPING UP TO BECOME ASIA-PACIFIC SUPERCON STRONGHOLD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is promising to become a stronghold
of the superconductor industry in the Asia-Pacific region, with its
abundant supply of high-caliber skilled manpower and strong marketing
capability, a leading superconductor scientist said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Paul Ching-wu Chu, director of the Texas Center for
Superconductivity, University of Houston, said the island has a
"window of opportunity" to enter the superconductor market now that
many bottlenecks in the field have been tackled after decades of
research since the science was discovered in 1911.</P>
      <P>Chu, a member of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's highest research
institute, and scheduled to become president of the Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology in July this year, made the
remarks in Taipei on a lecture tour at the invitation of the Chinese
Superconductor Technological Application Association.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Taiwan
should strive to develop precision and high-level instruments such as
high temperature superconducting filters for wireless
telecommunications networks, which other nations "cannot develop," to
help achieve an industrial transition.</P>
      <P>Lee, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry in 1986, was also present
at the 2001 Supercon Technology Seminar held at the Taipei
International Convention Center, to which Chu delivered a keynote
speech.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Advanced Superconducting Technologies (AST), a
daughter company of Wang NMR, Inc., one of the leading superconductor
companies in the United States, announced during the seminar that AST
is considering establishing a research and development center in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AST, founded by Wang NMR Chairman Bert Wang, is poised to help
raise Taiwan's international status in superconductor research and
development and related industries, said Chen Hui-tang, executive
vice president of AST.</P>
      <P>Wang is also founder of the Chinese Superconductor Technological
Application Association in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>AST has recently entered a joint venture plan with four leading
Taiwanese cellular phone system providers to jointly research and
develop high temperature superconducting filters for wireless
telecommunications networks, poised to further upgrade Taiwan's
wireless telecommunications systems.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the high temperature superconducting filter
with cryogenic low noise amplifier provides much better spectral
selectivity and dramatically improves base station sensitivity.</P>
      <P>AST, which was established in Taiwan in late 2000, is aiming to
research and develop three major product lines on the island -- low
temperature superconductor products such as magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) devices, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) devices, and
high temperature superconductor filters, said Chen.</P>
      <P>When the prototype of the Taiwan-developed high temperature
superconductor filter is completed, it will be sent to Germany for
OEM production, according to Chen. Once Taiwan's technology is
sufficiently mature to enable commercial production, AST will
establish full production lines here, he added.</P>

mature judgment as to whether to invest in mainland China's bourse.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks following Beijing's decision Monday to open
its hard currency B-share market to mainland people, which led to
speculation that Taiwan's "hot money" will pour into the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen declined to comment on whether the Ministry of Finance will
take measures to prevent such funds from flowing into the mainland.</P>
      <P>Yu Yi-hsun, a high-ranking company official in the local
securities sector, said Taiwan and foreign capital is not expected to
enter the mainland bourse in the short term.</P>
      <P>Yu said that even if Beijing's move expands the scale of the
mainland stock market, it is still premature to say that the measure
will increase the attraction for Taiwan and foreign capital,
especially since the issue of Beijing's control of foreign exchange
reserves has not been resolved.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Beijing's opening of the B-share market to
its people is only one procedure in the step-by-step opening of the
mainland stock market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POSSIBILITY OF BEIJING HOSTING 2008 OLYMPIAD INCREASES: IOC MEMBER</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chances of Beijing hosting the 2008
Olympic Games is greatly increasing, International Olympic Committee
(IOC) member Wu Chien-kuo claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that from Wednesday, an IOC Evaluation Committee will
visit the five cities which are vying for the right to host the 2008
Olympiad. The committee will arrive in Beijing Thursday and then
travel to Osaka for a three-day visit from Feb. 26-March 1. The trip
will then bring the committee to Toronto from March 8-March 11, to
Istanbul from March 21-March 24 and to Paris from March 26-March 29.</P>
      <P>The committee will submit an evaluation report to the IOC after
ending its evaluation tour, after which the IOC members will vote to
select the winning city at the 120th IOC meeting scheduled to be held
in Moscow July 13.</P>
      <P>Asked about the chances of Beijing or Osaka hosting the games, Wu
said that the possibility is "very high." He claimed that there is
"very little chance" of any European or North American city being
selected, as the 2004 Olympiad will be held in Greece and Montreal
hosted the Olympics in 1976.</P>
      <P>However, Wu went on, Japan has already hosted a winter Olympiad,
Wu said, adding that therefore, Beijing's chances will be increased.
He said the city has spent more than 100 billion renminbi to improve
the water supply and address the air pollution problems in the past
few years and added that these improvements will be noted by the IOC
evaluation committee.</P>
      <P>As to the human rights issue, Wu said that the evaluation
committee will chiefly evaluate the capabilities and facilities of
the potential host city.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui might visit
his alma mater -- Cornell University -- in the United States again
this year at the invitation of the university, Foreign Affairs
Minister Tien Hung-mao said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The visit would be "very likely" should Lee decide to go, said
Tien, adding that the U.S. government has expressed that Lee is
welcome to visit the United States "any time" in his capacity as a
private citizen.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remarks as he answered lawmakers' questions at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee last visited Cornell in 1995 for a lecture trip, making him
the first ROC president to visit the United States and whipping up a
storm in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, as Beijing viewed the trip as
a move promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>When asked about the prospects of Lee visiting Japan, Tien said
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has adopted a hands-off stance
on the matter.</P>
      <P>It's completely up to Lee to decide whether and when to visit
Japan, Tien said, adding that MOFA would offer all possible help to
Lee when the time is ripe and should Lee notify the ministry.</P>
      <P>As to when Taiwan will establish a liaison office or
representative office in the European Union, Tien said he has visited
the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union,
and the European Parliament and was told that the European Union
would like to swap liaison offices with Taiwan after the island is
admitted to the World Trade Organization.</P>

between the two countries will never be affected by threats from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun and Vice

      <P>Chen asked Gukuna to convey his regards to Solomon Islands
Governor-General John Lapli, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and
Foreign Minister Danny Philip. He also invited them to visit the ROC.</P>
      <P>Relations between the two countries have been cordial since they

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged foreign
banks Tuesday to invest in the local monetary sector to help
streamline Taiwan's competitiveness in the area.</P>
      <P>At a dinner banquet hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce
(Amcham) in Taipei, Chen said that 2001 will be a vital year for the
transformation of the local financial sector as the government is
vigorously pushing ahead with financial reform by urging mergers of
local banking institutions.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan possesses a first-class manufacturing
industry and accordingly, has to develop a first-class financial
service industry as well.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of establishing a financial system conforming
with intentional standards, Chen said the government has enacted laws
on the merger of banking institutions and the establishment of asset
management companies, by which foreign banks are encouraged to merge
with or invest in local banks.</P>
      <P>Over 400 people, including Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, attended
the party, which AmCham President Peter Banko said was organized
especially to express his organization's thanks to the ROC government
for its help over the past year.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan's economic growth may slow down this year
as a result of global economic sluggishness, but added that the
government is now "well on track for a reviving economy" having
adopted a series of stimulating measures. He urged the foreign
companies with operations on the island to be confident of Taiwan's
economic future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR ENACTMENT OF REFERENDUM BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Wednesday
called for the enactment of a referendum bill on public policies so
as to protect the general public's rights of initiative and
referendum that are mandated by the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chang, however, said the referendum bill, to be enacted by the
Legislative Yuan, will not necessarily be related to the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Stressing his determination in safeguarding political stability,
Chang said it is keenly hoped that controversies over public policies
can be resolved constitutionally in accordance with relevant bills.</P>
      <P>The referendum bill, if enacted before long, can help resolve
rows over major public policies institutionally in order to save the
nation and people from paying too high a social cost, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that an ad hoc committee will soon be established under
the Executive Yuan to exclusively examine and evaluate the
feasibility of the enactment of a referendum bill. The ad hoc
committee is expected to make public its study results in three
months, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Central Election Commission Chairman Huang Shih-cheng
said the Executive Yuan's intention to hold an informal referendum or
use the administration's discretionary power to resolve the nuclear
power plant issue before a referendum bill is enacted "lacks
legitimacy."</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-held Executive Yuan halted
construction on the partially-completed fourth nuclear power plant
project last October and then bowed to opposition pressure to restart
work on it last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Displeased with the Executive Yuan's decision to restart the
project, the DPP is now actively promoting the enactment of a
referendum bill, hoping that a referendum can be held before the end
of this year to resolve the nuclear power plant controversy.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang, which maintains a majority in the
Legislative Yuan, has subtly shown disapproval with the DPP's
intention to promote a referendum. KMT Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng said the party will make its stance known after an ad hoc
group conducts a thorough study into the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NAT'L PALACE MUSEUM CONSIDERING SETTING UP BRANCH IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Palace Museum is considering
setting up an exhibition compound in southern Taiwan, the director of
the world-renowned museum confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tu Cheng-sheng stressed however that the plan is still undergoing
a cautious assessment process.</P>
      <P>Tu pointed out that Taiwan's development has invariably tilted
more toward the north than to the south, more toward the west than to
the east, and more toward Taiwan proper than to the offshore islands.
He said establishing a second exhibition compound would be aimed at
balancing cultural resources more evenly between northern and
southern Taiwan and at helping nurture arts and culture in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum is currently planning an expansion,
but the budget for such an expansion has been shelved in the
Legislature, and there are other factors to be taken into
consideration, Tu said. He added that the National Palace Museum will
reconsider whether to continue the expansion plan if the proposed
branch proposal is confirmed.</P>
      <P>As for the budget for the second exhibition compound, Tu said
that if the government supports the plan, it will not be too
difficult to carry out, even with the present financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>Tu is scheduled to travel to southern Taiwan Saturday to meet
with local authorities in Tainan and Kaohsiung to discuss the
possibility of setting up the second exhibition compound in one of
those locations.</P>
      <P>To meet the expectations of the people in southern Taiwan, Tu
said he will not rule out setting up the branch in a place other than
Tainan or Kaohsiung so long as the other southern Taiwan cities or
counties can forge a consensus and express their sincere wish for the
branch to him.</P>
      <P>Tu said he would invite celebrated architects to design the
proposed second compound, hoping that the new branch will present a
new aesthetic experience beyond that of the typical traditional
palace design to the public.</P>
      <P>He added that the proposed second exhibition compound will not
only contain collections from the current museum, which houses many
priceless Chinese artifacts and pieces of art, but will also display
various indigenous Taiwanese art works and artifacts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China reported Tuesday
that Taiwan citizens spent a total of US$8.1 billion on overseas
travel in 2000, marking the highest level in three years.</P>
      <P>The figure represented a US$709 million increase over the total
spent on travel abroad in 1999. Overseas business travel expenses
totaled US$1.98 billion, while personal travel expenses amounted to
US$6.12 billion, the central bank said.</P>

showing that Taiwan's travel industry had total earnings of US$4.12
billion in 2000, representing an increase of US$547 million over the

      <P>The income obtained from business travelers was US$1.47 billion,

      <P>Taiwan citizens spent a total of US$1.78 billion on overseas

million compared with the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's travel industry pulled in a total of US$1.09 billion for
the fourth quarter of last year, marking a drop of US$14 million for
the same period the previous year.</P>
      <P>The 1999 earnings of Taiwan travel industry increased by only
US$199 million over the level for 1998 due to a major earthquake that
struck the island in Sept. 1999, officials said.</P>
      <P>Tourists however "flowed back" to the island last year, leading
to a significant increase in travel industry income, which broke the
US$4 billion barrier, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials added that Taiwan citizens' spending on overseas
travel broke the US$8 billion mark in 2000, showing a significant
increase in the number of Taiwan people traveling overseas in the
year after the quake struck.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING REITERATES OPPOSITION TO EX-ROC PRESIDENT'S VISIT TO U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By J. J. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting mainland Chinese official
reiterated Tuesday Beijing's opposition to any form of visit to the
United States by former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Zhou Mingwei, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
mainland China's State Council or Cabinet, made the remarks in
response to a press inquiry after delivering a speech on
relations across the Taiwan Strait at the invitation of the National
Council on U.S.-(mainland) China Relations, a New York-based think
tank.</P>
      <P>Zhou said Lee's U.S. visit is a very sensitive topic and that if
the American government grants a visa to Lee again, it would
certainly have adverse impact on Beijing-Washington and
Beijing-Taipei relations.</P>
      <P>Despite his retirement from the ROC presidency last May, Zhou
went on, Lee remains a "political figure" in Taiwan and still has a
clout in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Worse yet, Zhou claimed that Lee was the initiator of the "two
states" theory, referring to Lee's remarks made in an interview with
a German radio station in July 1999 that Taiwan-mainland China
relations should be conducted on a "special state-to-state" basis.</P>
      <P>Before Lee forsakes the so-called "two states" theory, Zhou
said, Beijing would oppose Lee's visit to the United States no
matter which form it may take.</P>
      <P>Zhou also reminded the U.S. government of the grave consequence
of its approval of a Lee visit to the United States more than
five years ago.</P>
      <P>Lee made a private visit to his alma mater, Cornell University,
in June 1995 for an alumni reunion. The move enraged Beijing and thus
triggered a Taiwan Strait crisis. As Beijing regarded Lee's trip as a
veiled strategy to promote Taiwan independence, it lobbed missiles
and conducted live-fire military drills in waters near Taiwan
between 1995 autumn and early 1996. The crisis ended only after the
U.S. government sent two aircraft carriers battle groups to the
region to signify its determination to maintain peace in the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing would take similar actions if the U.S.
government issues a visa to Lee again, Zhou didn't make a direct
reply. He instead said such a move would hurt both U.S.-mainalnd
China relations and cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's news media reported recently that Lee, who has a
Ph.D. in agricultural economy from Cornell University, is likely
to visit his alma mater this year at the invitation of school
authority.</P>
      <P>However, Linda Grace-Kobas, director of Cornell University's
press service office, told CNA in a telephone interview Tuesday that
the school has so far not issued any invitation to Lee nor has it
had any concrete plans to invite Lee in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee is an outstanding alumnus, Grace-Kobas said
Cornell University welcomes Lee's visit at any time. Nevertheless,
Grace-Kobas admitted that Cornell cannot unilaterally
determine whether Lee can truly visit the school because his entry
visa requires the approval of the Department of State and other
relevant U.S. government agencies.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas further said that Cornell University set up a world
affairs forum, known as the Lee Teng-hui Professor of World Affairs,
in 1994 with a fund of US$2.5 million jointly donated by Lee's
friends and the school's other alumni.</P>
      <P>Except for this, Grace-Kobas said none of the buildings being
constructed on the campus is named after Lee.</P>
      <P>Grace-Kobas also said she has no knowledge about a report that
Lee's granddaughter Lee Kun-yi is now studying at Cornell
University. Lee's granddaughter was originally studied in Europe.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan, had made strenuous efforts to promote Taiwan's
democratization during his 12-year presidential tenure.</P>
      <P>Despite Beijing's loud opposition, he managed to make low-profile
visits to Britain and the Czech Republic in the second half of last
year after his retirement. His departure from the presidency also
marked an end to the Kuomintang's 55-year rule of Taiwan and the
ROC's first-ever democratic transfer of power between different
political parties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL URGES GOV'TS TO TAKE UP AIDS CHALLENGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Declaring the HIV/AIDS epidemic "the most
formidable development challenge of our time," U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday called on governments around the world to
secure a global commitment for intensified and coordinated action.
, He made the appeal in a report issued in preparation for the U.N.
General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS, which will take place
in New York City June 25-27, 2001. The first round of substantive
negotiations for the special session is set to take place in the week
of Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>The report calls on governments around the world to intensify and
broaden their political and financial commitments in their response
to the AIDS crisis. Alarmed by the accelerating epidemic and its
global impact, the General Assembly decided in November 2000 to hold
a special session on HIV/AIDS at the highest political level.</P>
      <P>The scheduling of the session followed calls for concrete action
that were made at the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted
in September 2000 by world leaders at the Millennium Summit.</P>
      <P>More specifically, the report calls on governments worldwide to
meet a set of seven critical challenges that will help reverse the
spread of the HIV/AIDS.</P>
      <P>These challenges are effective leadership and coordination, the
alleviation of the social and economic impact of the epidemic, the
reduction in the vulnerability of particular social groups to HIV
infection, the achievement of agreed upon targets for the prevention
of HIV infection, the ensuring of the fact that care and support are
available to people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS, the development
of relevant and effective international commodities, and the
mobilization of the necessary level of financial resources.</P>
      <P>According to the report, by the end of 2000, 36.1 million men,
women and children around the world were living with HIV or AIDS and
21.8 million had died from the disease. The same year saw an
estimated 5.3 million new infections globally and 3 million deaths,
the highest annual total of AIDS deaths ever.</P>
      <P>Asia has so far escaped the high infection rates registered in
Africa. Only three countries -- Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand --
have prevalence rates exceeding 1 percent of those aged between 15
and 49 years. But infections are rising. In South Asia and Southeast
Asia, 780,000 adults, two-thirds of them men, became infected during
the past year. East Asia and the Pacific region registered 130,000
new infections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOF PREDICTS LOW GROWTH IN EXPORTS, IMPORTS FOR FEBRUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export and import growth rates for
February 2001 will stand at a low level compared with the same period
last year, the Ministry of Finance predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The growth rate for the island's exports for February is
predicted to be 7 percent, while the growth rate for imports is
expected to be 6.5 percent, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the MOF show that in the first half of
February, Taiwan's exports totaled US$5.35 billion and its imports
amounted to US$5.96, for a trade deficit of US$608 million for the
period.</P>
      <P>The MOF said it is too early to determine whether there will be a
deficit for the month as a whole because of the large amount of
revenue expected from the fishery industry at the end of the
month.</P>
      <P>The statistics suggested a slowdown in Taiwan's trade expansion
due to the cooling of the global economy. Exports for the year to
Feb. 16 totaled US$14.65 billion and imports totaled US$14.31
billion, marking a 7.9 percent and 2.3 percent drop, respectively,
over the same period the previous year. The trade surplus of US$348
million for the period was 72.5 percent lower than that for the same
period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Analyzing prospects for the near future, the MOF said the
slowdown in the U.S. economy will have a great impact on the island's
electronics exports because of decreased demand, leading to only
slight growth in exports.</P>
      <P>The island is expected to achieve only a 4.2 percent export
growth rate and 3.4 percent growth rate in imports for 2001,
according to the Executive Yuan's Bureau of Accounting, Budget and
Statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MAY CONSIDER INCLUDING TAIWAN ON OLYMPIC TORCH ROUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Peng Si-chou and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing may consider including Taiwan on
the Olympic torch relay route if the mainland Chinese capital city is
awarded the right to host the 2008 Games, sources from the Beijing
city government said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Beijing officials, however, declined to comment on whether the
inclusion of Taiwan will help ease the cross-strait stalemate.</P>
      <P>Currently, the pivotal concern of the Beijing city authorities is
how to win the opportunity to host the 2008 Games, noted an official,
adding that other matters can be discussed later.</P>
      <P>The official noted that the whole city is in high gear working
toward the same goal -- hosting the 2008 Olympic Games -- as 17
International Olympic Committee inspectors have arrived in the
capital for a four-day inspection tour starting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As the Olympic inspectors' assessment report will be crucial to
Beijing's chances of hosting the Olympics, Beijing has done
everything it can -- including giving the city a complete facelift
and having Beijing Vice Mayor Liu Jingmin meet the inspectors in
person upon their arrival at the airport -- to please the 17
inspectors.</P>
      <P>Beijing will have to beat out four other cities also bidding for
the Olympic Games -- Osaka, Paris, Istanbul and Toronto -- for the
right to host the event.</P>
      <P>Some residents worry that Beijing lags behind competitors such as
Toronto and Paris in economic development and quality of
infrastructure, but some are confident, saying that mainland China
has a great chance of winning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE MINISTER CLARIFIES NUCLEAR WASTE DISPOSAL PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said
Wednesday that the nuclear waste the Republic of China plans to
commission Russia to treat is low radiation, not highly radioactive
waste as had been reported by local media.</P>
      <P>Lin said the ROC's state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower)
struck a deal several years ago for shipping 5,000 barrels of low
radioactive nuclear waste to Russia for permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>"But the contract with Russia has so far not been implemented,"
Lin said, adding that Taipower cannot export its nuclear waste until
after the Russian parliament passes an amendment to its environmental
law and the Russian government issues an import permit.</P>
      <P>Lin further clarified that under the Taipower-Russian agreement,
the nuclear waste will not be shipped back to Taiwan after being
treated in Russia. "The waste will be buried in Russia permanently,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>As for a proposed U.S.-Russian cooperative plan, Lin said, the
program is basically designed for disposal of highly radioactive
nuclear waste. "We have not participated in that program and the
Taipower-Russian deal also has nothing to do with it," he added.</P>
      <P>Lin made the clarification after Russian environmental activists
staged a demonstration Monday in front of the lower house of the
Russian parliament, also known as the State Duma, in protest of a
Russian government plan to allow entry of nuclear waste from Taiwan,
South Korea and other countries for permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>The Russian demonstrators also unveiled a detailed program
allegedly designed to treat and accommodate nuclear waste from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A senior Taipower executive seconded Lin's remarks, stressing
that the nuclear waste Taipower intends to ship abroad for disposal
is all low radiation waste and will not cause safety concern.</P>
      <P>The material that draws international concern and controversy is
high-radioactive waste that can be recycled for military use, the
executive said, adding that such kind of waste is not covered in the
Taipower-Russian deal.</P>
      <P>The executive further said he was confused by a local media
report that the Taipower waste will be shipped back to Taiwan after
being treated in Russia. "In fact, no low-radioactive waste needs to
be shipped back to home country after overseas treatment," he added.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower sources, the United States plans to
cooperate with Russia in building a dump in Siberia for permanent
burial of high-radioactive nuclear waste from around the world to
prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons by using recycled
radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>In the past, South Korea once planned to ship high-radioactive
nuclear waste to France and Sweden for treatment, but the United
States vetoed such a plan for fears that Seoul might use the recycled
material for production of nuclear weapons.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS DIVIDED OVER WHO SHOULD FILE TOBACCO DAMAGE CLAIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan lawmakers were divided Wednesday
over who should sponsor the filing of a damage claim worth about
US$2.6 billion against U.S. tobacco firms.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chen Chao-jung and Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lin Yao-hsing, in collaboration with the John Tung
Foundation, jointly proclaimed in a press conference that the damage
claim should be filed by a city government, such as the Taipei city
government, rather than the nation, to avoid the move from being
pan-politicized.</P>
      <P>In a position paper, the John Tung Foundation, a non-profit
anti-smoking crusade, said that in view of Taiwan's "uniquely
special" political status in the international community, if the
lawsuit was filed by Taiwan in its capacity as a nation, it would
carry certain risks and encounter difficulties.</P>
      <P>However, it went on, if the lawsuit were to be filed by a city,
the prospects of success would be relatively higher and that it is
therefore the duty of a local government to take the action.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, legislators Wang Hsueh-feng and Lai Ching-lin from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party insisted that the damage claim
should be filed by Taiwan as a nation, saying that the Executive Yuan
would give Taiwan a better chance of winning the lawsuit because of
its superior clout in terms of diplomacy, law and health resources.</P>
      <P>Fifteen civil groups, including the John Tung Foundation, plan to
file the civil lawsuit by May 31 when the world observes "World No
Tobacco Day," accusing the U.S. tobacco companies of intentionally
covering up the harm their products do to consumers.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation estimates there are some 650,000 tobacco
consumers in Taipei City alone and that according to U.S. law, the
total worth of damage claims may amount to NT$85 billion (US$2.6
billion).</P>
      <P>The U.S. tobacco firms have for long insisted that smoking is not
addictive, which is a lie, said a foundation official.</P>
      <P>With 30 local governments and countries such as Guatemala,
Venezuela and Nicaragua filing lawsuits against multinational
companies for their practices -- including allegedly adding chemical
substances to increase addiction -- Prof. Yao Szu-yuan of Chinese
Culture University said that Taiwan should also take action to demand
compensation for getting the youth of Taiwan hooked on smoking.</P>
      <P>According to research conducted by National Taiwan University, 15
percent of male subjects who died during a nine-year study perished
due to smoking-related causes, while the same factors accounted for
10 percent of female deaths.</P>
      <P>Smokers are 1.3 times more likely than non-smokers to die of
complications related to smoking, the research indicated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Chen Chao-jung said that if indeed the
government files a tobacco damage lawsuit, the move should first be
directed toward the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Board, which supplies
more than 55 percent of tobacco products in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Wednesday
that the Republic of China is willing to provide Paraguay with
experience in developing and establishing its medical and hygiene
system.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when she received visiting Paraguayan Vice
President Julio Cesar Franco Gomez and his wife.</P>
      <P>Lu expressed appreciation to her Paraguayan counterpart for
speaking for the Republic of China in its bid to join the United
Nations during the U.N. General Assembly last year.</P>
      <P>She said that pushing for the ROC's entry into the U.N. has been
her "lifelong goal and ideal," adding that Paraguay is the only ally
of the ROC in South America and that although their countries are
geographically distant, they have had close exchanges and
cooperation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Franco lauded Lu as someone with firm beliefs and
convictions, as well as a strong sense of responsibility toward the
land and the people of Taiwan, as well as a pursuer of justice,
freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>He said that Paraguay's advocacy of the ROC's cause in the U.N.
General Assembly underscores the unswerving support of Taiwan, and
added that his visit will further solidify the friendship.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that the ROC will become an important supporter
of Paraguay in South America and will further cooperate in the
cultural, technological and trade fields, especially in the support
of medical resources.</P>
      <P>Lu responded by saying that the ROC is willing to provide its
experience in establishing medical and hygiene systems and that she
hopes Paraguay will continue to support the ROC's bid to enter the
World Health Organization so that Taiwan will have the chance to help
other countries that lack medical resources, as part of its efforts
to reciprocate to the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL EMPLOYERS TO BE ALLOWED TO HIRE FILIPINO WORKERS DIRECTLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local employers will be able to directly
hire workers from the Philippines without going through brokerages of
both countries, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CLA officials made the announcement after the Executive Yuan
approved a Jan. 1 memorandum of understanding on the direct hiring of
Filipino workers and issued guidelines on carrying out the direct
hiring plan.</P>
      <P>They noted that the exploitation of foreign workers by labor
brokers has long been a serious problem, affecting the rights of both
the employers and foreign workers.</P>
      <P>The direct hiring plan allows local employers to hire Filipino
workers through the Philippine government rather than private sector
assistance.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that foreign workers will save up to NT$100,000
(US$3,086) in brokerage expenses. The new system will also help curb
the monopoly of the brokers on foreign workers.</P>
      <P>According to the memorandum of understanding, which was signed
between the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in the Philippines
and its Taiwan counterpart, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office
(MECO), both sides agree that direct hiring will be on a trial basis
and will not replace the recruitment system of broker companies.</P>
      <P>The wages for Filipino workers will be agreed upon on the basis
that such agreement will not affect the welfare of the workers or the
regulations of both countries, according to the new measure.</P>
      <P>Both countries also agreed that MECO will work closely with the
Taiwan authorities to rigorously screen the applications of Taiwan
employers to hire foreign workers and that Filipino workers hired in
this way will be protected by Taiwan's labor regulations.</P>
      <P>MECO will also be responsible for ensuring that its recruit
mechanism meets the needs of local employers.</P>
      <P>Labor officials noted that some local people have complained that
Taiwan employers pay more to foreign workers than their counterparts
in Hong Kong and Singapore and have demanded that foreign laborers'
wages be de-linked from local workers' wages.</P>
      <P>But the officials said that from the angle of human rights, basic
labor wages should apply to local and foreign laborers alike in order
to avoid the condemnation of international labor organizations.</P>
      <P>They said that Hong Kong and Singapore have no basic wage system,
resulting in a big gap between wages for local and foreign workers.</P>
      <P>They said that although the average monthly wage for local people
is higher than the basic wage of NT$15,840 (US$488), some minority
groups of workers still rely on the protection provided by the basic
wage. They added that revoking the basic wage system, leaving pay
scales to reflect market forces, would adversely affect such workers.</P>

between different political parties last year.</P>
      <P>Liberal International, a London-based association of major
liberal political parties around the world, decided to award the
prize to Chen at a recent meeting of its Executive Committee held in
Brussels.</P>
      <P>Steel, who served as Liberal International chairman from 1992
through 1994, said the Prize for Freedom was designed to recognize
people who have contributed to freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>In his view, Steel said, the award is not only a personal honor
for Chen but also a recognition of Taiwan's progress in freedom and
democratic reform.</P>
      <P>Steel said he also hopes that Chen will be able to personally
receive the prize in Copenhagen and promised to do his utmost to help
push for Chen's visit to the Danish capital.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said he is more than willing to travel to
Denmark to receive the prize on behalf of the ROC government and
people.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on to say wryly that he is afraid he may
not have the "freedom" to receive the "Prize for Freedom" because of
political pressure. "And if I'm really forced to cancel the trip, it
will be very ironic," he noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, which claims sovereignty over Taiwan, has
consistently opposed visits by the ROC president, vice president and
other senior officials to countries that recognize Beijing. Denmark
maintains formal diplomatic ties with Beijing, does not recognize
Taipei, and it was unclear whether the Danish government would grant
Chen a visa if he were to file an application.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Chen said he was impressed by Steel's
courage when Steel said in a public speech recently that mainland
China has no legitimate right to claim sovereignty over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to Steel's remarks that senior ROC officials are
welcome to visit Scotland, Chen said he really hopes to make a visit.
"I hope our third meeting can take place in the Scottish parliament,"
he told Steel.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that he likes the Hollywood movie
"Braveheart," which depicts the story of Scottish nationalist hero
William Wallace. "I have often recommended this film to my friends
and students," he said, adding that the people of Taiwan, like their
Scottish counterparts, treasure the values of freedom, democracy and
human rights.</P>
      <P>"And it seems to me that our people have a special affection for
Scotland, as more than half of Taiwan-financed companies in Britain
are located there," Chen said, adding that Taiwan is now one of the
four largest foreign capital suppliers to Scotland.</P>
      <P>David Coates, director-general of the British Trade and Cultural
Office in Taipei, was also present at the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>80 PERCENT OF LOCAL OFFICE EMPLOYEES WISH TO CHANGE JOBS: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 80 percent of office employees in
Taiwan would like to change their jobs, according to the findings of
a recent online survey.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted by www.ctcareer.com.tw found that about 80
percent of local office workers have thought of changing jobs because
of the dim prospects of their current occupations.</P>
      <P>Some 11 percent of the people surveyed said they are worried that
they may lose their jobs, but have no idea whether they have a chance
of finding another, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>As to the question of the major reason behind their wish to shift
to other companies, some 40 percent claimed that it is because they
have little confidence in their company's future development, while
nearly 40 percent said they wish to do so as part of their personal
career path.</P>
      <P>Asked about the channels they will use to seek new jobs, 92
percent of the respondents replied that they would consider using an
online executive search company, ahead of 72 percent who said they
would search classified ads. Only a very small ratio said they would
seek help through relatives, friends, government institutions or
employment fairs.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 38 percent of the respondents said that
temporary workers should be the first to go when a company is
planning to trim its workforce, ahead of 31 percent who said
administration personnel are the most expendable. Some 14 and 18
percent, respectively, said that manufacturing workers and grassroots
workers should be first to be laid off, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out online during January 5-20, received
1,497 valid responses.</P>

      <P>Soong said that he has tried to persuade PFP Vice Chairman Chang

the Examination Yuan Wu Jung-ming and former Justice Minister Liao

      <P>All three posts are regarded as major battlefields in the coming

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIR PITCHES FOR NATIONAL UNIFICATION COUNCIL MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government
Wednesday to convene a National Unification Council (NUC) meeting as
soon as possible to cope with the new cross-Taiwan Strait situation.</P>
      <P>Lien further said at a weekly meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee that the DPP minority government should also
attach great importance to the Guidelines for National Unification,
which was unveiled by the previous KMT government on Feb. 23, 1991.</P>
      <P>Noting that the guidelines spell out the principles and positive
steps that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can take to expedite
China's unification, Lien said the guidelines can not only serve as
a guarantee to Taiwan's security but also provides a blueprint for
the development of cross-strait relations and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Lien said while the KMT was in power, it had formulated its
policy toward mainland China based on the guidelines. "Nowadays, the
KMT is no longer at the helm. But we'll still follow the guidelines
in formulating our mainland policy as the guidelines can benefit our
national interests and the common well-being of our people."</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks after hearing a report by Chang Jung-kung,
director of the KMT's mainland affairs department, on the
development of cross-strait ties in line with the guidelines.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, Lien said, China's unification
should be achieved in three phases. "And this gradual, sequential
plan can safeguard the Republic of China's national dignity and
simultaneously lay a foundation for reciprocal exchanges between the
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait," Lien explained.</P>
      <P>As the guidelines' 10th anniversary will come on Friday, Lien
urged the current DPP government to pay more heed to the ideals,
goals and spirit of the guidelines and call an NUC meeting to craft
out new strategy for the development of cross-strait ties under the
new situation.</P>
      <P>As a protracted cross-strait stalemate will do no good to either
side of the Taiwan Strait, Lien also suggested that the DPP
government return to the "1992 consensus" to facilitate resumption
of the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the "1992 consensus," which allows both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to "agree to disagree" on the definition of "one
China," complies with the spirit of the ROC constitution and the
unification guidelines and nearly all major opposition parties in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The DPP government should respect this mainstream public opinion
and take positive steps to facilitate resumption of cross-strait
dialogue," Lien urged.</P>
      <P>In his report on the development of cross-strait relations over
the past decade, Chang Jung-kung said since President Chen Shui-bian
promised in his inaugural speech on May 20, 2000 not to abolish the
NUC and the unification guidelines, he should honor his
promise and convene an NUC meeting as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the unification guidelines have withstood various
tests over the past decade, Chang urged Chen's administration to
treasure the guidelines and refer to its principles and spirit in
shaping its policy toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>During the weekly meeting, several members of the KMT Central
Standing Committee, also stressed the importance of the unification
guidelines and the "1992 consensus." They further suggested that the
KMT, which still controls a comfortable majority in the Legislative
Yuan, takes the initiative in making the guidelines and the "1992
consensus" the ROC's new laws.</P>
      <P>A number of KMT legislators present at the meeting said if
the guidelines and the "1992 consensus" are enshrined into the
ROC's legal code, the DPP government would have no excuse to shun
these principles in handling cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>As the overture may involve complicated issues, Lien didn't make
a definite decision. He instead ordered relevant KMT units to conduct
a further study of the proposal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM CONFIRMS MOFA IS MULLING PLANS FOR OVERSEAS TRIP FOR PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao confirmed Wednesday that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) is considering plans for an overseas trip for President Chen
Shui-bian, but has made no final decision yet.</P>
      <P>Tien said that if Chen wants to make a stopover in the United
States en route to his destination, all major cities on the U.S.
mainland could be considered. Tien stressed that the schedule of the
2001 ROC Naval Flotilla now heading for the Marshall Islands for a
goodwill visit will not affect the scheduling of Chen's expected
overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Tien made the remark in response to local press inquiries about
the president's upcoming overseas trip.</P>
      <P>Local mass media quoted Lee Ying-yuan, deputy ROC representative
to the United States, as reporting that Chen would stop over in
Houston during his trip to Central America.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the MOFA is considering the many different
conditions that future presidential overseas trips may face, so the
final decision has not yet made.</P>
      <P>Tien pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian does not play
golf, so Hawaii will not be a likely choice as a transit stop. He
said major cities on the U.S. mainland will be more suitable for a
stopover.</P>
      <P>However, the final decision will be up to the president himself,
Tien said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports said that the 2001 ROC Naval Flotilla, which
is conducting a transoceanic training program, might cancel its
original plan to make a port call at El Salvador, which was recently
struck by a devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>President Chen is scheduled to attend an upcoming summit for
heads of state of the ROC and its Central American allies, and the
schedule of the flotilla will no necessarily timed to coincide with
the visit of the president, the minister said.</P>
      <P>The summit was originally set to be held in San Salvador in
March, but due to the killer temblor that rattled El Salvador, the
meeting is likely to be postponed to May or June, Tien added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland Chinese scholar predicted
recently that there will be no crisis in the Taiwan Strait over the
next four years because Taiwan, mainland China and the United States
all have their own strategic considerations.</P>
      <P>Tao Wenzhao, deputy director of the Institute of North America
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, made the remarks at a
recent seminar in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tao said Taiwan's new Democratic Progressive Party-led government
is not expected to take any dangerous moves in cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs in the foreseeable future since the island's political and
economic developments have not gone on the right track.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tao went on, the United States will also not take
any dramatic steps in the region as it prefers to see the
continuation of the current status quo of "no war, no reconciliation,
no unification and no independence."</P>
      <P>As for mainland China, Tao said the Beijing leadership has
already stated clearly that it will focus efforts on economic
development over the next decade.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Tao said he is convinced that the Taiwan
Strait will remain stable at least in the coming four years.</P>
      <P>Jia Qingguo, deputy head of the Peking University's
International Relations College, seconded Tao's views, saying that
America's new Bush administration is unlikely to make any dramatic
adjustments of the U.S. policies on cross-Taiwan Strait issues
because Washington has consistently demanded a peaceful solution to
Beijing-Taipei disputes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO SUPPORT PLEBISCITE BILL BUT NOT REFERENDUM ON NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang will support the enactment
of a plebiscite bill, but opposes holding a referendum on the
island's fourth nuclear plant, a party official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking after a meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee, KMT spokesman Wang Chih-kang said that his party, which
controls more than half of all legislative seats, will support the
bill's enactment after full consultations with its allied parties in
the legislature. But he stressed that Kuomintang is strenuously
opposed to having a plebiscite on the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>He said the controversies surrounding the plant had ended after
the Executive Yuan bowed to the opposition's pressure on Feb. 14
and ordered that the plant's construction be restarted.</P>
      <P>The public is already tired of the fierce bickering between
politicians over the issue and any attempts by the administration to
vindicate its anti-nuclear stance by staging a plebiscite over the
issue would backfire, according to the KMT spokesman.</P>
      <P>Wang quoted Liu Chao-shiuan, a member of the KMT Central Standing
Committee, as accusing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
of trying to make the nuclear plant an issue in the year-end
legislative elections by dragging out the political bickering over
it.</P>
      <P>Kao Yu-jen, another member of the KMT Central Standing Committee,
echoed Liu's view. Kao was quoted as arguing that the DPP was trying
to launch a plebiscite, which would not be legally binding in the
absence of a plebiscite law, for political gains.</P>
      <P>Brandishing a DPP position paper over the issue published last
October, the Kuomintang spokesman said the DPP had itself argued in
the paper that a plebiscite is not the proper means to settle
controversies stemming from the nuclear plant, because of the
disturbance it might cause.</P>
      <P>He questioned what he called the DPP administration's quick
waffling on the issue.</P>
      <P>The KMT's criticism was supported by its ally in the Legislative
Yuan, the People's First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>Shen Chih-hui, PFP whip at the Legislative Yuan, criticized the
premier's decision to go ahead with a "consultative plebiscite" on
the nuclear plant without any legal ground would be "a dictatorial
move in defiance of public opinion."</P>
      <P>The Cabinet flip-flop on the issue has destroyed the trust
between the ruling and opposition parties, soured the ties between
the Executive and Legislative Yuans, and taken a heavy toll on the
nation's economy, Shen said.</P>
      <P>Now while the country is struggling to put the controversy behind
it and move ahead, the DPP is attempting to reopen old wounds and
squander the nation's scarce energies on a dispute that has already
been settled, according to Shen.</P>
      <P>She warned the premier not to stage a plebiscite and again plunge
the country into bitter political fighting.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey by Business Weekly
indicates that over 80 percent of major companies in Taiwan are
looking to the government to improve the domestic investment
environment.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted among 486 firms, all of which
are either listed on the securities exchange or allowed to engage in
over-the-counter dealing, between Feb. 8-13. Some 62 percent of the
companies gave valid responses to the survey.</P>
      <P>Seventy-two percent expressed their dissatisfaction with the
government's handling of the issue concerning the island's fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided to halt construction of the plant last
October, but under pressure from the Legislative Yuan, it recently
announced the resumption of the construction work.</P>
      <P>About 73 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the
performance of the Ministry of Economics Affairs (MOEA) in improving
Taiwan's investment environment, while 68 percent showed
disappointment over the island's general economic environment.</P>
      <P>When asked about the most urgent MOEA tasks, 82 percent pointed
to "improving the investment environment," 60 percent said "revising
the policy regarding making investment on the mainland," and 50
percent favored "resolving the controversy over the fourth nuclear
power plant."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, eleven percent went so far as to demand
the replacement of the economics minister.</P>
      <P>A researcher with the Social Research Institute of Academia
Sinica said the surveyed firms, which represent the country's large-
and medium-sized enterprises, were obviously dissatisfied with the
MOEA's performance because it has failed to smoothly carry out the
policies adopted by the previous government or to present new ones.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tomorrow Times (www.tTimes.com.tw),
Taiwan's first online-only newspaper, halted operations Wednesday,
citing financial troubles.</P>
      <P>Times Chairman Jan Hung-chi, who is also the CEO and publisher of
PC Home Publishing Group, apologized to the newspaper's stockholders
and nearly 300 employees at a rare company-wide meeting for what he
said was his "erroneous timing to enter the online media market."</P>
      <P>He pledged that 150 employees will be recommended to take up
posts at the three magazines that Hong Kong-based Internet and
magazine publisher Next Media plans to launch in Taiwan, while the
rest will be laid off with recommendations from him to work for
"other organizations."</P>
      <P>Next Media is owned by Hong Kong publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, who
owns the mass circulation Apple Daily and Next magazine in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Jan added that the employees have the right to choose whether to
accept the transfer arrangements.</P>
      <P>Calling the paper "an experiment that has nurtured a seedling
group in digital content production and management," Jan lamented
that he had been unsuccessful in trying to seek funding to bail out
the debt-ridden paper from "like-minded enterprises" over the past
four months.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment last February, the paper has amassed
NT$300 million (US$9.3 million) in debt due to difficulties in
attaining advertising revenue, which accounts for 70 percent of the
paper's income.</P>
      <P>Published entirely online, the paper had been hard-pressed to
keep up with competition from online papers that are supported by
"pulp" versions, including the United Daily News and the China Times.</P>
      <P>Jan said that the paper's parent company will continue to operate
and will transform itself into what he called an Internet company
that relies on the resources accumulated from its newspaper
experiences to provide payment-based "digital information services."</P>
      <P>The details of a concrete proposal are still being worked out,
and the company stockholders will then determine its viability, he
added. He declined to comment on whether the company may enter into
cooperative deals with Next Media in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Media Watch Foundation Chairwoman and National
Taiwan University law professor Ho De-fen said that Internet news
will be a trend in the future, but that traditional media will not be
replaced as quickly as once thought.</P>
      <P>She said that although her foundation had given its blessing to
the experiment of the online paper, it had also expressed concern for
issues such as hardware limitations, the high volume of fragmentary
news, and the identification of its online readership.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LARGE-SCALE TAIWAN TRADE FAIR TO BE HELD IN ISTANBUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ankara,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Kuo Chuan-hsin and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan trade delegations arrived in
Istanbul Wednesday to prepare for a large-scale Taiwan trade fair
held Thursday in the largest Turkish industrial and commercial city.</P>
      <P>Products on display will include high-tech computer peripheral
equipment, electronic parts and components, construction materials,
hardware utensils, household electric appliances, textile products,
synthetic leather, communications devices, office furniture, auto
parts and components, consumer goods, stationery goods, and
cosmetics.</P>
      <P>Huang Wen-rong, head of the Istanbul office of Taiwan's China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA), which organized the trade
fair, said this is its first such event of the year.</P>
      <P>Presently, more than 300 Turkish manufacturers have registered to
visit the exhibition, which is expected to create new trade
opportunities for Taiwan manufacturers in Turkey.</P>
      <P>In the first eleven months of last year, the value of Taiwan
exports to Turkey totaled US$423.8 million, while that of imports
from Turkey reached US$68.1 million. Both figures represented
significant increases compared with the levels of the previous year,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said products on display are all in great demand on the
Turkish market, adding that this will be a good chance for both
Taiwanese and Turkish industries to expand their markets.</P>
      <P>He encouraged Turkish manufacturers to frequent the various
CETRA-organized trade fairs in order to balance two-way trade between
Taiwan and Turkey.</P>
      <P>In addition to assisting Taiwan businessmen in exhibiting their
products, CETRA's Istanbul office will also arrange for them to visit
the Istanbul Free Trade Zone and other Turkish trade establishments.</P>
      <P>Before arriving in Istanbul, the two Taiwan trade delegations had
held similar trade fairs in Greece, Italy, Morocco, Tunisia and
Egypt.</P>
      <P>Members of the two trade delegations are scheduled to depart
Turkey for home Feb. 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RULES OUT COALITION FOR TAIWAN IN INTERVIEW WITH BBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb.  21 (CNA)
(By Mark Chu-lin Ou &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung told the BBC in
an interview post Wednesday on the broadcasting company's website
that a government which represents the whole people is more suitable
for Taiwan than a coalition.</P>
      <P>Asked by BBC whether an coalition would be more capable of
fending off political crisis such as the one stems from the island's
fourth nuclear plant, Chang said in a written response that there is
difficulty in forming a coalition given the great political
discrepancies between the major political parties.</P>
      <P>And an uneasy coalition between parties with conflicting views is
not a better assurance of political stability than the current
government which takes into account the interests of the whole
people, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Instead of being a cause of disturbances, political competition
between different parties over various issues and the opposition's
close monitor of the government's policy is natural under the
democracy.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taipei and Beijing didn't see eye to eye on the "one
China" issue, Chang called on the two sides to set aside their
differences and seek common grounds through dialogue and exchanges.</P>
      <P>He told the BBC, the launch of direct trade and shipping links
between Taiwan's two frontline islands and mainland China, known in
Taiwan as "mini-three links", is intended to create an friendly
atmosphere between Taipei and Beijing and promote the prosperity of
Kinmen and Matsu, the two frontline island.</P>
      <P>He said he is pleased with Beijing's pragmatic reaction to the
mini-three links, and believed the move has turned the page on
confrontation and ushered in a new era of "co-existence" in bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>He predicted that contacts between the two sides will intensify
once they are admitted to the World Trade Organization which is
expected later this year, and the room for complementary cooperation
between the two sides will be enlarged, providing that they can
overcome the challenges ensuing their WTO membership.</P>
      <P>He played down the possibility that the island's heavily
dependence on mainland China in economy will jeopardize its safety,
saying that his government is working on a safety mechanism to avoid
the risk sparked by its too close economic integration with mainland
China.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China on Wednesday extended
a medical cooperation agreement with Gambia for five years with an
accompanying increase in financial aid.</P>
      <P>The ROC Executive Yuan ratified the agreement, which was signed

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MILITARY'S APPROACH TO TAIWAN  WORRIES FORMER U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The high-handed approach of mainland
military leaders toward Taiwan and the succession of its political
leaders are two factors which will influence future political
developments in Asia, said a former U.S. official Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, former U.S. assistant secretary of state in the
Clinton administration, told a symposium staged by U.S. magazine
Business Week that military leaders in Beijing could force the
mainland's supreme leader to take a tougher stand on Taiwan and force
the unification of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The succession of Beijing leaders is another question that could
cause unrest in the country and thereby disrupt stability in the
region.</P>
      <P>However, Roth said, he didn't think the economic reforms which
have brought prosperity to mainland China will be reversed because of
any changes in Beijing's leadership.</P>
      <P>As to the entire Asian region, Roth said that despite the
potential military conflict on the Korea Peninsula and the
territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea, the related
parties are not likely to appeal to military force to settle their
differences.</P>
      <P>He said that prospects are bright for regional peace and
stability in general, despite some domestic problems plaguing several
countries.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the low popularity of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori and South Korean President Kim Dai-chung, Roth said he is
dubious about the two leaders' ability to push ahead with economic
reforms in their respective nations.</P>
      <P>The problems in Indonesia are something with which no alien power
from any region can help, Roth said.</P>
      <P>The increasingly assertive Moslems in Malaysia will cast a shadow
on the country's economic prospects, since political oppression of
dissents will inevitably dampen the nation's economic development
over the long run, said Roth.</P>
      <P>Singapore is free of any looming economic problems and is
politically stable, and the only question is how fast its economy
will expand, Roth said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POWELL URGED TO SUPPORT U.N. CONDEMNATIONS OF MAINLAND ABUSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom has urged Secretary of State Colin Powell to
vigorously support any resolutions at the forthcoming U.N. Commission
on Human Rights condemning Communist China and other countries for
violations of religious freedom and other human rights.</P>
      <P>In a Feb. 16 letter to Powell, commission chairman Elliott Abrams
stressed that the strongest possible effort by the U.S. at the UNCHR
to condemn the Chinese government "will send the message that it
cannot violently, systematically violate the right to freedom of
religion or other human rights with impunity as far as its relations
with the international community is concerned."</P>
      <P>Abrams asked Powell to undertake vigorous efforts, including
bilateral and multilateral efforts to build coalitions and gain
support, to ensure passage of resolutions condemning egregious
violations of religious freedom in Communist China, Sudan, Iran and
other countries.</P>
      <P>"We recommend that you raise European Union co-sponsorship of the
UNCHR resolutions when you host the EU foreign ministers on March 6.
We also urge you to make religious freedom violations a prominent
talking point in your discussions with Vice Premier Qian Qichen next
month," wrote Abrams.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that according to the State Department's Annual
Report on International Religious Freedom 2000, the Chinese
government's respect for religious freedom had "deteriorated
markedly." In addition, Beijing has not agreed unconditionally to the
resumption of a bilateral human rights dialogue with the U.S., which
it had unilaterally suspended.</P>
      <P>Abrams urged Powell to mount a sustained campaign at the highest
levels to convince other governments to support such a U.N.
resolution at this year's session, emphasizing that "China is the
only country designated by the State Department as a 'Country of
Particular Concern' in 1999 and 2000 where a resolution was not even
debated at last year's UNCHR session."

      <P>Taiwan's exports to the United States
declined to an eight-month low of US$3.16 billion in December, down
7.1 percent from the previous month, sources from the Department of
Commerce (DOC) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The monthly decline in December, the second in a row, was in line
with slowing growth in the American economy, DOC officials noted,
adding that exports to the United States from each of the four "Asian
dragons" declined in the last month of 2000, with Taiwan exports
falling by the largest margin.</P>
      <P>According to DOC statistics, Taiwan's U.S. exports and imports
for December 2000 dropped 2.8 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively,
from the previous December's levels, clearly demonstrating a
down-turn from the peaks reached in the first three quarters of 2000.</P>
      <P>Despite the December fall, the DOC tallies showed that Taiwan's
two-way trade with the United States for 2000 still registered three
record highs -- a total of US$64.89 billion in two-way trade,
US$40.51 billion in Taiwan exports to the United States, and US$24.38
billion in imports from the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the United States' trade deficit with Taiwan maintained
a nearly zero percent growth rate in 2000, with the deficit
increasing by a mere US$60 million over the previous year's level to
US$16.13 billion, the statistics showed. Taiwan remained the United
States' sixth largest source of trade deficit.</P>
      <P>The island was the United States' seventh largest export market
and import source and its eighth largest trading partner, behind
Canada, Mexico, Japan, mainland China, Germany, Britain and South
Korea, in that order, the DOC tallies revealed.</P>

trade surplus of C$54.5 billion (US$35.33 billion) in 2000, as its
exports to the United States, its largest trading partner, rose at
more than twice the pace of its imports from its southern neighbor.</P>
      <P>Canadian companies exported a total of C$417.7 billion worth of
goods last year, up 15.8 percent from the level in 1999. At the same
time, merchandise imports rose 11.1 percent to C$363.2 billion.</P>
      <P>About 86 percent of the goods Canada exported flowed to the
United States in 2000, while 74 percent of its imported goods came
from America. Exports to the U.S. rose 16.2 percent over the previous

      <P>The C$54.5 billion merchandise trade surplus was far higher than
the previous record of C$42.4 billion set in 1996.</P>
      <P>Merchandise trade is one component of the current account of

      <P>Canada's energy and high technology exports soared in 2000, with
the former increasing by a whopping 76.8 percent to more than C$52.5
billion. Shipments of crude oil and natural gas, all to the United

exports accounted for the rest.</P>
      <P>Canadian companies exported a record C$105.6 billion worth of
machinery and equipment, up 22.8 percent from 1999's figure. Exports
of telecommunications equipment were nearly 60 percent higher than in

      <P>Wednesday's 10-minute meeting between Powell and the mainland

      <P>The Taiwan Garment Industry Association
(TGIA) signed an agreement Wednesday with the United States
Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel (USAITA) to step up
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by Huang Uan-fu, the leader of the 2001
U.S. Trade Expansion and Promotion Group of TGIA, and Laura Jones,
representative of USAITA. The signing ceremony was held at the
USAITA's Manhattan office and was witnessed by Lee Yi-an, the head of
the New York Office of the China External Trade Development Council.</P>
      <P>The agreement states that both associations will work to propel
bilateral cooperation regarding product sales and trade and to
exchange information on development, clothing designs and market
share in order to achieve a win-win situation for both sides.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan's clothing industry is facing challenges
brought about by labor shortages and rising wages, as well as by the
global economic slowdown and increased competition from lower-priced
goods from other Asian countries. The island's garment industry now
has to focus on quality improvement and design development in order
to maintain its niche in the field, he added.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that the United States has long been the main
market of Taiwan's textile and apparel exports. The agreement is
expected to help the two organizations widen their communication
channels and furthur increase their business opportunities and
advantages, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile and apparel exports totaled US$14.1 billion for
the period between January and November, 2000, with US$1.57 billion
worth of apparel shipped to the U.S. market, sources reported.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A garment wholesaler from Taipei on the run
from Taiwan authorities has reportedly been kidnapped in Xiamen,
mainland China, sources from the Peitou police station said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the police, the 45-year-old business woman, surnamed
Chu, went missing in the Fujian city earier this year.</P>
      <P>Her husband, surnamed Chen, went to Xiamen and reported Chu
missing to local public security authorities in early February, but
he received no answers.</P>
      <P>Chen returned to Taiwan Feb. 12 and reported Chu missing to the
Peitou police station, which in turn asked for help from the mainland
Chinese public security authorities via the Criminal Investigation
Bureau.</P>
      <P>In a reply to the Criminal Investigation Bureau, the Xiamen
police said Chu was not kidnapped but abducted for "financial
reasons." The Xiamen police said Chu is now physically safe, but they
didn't disclose her whereabouts and didn't offer to extend any help
in resolving the case, according to the Peitou police.</P>
      <P>Chu fled the country after she was charged with fraud and was
listed as wanted by Taiwan police after 1998. She reportedly snuck
into Hong Kong, and then Singapore, before finally landing in Xiamen
sometime around 1999.</P>
      <P>Chu's husband and the Peitou police said they believe that she
was abducted by members of mainland China's underworld who were
apparently hired by several Taiwan creditors to whom Chu owed some
NT$9 million (US$273,000).</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau recently contacted Xiamen
public security authorities through the cross-strait intermediary
bodies -- the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to ensure Chu's personal
safety, according to Peitou police.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Peitou police have been covertly investigating the
owners of several pawn shops in Sanchung City, Taipei County, trying
to learn more about Chu's financial row with the pawn shop owners --
her creditors -- and her recent alleged abduction in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN REMAINS NEUTRAL ON REFERENDUM VOTE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has never
insisted that a referendum vote on the controversial fourth nuclear
power plant be held along with the year-end elections for lawmakers
and local governments chiefs, a senior official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Yao-chi, director of the public affairs office under the
Presidential Office, was responding to remarks by Chou Po-lun, the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) whip in the Legislative
Yuan, that President Chen has decided to call a referendum vote
late this year no matter whether the legislature passes a plebiscite
bill or not.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Chou's statements were not true, stressing that the
Cabinet is still evaluating the pros and cons of holding
such a referendum and that no definite decision has so
far been made.</P>
      <P>"I has never heard that President Chen has made up his mind to
hold a referendum vote on the nuclear power plant project under any
circumstances," Kuo said, adding that Chou might have misunderstood
the president's basic ideas and concepts.</P>
      <P>"In fact, President Chen has clearly stated that he wants to
avoid contentious issues in order to maintain domestic political
stability and facilitate economic development and internal reforms,"
Kuo explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that local society remains divided over whether
construction on the fourth nuclear power plant should be continued
or discontinued, Kuo said the Cabinet is unlikely to press for its
agenda without paying heed to the general domestic political climate
and the public opinion.</P>
      <P>Kuo emphasized that the Cabinet is now orderly promoting its
policy goal after it tentatively came up with a proposal of calling
a referendum vote on the nuclear power plant project together with
the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Asked whether President Chen had taken the initiative in
directing the Cabinet to study the feasibility of holding a
referendum vote, Kuo said that as far as she knows, President Chen
does not like to get involved in day-to-day administrative
affairs.</P>
      <P>"President Chen's leadership style has been characterized by
his willingness to delegate power to relevant government agencies or
officials," Kuo explained.</P>
      <P>As for a planned anti-nuclear demonstration this weekend, Kuo
said the anti-nuclear activists' wrath over the government's
decision to resume construction on the nuclear power plant
under the pressure of the opposition-dominated legislature is
understandable. "It is regrettable that the issue has been
'politicized,'" she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng also said
Thursday that he has never heard that President Chen will
press for a referendum vote at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 111-day furor over the Cabinet's reckless
decision to halt construction on the plant was just over, Wang said
he earnestly hopes that the DPP minority government could avoid any
move that might trigger a new round of the Cabinet-legislature
rivalry to affect domestic stability.</P>
      <P>"It would be very inappropriate for the Cabinet to call a
referendum vote on the nuclear power plant project without a legal
basis," Wang said, adding that the opposition-controlled legislature
is unlikely to endorse the Cabinet-proposed referendum vote.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang, which controls a comfortable majority
in the legislature, declared Wednesday that it disagrees with
the Cabinet proposal to call a referendum on the nuclear power plant,
but would be willing to consider legislating a plebiscite bill to
pave the way for a referendum vote on other major public policy
issues in the future.</P>
      <P>President Chen's administration had been embroiled in a political
wrangling with the legislature since it abruptly announced a
decision to scrap the partially built fourth nuclear power plant, a
pet project of the previous KMT government, on Oct. 27, 2000. Bowing
to the legislature's pressure, the anti-nuclear DPP administration
finally agreed to resume construction on the plant earlier this
month. But some DPP hardliners are still pushing for a referendum
vote with a view to eventually canceling the project.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BOTH PRODUCTION AND EXPORT ORDERS FALL IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's overall industrial production
declined 13.98 percent in January as compared to the same month of
the previous year, with the manufacturing sector posting a 14.7
percent decrease, sources from the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 14.7 percent decrease suffered by the manufacturing sector
represented the largest monthly fall in growth since February 1993,
the MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, January export orders also showed a decline, sliding
an annual 4.62 percent to reach US$10.37 billion, according to the
MOEA's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director general of the Department of
Statistics, ruled out the possibility that export orders this year
will grow by as high a rate as that of 2000. The official projected
that annual export growth in 2001 will reach around 5 percent
compared to last year's figure of 22 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang attributed the decline in export orders in January mainly
to slowing worldwide economic growth, coupled with fewer-than-normal
working days in January due to the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays,
which fell during that month this year.</P>
      <P>Chang cautioned against using the January performance as
reference for speculating on the whole year's growth in export
orders.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that if overall industrial production remains
in the doldrums during the first quarter, a slump in the country's
annual economic growth would be almost certain.</P>
      <P>In January, export orders received by Taiwan exporters and
manufacturers for electronics and electrical machinery still showed
the largest growth among all manufacturing sectors, up 11 percent
over the same month of 2000, according to tallies compiled by the
Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>Comparatively, January export orders for information and
telecommunications products dropped 14.15 percent, while orders for
textiles slipped 17 percent and those for machinery products
plummeted 32.8 percent, the tallies show.</P>
      <P>By region, orders from the United States totaled US$3.39 billion
in January, marking a 4.69 percent decrease from the same month of
the previous year. Orders from Hong Kong totaled US$1.77 billion, a
decrease of 9.89 percent; while those from the European Union came to
US$1.73 billion, down 12.41 percent, according to the ministry
statistics.</P>
      <P>But orders from Japan were higher, reaching US$1.22 billion, an
increase of 11.54 percent, the tallies indicated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a recent survey of Taiwan exporters and
manufacturers on prospects for export orders for February, the MOEA
found that 36.7 percent of the respondents believe that export orders
will increase in February, 37.25 percent say business will remain
almost the same during the month, while 26 percent expect export
orders to show a decrease from January.</P>

      <P>The man who fell into the sea and drowned
in waters off northern Taiwan's Keelung Thursday morning could have
been a mainland Chinese stowaway, rather than a local angler as
previously thought, police said.</P>
      <P>Rescuers rushed to the scene and were able to retrieve the body
of the victim at around noon. They found that the man had been
carrying renminbi -- mainland Chinese currency -- and an I.D.
identifying him as mainlander Liu Xinbiao.</P>
      <P>Judging from the items he was carrying, police believe the victim
was a stowaway and might have jumped into the sea after seeing coast
guard vessels patrolling along the coast.</P>
      <P>The incident took place at 8:30 a.m. Police and rescuers boarded
two rubber boats and one patrol boat to come to the rescue, but were
unable to save the man.</P>
      <P>According to coast guard officials at the scene, the victim
seemed to be looking down trying to find something before he slipped
inadvertently into the sea.</P>
      <P>Nearby anglers threw two ice chests to him, hoping that he would
cling to them and be able to float. But the man, who was obviously
unable to swim, drifted further away and drowned.</P>

      <P>State-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. said
Thursday that it plans to invest NT$6 billion (US$185.18 million)
over the next three years to establish eight hypermarkets around the
island.</P>
      <P>Taisugar made the announcement while soliciting manufacturers to
sell products in a proposed hypermarket in Nantzu, a town in southern
Taiwan's Kaohsiung County. The facility would be the first of the
eight such hypermarkets scheduled to be opened during the three-year
period.</P>
      <P>Taisugar's move is expected to trigger another round of
competition in the domestic distribution business.</P>
      <P>Taisugar, often named as the largest landowner in Taiwan,
established a hypermarket business department last October, in the
hopes of gaining a niche in the lucrative distribution business.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Nantzu facility, Taisugar hopes to establish
hypermarkets in Fengshan in Kaohsiung, Peikang and Fuwei in Yunlin,
Hsifu in Changhua, Chunan in Miaoli, and sites in Taichung and
Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Taisugar officials said that the first hypermarket in Nantzu,
scheduled to open Jan. 1, 2002, will have an area of 4,500 pings (one
ping is equal to 3.3 square meters), with parking for 700 vehicles.</P>
      <P>The first hypermarket will contain sections for food and
groceries, electric merchandise and DIY products, as well as
providing space for special brand-name display counters. To entice
more consumers, the hypermarket will later be expanded to provide
leisure and entertainment for its visitors.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirteen Tibetans who have been "stranded"
in Taiwan for about a decade filed a petition with the Cabinet-level
Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) Thursday to resolve
their identity and residency issues.</P>
      <P>The Tibetans said MTAC staff members posted in southern and
northern India and Nepal helped them to travel to Taiwan for
settlement and work between 1989 and 1992.</P>
      <P>"They helped us purchase passports to facilitate our trips to
Taiwan and even promised to help us obtain legal residence status
here," claimed a petitioner.</P>
      <P>However, he said, their identity certificates and entry/exit
permits were taken away after their arrival in Taiwan. "And in the
process of applying for the Republic of China's identification cards,
we have often encountered MTAC-imposed hindrances," he complained.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Tibetans allegedly have been forced to lead
destitute lives over the past decade, with no legal status, no legal
residency and no work permits.</P>

miserable lives and cannot go home," a tearful Tibetan said. He
pointed out that although Tibetans are regarded as stateless refugees
in India and Nepal, their existence is legally recognized there. "But
in Taiwan, we are in a dilemma. We can neither stay legally nor leave
freely," he lamented.</P>
      <P>MTAC Chief Secretary Chien Shih-ying received the Tibetan
petitioners on behalf of the commission. Chien told the petitioners
that the MTAC has never set up branch offices in India or Nepal.</P>
      <P>"We have only maintained cultural and educational centers there,"
Chien explained, adding that the MTAC workers in India and Nepal
might have helped Tibetans come to Taiwan to receive vocational
training, but they couldn't have promised to allow the refugees to
settle here. "The MTAC is not authorized to do so," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Chien went on to say that the MTAC has consistently tried its
utmost to help the Tibetans resolve their status and residency
issues.</P>
      <P>"We have been pushing the Ministry of the Interior and other
relevant government agencies to work out proper measures to resolve
all problems concerning the 'stranded' Tibetans," he added.</P>

(By Semy Chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong-based publishing group Next
Media announced Thursday that it has not reached any concrete
agreements with the Tomorrow Times, a Taiwan-based online newspaper
that shut down operations the day earlier amidst financial troubles.</P>
      <P>In its statement, Next Media admitted that it has negotiated with
the Times on several cooperative issues but added that such
negotiations remain in their "initial stages" and have not resulted
in any concrete agreements.</P>
      <P>Regarding the failed paper's announcement that 150 of its
employees would be recommended to take up posts at Next Media instead
of being laid off, the statement claimed that such a plan is still as
yet "unrealized."</P>
      <P>However, Next Media confirmed that it plans to publish a magazine
in Taiwan within the year and will hire on "appropriate talent" at
that time.</P>
      <P>The company added that it never reached any agreement to acquire
the Times and will not discuss related issues with the paper in the
future.</P>
      <P>Next Media is owned by Hong Kong publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, who
also owns the mass circulation Apple Daily and Next magazine in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>The Tomorrow Times (www.tTimes.com.tw), Taiwan's first
online-only newspaper, halted operations Wednesday after its
publisher failed to attain enough funding to bail out the debt-ridden

    <HEADLINE>TTWB TO LAUNCH NEW BEER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Setting its sights on the lucrative youth
market, Taiwan Tobacco &amp; Wine Board (TTWB) is scheduled to launch a
new brand in May, just in time for Taiwan's sweltering summer.</P>
      <P>TTWB officials said that its most popular brand, Taiwan Beer,
which is made from malt, enjoys a wide customer base both here and
abroad because of its unique flavor. With its recent advertising
using local entertainers, the brand's market share has increased to
reach 85 percent of total Taiwan beer sales in January.</P>
      <P>TTWB, riding on the crest of the success of its signature brand,
developed Yankee Beer, its new offering, in the hopes of attracting
consumers who prefer American-style lagers.</P>
      <P>TTWB officials said that Yankee Beer, which uses corn instead of
malt, lacks the bitter taste of Taiwan beer, and has a lighter
flavor. The price of the new brand will be similar to that of Taiwan
Beer.</P>
      <P>Also to attract the nation's younger tipplers, Yankee Beer will
be packaged in more lively manner.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Yankee Beer will be sold at all TTWB
distribution outlets, as well as hangouts of young beer consumers.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh met with
Paraguayan Vice President Julio Cesar Franco Gomez Thursday to
exchange views on city construction.</P>
      <P>Franco, accompanied by his wife and a number of members of House
of Representatives of Paraguay, arrived at Kaohsiung City Hall at
noon and was warmly welcomed by Hsieh and the department chiefs of
the city government.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Franco, who will run for a local government chief in this
November, asked Hsieh to show her how to win the election. Hsieh said
that his Democratic Progressive Party captured the five counties and
Kaohsiung cities in the last elections for president, magistrates,
and mayor because of the Kuomintang's poor performance. He also
wished Mrs. Franco good luck in her upcoming election.</P>
      <P>Franco is member of the Blue Party, a radical liberal party. The
Blue Party traveled down a difficult road on its way to becoming his
nation's ruling party -- similar to the history of Taiwan's ruling
DPP.</P>
      <P>Several senior party cadres were either jailed or fled overseas
in past years during their fight against the former military
dictatorship regime.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said jokingly that President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung and himself, who were all lawyers before becoming
politicians, assumed political jobs because they would not have to
hire lawyers to defend themselves in case they were jailed.</P>
      <P>Franco showed his interest in heavy industrial development and
said he hoped that Paraguay and Kaohsiung will share even more of
their experiences in the sector.</P>
      <P>During the afternoon, Franco and his entourage went on to visit a
senior high school and local firm China Shipbuilding Corp.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2001 PRIVATE SECTOR INVESTMENT AT HOME ESTIMATED AT NT$ 600 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs estimates
that private sector investment in large-scale projects will reach
NT$600 (US$19 billion) this year, Economic Affairs Ministry Lin
Hsin-yi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>More than NT$400 billion of that total is expected to be
channeled into the information industry and related electronics
sectors, Lin pointed out.</P>
      <P>The minister made the remarks while reporting in an Executive
Yuan economic panel meeting on current private-sector investment in
the domestic market.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, private sector investment in local power plants
has reached NT$168.6 billion to date. In addition to the already
complete Mailiao and Changsheng power plants, there are six another
power plants being planned around the island, he noted.</P>
      <P>In the establishment of "composite commercial-industrial
complexes," Lin said his ministry has endorsed 38 cases of such
projects to be set up in a combined 338-hectare land. He added that a
total of NT$185 billion to be invested in these planned complexes
will help create more than 72,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>During the period between January and June last year, new
factories outnumbered factory closures by 2,758 to 2,025, he said.
However, some 2,931 new factories were registered with the government
during the second half of the year, slightly fewer than the 2,970
factories that were shut down during the same period, he elaborated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STUDY: SNORING MAY BE A WARNING SIGN OF DANGEROUS HEALTH PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Snoring is a sign of dangerous health
problems, but is often ignored by the snorers themselves, according
to a newly-released study.</P>
      <P>People who snore are more likely to suffer high blood pressure,
heart disease and somnambulant breathing disorders that could result
in death, according to a study by Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in
Linko, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The study of 433 persons aged between 22 and 86 who went to the
hospital for physical examinations found that 86 percent of males and
65 percent of females snore at some point, and 44 percent of men and
14 percent of women snore every night.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Ning-hong, who led the study, concluded that weight and
age play a role in snoring, with heavier and older people more likely
to snore.</P>
      <P>Chen said that 31 percent of snorers suffer from high blood
pressure, a rate three times higher than that for normal people; and
11 percent of snorers suffer from heart disease, which is four times
higher than normal.</P>
      <P>The study also shows that about 10 to 15 percent of people who
snore also suffer from sleep apnea. This problem causes problems with
somnambulant breathing when throat muscles relax, blocking the
passage of air.</P>
      <P>A 53-year-old patient weighing 108 kg actually died due to sleep
apnea during the period of the study, Dr. Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said his hospital is engaged in an multinational study on
snoring led by Stanford University in California.</P>
      <P>The two-year study will survey 600 residents in Taipei City about
their sleep habits, which will give further insight into the snoring
problems of local people, Dr. Chen said.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan Thursday sent corrective
measures to the Ministry of National Defense (MND) over the
management and training of military reservists.</P>
      <P>According to Control Yuan members in charge of the case, the
management and training of the country's reservists is far behind
required levels.</P>
      <P>As a result, they pointed out that in many cases reservists are
unable to undertake their required duties during the implementation
of the ROC's troop-reduction plan, affecting the combat capability of
the armed forces.</P>
      <P>In some cases, the decommissioned soldiers were asked to report
to the training center only twice in an eight-year period, and their
primary training only consisted of watching military video tapes.</P>
      <P>The MND was censured for failing to fulfill its duty of providing
efficient management and training for the reservists.</P>
      <P>An official with the MND said that the ministry has no comment on
the matter, adding that it will correct problems indicated by the
Control Yuan when it receives the formal document.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOE BLASTED FOR PROHIBITING TAIWAN SCHOOLS FROM EXPANDING TO M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Pan Wei-kang from the major opposition Kuomintang
presided over a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan Friday,
criticizing the MOE's recent move to prohibit Taiwan educational
institutes from branching out to the mainland or engaging in
educational cooperation projects with their mainland counterparts.</P>
      <P>Pan said the MOE's move goes "against the wind" as the government
has already reviewed Taiwan's "No haste, be patient" policy and is
taking a more liberal and open-minded attitude toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that the MOE's order was based on political
considerations and is an ideological barrier that will impede
cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The legislator noted that Taiwan-based educational institutes
risk losing their competitiveness as the government is not providing
any rules regarding related operations while the Ministry of
Education is issuing papers banning such activities.</P>
      <P>In response to Pan's questioning, Vice Education Minister Lu
Mu-lin denied that the MOE is "putting the brakes on" the expansion
of Taiwan educational institutes' operations to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lu said the MOE has been actively assessing relevant policies and
has formed an ad hoc committee to evaluate the feasibility of mutual
recognition of academic accreditation with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said it is hoped that Taiwan schools and institutes can wait a
little longer until official concrete regulations dealing with the
fast-changing situation are worked out.</P>
      <P>Lu, however, ducked Pan's question about what the chances are of
a Taiwan school receiving only Taiwan children that only needs to
move its teaching materials, faculty and staff to mainland China
being allowed to set up a branch on the mainland.

    <HEADLINE>228 MEMORIAL DAY TO REMAIN PUBLIC HOLIDAY AT LEAST FOR THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to a CPA press release, the Executive Yuan submitted a
proposal to the Legislative Yuan last October to turn Feb. 28 into a
regular work day in order to help make up for work days lost under
the new five-day workweek policy. The Legislative Yuan however has
still not taken up the proposal.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng convened a special
cross-party session Friday morning, saying that no additional
sessions will be held before Feb. 28 and that Memorial Day will be a
day off for civil servants this year based on the "principle of
following the law".</P>
      <P>Another cross-party session scheduled for Feb. 26 to discuss the
revision turning 228 Memorial Day into a regular workday has been
canceled because of time considerations.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung stressed that the proposal for the
revision that would maintain Feb. 28 as a memorial day but not as a
public holiday was submitted to the Legislative Yuan on Oct. 19,
2000. The Legislative Yuan however did not convene a special
cross-party negotiation session to discuss the issue until Feb. 20
this year, he added.</P>
      <P>Chang "reminded" Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng that
the revision should be passed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Wang acknowledged Thursday that Chang had telephoned him
Wednesday afternoon to ask whether the session to discuss the
revision would still be held as scheduled. He added that the question
was not brought up when he met CPA Director General Chu Wu-hsien
Tuesday, saying that the Legislative Yuan "could have" dealt with the
issue right away otherwise.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a statement issued by the New Era Institute, headed by
Legislator Chang Chun-hung, the influential DPP opinion body
questioned the efficiency of the NUC, founded by the Kuomintang-ruled
government in 1991, and suggested that the Cross-Strait Peace
Committee be established to take the place of the NUC.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the New Era Institute suggested that the Guidelines
for Cross Taiwan Strait Peace be legislated to replace the current
Guidelines for National Unification, which outline the principles and
steps that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can take to expedite
China's unification.</P>
      <P>The institute also suggested that the DPP-ruled government make
the Guidelines for Cross Taiwan Strait Peace and the Cross-Strait
Peace Council (CSPC) Taiwan's new guiding core on the development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The statement ridiculed the Guidelines for National Unification
for failing to fulfill their due functions and responsibilities, and
accused the Kuomintang government under the leadership of former
President Lee Teng-hui of dragging cross-strait relations to their
lowest point.</P>
      <P>It suggested that the DPP-ruled government strive to get rid of
ideological restraints, make peace its top priority and begin with
economic and trade exchanges to accelerate reconciliation and redress
the cross-strait stalemate.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a White House press conference, Condoleezza Rice was asked
about a Washington Post story reporting that mainland China's
assistance to Iraq could affect the decision by the Bush
administration in April on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She responded by saying that basing the question of what to do
concerning arms sales to Taiwan on the island's ability to defend
itself is the "best matrix" to use.</P>
      <P>Rice said the U.S. has told the Beijing government "a couple of
times" that Washington is concerned about mainland Chinese activities
in Iraq which may have violated the United Nations Security Council's
sanctions.</P>
      <P>"We've asked them to give us further information and to look into
what is going on there," she added.</P>
      <P>President Bush said earlier that he was "concerned" Beijing had
helped Baghdad enhance its air defense systems by helping with
fiber-optic projects, thereby risking the lives of U.S. air crews
patrolling the "no-fly" zone over Iraq.</P>
      <P>"It's troubling that they may be involved in helping Iraq develop
a system that will endanger our pilots," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the White House disputed the notion that the friction
over Iraq had started off the Bush administration's relationship with
mainland China on a bad footing.</P>
      <P>Rice said President Bush had already sent a letter to President
Jiang Zemin that talked about his desires and wishes for a good
relationship with mainland China.

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER PROMISES TO PUBLISH `COMFORT WOMEN' REPORT IN 6 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung promised Friday
to publish a government investigative report on wartime Taiwanese sex
slaves, euphemistically named "comfort women," in six months.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan plenary session, Chang
also blamed the writer of the Japanese comic book "On Taiwan" for
claiming that Taiwan's comfort women "willingly" became military sex
slaves during World War II.</P>
      <P>"The allegation is a stark distortion of historical facts," Chang
stressed, adding that the Republic of China government is willing to
do its utmost to help surviving comfort women secure "fair and just"
discourse.</P>
      <P>Chang recalled that he led surviving comfort women during his
17-year stint as legislator to demand that the Japanese government
apologize and pay compensation for its wartime atrocity of forcing
some 200,000 young Asian women, including those from Taiwan, into
working in Japanese military brothels.</P>
      <P>In response to a complaint by opposition People First Party
Legislator Diane Lee that the government has so far failed to publish
any formal investigative report on the comfort women tragedy, Chang
said he will order relevant government agencies to publish a report
over the next six months based on documents prepared by several
private groups.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said he will ask the Presidential Office to
check whether Hsu Wen-lung, a veteran tycoon who concurrently serves
as a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, really made
insulting remarks about the comfort women.</P>
      <P>"I believe the Presidential Office will handle this issue
properly," Chang added.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with two surviving comfort women, both in their
80s, Chang assured them that the government will include the comfort
women tragedy into the ROC's formal historical archives.</P>
      <P>In his book, Japanese cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi quoted Hsu
as having said that many of the comfort women "willingly" chose to
serve Japanese soldiers and that compared with many other women sold
to brothels, the women pressed into slavery for the Japanese army
were considered "blessed."</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is also chairman of the Chi Mei Group, has thus far made
no public comments on the book and has consistently kept a low
profile regarding criticism about his pro-Japanese and pro-Taiwan
independence views.</P>
      <P>On Friday, scores of members of the right-wing Patriots
Association staged a demonstration in front of the Chi Mei Group's
Taipei office to protest Hsu's insulting remarks. Several other
private groups are planning to follow suit in the next few days,
sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2-28 INCIDENT FILES TO BE DECLASSIFIED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will announce next
week the declassification of the files on the 2-28 incident, one of
the most tragic chapters in Taiwan history, the Presidential Office
announced Friday.</P>
      <P>On the annual commemoration of the incident, which will be the
first Chen will have observed since becoming president, he will
receive the families of victims of the 2-28 incident and tour the
National Museum of History, where he will announce the
declassification of the files relating to the Feb. 28, 1947 incident.</P>
      <P>The president will attend a commemorative ceremony Wednesday and
go to the National Library to see a 2-28 incident exhibition.</P>
      <P>In addition, he will also announce Tuesday the declassification
of files relating to the late presidents Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang
Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>A National Museum of History spokesman said that the
declassification of the files is in line with existing laws and does
not target special issues or individuals.</P>
      <P>On the files of Chiang Kai-shek, the museum said that they had
been opened to the general public within the museum several years ago
and that the files on his son and successor were also declassified
after 30 years in line with declassification regulations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 2-28 Incident Memorial Foundation announced that
it will hold a series of activities to mark the day, including a
memorial ceremony, a music recital and exhibitions with the theme of
love, honor and peace.</P>
      <P>The foundation made the announcement in front of the Taiwan
Tobacco and Wine Bureau, the scene of one of the bloodiest episodes
of the incident that took place more than five decades ago.</P>
      <P>The incident, which erupted shortly after the Kuomintang took
over the island from Japanese rule, was sparked by the arrest and
beating of an old woman vendor who was selling untaxed cigarettes.
Local people protested and their outrage quickly turned to violence
that spread rapidly into an islandwide uprising until it was brutally
suppressed by government troops sent from Nanking in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The 2-28 incident was a taboo subject for years and the families
of the victims lived in terror of the KMT's goons for years afterward
until former President Lee Teng-hui formally apologized for the
tragic chapter in the island's history and tried to heal the
decades-old wounds.</P>
      <P>The foundation also said that as of Feb. 5, some 7,145 people had
been approved to receive a share of NT$6.434 billion (US$198.51
million) in compensation for their suffering in the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO CROSS-STRAIT CONSENSUS ON 'ONE CHINA': MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland China affairs official
denied again Friday the existence of a so-called "1992 consensus"
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait on the "one China,
separate interpretations" principle.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland
China, made the denial at a seminar on the development of
cross-strait relations. The seminar was organized by the opposition
right-wing New Party to mark the 10th anniversary of the adoption of
the Guidelines for National Unification.</P>
      <P>Chen said the "one China, separate interpretations" principle
was broached by the previous Kuomintang (KMT) government. "The
principle, however, was not a consensus agreed by both sides of the
Taiwan Strait as claimed by the KMT," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>Chen, who had taught China affairs at a local university before
assuming his current post, pointed out that mainland China has
denied the existence of such a consensus.</P>
      <P>"Xu Shiquan, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies
under Beijing's Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, published an
article last October stressing that Taiwan and mainland China have
never reached a consensus on the definition of 'one China,'" Chen
said.</P>
      <P>In his article, Xu said mainland China could not agree to the
claim that the two sides reached a consensus in 1992 that each side
can have its own definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>"Such a claim was a stark distortion of the truth and would hurt
cross-strait relations. In fact, the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) have never discussed the political
implications of 'one China.' Against this backdrop, how could the
two sides reach a consensus on the issue?" Hsu wrote in his article.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Xu's remarks, Chen said the previous KMT
government had not left any documents or archives to back its claim
that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait "agreed to disagree" on the
one China definitions.</P>
      <P>"I have spent much time searching for relevant archives in hopes
to find written documents to prove the KMT's claim. But so far I
have found nothing," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that whether there was a "1992 consensus" was basically a 
dispute between the old KMT administration and mainland China, Chen
said the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
has no intention of getting involved in this controversy.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the new DPP government has a comprehensive
plan and strategy to promote cross-strait relations. "We hope all
opposition parties can give us full support to seek a breakthrough
to the current cross-strait impasse," he added.</P>
      <P>As for when President Chen Shui-bian would convene a National
Unification Council (NUC) meeting, Chen said the council has its
"phasic significance" in the development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The NUC was founded in 1990 to serve as a presidential advisory
body. And the NUC unveiled the Guidelines for National Unification
on Feb. 23, 1991 to serve as the highest directives governing
Taiwan's mainland policy under the KMT administration.</P>
      <P>Chen said President Chen already declared in his inaugural speech
on May 20, 2000 that so long as mainland China has no intention of
using force against Taiwan, "there will be no issue" of whether the
NUC and the unification guidelines will be abolished under the DPP
administration. The DPP has traditionally been vocal in its
anti-unification stance.</P>
      <P>In his Lunar New Year's Eve speech, President Chen also pitched
for the development of a new framework to facilitate cross-strait
engagement and integration without compromising on the Republic of
China's sovereignty, safety and dignity.</P>
      <P>Under these principles, the MAC vice chairman said, the DPP
administration will either seek to adjust the NUC or forge a new
mechanism to ensure permanent cross-strait peace through gradual
economic and political integration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING, OPPOSITION PARTIES DISAGREE OVER UNIFICATION GUIDELINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislative Whip Chou Po-lun said Friday on the 10th anniversary of
the Guidelines for National Unification (GNU) that the DPP has always
opposed the guidelines, but respects them as a "historical document."</P>
      <P>However, he continued, respect for the GNU does not mean the DPP
administration has to follow them in implementing Taiwan's mainland
China policy.</P>
      <P>Although it would be "difficult" for the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), People First Party (PFP) and New Party (NP) to force the
government to accept the guidelines, Chou added that the government
wouldn't provoke the parties over the issue simply to create
problems.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan criticized the administration
for "confining the guidelines to the attic" and lacking clearly
defined direction, goals, methods and progress in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, lamented that cross-strait
relations began falling backward after the loss of what he called an
"important foundation of consensus," leading to a subsequent loss of
public confidence in the nation's future.</P>
      <P>Lien praised the guidelines, which were drafted and ratified
under the previous KMT administration, for placing Taiwan's interests
first and maintaining the Republic of China's dignity while providing
a "solid foundation for mutually beneficial cross-strait
interactions."</P>
      <P>Cross-strait dialogue under a new mechanism also began after the
guidelines were put in place, Lien added.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong also praised the guidelines for being
able to consolidate public consensus on Taiwan's mainland policy
while promoting bilateral relations through incremental stages.</P>
      <P>He criticized the DPP for brushing aside the guidelines after
coming into power last May and completely deviating from the KMT
era's mainland policy and the use of related mechanisms without
proposing any new policies to handle cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Urging the DPP to return to the guidelines and convene a meeting
of the National Unification Council (NUC), Soong warned that taking
the path of Taiwan independence would lead to "violent confrontation"
between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, he conceded that portions of the guidelines may be
worthy of being "adjusted" or "interpreted according to the current
situation" under the premise that such adjustments would not violate
the constitutional system or change the ROC's national identity.</P>
      <P>Soong proposed following the path of economic integration, social
engagement and finally political integration in dealing with mainland
China. This would help maintain a stable and peaceful cross-strait
environment while the two sides continue to develop relations like an
"engaged" couple where the final "marriage" may be delayed depending
on the state of cross-strait relations, he added.</P>
      <P>He urged President Chen Shui-bian to take the benefit of the
public and national security into consideration instead of thinking
in terms of political popularity and internal DPP pressure.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Hau Pei-tsun, whose Cabinet ratified the GNU in
1991, said at a NP-organized seminar that the guidelines, first
ratified by the NUC, have complete legal backing because the
Legislative Yuan had also reviewed it without raising any objections.</P>
      <P>Hau's son, NP National Convener Hau Lung-bin, criticized the new
government for treating the guidelines as a museum piece -- simply
placing it on display but not using it. He added that the GNU is a
legal document that the government should execute according to its
contents.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Soong, who was originally a KMT stalwart but formed
his own party after running as an independent candidate in the
presidential election last March against Lien and Chen, the senior
Hau said that the guidelines should not be considered untouchable,
because thoughts and ideas from 10 years ago may require some
"adjustments."</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the basic tenets of the guidelines --
"unification of China," "unifying China under democracy and freedom"
and the "one China principle" -- must not be abolished.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT COULD VISIT PARAGUAY IN MAY: PARAGUAYAN VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Paraguayan Vice President Julio
Cesar Franco Gomez said Friday that Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian could visit Paraguay at the end of May.</P>
      <P>Franco made the remarks at a press conference prior to his
departing the Republic of China Saturday after a weeklong visit.</P>
      <P>Franco disclosed that during his meeting with Chen earlier in the
week, the president said he is likely to visit Paraguay in May, but
his itinerary and other details still have to be discussed by the two
nations.</P>
      <P>May is a cool autumn month in the South American nation, which
Franco said will be ideal for Chen's visit. He added that the
presidential trip will be beneficial to the friendship and
understanding between the peoples of the two nations.</P>
      <P>He also urged the ROC to use Paraguay, which is a member of
Mercosur, also known as the South American Common Market, as a
springboard to enter the regional market. Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina
and Uruguay agreed to form Mercosur in 1991.</P>
      <P>He also said that his country is now dedicated to the
establishment of a just society and a stable economic environment,
which should entice more foreign investors to his country.</P>
      <P>Paraguay, the ROC's only ally in South America, signed agreements
with Taiwan to guarantee investments and avoid double taxation for
both nation's citizens. Many Taiwan investors have used Paraguay as a
conduit for doing business in the huge Brazilian market, Franco
pointed out.</P>
      <P>He also said that neighboring Bolivia and Chile have expressed
interest in joining Mercosur as a way to take advantage of the trend
of globalization and create prosperity for their people.</P>
      <P>Franco expressed his deep appreciation for the warm hospitality
extended to him during his first visit to the ROC, adding that his
trip had reaffirmed the long-standing friendly relations between the
two nations.</P>
      <P>Franco, who arrived here Sunday, also called on Vice President
Annette Lu, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien
Hung-mao, Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi and Mainland Affairs
Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen during his visit to exchange views on
matters concerning the political and economic situations in the two
countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quanta Computer Chairman Lin Pai-li
announced Friday that his firm's production of notebook computers
will reach a new high this year, making it the largest manufacturer
of notebooks in the world.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that due to the slowing global economy, multinational
computer companies are increasingly contracting with foreign firms
such as Quanta to manufacture their products in order to cut down on
costs. This has been the driving force behind his firm's increased
orders, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Quanta shipped 2.63 million notebook computers last
year, Lin said he anticipates that this year's production will grow
by 52 percent to reach 4 million units, driven by increased orders
from several Japanese firms. That figure will make Quanta the largest
manufacturer of notebooks in the world, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Quanta's cellular phones and server products are
among the firm's major export products. He added that Quanta will
step up its development of telecommunications devices in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100,000 people are expected to
participate in an anti-nuclear rally called by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Saturday in an effort to allow the people to
have a say on the fate of the disputed fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the public have the right to directly voice their
opinion in the government's formulation of major public policies, DPP
officials said that the demonstrators will also call for the
enactment of a plebiscite law to permit people to play a role on
major issues of national concern.</P>
      <P>Around 10,000 DPP members, including former chairman Lin
Yi-hsiung, secretary-general Wu Nai-jen and Legislator Tsai
Trong-rong, will also walk in a parade as part of the party's efforts
to avoid disturbances, which might backfire on President Chen
Shui-bian and the DPP-led government.</P>
      <P>According to DPP officials, incumbent chairman Frank Hsieh will
not take part in the march, but will give a speech at an appropriate
time.</P>
      <P>In a press release made public later the same day, the DPP
reiterated that the aim of the mass rally is to express the party's
aspiration for reforms and to pursue greater social and national
progress. In a bid to strive for the benefit of the people of Taiwan
and transform their homeland into a nuclear-free zone, the DPP will
continue to fight for its dream, according to the announcement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Chang Chung-hsiung stressed that he will
always stand firm on his insistence on making Taiwan a nuclear-free
country. Chang said although some barriers still stand in the way of
that goal, he will never be disappointed or upset in the fight.</P>
      <P>Due to the lack of a referendum law which would allow the people
to have the final say on disputes about major national policies, he
pledged that the Executive Yuan will do its very best to promote the
enactment of such legislation.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in response to a request from DPP
Legislator Wong Chin-chu, who said DPP lawmakers are disappointed
about the Legislative Yuan's decision to continue construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush on
Thursday announced his intention to nominate a former Reagan
administration official to be the ranking State Department officer
responsible for U.S. relations with the countries of the Asia-Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Pending confirmation by the Senate, James Andrew Kelly will
become Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs. Kelly is now president of the Pacific Forum of the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Honolulu, Hawaii.</P>
      <P>Kelly's nomination is welcomed by China experts including James
Lilley, a colleague in the Reagan administration, who described the
retired Navy captain as "a fine fellow who has worked on Asia for
years."</P>
      <P>Lilley and other experts said that policy towards Asia and the
Pacific is likely to be decided at levels above that of assistant
secretary, with major decisions being made by Secretary of State
Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of State designate Richard
Armitage.</P>
      <P>Retired Rear Admiral Eric A. McVadon said Kelly's nomination
"will bring a great deal of experience" to the State Department's
Bureau of East Asia and the Pacific.</P>
      <P>Kelly has had "a full understanding of the Taiwan issue for many
years," said McVadon, who was a classmate of Kelly's at the National
War College in 1977. A former naval attache at the U.S. embassy in
Beijing, McVadon is now a well-known private consultant on security
in Asia.</P>
      <P>Other experts say that Kelly is "a team player" with
"well-balanced views" and is unlikely to initiate any major departure
from existing policies.</P>
      <P>During the latter years of the Reagan Administration (1981
-1989), Kelly served as special assistant to the president for
national security affairs and as senior director for Asian affairs at
the National Security Council.</P>
      <P>From 1983 to 1986, he was deputy assistant Secretary of Defense
for international security affairs for East Asia and the Pacific. He

    <HEADLINE>ROC NAVY CHIEF REPORTEDLY DENIED U.S. VISA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A planned visit to the United States by
the Republic of China Navy chief has reportedly been scrapped because
Beijing has succeeded in "intimidating the State Department into
denying a visa" to the admiral.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times on Friday described the incident as a sign
that Beijing "is winning the behind-the-scenes lobbying over U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In "Inside the Ring," its weekly column on the military, the
paper said Adm. Lee Chieh wanted to come to Washington in early April
to discuss Taiwan's annual arms requests, including Aegis-equipped
warships and four Kidd-class guided-missile destroyers.</P>
      <P>His application for a visa was rejected because the trip would be
too close to the April arms talks and some U.S. officials do not want
him to lobby, one unnamed U.S. official was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>"Contrast that with the parade of Chicoms (Chinese communists)
that are clearly lobbying against arms sales (to Taiwan)," the
official said. "It looks like for the time being the Clinton
administration policy of dumping on Taiwan and helping Beijing is
continuing."</P>
      <P>The paper said that the State Department "gave in to a request"
from Beijing to arrange a visit to the United States by Deputy Prime
Minister Qian Qichen.</P>
      <P>Prior to Qian's visit, which is expected in March, a group of
former top mainland Chinese diplomats were in Washington last week.
They will be followed by a visit from deputy director of the mainland
Chinese State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office later this week.</P>
      <P>It is believed that objection to arms sales to Taiwan is high on
the agenda of these visitors.</P>
      <P>The State Department and the Pentagon have no immediate comments
but sources told the Central News Agency that Lee's visit has been
postponed "for various reasons," including the fact that some of the
officials he plans to call on will not have been confirmed by the
Senate if he is to come in early April.</P>
      <P>It is not known when Lee is now expected to make the visit, which
sources said is for the purpose of "routine consultation."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC IMPOSES LAST-MINUTE TRAVEL RESTRICTION ON TAIPEI DEPUTY MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) imposed a last-minute travel restriction on Taipei Deputy Mayor
Pai Hsiu-hsiung Friday, declaring that he may visit Shanghai and
Nanjing in mainland China as scheduled but not Gueilin.</P>
      <P>Pai is scheduled to embark on his trip Saturday. He is slated to
attend the Taipei-Shanghai city forum and visit Nanjing next Friday.
His original itinerary would have taken him to Gueilin, the last leg
of his trip, on Mar. 4.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said that the situation is still
"uncertain" after Pai made telephone calls to both MAC Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen and Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung to clear up the
surprise change. Therefore, Ma added that the city government will
continue to communicate with the MAC on the issue.</P>
      <P>Pai charged that Tsai and Chen's reasons for disallowing his
Gueilin visit kept changing. He said that they had first criticized
the city government for supposedly revealing the MAC's "eight-point
suggestions" to his delegation to abide by all Republic of China laws
and official stances during his trip, then claimed that Chen had
merely "forgotten" to tell Pai about Tsai's decision from two days
before not to allow him to go to Gueilin.</P>
      <P>According to Pai, Chen's final reason for disallowing his Gueilin
trip was that it had nothing to do with the twin city forum. However,
Pai responded by saying if that argument is valid, then the Nanjing
leg of his trip should be disallowed as well, since the forum is to
be held only in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Pai will be leading the city's news, transportation, environment,
urban planning and education department chiefs, as well as city
councilors and municipal advisers, to attend the forum and share
their experiences in urban development.</P>
      <P>After the forum, Pai is scheduled to call on Taiwan businessmen
in Nanjing and Gueilin and possibly meet with local city officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC RED CROSS DONATES NT$ 2 MILLION IN AID TO EL SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Alice Liang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China donated NT$2 million Friday to assist the victims of two
devastating earthquakes that struck El Salvador Jan. 26 and Feb. 13.</P>
      <P>According to Red Cross Society officials, the donations came from
local civil groups, citizens, and companies. El Salvador Ambassador
H.E. Francisco Ricardo Santana received the funds on behalf of the
Salvadoran government.</P>
      <P>A quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale and another measuring
6.6 on the Richter scale jolted El Salvador on Jan. 26 and Feb. 13,
respectively. The quakes caused more than 1,000 deaths and left more
than 7,000 injured.</P>
      <P>Santana expressed the gratitude of the Salvadoran people for the
assistance from the ROC government, citizens and Red Cross Society.
He noted that in addition to Friday's donation, the ROC Red Cross had
already provided 10,000 blankets and 320 tents to assist
quake-stricken victims, and has been continuously monitoring their
conditions.</P>
      <P>ROC Red Cross Secretary General Chen Feng-yi noted that the
assistance was based on the group's ideals, and said that donating
aid and collecting relief materials expresses the friendship of ROC
citizens toward El Salvador.</P>
      <P>The Salvadoran government has set up an account for citizens to
donate funds to aid the quake victims in the Central American
country. An account numbered 19010107004 was set up at First
Commercial Bank to accept donations from local groups and
individuals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUSPENDED SUBSTANCE OF SANDSTORM FROM MAINLAND TO HIT TAIWAN SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A cloud of sand particles suspended high in
the atmosphere, the result of a sandstorm in mainland China, is
expected to hit Taiwan Saturday, an official of the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The suspended particles stem from a sandstorm in mainland Chinese
Gansu province on Feb. 21. The suspended matter is expected to enter
the skies over Taiwan Saturday at noon, along with a mainland cold
front, said Chang Shun-chin, head of the second division of the EPA's
Environmental Monitoring and Data Processing Bureau.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the front was approaching Taiwan Friday, with
islandwide air quality ranging from ordinary to bad. He said with the
arrival of the high pressure cold front from the mainland and the
strengthening of northeastern seasonal winds, the sandstorm's fallout
will make western Taiwan's air quality even worse Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang predicted that Taiwan will not be off the hook until Feb.
25, when the cold front will pass by the island.</P>
      <P>He warned that people who suffer from respiratory diseases, the
elderly and children should avoid going out or engaging in strenuous
outdoor activities Saturday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP REGRETS CHEN ADVISER'S REMARKS ON WILLINGNESS OF SEX SLAVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said Friday that it regrets the "fallacious rhetoric" that Taiwan
women "willingly" served as sex slaves for the Japanese Imperial Army
during the Second World War.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Women's Department made the statement amid a national
furor over a Japanese comic book titled "On Taiwan." The book quotes
Hsu Wen-lung, a local tycoon and senior adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian, as claiming that Taiwan women "willingly" served as
prostitutes in Japanese military brothels so as to outshine their
peers.</P>
      <P>The statement said that the party regrets such "fallacious
rhetoric," which only underscores Japanese colonial militarism and
male chauvinism, throws salt in the wounds of the victims, and
attempts to antagonize Taiwan's people.</P>
      <P>The Women's Department noted that the government has commissioned
investigations into the historical truth of Taiwanese "comfort women"
since 1992, and that after years of such probes has persuaded several
former "comfort women" to come forward and openly accuse the Japanese
government of committing atrocities during the World War II.</P>
      <P>The DPP Women's Department suggested that the historical truth
should be published in Taiwan's textbooks to set the record straight
and to avoid similar false rhetoric from misleading the international
community and creating nationwide furor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Japanese author's quotation of Hsu also became the
focus of legislative interpellation questions Friday.</P>
      <P>A DPP legislator tried to draw a line between the party and Hsu,
chairman of Chi Mei Group, who has never tried to hide his
pro-Japanese and pro-Taiwan independence stance. The legislator added
that Hsu does not represent the DPP, and the party should not
shoulder the criticism leveled at him.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Wang Hsueh-fung demanded that the
government respond swiftly to the Japanese comic, and requested that
Hsu, who has maintained a low-profile over the past few days, be
called on to clarify his words.</P>
      <P>If Yoshinori Kobayashi, the book's author, misquoted Hsu, the Chi
Mei chairman should accuse him of lying, Wang said. Otherwise, Hsu
should apologize to Taiwan for making such improper remarks.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said that the comic seriously distorts
the historical facts, noting that the government has appropriated
NT$21 million (US$648,150) to subsidize Taiwan's former "comfort
women."</P>
      <P>The premier said that he was unclear about whether Hsu had
actually made the remarks to the Japanese author, but he will convey
the legislators' information to the president for his understanding
and handling.</P>
      <P>Legislator Shu Shu-po of the opposition Kuomintang asked whether
to list Kobayashi, who may visit Taiwan in March, as "persona non
grata" for his serious distortion of history.</P>
      <P>The premier said that related government agencies will look into
the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, two former Taiwanese "comfort women," accompanied by
opposition party legislators, went to the Presidential Office Friday
to ask the president to tell Hsu to come forward to face them and
explain why he had wronged them, adding that Hsu should apologize
and step down as a senior adviser to the president.</P>
      <P>The two women, both in their 80s, were vilified by Hsu's alleged
words in the book. The comic says that "comfort women" lived in
dignity.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by the party whips of the three opposition parties,
they were received by Eugene Chien, deputy secretary general to the
president, because the president was meeting with other visitors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO TAIWAN TRADE MISSIONS ABROAD REAP FRUITFUL RESULTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Taiwan trade missions abroad have
harvested exceptionally good returns on their recent promotion tours
to southern Europe, Turkey and north Africa, sources from the China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA) reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Southern Europe mission, comprised of representatives from
some 30 Taiwan companies and led by CETRA officials, visited Spain's
two leading cities of Madrid and Barcelona over the last two days,
receiving US$337,000 worth of on-the-spot orders which are expected
to generate over US$5.65 million worth of business in the following
year. The mission also secured some 255 potential trade partners in
the two Spanish cities.</P>
      <P>Through the mission's promotion activities in Madrid and
Barcelona, Taiwan business people discovered that most of their
Spanish counterparts do not speak English. They suggested that other
Taiwan business people who intend to expand their trade to Spain keep
the language issue in mind.</P>
      <P>Before heading to Spain, the mission also visited Greece and
Italy, where they also reaped satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another Taiwan trade mission, to Turkey and North
Africa, experienced a more-successful-than-expected promotion tour in
Istanbul over the last two days.</P>
      <P>The mission, comprised of executives from 33 Taiwan companies and
also led by CETRA officials, attracted a total of 860 Turkish
companies to a Taiwan trade workshop for business talks.</P>
      <P>In a short two-day activity, CETRA officials said, the Turkish
buyers placed US$930,000 worth of on-the-spot orders, with follow-up
transaction opportunities topping US$8.5 million and the number of
potential buyers reaching 501.</P>
      <P>There were no signs of the sluggishness expected due to the
recent political uncertainties resulting from the row between the
Turkish president and prime minister and also from the nose-dive in
Turkey's currency, CETRA officials noted.</P>
      <P>The Turkish traders showed interest in buying almost everything
that members of the Taiwan mission were offering, ranging from
computers and peripherals, electronics and parts, turn-key whole
plant facilities, construction materials, to garments,
telecommunications equipment, office automation equipment, auto
parts, consumer's goods, stationery and cosmetics.</P>
      <P>According to Huang Wen-jung, CETRA's head officer in Turkey,
Taiwan's exports to Turkey reached US$423.80 million in the first 11
months of 2000, while imports from Turkey hit US$68.10 million, with
both figures registering remarkable increases over those of the same
period the previous year.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding to Turkey, the mission also visited Morocco,
Tunisia and Egypt, CETRA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPUTY TAIPEI MAYOR LEAVES FOR MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Taipei Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung,
heading a large delegation of municipal officials and elected
representatives, left for Shanghai Saturday to attend a forum on
urban development and city-to-city exchanges.</P>
      <P>During its 10-day mainland China visit, the delegation will also
visit Nanjing. But due to opposition of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), the group has cancel its plan to visit the
southwestern city of Gueilin.</P>
      <P>Pai said before his departure that in addition to attending the
Feb. 27-28 Taipei-Shanghai City Forum, his mission will also discuss
concrete city-to-city exchange programs in cultural, educational,
sports and social welfare fields.</P>
      <P>The group will also visit the preparatory office and projected
construction site for a Taiwanese school to be built soon to help
resolve the education problems for school-age children of the
Taiwanese business people in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Following its Shanghai visit, the Taipei city delegation will
travel to Nanjing to promote cultural and educational exchanges
between the two cities.</P>
      <P>The delegation are composed of more than 30 members, including
10 city government officials and advisers, four city councilors, one
legislator and several urban development and mainland affairs
experts.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that mainland China has agreed to allow
Taiwan officials to visit in their official capacity. During his
first mainland trip last year, Pai entered the mainland as a
specialist in senior citizens problems.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi is scheduled to meet with the Taipei
delegation Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>As the Republic of China has not yet formally opened
city-to-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, the Taipei City
Hall had a spat with the MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward
the mainland, in arranging the delegation's itinerary.</P>
      <P>Pai originally planned to visit Gueilin with some mission
members, but canceled the plan at the last minute due to the MAC's
opposition. Pai said he feels regret over the MAC's handling of the
issue and has decided to resign from the post as convener of the
Taipei city government's mainland affairs task force after his
return from the mainland trip.</P>
      <P>Some mission members also complained about the MAC's restrictions
on their activities in Shanghai. They said the MAC has advised them
not to meet with staff members of Beijing's Association Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), a semi-official intermediary body authorized
by mainland authorities to handle exchanges with Taiwan in the
absence of official ties. The ARATS has long shunned contacts with
its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation, because
mainland authorities still refuse to resume the long-stalled
cross-strait dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COUPLE STRIVES TO SERVE AS PARENTS OF WORLD'S POOR CHILDREN (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to their encounter with an autistic
boy, Tim Shao, executive director of World Vision of Taiwan, and his
wife Helen, changed their minds and returned to Taiwan after a
26-year stay abroad, pledging to serve as "the parents of the poor
children of the world."</P>
      <P>Tim Shao's earlier life had been full of surprises and sorrows,
especially after one of his and his wife's children died at a young
age only a few years after another son of theirs died in an accident,
filling their life with tears, until they accidentally met with Louis
Huang, a nine-year-old boy suffering from autism. This encounter
would begin to convert their sorrow into a strong determination to
help poor children.</P>
      <P>Tim Shao, who is now all smiles all the time, went to the United
States for further study after graduating in Taiwan. He later went to
live in west Australia and served as a social worker under the Office
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He and his wife
Helen Shao Chang returned to Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>Earlier, in 1992, the eldest son of Shao went on a mountain
climbing trip with his classmates and accidentally fell off a cliff
and died at the age of 20. Three years later, Tim and Helen suddenly
lost their youngest son who had been suffering from Down syndrome.</P>
      <P>Recalling this saddest period of his life, Shao still seems to be
reluctant to let go, saying that "I never imagined that my eldest son
would die before I did."</P>
      <P>Both Tim and Helen are devoted Christians and, in the eyes of
their friends, Tim is regarded as a "good man." Tim said that he and
his wife could not understand for a long time why God would let them
experience such tragedies. As a daughter of a preacher, Helen was
particularly distraught.</P>
      <P>It was not until Helen recovered from a serious illness that she
began to develop a new outlook on life. And later, when she and her
husband met with Louis, her and her husband's way of thinking would
dramatically change again.</P>
      <P>Louis, son of a Hong Kong immigrant, was diagnosed with autism
and a low intelligence quotient of only 50 when he was a child. After
being dropped out of a special education school in Australia, his
mother had to bear the heavy burden of educating her son herself.</P>
      <P>Similar to the story in a movie called "Rain Man," Louis' mother
accidentally found out that Louis had a special talent. In Louis'
case, it was with languages. Somewhat unexpectedly, Louis, who was
growing up in an English-speaking environment and in a situation
where he lacked tutors, was able to clearly write down his own
opinions and predictions in both Chinese and French. One of his
predictions was that his uncle, Tim Shao, would return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shao said that, at the time, he himself found the "prediction" to
be laughable because since the time he left Taiwan in 1971, he had
only returned to Taiwan one time in 1985 and had no further thoughts
of returning to Taiwan, adding that he had a good job in Australia.

    <HEADLINE>COUPLE STRIVES TO SERVE AS PARENTS OF WORLD'S POOR CHILDREN (2)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A wonderful thing happened in 1998, when a vacancy was created at
the World Vision of Taiwan and Shao was contacted to fill the
position. At this time Tim recalled the prediction made by Louis and
decided there was no harm in trying out the new job. After a series
of interviews in Taiwan, the United States and Canada, he finally
became executive director of World Vision of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shao said that he then realized that God must have his own will,
saying "He wants me to perceive intuitively before helping others."</P>
      <P>Soon after he and his wife returned to Taiwan in May, a
fund-raising campaign was held on Mother's Day and Helen was
interviewed by reporters. Tim was quite worried because he do not
know whether his wife could bear reporters' questions about her
feelings on that particular day.</P>
      <P>Shao said he was relieved when he heard Helen tell reporters that
"all the children in the world are my children." Tim then said
affectionately "I also want to be the father of the world's
children."</P>
      <P>In the past three years, Shao has traveled to Mongolia, Africa,
and Central and South America under such projects as "the 30-Hour
Famine Campaign" and "Child Sponsorship" in order to fulfill his vow
to try to be a father to the poor children of the world.</P>
      <P>To further the work of World Vision of Taiwan for local children,
Tim has promoted a project called "Guardian Angel" over the past two
years, saying that "we can affect the world by changing our own
lives."</P>
      <P>The devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999 had a
major impact on social welfare organizations in Taiwan. Funds raised
by the World Vision of Taiwan rose to NT$1.2 billion in that year.
Shao however noted that although resources have increased, more money
does not necessarily make an organization more effective.</P>
      <P>Shao said he understand that due to the low pay given by welfare
organizations, talented people tend to flock to foreign commercial
institutions. Furthermore, due to the lack of a program on managing
non-profit institutions at any of the colleges or universities in
Taiwan, there is not only a shortage of social workers, but also of
trained managers.</P>
      <P>To solve the problem, Shao said World Vision of Taiwan is
planning to cooperate with the Asia Foundation in Taiwan and the
Himalaya Foundation to open in the near future a special class on
management similar to an Executive Master Business Administration
program at a local university in order to train future managers for
non-profit institutions.</P>
      <P>As a first step toward the goal, the three welfare organizations
will hold a seminar titled "Twilight of a Century -- A New Path for
Non-Profit Organization Management" between March 22-23, 2001, at
National Taiwan University.</P>

launched an islandwide "clean-up" movement on March 20 of that year.</P>
      <P>The incident has had far-reaching effects on the development of
Taiwan's politics. Many believe the incident led to the rise of the
Taiwan independence movement, the public's cool attitude toward and
fear of politics, as well as the chasm between the island's different
ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Today, the attitude of the people of Taiwan to politics has
changed and the chasm between the different ethnic groups has been
eliminated with the government's efforts in promoting democracy over
the past several decades.</P>
      <P>A concert held Saturday night in front of the city's Chungshan
Hall will formally begin the series of memorial activities.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 28, President Chen Shui-bian will lead high ranking
government officials in laying a wreath and paying respects at the
228 monument in the 228 Park.</P>
      <P>A two-month historical relics exhibition of the families of the
228 Incident victims will be unveiled Feb. 28 at the Taipei City 228
Memorial Hall, said the 228 Incident Memorial Foundation, adding that
another exhibition of files on the 228 Incident will be held March
1-11 at the National Library.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY CHEN'S `INTEGRATION' CALL: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  24  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should be more open to studying
President Chen Shui-bian's recent advocacy of political "integration"
between Taiwan and mainland China, a political science scholar said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Byron Weng of National Chi-Nan University said that Chen's
pledge in his Lunar New Year message to promote the "integration" of
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is politically invaluable and that
mainland Chinese leaders should pay more attention to it and study it
more elaborately.</P>
      <P>Weng, formerly professor with the Chinese University of Hong
Kong, noted that Chen's "integration" concept includes a dual
meaning, referring to "Taiwan's separation from the mainland but not
independence, and Taiwan's reunification with the mainland but not
under the fold of the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The pledge was a goodwill gesture toward Beijing on the one hand
and a pragmatic response to expectations from Taiwan's opposition
parties on the other, Weng said.</P>
      <P>Weng said Chen's "integration" initiative offers the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) a new option,
pointing out that under this "integration" directive, Chen's
administration should enjoy even greater room than the preceding
pro-unification Kuomintang government in terms of conducting
cross-strait dialogue with Beijing.</P>
      <P>He added that Chen's series of peaceful overtures directed toward
Beijing, including a declaration in his inaugural speech on May 20,
2000 that so long as mainland China has no intention of using force
against Taiwan, "there will be no issue" of whether the National
Unification Council and the Guidelines for National Unification will
be abolished under the DPP administration, is a positive force in
easing cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>Weng made the remarks when he delivered a speech to a seminar
hosted by the New Era Institute, a DPP legislative sub-group, on "the
comparison of national sovereignty and integration formulas."</P>
      <P>On possible formulas for cross-strait political "integration,"
Weng said the European Union formula may be viable, adding that
before and during the process, Beijing should make certain promises
to make sure that Taipei will not stray further and further away.</P>
      <P>Weng, meanwhile, pointed out that currently, there are no signs
indicating any prospects for cross-strait political "integration,"
although he said economic and trade integration across the Taiwan
Strait is now a trend that cannot be avoided by any related party.</P>

      <P>The hospital is located in Cuartel de la Victoria, a military

ROC would donate US$930,000 to help improve Paraguay's public health
facilities.</P>
      <P>A US$280,000 portion of the donation has been earmarked for the

    <HEADLINE>POLICY ON CITY-TO-CITY EXCHANGES STILL UNDER REVIEW: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Saturday it is still reviewing the current policy on
city-to-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and has yet to make
a final decision on policy adjustments.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, was
responding to a local newspaper report that the MAC has decided to
fully liberalize cross-strait city-to-city exchanges and that
preparations for implementing the new "open-door" policy can be
completed in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>The MAC said in a press release that the report does not
fully comply with the reality.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the MAC pointed out that it is still conducting
an overall review of the existing city-to-city exchanges policy and
working on new regulations to govern such interchanges under a
revised policy.</P>
      <P>As policy adjustment usually involves legislation of new
regulations, the MAC said it needs more time to complete all relevant
work.</P>
      <P>Noting that parity and dignity are the Republic of China's
cardinal principles in handling cross-strait exchanges, the MAC said
it is conducting its city-to-city policy review based on these
principles.</P>
      <P>The MAC further said the new legislation for cross-strait
city-to-city exchanges is mainly aimed at forging an
interchange order and meeting the demand of local-level
governments.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that future city-to-city exchanges can help
foster cross-strait rapprochement and facilitate full-fledged
positive interaction," the MAC said in its press statement.</P>
      <P>A front-page report appearing in the Saturday issue of the
mass-circulation United Daily News (UDN) quoted MAC Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen as having said during a Legislative Yuan plenary session on
Friday that the government is reviewing its existing policy on
cross-strait city-to-city exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Tsai said the ROC's current
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government will largely
adjust the current "point-to-point" cross-strait exchange policy and
plans to adopt a "fully open" policy.</P>
      <P>Tsai further said she hopes that the policy review work can be
completed by the end of June, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said at Friday's parliamentary session that Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh's plan to visit the southeastern mainland port
city of Xiamen last July was aborted mainly because of his failure
to file an application earlier.</P>
      <P>The government has not yet formulated a comprehensive legal
system for elected officials to visit the mainland and has approved
such visits on a case-by-case basis, Tsai explained.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, Hsieh has filed a new application for his
plan to visit Xiamen in April this year. And the MAC is now screening
Hsieh's application, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman, reportedly has
briefed President Chen Shui-bian on his new Xiamen travel plan.</P>
      <P>The UDN report said as both President Chen and the MAC have
shown a positive attitude toward Hsieh's travel plan, Hsieh is
likely to become Taiwan's first municipality mayor to visit the
mainland. Taiwan has two municipalities --Taipei and Kaohsiung --
which are under the direct jurisdiction of the Cabient.</P>
      <P>If Hsieh's Xiamen trip becomes a reality, the paper said, it will
also mark a breakthrough in the DPP's relations with mainland China.
As the DPP has traditionally been vocal in promoting Taiwan
independence, the Beijing government has rejected any contacts with
the DPP even after the party won the ROC's presidency in last year's
election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN LEADS TO TAIWAN INVENTORY PILE-UP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Feb. 24 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The slowdown in the U.S. economy has led
to the problem of inventory pile-ups -- especially in high-tech
products -- in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, according to the latest
issue of Business Week magazine.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that many manufacturing companies in Asia, home to
thousands of suppliers to American corporate buyers, had originally
predicted a substantial third quarter increase in orders from their
U.S. customers last year, but when those expectations fell short,
they were caught off guard.</P>
      <P>Unable to deal flexibly with the steep drop in demand -- a 30
percent drop in orders for Taiwan semiconductors, for example -- the
inventories at these Asian manufacturers began to pile up.</P>
      <P>Analysts said that contract manufacturers in Taiwan and mainland
China were among the worst hit by the large scale order cuts because
semiconductors require advance orders up to three months before
delivery, and the companies were unable to quickly adjust production.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, semiconductor production dropped from 100 percent
capacity to 70 percent within a few months, and related income from
information technology products are expected to suffer a proportional
25 percent drop by March.</P>
      <P>Even in Japan -- home to Asia's largest economy -- IT inventories
were up 30 percent over the previous year as of December 2000,
according to the magazine.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A cloud of sand particles suspended high in
the atmosphere, the result of a sandstorm in mainland China, hit
Taiwan Saturday, giving the entire island a poor air quality rating,
the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) reported.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA's monitoring station in Matsu, located
offshore from mainland China's Fujian Province, suspended particles
in the air over Matsu reached 52 micrograms per cubic meter at around
6 a.m. Saturday, a figure about double that of a couple days earlier.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that with the arrival of a high pressure cold
front from the mainland and the strengthening of northeastern
seasonal winds, the sandstorm's fallout will make western Taiwan's
air quality even worse Sunday.</P>
      <P>The effects on Taiwan of the sandstorm that began to sweep
through southern China early Friday are not expected to subside until

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) ordered Saturday that the fuel oil and cargo still within the
grounded Greek freighter Amorgos be removed by next Tuesday and no
later.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Administrator Lin Chun-yi said the owner
of the Greek vessel will face a daily fine of NT$1.5 million
(US$45,450) in accordance with Taiwan's ocean pollution laws if the
fuel oil and cargo are not removed by the deadline.</P>
      <P>Lin, meanwhile, suggested that the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications take over the supervising work to make sure that the
work of related bodies involved in the oil spill clean-up progresses
at a sufficient pace.</P>
      <P>Lin said that while accelerating the pace of the clean-up work,
the ship owner and its Taiwan agent should also come up with a plan
before Wednesday to prevent the adjacent area of the sea from being
further polluted during the cleaning process.</P>
      <P>He added that the EPA is also considering handing the captain and
two senior crewmembers of the cargo ship to the Pingtung District
Prosecutor's Office for questioning. The trio have been prevented
from leaving Taiwan since the accident occurred Jan. 14.</P>
      <P>The freighter, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for
Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical
problems and began to drift. It ran aground one mile off the coast of
Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip.</P>
      <P>All 25 crewmembers were rescued, but the ship later broke into
two parts and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the
vessel.</P>
      <P>The oil spill from the vessel has blanketed coral reefs in the
Oluanpi area, causing an ecological disaster that will take the
sensitive ecosystem years from which to recover.</P>
      <P>Since then, opposition parties have called on the chiefs of

Administration, to resign from their posts for their gross
dereliction of duty.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shanghai City Mayor Xu Kuangdi met with
visiting Taipei City Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung Sunday morning at
his office, marking the first official engagement between the two
city governments.</P>
      <P>Xu was originally slated to receive Pai and his delegation at a
demonstration house for city planning next to the city hall, but the
meeting location was changed at the last minute to highlight the
official character of Pai's visit.</P>
      <P>During the 30-minute meeting, Pai invited Xu on behalf of Taipei
City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou to visit Taipei at a yet unspecified date.</P>
      <P>Xu also invited Ma to visit Shanghai, "providing that (the
Republic of China's) Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) doesn't frown
upon such a trip."</P>
      <P>Noting that Xiamen City Mayor Zhu Yayan tried to invite his
Kaohsiung counterpart Frank Hsieh to visit his city, only to be
blocked by the MAC last year, Xu said "Shanghai would like to be the
first one to be successful, rather than the second one to fail, in
inviting the head of its Taiwan counterpart to visit."</P>
      <P>He raised the issue of the eight restrictions imposed by the MAC
on Pai's visit on the eve of his departure for Shanghai and sought
Pai's opinion, but Pai said he would toe the line laid down by the
MAC despite his criticism while in Taipei of the MAC's attempts to
curtail his mission.</P>
      <P>Xu briefed Pai about Shanghai's situation, saying that the city,
which is home to 13 million people and has an additional 3 million
people who commute to the city to work, faces an urgent waste
disposal problem and that the nearby river has been seriously
contaminated by sewage.</P>
      <P>Pai touted Taipei as the first city in Taiwan to charge a fee for
solid garbage disposal, offering to share the city's experiences in
this field with Shanghai.</P>
      <P>He also asked Xu to show special care for Taiwan businesspeople
operating in Shanghai, appealing for his help in efforts to set up a
Taiwan school in the city.</P>
      <P>Pai arrived here Saturday evening at the head of a delegation of

      <P>CNA reporter</P>
      <P>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA) For Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director
general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), smiling is not
only a weapon to deal with work and the life he faces, but also a
tool to help him create another mood for living.</P>
      <P>"A boy who is learning to play the piano will not become bad" is
a sentence which appears in a well-known advertisement. Chang changes
this slightly by saying that "a man who puts all his energy into his
work is a good man."</P>
      <P>One of Chang's friends said that Chang is a complete workaholic,
but added that although Chang has always placed a priority on his
work, he always does it with a smile and also lives his life with a
smile, thereby creating a different lifestyle and winning the respect
of both his family and friends.</P>
      <P>Although it has been a long time since he completed his military
service, Chang still maintains the spirit of a military person. To do
a job thoroughly and well is his motto for work, saying he believes
that a man who cannot do a job well cannot do other things well.</P>
      <P>Although it is not an exaggeration to describe Chang as a man of
high quality, his wife and his secretary Hsia Su-chen said that using
the term "workaholic" to explain his working spirit may be more
accurate. Hsia added that because he spends so much time on his work,
he does not spend a lot of time on family affairs.</P>
      <P>Chang began his military life after graduating from the ROC Air
Force Academy in 1966. He knew to consider himself as just another
military man and to regard other troops as his family.</P>
      <P>He got married to Ana Pan in 1971 and was named military attache
of the Republic of China Embassy in South Africa in 1985. During the
first 14 years of his marriage, Chang was only at home for three
years, with his wife having to take care of the children and other
family affairs by herself for the other 11 years.</P>
      <P>Pan, who like other wives of military man has complained about
her husband for ignoring her and their children, said however that
she got accustomed to such a lifestyle and accepted it so as to let
her husband focus on his work.</P>
      <P>Although Chang said he believes he does his job according to what
is right, he admits that he is not very good at being a family man.</P>
      <P>He finished his military life in 1994 and entered into the Civil
Aeronautics Administration under the control of the Ministry of
Transport and Communications (MOTC), but he never changed his living
style.</P>
      <P>Chang has always used his family time to deal with reports
submitted by members of his team, with his wife watching television
or engaging in other activities while he works away during holidays
or his time off.</P>
      <P>One time, Chang even failed to show up at an appointment to have
his wedding anniversary photo taken with his wife because he had a
lot of work to do at his office.</P>
      <P>But he wife always forgives him for these kinds of actions
whatever his excuse might be. This may be due to the fact that, as a
staff member at Chang's office once said, Chang is a superior officer
with a kind heart.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan semiconductor industry's
expansion in setting up eight-inch wafer plants is expected to slow
down as the sector's future remains uncertain, according to industry
sources.</P>
      <P>The local industry will invest about US$6.6 billion in capital
spending this year, down 34 percent from the 2000 level, Applied
Material Taiwan Corp. Manager P. L. Chang said, adding that US$4
billion of the total will be fueled into the arrey process -- the
establishment of wafer plants -- and that only one third of that will
be allocated to setting up eight-inch wafer plants.</P>
      <P>Spending on the establishment of 12-inch wafer plants will
account for 42 percent of the local industry's total allocation in
the array process this year, far ahead of the global average of 25
percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>Amid global sluggishness in the sector, the local industry is
more willing to invest capital in the development of advanced process
technologies than in the setting up of eight-inch wafer plants, Chang
pointed out, claiming that 12-inch wafer plants are thus less
affected by the current global slowdown.</P>

efficiency.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet announced that Feb. 28 will remain a public holiday,
at least for this year, due to the fact that the Legislative Yuan
does not have enough time to deal with the issue before this year's
holiday.</P>
      <P>He noted that public criticism will give the impetus for the
government to improve and that the people's expectations and
discontent will help lead to an upgrading of government efficiency.</P>
      <P>The president urged for the establishment of the notion of
government service as a core value and said that civil servants will
take the initiative in safeguarding the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>President Chen also spoke about four kinds of government
management, namely goal setting, growth, mobility, and crisis
management.</P>
      <P>With respect to goal setting, Chen pointed to post-quake
reconstruction after Sept. 21, 1999, saying settlement of the
problems faced by quake-affected people should progress as scheduled.</P>
      <P>On growth management, the president said that the public service
shouldn't only focus on growth figures and forget the mission of
government management.</P>
      <P>He cited the example of the construction of the high-speed
railway between Taipei and Kaohsiung and its effect on the Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park as an example, saying that the
Executive Yuan should intervene in advance to coordinate and to avoid
businesses in the park from moving out because of concerns over the
construction of the high-speed rail.</P>
      <P>On mobile management, he urged civil servants to turn away from
the red tape and bureaucracy and travel to the scenes of problems to
try to solve them as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The president also cited the oil spill problem in National
Kenting Park in southern Taiwan to illustrate crisis management,
saying that all government agencies have to coordinate and act
swiftly to prevent oil spills and protect wildlife.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS HE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ACCEPTS PRESIDENT'S CRITICISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsing said Sunday that
he wholeheartedly accepts President Chen Shui-bian's criticism of the
administration, urging all the government's employees to face up to
their shortcomings pointed out by the president and to address them
properly.</P>
      <P>Speaking after President Chen at the National Administration
Reform Conference, Chang echoed Chen's dressing down of the
administration's ignorance in prodding the legislature to debate a
revision proposal to the compensation statue for the Feb. 28
incident, which was put forward last Oct., saying that, as a result,
the revised version of the statue is still pending in the Legislative
Yuan with three days to go before this year's holiday on Feb. 28.</P>
      <P>Noting that the terms of the councilors of the rural and urban
townships will expire by March next year, the premier warned the
related government agencies to gear up for the elections of the
councilors if a revised law to get rid of these elected officials is
not approved by lawmakers before this October.</P>
      <P>Another incident listed by President Chen in his criticism was
the government's slow response to the environmental disaster caused
by the oil spill from the Greek cargo ship Amorgos that ran aground
and broke into two parts in mid-January.</P>
      <P>Chang said he regretted the fact that the accident occurred
during the Lunar New Year when the whole government was closed for
the eight-day holiday and that the administration failed to respond
quickly to the disaster. He also warned government employees to be
watchful against accidents even during holidays.</P>
      <P>Chang said he will bear the blame for all the administration
faults, but he urged his subordinates to address their own
shortcomings and not make the same mistakes again.</P>
      <P>Saying that embracing the knowledge economy is the government's
only choice, the premier said that the public expects an efficient
government and that the administration reform conference is designed
to meet the public's expectations.</P>
      <P>He urged the conference-attendees to come up with innovative
ideas to help the government promote efficiency.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) is
planning to cut Taiwan's rice production by around 10 percent within
three years, COA officials said Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the Cabinet-level COA will work to
promote the plan by reducing Taiwan's annual rice production to 1.4
million metric tons from the current level of 1.5 million metric tons
in a bid to minimize the impact of Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) on the local agriculture sector.</P>
      <P>As the government will permit rice imports of more than 14,400
metric tons in the first year following Taiwan's WTO entry, the COA
will take measures to reduce the area of islandwide paddy fields to
310,000 hectares by implementing a "lie fallow program" starting this
year, according to the officials.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung reaffirmed
the value of life Sunday while visiting the Life Society in Taipei,
saying that only by keeping on living can there be hope.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks Sunday in the company of Minister of
the Interior Chang Po-ya and the Department of Health Administrator
Lee Ming-liang.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang said that the number of Taiwan suicide cases has not
increased since Oct. 10, 2000, and he expressed the hope that the
media would not play up the suicide cases.</P>
      <P>The premier urged the media not to air the method to commit
suicide of the victims every single hour, saying that suicide could
sometimes be contagious.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to pay more attention to the relatives
and friends around them to lend needed support to those who are on
the verge of taking their own lives.</P>
      <P>Chang, saying that one's life has its up and down, added that
he and President Chen Shui-bian and other government officials have
faced no less stress and difficulties than others.</P>
      <P>Noted that he received the training of volunteers for life
hotline in the 1950s, he said he realized at the time that people
could only have hope if they keep living, urging people to try to
find the will to continue to live.</P>
      <P>He criticized the recent cases of parents who committed suicide
and who also took their children's lives, saying that children are
independent beings and not the property of parents. Parents have no
right to deny their children's right to life, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh San-lien, chairman of the Life Society in Taipei, said that
the society has provided assistance to tens of thousands of people
over the 32 years since its inauguration.</P>
      <P>Chu Kai-yu, secretary general of the society, said that the
function of the society has turned from the "prevention of suicide,"
to being a consultation service and social education center over the
years.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health Administrator Lee Ming-liang also
announced a 080-021-995 hotline to provide comfort for those people
in torment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu and other celebrities also
urged the public to respect life by giving anecdotes from their own
experience.</P>
      <P>The vice president said that the Department of Health estimated
that the number of people who committed suicide in Taiwan last year
was around 2,000.</P>
      <P>Lu spoke of her experience of trying to commit suicide,
including one time when she was behind bars on sedition charges
and couldn't visit her mother who was on her death bed.</P>
      <P>Actress Chin Shu-mei, who attempted suicide in her 20s because
of setback in love, said that she now looks at things from a
different angle. She said those who committed suicide are very
selfish, saying those who are considering ending their own lives
should think of all those people suffering from terminal disease in
hospitals who are fighting to stay alive.</P>
      <P>Arthur Wu Tang-ju, whose brother killed himself after having his
heartbroken, said those who have thoughts of suicide should consult

inaugurated Monday.</P>
      <P>Mandarin Airlines said that those who buy airline tickets via the

    <HEADLINE>BRITISH ENVOY MAKES INSPECTION TOUR OF KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The top British representative to the
Republic of China said here Monday he is convinced that
progress in forging direct commercial and transport links across the
Taiwan Strait will get increasingly faster in the future.</P>
      <P>David Coates, director-general of the British Trade and Cultural
Office, which represents British interests in Taiwan in the absence
of official ties, made the remarks during an inspection tour of the
ROC's frontline island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>This was Coates' first trip to Kinmen, which lies much closer to
mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Coates paid a visit to the Kinmen County Government where he was
briefed on the operations of direct trade, mail and shipping links
between the ROC's two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and Matsu
and mainland China's Xiamen and Fuzhou, commonly known as the
"mini three links."</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Deputy Magistrate Yen Ta-jen told Coates that four
groups of Kinmen residents and Taiwanese business people have made
direct voyages from Kinmen to Xiamen since the "mini three links"
opened at the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, a large delegation
of Kinmen-born residents in Xiamen also made a direct sail to Kinmen
earlier this month for a four-day family reunion visit.</P>
      <P>Yen said although the Taiwan-initiated "mini three links" program
has not yet taken off due to Beijing's lukewarm response, the
program is expected to gradually gain momentum.</P>
      <P>"For one thing, our central government is scheduled to make an
overall review of the program at the end of March. And the Kinmen
County Government is pushing the Cabinet to allow the use of Kinmen
as a transit stop for passengers and cargo shipment between Taiwan
and mainland China. Once the current 'transit' ban is lifted, we
believe Kinmen would become a major midpoint for Taiwanese business
people with interests in mainland China," Yen explained.</P>
      <P>For his part, Coates said he shares Yen's view that the "mini
three links" will gradually shift into high gear. Given Taiwan
businessmen's strong economic clout on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait, Coates said he thinks that Beijing is not likely to continue
resisting coordination with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Coates said he believes that progress in
the development of direct cross-strait trade and shipping links will
become faster in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>Coates rented a motorcycle Sunday to tour Kinmen's major tourist
attractions Sunday. The British representative said he was impressed
by Kinmen's fresh air, clean environment and historic relics. "I can
hardly think that it was a battlefield about three decades ago," he
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI DELEGATION CONTINUES SHANGHAI VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By S.F. Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei delegation of city officials
and councilors, headed by Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung, that is
visiting Shanghai, continued its fact-finding mission Monday in one
of Asia's most prosperous cities.</P>
      <P>The Taipei delegation, which also includes Lee Hsi-chin, director
of the Taipei City Bureau of Education, divided into three groups to
meet Shanghai officials in charge of education, environmental
protection, and transportation and urban development.</P>
      <P>Pai and Lee visited several "key" primary schools in Shanghai
Monday morning and are scheduled to head to the famous Fudan
University in the afternoon. Pai is expected to relay Taipei National
University's intention of establishing closer academic cooperation
ties, such as sisterhood ties, with Fudan.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with Pai on Sunday, Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi said
Shanghai is now asking for a minimum education background of 12 years
from individuals who are new to the job market, adding that he hopes
that the requirement will be further raised to 14 years of education
by 2005.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Pai and the Taipei delegation toured the futuristic
Pudong economic zone on the other side of the Huangpu River. Pudong,
a shabby backwater of Shanghai only some two decades ago, is now the
center of Shanghai's stock market and future markets, and also its
real estate and maritime businesses. Skyscrapers, including the 420
meter high Grand Hyatt Shanghai, the world's tallest hotel, and the
World Financial Center, one of the world's tallest buildings,
appeared within the past short 10 years.</P>
      <P>Hu Wei, top district official of Pudong, told Pai and his
delegation that the amazingly fast development of Pudong would not
have been possible without the strong authoritative power of the
Shanghai government. In 1993, 3,700 households in Lujiazui were
removed in the short period of four months to make room for the
building of a park, without a single protest from the residents,
according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Highly impressed, Pai said the efficiency, forward-thinking
outlook and sound working plans that have been demonstrated in
Shanghai's fast development are examples that Taipei should emulate.</P>
      <P>Pai and the Taipei delegation, which arrived in Shanghai
Saturday, are scheduled to take part in the two-day Shanghai-Taipei
municipal forum slated for Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei delegation visiting Shanghai marks the first official
engagement between the two metropolitan governments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION PARTIES DEMAND OUSTER OF PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition parties unanimously
demanded Monday that President Chen Shui-bian remove Hsu Wen-lung,
one of Chen's senior advisers, from the presidential consultants'
list for his "unacceptable remarks about World War II female sex
slaves from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) legislators said in a press conference Monday
that they will propose asking President Chen that he force Hsu to
resign his post as senior presidential adviser, ban public sales of
the comic book that carry Hsu's improper remarks, and ask the general
public to not buy products made by any of Hsu's companies.</P>
      <P>The Japanese comic book titled "On Taiwan," which rolled off the
press in Taiwan recently, quoted Hsu, who is also a local tycoon, as
claiming that Taiwan women "willingly" served as prostitutes in
Japanese military brothels during the World War II period so as to
outshine their peers.</P>
      <P>The comic book has stirred a national furor in Taiwan over the
past few days over the "fallacious rhetoric" that the book's Japanese
author quoted Hsu as having said.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers asked for a formal response from the
Presidential Office to their demands within one week.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan stressed that Taiwan women being forced to
work as sex slaves for the troops of the Japanese military is a sad
chapter in history. While historical facts should not be ignored or
forgotten, they should especially not be distorted, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, New Party Legislator Elmer Feng criticized Hsu's
latest explanation of his alleged remarks in the comic book as
"exerting a second-round of harm on the Taiwan comfort women and
their families. Amid a rising furor, Hsu reportedly said over the
weekend that the young Taiwan women were sold by their parents to the
military brothels.</P>
      <P>Feng called Hsu "shameless" as he said Hsu failed to take the
opportunity of talking with the author of the comic book to ask for
justice for his elderly fellow Taiwan countrywomen.</P>
      <P>Feng also visited the publisher of the comic book Monday to ask
it to stop printing more copies. The publisher, however, said it
enjoys the same publishing rights as any other publishing house.</P>
      <P>Some 30,000 copies of the book "On Taiwan" have been published
and sold, and it can't do anything about it, the publisher said,
adding that the company will decide what to do when it begins to plan
the printing of further copies of the comic book.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) legislators asked the Executive Yuan to
list Japanese cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi, author of the comic
book, as a persona non grata in Taiwan for his insulting remarks
about Taiwan sex slaves, euphemistically named "comfort women."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation said the
organization has received numerous calls over the past several days,
all condemning the comic book and Hsu for remarks which they
considered insulting to the women. Many of the callers wanted
President Chen to step forward to seek justice for the former comfort
women.</P>
      <P>A foundation spokeswoman pointed out that the former comfort
women, now in their 70s and 80s, are almost all suffering from
declining health, saying she doubts whether they are strong enough to
handle another round of harm to themselves by the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER REFUTES JAPANESE THINK TANK'S ASSESSMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang refuted
Monday a Japanese think tank's assessment that the Republic of
China's current banking system was inferior to South Korea's,
asserting that the local financial system is in good shape.</P>
      <P>The Nomura Research Institute said in a newly released
report that Taiwan is being experienced a scaled-down Asian financial
crisis that plagued several Asian countries in 1998.</P>
      <P>Nomura further said Taiwan should have carried out sweeping
structural reforms to cope with its "mini-scale" financial crisis.
However, it went on, Taiwan adopted a strategy similar to Japan's,
with its government pouring a large amount of money to "fight
against market force." Such a strategy, Nomura said, has further
undermined Taiwan's banking system, now even more vulnerable to
South Korea's.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Nomura report, Yen said the data used by the
Japanese economic think tank was apparently outdated. "In fact, our
banking system is sound and healthy," Yen argued, but he didn't go
into detail.</P>
      <P>The Nomura report also predicted that the sluggish Taiwan economy
couldn't see a turnaround until the fourth quarter of this year.
According to the report, the ROC government's current efforts to
accelerate public spending with a view to expanding the domestic
demand would only have limited effects.</P>
      <P>The forecast was, however, challenged by Wu Jung-yi, director of
the Taiwan Institute for Economic Research (TIER), a Taipei-based
private think tank.</P>
      <P>Wu said although Nomura is a famed research organization, it
has also made wrong forecasts from time to time. "None of Taiwan's
major economic forecasting agencies have predicted that
our economy couldn't regain momentum until after the third
quarter," he noted.</P>
      <P>Based on all data collected by the TIER, Wu said, the Taiwan
economy will very likely show signs of improving between February
and March, and will become even stronger in the second half of this
year.</P>
      <P>According to Nomura, Taiwan boasts a better economic structure
than South Korea, Japan and mainland China, and its electronics
industry does not heavily rely on bank loans nor does it requires a
restructuring.</P>
      <P>As for its traditional industries, the report said, Taiwan
should let those labor-intensive industries relocate to mainland
China. Although a mass exodus of those industries may lead to an
industrial hollowing-out, the report said, the relocation is a
comparatively less painful strategy.</P>
      <P>The report warned that Taiwan seems to be repeating Japan's
mistake. It pointed out that Japan's current economic woes lie in
continued market manipulation by its former generations of
politicians and bureaucrats, coupled with numerous errors
committed by its current generation of political figures.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's present situation, the report said
President Chen Shui-bian's administration is using similar
strategies to bolster Taiwan's battered capital markets.</P>
      <P>For example, it said, Chen's administration has used government
and bank funds to back the stock market, ailing corporations,
sunset industries, real estate market, foreign exchange market and
even poorly managed banks. President Chen also promised not to raise
tax rates during his four-year tenure. All these practices were
similar to the strategies adopted by the Japanese government since
the bubble of the Japanese economy burst in the early 1990s, the
report claimed.</P>
      <P>It further said Taiwan is an "over-borrowing" society, with
total debts reaching 160 percent of its gross domestic product,
which is the highest ratio among major Asian countries.</P>
      <P>According to Nomura, Taiwan's corporations, individuals and
banks have borrowed too much money for stock investment. And its
banking system has thus been hurt by its over-reliance on the real
estate and stock markets as well as traditional industries.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that many traditional industries
in central and southern Taiwan are on the brink of bankruptcy
due to high production costs and government restrictions on
relocation to the mainland. These ailing companies have become a
heavy burden for Taiwan banks and their government still ask them
to support some of those business groups, the report said.</P>
      <P>Nomura said Taiwan should instead push for restructuring of its
banks and clearing of all bad debts, as well as let market forces
settle outdated industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO UNDERGO PARTIAL RESHUFFLE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday that
the Cabinet will undergo a partial reshuffle, but added that he has
yet to set a timetable or decide which individuals will be affected.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks at a press conference held after the
closing of the two-day national meeting on administrative reforms.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang also said that he has set up a task force, with
Vice Premier Lai In-jaw serving as the convenor, to study the issue
of streamlining government agencies and present a report with
substantial proposals for him to review within two months.</P>
      <P>Lin Chia-cheng, chairman of the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission of the Exceutive Yuan, confirmed later that a
Cultural Department will be formed, comprised of several agencies now
under the Government Information Office, the Ministry of the
Interior, and the Council for Cultural Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs will also be upgraded to the
Ministry of Labor Affairs, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks after media speculation that a
Cabinet reshuffle may be imminent following the president's harsh
criticism during the opening day of the national meeting Sunday of
the Cabinet for being inefficient and ineffective and his criticism
of the Cabinet's "five major faults."</P>
      <P>The president cited as examples the debate on phasing out the 228
Memorial Day as a national holiday, the lagging behind schedule of
reconstruction efforts in the wake of the disastrous earthquake of
Sept. 21, 1999, the effects of vibration levels on Tainan
Science-based Industrial Park caused by the construction of a
high-speed railway, the falling behind schedule by 30 percent of
construction of a section of the Second Highway, and the excessively
slow response to the recent oil spill off the southern tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Presidential officials had earlier said that, in consideration of
maintaining a stable political situation, any Cabinet reshuffle would
be small in scale.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the president's criticism was due to "the
high expectations he has placed on the Cabinet" in his hopes of
upgrading administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>The president, in a meeting Monday with the winners of
professional managerial awards, again pointed out that the examples
he cited the previous day were not targeted at special government
agency heads, saying carrying out administrative reforms will require
teamwork, and not just the efforts of a few individuals.</P>
      <P>Sources of the Office of the President have said that Chen, in
view of the approaching first anniversary of his presidential term,
asked the Cabinet two weeks ago to submit its initial report on its
performance regarding financial reforms, administrative efficiency,
post-quake reconstruction, and the crackdown on gangsters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND DISSIDENT CRITICIZES TAIWAN'S ATTITUDE TOWARD BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wei Jingsheng, a prominent U.S.-based
mainland Chinese democracy activist, said here Monday that Taiwan's
new Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led government should not be
too cowardly toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wei, who arrived in Taipei Sunday for a lecture tour, said
although he is not fully aware of the DPP administration's
operations, he and many other exiled mainland dissidents feel that
the Taiwan political community's attitude toward mainland China is
"unusual, abnormal and too feeble."</P>
      <P>"I feel that Taiwan's political community is overly soft and
cowardly in the face of Beijing's consistently hardline attitude
toward Taiwan," Wei said.</P>
      <P>The outspoken mainland dissident further criticized local
politicians as "lacking coherent, consistent thinking" about Taiwan's
relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>"I have found that so long as Beijing slightly softened its
hawkish rhetoric on Taiwan-related issues, local politicians
tended to reciprocate Beijing's empty talks in ways that even
violated their previous stances or principles," Wei
regretted.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan should enact a plebiscite law and holds
a referendum on the island's controversial fourth nuclear power
plant, Wei said referendum is a normal measure to resolve a
contentious national issue in a democratic society.</P>
      <P>In his view, Wei went on, referendum can resolve all major
public issues. "My observation is that referendum is not necessarily
taboo in deciding Taiwan's future," he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the proposal that Taiwan co-host the 2008 Olympic
Games with mainland China if Beijing really becomes the host city,
Wei said the proposal is not necessarily in Taiwan's interest, given
the huge gap between their political and social systems.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing's Olympiad bid is mainly politically
motivated, Wei said he personally opposes picking Beijing as the
host city because he suspects that the current mainland regime can
survive until that time.</P>
      <P>Wei claimed that the mainland government is promoting its
Olympic bid with a view to maintaining domestic political stability.
"But in fact, the Beijing regime is currently facing a host of
problems and challenges," he asserted.</P>
      <P>Wei also dismissed as "too naive" the idea that co-hosting
Olympic Games could help maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait. "To me, such a concept is like trying to negotiate with a
tiger for its hide," he explained.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Wei paid a visit to Legislative Yuan Vice President
Yao Eng-chi, who concurrently serves as president of the ROC chapter
of the World League for Freedom and Democracy.</P>
      <P>Starting Tuesday, Wei will hold a total of nine rounds of
conversation with former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh on the
prospects for democracy and human rights in the new century.</P>
      <P>Wei had spent long years in mainland Chinese prisons for his
pro-democracy stance before being allowed to leave the mainland in
1998, and Shih was also jailed for 25 years for his
pro-independence, pro-democracy views during Taiwan's martial law
era.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential lawmaker of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suggested Monday that Hsu Wen-lung
take the initiative to resign from the post as a presidential
senior adviser for his controversial remarks on "comfort women."</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who concurrently serves as the chief
executive of the DPP Policy Research and Coordination Commission,
said Hsu's remarks concerning Taiwanese wartime sex slaves were
inappropriate.</P>
      <P>"Although Hsu said he was just expressing his personal
views, opposition politicians would certainly link his words to
President Chen Shui-bian," Shen explained, adding: "Against this
background, I think that Hsu had better take the initiative to leave
the 'senior adviser' post to help cool the furor over his
remarks."</P>
      <P>Hsu, also Chi Mei Group chairman, was quoted by Japanese
cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi in his comic book "On Taiwan" that
some Taiwanese women "willingly" became military prostitutes
during the island's Japanese rule.</P>
      <P>His remarks caused an uproar in local society. In an
effort to calm the public wrath, Hsu called a news
conference Sunday, during which he said Koyabashi had misquoted him.
Hsu explained what he had said was that some Taiwanese parents sold
their daughters to Japanese military brothels through certain agents
during World War II. His clarification failed to calm the
controversy and even triggered more furor.</P>
      <P>A Presidential Office spokeswoman said the tragedy of "comfort
women" was an integral part of Japan's wartime atrocities.</P>
      <P>"Our government has consistently expressed to Japanese
authorities its solemn attitude toward the issue," said Kuo
Yao-chi, director of the Public Affairs Office of the Presidential

      <P>Kuo further said President Chen has never consulted Hsu

      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) is
planning to send officials to check the accounts of Taiwan companies
listed on foreign stock markets, including the mainland Chinese
bourse, starting this year.</P>
      <P>If the plan receives approval from the Securities and Futures
Commission (SFC), it will allow the Taiex to check the accounts and
assess the overseas spin-off operations of those Taiwan companies in
their respective host countries, mainly mainland China, which has
been the major foreign investment destination among Taiwan-based

      <P>SFC Chairman Chu Chao-chuan said Sunday that he had not seen the

moves as long as it can surmount technical difficulties with the
relevant mainland Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>The planned Taiex move is expected to provide effective
protection for local investors who have bought shares of those

could only check accounts of those companies' mainland operations "on

      <P>The Republic of China has made relations
with Europe one of the most important areas of its foreign policy,
Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the European Council of Commerce and Trade (ECCT)
in Taipei, Tien said Europe, especially the European Union, has
steadily gained importance on the world stage both economically and
politically.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is particularly interested in Europe's 50-year quest for
integration, with hopes that it might offer the island a path for
integration with mainland China or even their other neighbors in the
Asian region, Tien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that European integration started with economic and other

      <P>Tien said the interaction between Taiwan and Europe has been
widening and deepening at an accelerating pace, evident in the
increasing two-way trade and investment.</P>
      <P>In order to strengthen the island's ties with Europe, Tien said,
his ministry is upgrading the functioning of its offices in Europe
with the appointment of younger, more dynamic representatives,
simplification of visa procedures, and expansion of the island's
technical cooperation programs to the nations of Central and Eastern
Europe.</P>
      <P>The minister also pledged to step up exchanges with Europe in the
non-traditional fields of diplomacy, including human rights
protection, environmental protection and academic exchanges.</P>
      <P>In return, Tien appealed for Europe's continuous support for the
island's entry into the World Trade Organization and World Health
Organization. He also appealed for support for the islands continued
inclusion in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT STREAMLINING, ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Monday that
the government should streamline its administrative work-flow, adjust
its organizational structure, encourage participation by the public
and maximize the use of information technology to improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>At the closing ceremony of a two-day national administrative
reform conference, Chang instructed various Cabinet agencies to come
up with concrete proposals within two months in answer to the
conclusions that were determined at the meeting.</P>
      <P>He ordered the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission (RDEC) to develop the means by which the public can
participate in the supervision of various government projects through
the disclosure of information on all project evaluation stages on the
Internet.</P>
      <P>The RDEC has been charged with reinventing government
organization and formulating plans to computerize administrative
services in a massive project that began in 1998. It recently
submitted an extensive four-year plan to speed up the government's
computerization project.</P>
      <P>With 75 percent of the 4,400 administrative agencies already
connected to the government network and 17 percent of all
inter-agency document flow carried out electronically, the RDEC last
month proposed boosting the number of connected agencies to a full
100 percent and reaching 50 percent electronic document exchanges by
the end of 2002.</P>
      <P>Within four years, over 1,500 types of information search,
reservation or application services will be done via the government
network.</P>
      <P>Chang also appointed the RDEC to be responsible for establishing
a mechanism by which the government can receive direct feedback from
the public, particularly through the use of opinion polls during the
promotion of major government policies.</P>
      <P>He said that the results of such surveys can be used as points of
reference for the government's policy-publicizing efforts and will
provide a basis for an "appropriate amount" of policy adjustments.</P>
      <P>Proposing an across-the-board reduction in the number of
administrative tasks, documents, regulations and meetings as well as
a general cut in excessive discourse -- both verbal and written --
Chang assigned the RDEC to develop new streamlined work-flow
processes in tandem with each Cabinet agency in order to better
utilize manpower and increase administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>The RDEC was assigned to come up with a timetable and related
measures for the Cabinet's organizational adjustment, which Chang
demanded be completed within two years of the passage of related
laws.</P>
      <P>Chang also instructed the Interior Ministry to establish a
coordination channel between the central and local governments and
the Central Personnel Administration to provide the means by which
the government can exchange talented workers with civic organizations
in order to infuse a "civic life-force" into the government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he ordered the Government Information Office to
improve its communication channels with the media in order to satisfy
the people's "right to know." He also demanded the establishment of a
crisis forewarning and reporting system to improve the ability of
media liaison personnel in various government agencies to handle
crisis situations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MANUFACTURING FIRMS MORE UPBEAT ON ECONOMY: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) announced Monday that the results of a January study on
domestic manufacturing companies indicate a more upbeat attitude on
the possibility of a turnaround for the sluggish economy.</P>
      <P>According to the private think tank's study, 31.3 percent of the
companies polled believe that the economy will improve over the next
six months, compared to the previous month's 27.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, those who believe the economy will stay the same also
increased from December's 38.6 percent to January's 41.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The percentage of companies that believe the economy will take a
turn for the worse over the next two quarters went down from
December's 34.0 percent to 27.5 percent.</P>
      <P>However, TIER pointed out that because the manufacturing sector
saw a decrease in orders, production, sales and profits in January,
55.9 percent of the companies polled said that the economy was "bad,"
an increase over the previous month's 49.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Only 7 percent said that the economy was "good" in January, a
decrease from December's 14.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 37.1 percent of the respondents said that the economic
situation was "average," compared to the previous month's 36.3
percent.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, TIER President Wu Rong-i challenged a recent
assessment of Taiwan's economy by the Nomura Research Institute, a
Japanese think tank.</P>
      <P>The Nomura report predicted that Taiwan's economy will remain
mired until the year's fourth quarter. However, Wu said that the
economy will likely show signs of improvement between February and
March and will become even stronger in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although Nomura is a famed research organization, it
has also made inaccurate forecasts from time to time. "None of
Taiwan's major economic forecasting agencies have predicted that our
economy will not regain momentum until after the third quarter," he
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLISHER TO EVALUATE WHETHER TO DUMP `ON TAIWAN'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The publisher of the Chinese edition of a
controversial cartoon book titled "On Taiwan" by Japanese
ultra-rightist writer Yoshinori Kobayashi is evaluating whether to
continue publishing the book, a company spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Chen-jui, editor-in-chief of the Front Guard Publishing Co.,
said that in the face of a series of protests, bookstores began
Monday to take the book from their shelves. However, Chiu added that
the company will evaluate opinions from all walks of life before
making a final decision on whether to continue publication.</P>
      <P>The book has sparked protests from local "comfort women" and
civic organizations since its release in Taiwan. Chiu said that his
company had already printed 30,000 copies, some 25,000 of which have
already been sold.</P>
      <P>He noted that many more people visited the company Monday to buy
the book and said he had even received faxes of support from
individuals in the United States.</P>
      <P>In related news, Senior Adviser to the President, Hsu Wen-lung
issued a written statement claiming that due to the "different era,"
people today are "absolutely unable to know about the living
conditions of Taiwan people during the time of Japanese rule" and
that due to the passage of time, the people of today have a
"different knowledge of history" compared with the people of that
time.</P>
      <P>Hsu was quoted by Kobayashi as saying that comfort women tricked
or coerced into sexual slavery by the Japanese government in World
War II were actually voluntary prostitutes. Hsu later said in a press
conference that the job of comfort woman was a "reasonable trade,"
which sparked a series of protests.</P>
      <P>Hsu's statement was read at a Central Daily News-sponsored
seminar titled "Returning the Comfort Women to Their Original
Historic Status."</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the people of Taiwan should "face reality" and
urged them to redirect their energy to dealing with the child
prostitute issue. He also called on government agencies and civic
organizations to spend less time railing against the Japanese on the
comfort women issue "because the Japanese obtained the women in a
reasonable way."</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, most of the girls were actually sold to the
Japanese or their agents by their impoverished Taiwanese parents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su Cheng-ping, director-general of the Government
Information Office (GIO), said that the government cannot prohibit
the publication of the book without a legal basis.</P>
      <P>Su said that the Executive Yuan hopes that the Japanese
government will publicly apologize for the comfort women issue and
compensate them via a national fund.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Every country has problems in its
development, especially a country that is transforming from
authoritarianism to democracy, but a constitutional system needs to
be maintained as a basis, President Chen Shui-bian said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with visiting former Bolivian President Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada, Chen touted Taiwan's democracy as something
unheard of in mainland China, although Beijing is following the
island's suit in developing its economy.</P>
      <P>Citing his own political career as an example, Chen said it would
be impossible for a dissident in mainland China to turn from a
political prisoner to the elected mayor of the capital city and
eventually head of state.</P>
      <P>Describing democracy as a system valid for the whole world, Chen
lauded Bolivia and the Republic of China for choosing democracy in
preference to authoritarianism. He said he is proud that Taiwan has
never wavered in its pursuit of democracy, despite the high cost of
the transformation and Beijing's persistent military threats.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taipei City struck a sistership agreement with La
Paz when he served as the mayor of Taipei and Sanchez held the reins
of power in Bolivia. He said he looks forward to Sanchez' reelection
as head of Bolivia in 2002 and the bilateral ties that will grow.</P>
      <P>Sanchez for his part hailed Taiwan as a democratic model for Asia
and an exporter of democratic experience in the region.</P>
      <P>He branded the dispute between Taiwan and mainland China as one
of territory, economic and political systems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung said
Monday that he regrets being unable to visit the southwestern city of
Gueilin during a 10-day visit to mainland China, but that the mayor
of that city might still visit Taipei in March as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Pai, who arrived in Shanghai Saturday with a delegation of more
than 30 Taipei city officials and councilors, called on Shanghai
Mayor Xu Kuangdi Sunday and is slated to attend a two-day twin city
forum starting Tuesday. He is also scheduled to travel to Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Pai had originally intended to visit Gueilin, where he said the
thriving travel industry can provide valuable experience for Taipei's
own tourism development. However, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) notified him the day before his departure that the Gueilin leg
of his trip was not approved.</P>
      <P>Pai made his apologies and said Taipei would be willing to
partially reimburse hotels and reserved banquet locations canceled by
the delegation.</P>
      <P>However, Pai said that the mayor of Gueilin might still be able
to visit Taipei, pending MAC approval.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Pai visited an experimental elementary school
in Shanghai, a junior high school and two universities -- Shanghai
University and world-renowned Fudan University, which was established
in 1905.</P>
      <P>The administrators of Changning Experimental Elementary School,
Shanghai University and Fudan University praised the performance of
Taiwan students at their schools, saying that they are very diligent.</P>
      <P>Currently, 30 Taiwan students -- mostly the children of Taiwan
businessmen who work in Shanghai -- study at the elementary school,
while 19 students from Taiwan study at Shanghai University and 72
students study at Fudan University, 47 of whom are in the school of
medicine.</P>
      <P>Pai proposed the establishment of an exchange mechanism between
Fudan University and the National Taipei University, adding that the
details of such arrangements could be worked out by the two schools
through further discussion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. MIGHT PAY MORE ATTENTION TO CROSS-STRAIT TIES: ROC MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said Monday that the administration of U.S. President George
Bush is expected to be more concerned about the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations than the preceding administration.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while delivering a speech on "the Bush
administration's Asia-Pacific policy and its stand on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations" at a monthly meeting of the Ministry of National
Defense.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that the strategic target of the United States in the
Asia-Pacific area is to strengthen regional security and stability,
expand its market and promote democracy.</P>
      <P>"In the foreseeable future," he continued, "U.S. involvement in
cross-strait issues may become more conspicuous than before."</P>
      <P>Although the United States still insists that it will not play
the role of mediator for the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, Tien
said, it is expected to attach importance to the issues concerning
the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He stated that the Bush administration will try to bring mainland
China into such international systems as the World Trade Organization
and added that it might adopt tougher measures to force Beijing to
abide by international regulations with an aim of having Beijing
accept the values of freedom, democracy and human right gradually.</P>
      <P>As some people in the Bush administration and in the Beijing
leadership still regard the other side as potential enemies, the
scholar-turned-minister went on, the engagement policy adopted by the
Clinton administration might develop into a policy somewhere between
engagement and containment.</P>
      <P>Regarding the U.S. government's plan to establish a national
missile defense system and a theater missile defense (TMD) system, he
said that Beijing has issued warnings over the issue.</P>
      <P>Tien admitted that whether Taiwan will be included in the TMD
system constitutes a vital test of Washington's relations with
Beijing and added that Taiwan must watch developments closely.</P>
      <P>On the recent U.S. air strike against Iraq, he said that the Bush
administration apparently wanted to use the incident to consolidate
its status as world leader.</P>
      <P>Attention must be paid to the possible effect of such an attitude
on the implementation of U.S. policy toward the Asia-Pacific region
and on the handling of its ties with Taipei and Beijing, he said.</P>

Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) on several patent infringement cases
and the issue of the power of attorney.</P>
      <P>U.S. customs seized a total of US$6 million-worth of alleged
counterfeited commercial goods exported from Taiwan in the 2000
fiscal year. The amount was the second-largest, behind only mainland
China, despite the fact that the United States has asked the ROC many
times to stem the situation.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said that
the United States is most concerned about counterfeit chip markings,
CD-ROM SID codes and the power of attorney.</P>
      <P>Following Burcky's visit, another group of U.S. trade officials
will arrive in mid March for IPR talks.</P>
      <P>It was learned that U.S. businessmen pay close attention to
Taiwan's counterfeiting of CD-ROM products and that the ROC will
probably be placed on the U.S. priority watch list rather than the
general watch list of the special 301 trade clause.</P>
      <P>Most of the counterfeited products seized by the U.S. customs are
CD-ROMs, video game machines, computer parts and components, garments

      <P>The annual U.S. human rights report
issued by the Department of State Monday says that the Japanese
government has admitted the forcible recruitment of Asian women to
serve as prostitutes for Japanese soldiers during World War II.</P>
      <P>The report also says that political and individual interference
in judicial cases is one of the remaining human rights issues in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But it notes that after the inauguration of the Democratic
Progressive Party government in May 2000, the pressure on the
judiciary field has been lowered conspicuously.</P>
      <P>On the "comfort women" issue, the report says that a Japanese
government spokesman acknowledged in 1993 that the government forced
as many as 200,000 women to serve as sex slaves for the imperial
troops and that he apologized over the incident.</P>
      <P>The report indicates that the "comfort women" recruited to
entertain Japanese troops between 1932-1945 were from the Korean
peninsula, the Philippines, China and Indonesia, as well as those
with Dutch and Japanese nationalities.</P>
      <P>It says that a United Nations committee suggested in 1999 that
the Japanese government provide compensation to the surviving women

      <P>The report also points out that the Japanese government has
refused to provide compensation, contending that all compensation
issues were resolved through the signing of treaties after the war.</P>

      <P>The Japanese government acknowledged that
the Japanese Imperial Army recruited prostitutes who were
euphemistically called "comfort women" during World War II through
"coaxing or coercion," a local human rights lawyer said Monday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Wang Ching-feng, who campaigns for the
welfare of Taiwan's victims of the system, came up with a copy of a
1996 report presented by the Japanese government to the United
Nations in support of her claims.</P>
      <P>In the document, Wang said the Japanese authorities admitted that
"the recruitment of the `comfort women' was conducted mainly by
private recruiters who acted upon the request of the military.
However, in many cases they were recruited against their will,
through such means as coaxing and coercion, and at times
administrative military personnel directly took part in the
recruitment."</P>
      <P>She drew public attention to the document in a bid to dispel
claims by Japanese right-wing writer Yoshinori Kobayashi, who quoted
two Taiwanese business tycoons in his new book as saying that Taiwan
comfort women willingly joined the ranks of military prostitutes and
in fact deemed it a job that brought glory and enabled them to lead
better lives.</P>
      <P>Wang said the report was the result of a survey of the Japan
government. It was first made public in 1993 and the facts
established in the report are carried by 70 percent of Japanese high
school history textbooks.</P>

promises to create 100,000 jobs to benefit 100,000 families and one
million people if he is elected president on March 18.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If you speak to a man in the
strict words of the law, he will probably agree with you; but the
important point is that he should so profit by what you say to him as
to change his conduct. If you speak to a man in parables, he will
probably be pleased with your story; but the important point is that
he should apply the moral to himself."</TEXT>

      <P>Beijing may have tidy streets and green

said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Globe and Mail, commenting on the Communist Chinese

inspectors, but not every city sweeps up potential protesters too,
the daily said in an editorial titled "Green Beijing."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH URGED TO MAKE HUMAN RIGHTS TOP PRIORITY IN CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi on
Monday urged the Bush administration to make human rights "a top
priority in its China policy."</P>
      <P>Pelosi, a Democrat from California, made the appeal shortly
after the U.S. State Department released its annual country reports
on human rights practices for 2000, confirming that the Communist
Chinese government's human rights record has worsened over the past
year.</P>
      <P>Pelosi also said she noted that the State Department announced
the United States will introduce a resolution condemning Beijing's
human rights record when the U.N. Commission on Human Rights meets in
Geneva in March and will call on other members of the international
community to support such a resolution.</P>
      <P>"If this hard-hitting report, (titled 2000: Country Reports on
Human Rights Practices), is to mean anything, the administration must
act on its words. The Bush administration should make human rights a
top priority in its China policy," said the congresswoman, who has
been a champion of human rights in mainland China ever since
Beijing's brutal Tiananmen Square crackdown on the democracy movement
in 1989.</P>
      <P>She also called on President George W. Bush and his
administration "to organize and lobby other governments, at the
highest level, to support a resolution condemning China's human
rights practices at the commission meeting in Geneva."</P>
      <P>"Year after year, the human rights situation in China continues
to worsen, and the international community continues to be silent.
With the publication of this official report, the new administration
cannot ignore the deteriorating state of human rights in China. Now
is the time to act," said Pelosi.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Michael E. Parmly, acting assistant secretary of state
for democracy, human rights and labor, told a special State
Department briefing that "if you read the report, it's hard to come
to a conclusion that a resolution is not justified."</P>
      <P>He cited the worsened situation in mainland China in such areas
as freedom of religion, freedom of expression, the practice of Falun
Gong, and the rights of workers. He also pointed to the recent
reports on the use of psychiatric hospitals in dealing with
dissidents, saying that "all of these are elements that will inspire
our efforts to fashion a good resolution.</P>
      <P>"And we hope to start our discussions with our allies and
like-minded partners in the near future," he added.</P>
      <P>"I think there has been an improvement in certain areas in China.
Those improvements have been largely despite Beijing's efforts to
control them. The bottom line is that the government strives to
suppress any activity that it perceives as a threat to the
government," explained Parmly.</P>
      <P>But he made it clear that the purpose of this resolution is not
to point the finger at the Beijing government. "On the contrary, I
think the Chinese government has indicated, through such actions as
its welcoming again today of (U.N. Human Rights High Commissioner)
Mary Robinson's visit, its desire to participate more fully in the
international circles that discuss human rights issues."</P>

      <P>The United States announced on Monday
that it will introduce a resolution on Beijing's human rights
practices at a United Nations conference next month in order to
"encourage China to take positive, concrete steps" in improving its
human rights record.</P>
      <P>The announcement came as the State Department released its annual

human rights record" is said to have "worsened" further.</P>
      <P>A statement issued by Philip T. Reeker, the deputy State

countries, especially those on the 53-member U.N. Commission on Human

issues," Parmly said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also expressed an interest in ratifying at least one
of the two international conventions on human rights signed earlier
and in talking about allowing international observers access to
mainland Chinese prisons, he said.</P>
      <P>The U.N. Commission on Human Rights is due to meet in Geneva from

    <DATELINE>Shanghai,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Shu-fen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Deputy Mayor Pai Hsiu-hsiung said
Tuesday at the opening of the second Taipei-Shanghai City Forum that
the two municipalities share certain common issues and should have
much to learn from each other.</P>
      <P>Pai, who arrived in Shanghai Saturday with a delegation of over
30 Taipei city officials, councilors and advisers, shared the stage
with Shanghai Vice Mayor Zhou Muyao as the two-day conference titled
"Urban Development and Cultural Environment" began.</P>
      <P>Pai spoke on Taipei's development, challenges and opportunities
and described Taipei's goal of turning itself into a world-class
capital city.</P>
      <P>In the printed version of his speech, however, forum organizers
in Shanghai deleted the reference to Taipei as a "world-class capital
city" in an apparent attempt to play down the Republic of China's
status as a sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the spat he had with the ROC Mainland Affairs
Council over his itinerary prior to embarking on his 10-day mainland
visit, Pai said in his address that so long as the "goals and
directions are correct" and the exchanges and discussions are
beneficial to the people, then his delegation will press on and
"bravely move forward."</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from reporters, Pai said that he was adamant
about resigning his concurrent post as convener for the Taipei City
Mainland Affairs Task Force. He added that he had already tendered
his resignation for the post to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou before
departing for Shanghai and will do so again upon his return despite
Ma's urgings for him to remain in the post.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Zhou said in his opening address that the second
city-to-city forum between Taipei and Shanghai is "very significant"
to the promotion of friendship and exchanges between the
"compatriots" of both cities.</P>
      <P>The first Taipei-Shanghai Forum was held in Taipei last May. The
second forum is slated to continue to touch on similar issues, such
as urban planning, environmental protection, education and
transportation.</P>
      <P>Zhou said that Shanghai has enjoyed nine consecutive years of
annual economic growth above 9 percent, while investments from Taiwan
businesspeople have comprised a major portion of all foreign
investments. As of January, he continued, Taiwan businesspeople had
made a total of more than 3,865 investments in Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S AVERAGE TEMPERATURE UP 1 C OVER LAST 100 YEARS: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The effects of global warming have led to
an increase of one degree Celsius in Taiwan's average temperature
over the past century, according to an analysis by the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Temperatures recorded at weather stations in Taipei, Taichung,
Tainan and Hualien show that the island is undergoing a climate
change that has resulted in rising average temperatures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's average temperature for the whole of 2000 was higher
than previously recorded average annual temperatures for the island,
the CWB added.</P>
      <P>Hsinchu, Suao, and Taichung last year recorded their third
highest average annual temperatures since the time when recordkeeping
began, while Keelung, Taipei, Chiayi, Hualien, Yangmingshan and
Yushan reached their fourth highest average annual temperatures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's climate has been steadily getting warmer over the past
century, the CWB said. It added that Taiwan's overall average
increase in temperature has been 56 percent that of major cities,
such as Taipei, Taichung, Tainan and Hualien, suggesting that
population density and urbanization are factors besides global
warming effects that influence climate change.</P>
      <P>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the
United Nations Environment Program reported that the average global
temperature in 2000 was 14.3 degrees Celsius, marking a 0.6 degrees
Celsius increase over the past hundred years.</P>
      <P>The British Weather Bureau has estimated that the average global
temperature will climb by 3.2 degrees Celsius from now until the end
of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The year 2000 also experienced the third largest annual volume of
rainfall in the last hundred years due to the reverse El Nino effect,
causing significant increases in the volume of rainfall in regions of
the western Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, as well as in Brazil
and southern Africa.</P>
      <P>The annual volume of rainfall in Taiwan last year was also higher
than the average, with Suao topping the list in this area,
experiencing a rainfall volume of 6,595 mm for the year, the CWB
said.</P>
      <P>The CWB also warned that the annual volume of rainfall will
increase by 7 percent from now until the end of the 21st century. The
time and location of the rainfall will be unevenly distributed,
suggesting more frequent occurrences of storms and droughts around
the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REPORT HAILS ROC'S DECREASED POLITICAL INFLUENCE OVER JUDICIARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Tuesday
that creation of a clean and transparent political environment is
the new Republic of China government's top policy goal.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a newly released U.S. State
Department report on human rights conditions in major countries
around the world in 2000, which hails Taiwan's new Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led government's efforts to eliminate
corruption and to diminish political influence over the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The annual U.S. human rights report also notes that political
and personal pressures on the judiciary have decreased significantly
in Taiwan over the past year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, a senior MOJ official said
Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan made the assurances on his
swearing-in day that he will not never allow political forces in the
executive and legislative branches to improperly interfere with
judiciary operations.</P>
      <P>"Minister Chen has never wavered in his determination to honor
his promise since assuming office, and all prosecutors have all
abided by this principle in carrying out their official duties," the
official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that gang- and money-linked politics, also known as "black
gold" politics in local society, has gradually eroded Taiwan's
national competitiveness over the past few decades, the official
said the DPP government has intensified crackdown on organized
crime and official corruption since its inauguration last May.</P>
      <P>In the process, the official said, the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) has contributed much to the new
government's anti-"black gold" campaign.</P>
      <P>The official said all MOJ agencies and staff members will
continue to handle all judicial cases in line with the principles of
impartiality and independence of any political or interest groups in
order to restore local people's confidence and trust in the
country's judicial system.</P>
      <P>In its "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -- 2000," the
U.S. State Department said Taiwan authorities generally respect
human rights, but political and personal pressures on the judiciary
is one of its remaining human rights problems.</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the March victory of DPP
presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian marked the first transition
from one political party to another in Taiwan's history.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the report said, the Judicial Yuan is
constitutionally independent of the other branches of the political
system, but corruption and political influence remain serious
problems.</P>
      <P>"However, the new DPP government made efforts to eliminate
corruption and to diminish political influence over the judiciary,"
the report said.</P>
      <P>It further said Taiwan has a dynamic, export-oriented, free
market economy. "Liberalization of the economy diminished the
dominant role that state-owned and party-run enterprises played in
such major sectors of finance, transportation, utilities,
shipbuilding, steel, telecommunications and petrochemicals," the
report noted.</P>
      <P>During the past year, the report went on, Taiwan's principal
human rights problems included police abuse of detainees, prison
overcrowding, political and personal pressures on the judiciary, some
infringements on citizens' privacy, violence and discrimination
against women and child prostitution and abuse.</P>
      <P>"However, during the year, political and personal pressures on
the judiciary decreased significantly," the report said, adding that
in his May 20 inaugural address, President Chen declared that Taiwan
must include international human rights in its legal code and
establish a national human rights committee.</P>
      <P>The report also said that there were no reports of political or
other extrajudicial killings and disappearances in Taiwan, and that
the ROC's Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that no violence,
threat, inducement, fraud, or other improper means shall be used
against accused persons.</P>
      <P>"However, there were credible reports that police occasionally
physically abused persons in their custody," the report claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMY FLASHES BLUE LIGHT FOR SECOND STRAIGHT MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy flashed a blue light,
indicating economic recession according to the country's official
rating system, for the second consecutive month in January, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that with exports and industrial growth
showing negative growth, a continued sluggish stock market, an
increasing unemployment rate, and the weeklong Chinese New Year
holiday break in January, the economy flashed a blue light for the
month.</P>
      <P>In addition, the leading economic indicators, which gauge
economic prospects for the next three months and six months, dropped
to 97.6 points, the 12th consecutive month of decline, hitting their
lowest level since April 1999, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy also flashed a blue light in December,
representing the first time it had done so since March 1999.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color rating system, a "red" light means
the economy is overheated, "yellow-red" indicates the economy is
heating up, "yellow" reflects steady growth, "yellow-blue" signals
economic sluggishness, and "blue" represents recession.</P>
      <P>In applying the system, the CEPD measures nine major areas of
economic activity: industrial production, money supply M1b, bank
clearing and remittance, stock prices, new manufacturing orders,
exports, manufacturing inventory ratios, non-agricultural employment,
and direct and indirect finance.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that leading economic indicators have
registered a decline since February last year, adding that over the
past four months, three months have registered a leading index
decline of more than 1 percent, showing the depth of Taiwan's
economic sluggishness and that prospects are not good.</P>
      <P>As such, CEPD officials said that economic growth this year could
be lower than 4.7 percent.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics
predicted recently that economic growth for this year would reach
5.25 percent.</P>
      <P>The directorate said that if the effect brought about by the

    <HEADLINE>VP CALLS FOR END TO DISPUTE OVER `IMPROPER REMARKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Tuesday called
for an end to the controversy over senior presidential adviser Hsu 
Wen-lung's "improper remarks" about Japan's forcible recruitment of
Taiwan women to serve as prostitutes during World War II.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Hsu, a local tycoon who was vocal in his support of
President Chen Shui-bian's election campaign last year, already
apologized the previous day for his inappropriate words.</P>
      <P>She added that everyone makes the mistake of saying the wrong
words sometimes and lamented that the entire issue has already been
pan-politicized.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the important issue at hand is to pay more concern
to how the younger generation's "Japan-idolizing" culture is eroding
Taiwan's culture.</P>
      <P>Lu's remarks came after days of nationwide uproar over a Japanese
comic book titled "On Taiwan" that quoted Hsu's claims that Taiwan
women "willingly" joined the ranks of military prostitutes and in
fact deemed it a job that brought glory and enabled them to lead
better lives.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers on Tuesday continued to call for Hsu's
resignation from his honorary post and for a ban on the book. Some
legislators also demanded that the Cabinet list Japanese right-wing
cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi as a persona non grata in Taiwan for
his book's insulting remarks about Taiwan sex slaves, euphemistically
named "comfort women."</P>
      <P>However, Wu Nai-jen, the outspoken secretary-general of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said that Hsu is a "public
personality" and not a "political personality." As such, he added
that Hsu should not have to be called on to resign for "a little
personal mistake."</P>
      <P>Wu praised Hsu for having "many qualities worthy of respect" but
admitted that Hsu may have made the mistake of projecting his
"personal experiences" on the comfort women issue to a point that he
believed they were the norm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition New Party Legislator Elmer Feng said that
the recent U.S. State Department annual report on human rights made
it "very clear" that the Japanese government has already admitted to
forcibly recruiting Asian women to entertain Japanese troops during
World War II.</P>
      <P>He added that although Hsu should be recognized for admitting to
his mistake and apologizing, he should also resign his senior adviser
post and establish two foundations to promote gender equality and to
research the historical "truth" of the comfort women's suffering.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Chen Chao-jung said that if the
government really wants to show its determination to carry out
administrative reform, then it should first ask Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao to resign for "calling others not to say words that may
damage bilateral ties (between Taiwan and Japan) at a time when the
dignity of the people of Taiwan was being tramped on.</P>

      <P>The semi-official Straits Exchange

was reported missing in Nanning, Guangxi province. He was confirmed
dead by mainland police Monday afternoon.</P>

      <P>Yen Wan-chin, deputy SEF secretary-general, said that the agency
has asked officials from a Taiwan businessmen's association to meet

      <P>Yen said that the foundation has learned that the local

    <HEADLINE>BIOTECH INVESTMENT TO EXCEED NT$10 BILLION IN  2001: MOEA OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Francy Fang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Shih Yen-hsiang, director general of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau (IDB),
said Tuesday morning that investment in Taiwan's biotechnology
industry will exceed NT$10 billion (US$310 million) in 2001.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan's present level of biotechnology has been
stretched to its developmental limits, and the industry requires
significant new investment in order to break through to a new level.</P>
      <P>Located in the Greater Taipei area, Yangming Hospital, Veterans
General Hospital, National Taiwan University Hospital and Academia
Sinica make the island's capital geographically convenient for
biotechnological development. However, Shih cautioned that investors
should determine whether to make the area a development center or a
mass production facility before taking any action.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at the "biotechnology, software and IC
design and development" public hearing sposored by Kuomintang
Legislator Ting Shou-chung in the Legislative Yuan Wednesday morning.
Noting that mass production in this sector requires great areas of
land, he pointed out that investors may consider Taipei real estate
to be expensive.</P>
      <P>Shih added that for example that one "ping' (about 36 square
feet) of space in the Nankang district of Taipei City currently
costs NT$260,000-270,000 (US$8,100-8,400). With Taipei County land
prices much less expensive, that area has attracted more investors
than the city, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Shih thus called for greater attention to more evenly distributed
investment throughout the entire Greater Taipei area in order to fuel
the growth of the biotech sector in the future.</P>
      <P>According to the Biomedical Technology Center of Industrial
Technology Research Institute (ITRI), a government-owned research
institute, Taiwan's latest biotechnology development is focused on
transferable technology and techniques for making titanium spinal
supporters, physical examination software and hardware,
anti-resistance respiratory rate measuring devices, and low-radiation
high-frequency X-ray machines.</P>
      <P>Other diagnostic technologies now in development in Taiwan are
physical examination facilities and tele-information techniques, fat
measuring systems and digital X-ray devices, according to ITRI.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEAT BELTS POSE DANGERS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian studies show that buckling up
could be dangerous for young children aged between four and eight.</P>
      <P>The studies indicate that restraining a 20 kilogram child in a
seat belt designed for a 75 kilogram man is dangerous if the car is
involved in a crash.</P>
      <P>The same studies show that booster seats provide much more safety
to children up to the weight of about 40 kilograms.</P>
      <P>In Nova Scotia, four- to eight-year-olds who are injured in
accidents are eight times more likely to be in adult seat belts than
car seats or booster seats. In Saskatchewan, children in that age
group who are injured in accidents are 33 times more likely to be in
adult seat belts.</P>
      <P>If a child is not ejected from a vehicle during a car accident,
the unprotected abdomen takes the force of the crash. This increases
the likelihood of spinal cord injuries or serious injuries to vital
organs.</P>
      <P>"The injuries to young children and deaths to these young
children are preventable," Valerie Lee of the Infant and Toddler
Safety Association said. "Seventy-five percent of the deaths and
injuries don't have to happen."</P>
      <P>In the U.S. state of Washington, a law requiring young kids to
sit in booster seats will become effective next year. But in Canada,
no province has led the way with a booster seat law even though
statistics show that an overwhelming number of children aged four to
eight years old who are injured in car accidents are strapped in seat
belts that were never designed to fit them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIEX DENIES REPORTS OF PLAN TO VET OVERSEAS ACCOUNTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange (Taiex) has
denied a media report that it plans to check the accounts of listed
Taiwan companies with operations in foreign countries, including
mainland China, the Liberty Times reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taiex was cited as reporting that it only wishes to send
officials to assess the spin-off operations of several Taiwan-based
groups in mainland China, rather than the "account vetting" as
earlier reported.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Taiex plan remains on the drawing
board and it has not worked out a list of which companies it plans to
visit. The Taiex stressed that it is not entitled to checking the
accounts of Taiwan companies' operations in mainland China, nor will
it do so in the future.</P>
      <P>The Taiex was reported as saying that eastern and southern
regions in mainland China have been the leading investment
destinations for Taiwan-based companies listed on the Taiwan stock
market, while the electronics sector has fueled the most capital into
the mainland, again mainly in southern and eastern regions.</P>
      <P>Taiex statistics show that a total of 529 companies are listed on
the local stock market, 310 of which have set up affiliates overseas.
In mainland China alone, those Taiwan firms have already established
443 branches, with 165 of them being set up by electronics
businesses.</P>
      <P>As spin-off operations by those Taiwan-based firms in mainland
China must be conducted indirectly through a third area, it would be
impossible for the Taiex to vet their accounts there, as such
accounts are under the jurisdiction of the mainland Chinese
authorities, sources said, adding that the only thing the Taiex can
do is to closely watch the financial sheets of their parent companies
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, told the Liberty Times that the Taiex plan to assess
overseas operations of Taiwan listed companies is necessary to
protect their shareholders' business interests and the need to
maintain a stable domestic capital market.</P>
      <P>Given the fact that hostility remains between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, Wu said that the government needs to cautiously
gauge the possible consequences should it decide to relax the current
"no haste, be patient" mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether mainland China's opening of its
b-share market to domestic investors will further fuel Taiwan's
capital flight west, Wu contended that such an effect can be avoided
if the Taiwan authorities iron out effective measures to regulate
Taiwan investors' trading in mainland b-shares.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) Tuesday
rebutted claims that there has been a so-called "suicide fad" in
central Nantou and Taichung counties since the Sept. 21 earthquake in
1999, the worst-ever to hit Taiwan in a century.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the DOH during the first 10 months of 2000
show that suicide ratios in the two counties, which were the most
severely devastated by the catastrophe, have not risen noticeably as
compared to the levels registered around the country during the same
period of 1999.</P>
      <P>During the first 10 months of last year, the suicide ratio in
Nantou and Taichung counties was 15.11 and 9.45 out of every 100,000
people, respectively, a slight increase of 1.16 and 0.32 people in
every 100,000 as compared to their respective levels posted during
the same period of 1999.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, long-term data and statistics are needed to
judge whether there is a "suicide fad." The Cabinet-level government
agency said that although there have been many cases of suicide
attempts in recent months, it is improper to rashly call the
phenomenon a "suicide fad" in order to minimize the impact on the
whole of society.</P>
      <P>DOH statistics show that more than 2,100 people have killed
themselves every year since 1997, an average of six deaths per day.
However, it noted, the daily number would rise to at least 10 people
if the number of failed suicides were added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO ENTRY NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO 'BIG 3 LINKS': PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday
that the Republic of China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will not necessarily lead to an immediate opening
of the direct "big three links" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks in response to a press inquiry
whether the ROC government would announce the opening of direct
cross-strait trade, postal and transport links, commonly known as
"big three links," immediately after Taipei's and Beijing's WTO
entry in October or November.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, mainland Chinese
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng has
said recently that mainland China would be able to join the WTO
either in October or November at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has no way to know at this moment whether mainland
China would be admitted to the WTO in October or November. "But
anyway, the WTO entry will not be the only decisive factor in
mulling the timing for opening the 'big three links,'" he noted.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that national security and the island's
economic development will be the top concerns in deciding when the
'big three links' will be inaugurated.</P>
      <P>As WTO member countries have reached a consensus that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should be admitted into the world trade
regulatory body almost simultaneously, Taiwan's WTO entry would be
affected if mainland China's accession is postponed to the fourth
quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>Many observers originally predicted that Taipei and Beijing
could join the WTO this summer. But the latest development
shows that mainland China's negotiations with the multilateral WTO
working party has not proceeded as smoothly as previously expected,
particularly in the field of service market opening. Against this
backdrop, the mainland foreign trade minister said Beijing's WTO
entry may be delayed until this winter.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang said relevant ROC government agencies will keep
a close watch on the development of Beijing's WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang attended a changeover ceremony for the head of
a cross-party association for promoting rights and interests of
Taiwanese investors in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chang said although the mainland
policies of major domestic political parties are not completely
identical, they have a common goal of protecting the legitimate
rights and interests of Taiwanese business people on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hopes
to cooperate with all opposition parties in realize this policy
goal.</P>
      <P>The association, composed of legislators of different political
stripes, is scheduled to organize a delegation to visit the
mainland in mid-March to inspect the effects of the newly
opened "mini three links" between Taiwan's offshore frontline
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China's Xiamen and
Fuzhou as well as to discuss with mainland officials
possible effective measures to better protect personal safety of
Taiwanese businessmen in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The association will also sponsor a seminar in June on the
prospects for cross-strait relations after their WTO accession, with

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has once again made clear its grave
concern over Japan's forcible use of Asian women, including those
from Taiwan, as sex slaves during World War II and over "untrue"
related content carried in Japanese text books.</P>
      <P>Lo Fu-chen, Taiwan's head representative in Japan, Monday visited
Toshio Goto, chairman of the Interchange Association, Japan's liaison
office with Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic relations, to
express Taiwan's concern and position.</P>
      <P>Lo demanded a quick formal apology and compensation from the
Japanese government to former Taiwanese wartime sex slaves,
euphemistically named "comfort women" and a more vigilant attitude
toward the way that Japan's wartime atrocities are represented in
today's Japanese text books.</P>
      <P>The ROC liaison officer asked the Japanese government not to shun
the "comfort women" issue and to expedite its due apologies and
compensation to all affected individuals before time runs out for the
surviving former sex slaves, who are now in their 70s or 80s.</P>
      <P>Lo told Goto that the Ad Hoc Committee on Taiwanese Comfort
Women, organized by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and several
human rights and women's rights activist groups in 1991, has made
similar appeals to the Japanese government over the years, but
without ever receiving a satisfactory response.</P>
      <P>The visit came in the wake of reports that some retrospective
accounts of Japanese wartime atrocities have been tampered with in
the text books for the 2002 academic year on the grounds that the
accounts could be perceived as a kind of mental "self-abuse." The
Japanese authorities are said to have taken a hands-off attitude
toward the alleged falsification, Lo told Goto.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, sources from Taipei said Tuesday that Lo will be
summoned back to Taipei to make a report to the Legislative Yuan on
March 7 on relations between Taiwan and Japan and on the recent
national furor in Taiwan over a comic book titled "On Taiwan"
authored by Japanese cartoonist Yoshinori Kobayashi, in which
Kobayashi quoted a veteran Taiwanese tycoon as saying that the
Taiwanese comfort women were willing prostitutes.</P>

relations association. He was scheduled to give a speech at a
luncheon meeting Tuesday to be organized by the association.</P>
      <P>Shortly after his arrival in Dallas, Chen met with a senior
executive of American Airlines to get first-hand information about
the carrier's preparations for the April 1 inauguration of direct
flight services between Silicon Valley in San Jose, California and
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said the U.S. carrier's decision to open the new flight
route signifies the close relations between Taiwan and Silicon
Valley, the stronghold of the U.S. high-tech industry.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States is one of the ROC's most important
friends, Chen said the ROC representative office has spared no effort
to boost contact and communication with the U.S. executive branch,
Congress, think tanks and news organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has effective communication channels with the
U.S. executive branch and that Taiwan's political democratization has
made it easier to forge close ties with the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, U.S. think tanks and news media generally
recognize the ROC's achievements in economic prosperity and political
democratization.</P>
      <P>Chen further said that although the new Bush administration has
been inaugurated for only slightly more than one month, its policy
toward Taiwan is not expected to undergo dramatic changes in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that U.S. foreign policy has consistently focused on
its own national interests, Chen said the basic U.S. policy toward
Taiwan and cross-Taiwan Strait relations will not change unless
cross-strait ties or internal situations in either Taiwan, mainland
China or the United States see drastic changes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan met
with People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong Tuesday and the
two agreed to bolster future cooperation.</P>
      <P>Playing host to ranking officials of Taiwan's two major
opposition parties in a private feast to welcome the arrival of
spring, Lien stressed that the meeting was only a chance to be with
some old friends and talk out issues related to future cooperation
with the PFP.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the two political parties should try to establish
mechanisms to boost mutual communication and understanding and added
that he is willing to discuss this with Soong on other occasions, as
long as their cooperation benefits Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong also described his meeting with Lien as a "private union,"
claiming that they might also exchange views and opinions on issues
of major national concern in efforts to exercise their roles as
effective political parties.</P>
      <P>He added that political parties should engage in positive
competition while seeking to build consensus. Both the KMT and the
PFP believe that the Republic of China must strive for its existence
and that Taiwan's relations with mainland China are of vital
importance to the country's persistent progress, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTERS MAY BE PUNISHED OVER KENTING OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three ministerial-level officials are
likely to be punished for apparent dereliction of duty in the wake of
an early January oil spill in southern Taiwan, sources from the
Legislative Yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung said Transportation And Communications Minister Yeh
Chu-lan, Environmental Protection Administrator Lin Chun-yi and his
deputy Lee Chieh-mu, might be disciplined as a result of the oil
slick that has caused an ecological disaster to coral reefs in
southern Taiwan that will take the sensitive ecosystem years from
which to recover.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission will soon mete out punishment for the three political
appointees to demonstrate the government's willingness to shoulder
responsibility for the catalogue of errors and omissions following
the accident.</P>
      <P>After the Greek freighter Amorgos ran aground off the coast of
Kenting at the southernmost tip of Taiwan Jan. 14 and broke in two,
the most crucial time for dealing with the resulting spillage of fuel
oil -- between Jan. 15 and Feb. 1 -- was lost because relevant top
officials passed the buck for handling the disaster, with each saying
the other should do the work.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Cabinet has a rapid reaction center under the
Disaster Prevention Committee, Chang said the country has related
legal systems for dealing with such cases, but the chaos still
happened simply because of the officials' gross dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>As to whether the three officials should be asked to step down to
bear political responsibility, Chang said his office is still
pondering the matter, adding that there is "no timetable" for that
kind of decision.</P>
      <P>The freighter, carrying 60,000 tons of iron ore, was heading for
Nantong in mainland China from Singapore when it developed mechanical
problems and began to drift. It ran aground one mile off the coast of
Oluanpi, Taiwan's southernmost tip.</P>
      <P>All 25 crewmembers were rescued, but the ship later broke in two
and an estimated 1,150 tons of fuel oil gushed out of the vessel and
blanketed coral reefs in the Oluanpi area.</P>
      <P>Since then, opposition parties have called on the chiefs of
related agencies, including the Environmental Protection
Administration, to resign from their posts for their dereliction of
duty.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, NETHERLANDS SIGN PACT FOR AVOIDANCE OF DOUBLE TAXATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,   Feb.   27   (CNA)
(By P. C. Tang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and the
Netherlands signed an agreement in The Hague Tuesday for the
avoidance of double taxation.</P>
      <P>The agreement was inked by ROC Representative to the Netherlands
Ku Chung-lien and Siebe Schuur, the representative of the Netherlands
Trade and Investment Office in Taipei, on behalf of their respective
governments.</P>
      <P>The accord will exempt people from the two countries from double
taxation and facilitate prevention of tax evasion by their
corporations and individuals. The pact will take effect after both
sides complete their domestic procedures or relevant formalities.</P>
      <P>Ku said at the signing ceremony that the agreement is expected
to benefit ROC and Dutch trading companies, manufacturing
corporations and individual investors.</P>
      <P>"The accord marks a new milestone in the development of
ROC-Dutch relations and a new beginning for further progress in ROC
relations with other European countries," Ku noted.</P>
      <P>Ku also expressed appreciation for Schuur's efforts to push for
the signing of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ku, a retired admiral who once served as ROC Navy
commander-in-chief, hosted a reception to bid farewell to more than
60 of his Dutch friends in various circles as he will soon end his
nearly four-year stint as the de facto ROC ambassador to the
Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Ku said Taiwan has won worldwide recognition as a full-fledged
democracy following its first peaceful transition of power between
different political parties in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of President Chen Shui-bian, Ku said, the
new ROC government is placing even more emphasis on the promotion of
human rights, environmental protection, peace and freedom as well as
the fulfillment of the ROC's obligation as a member of the
international community.</P>
      <P>"I hope all people around the world who are aware of our
country's achievements in economic development and political
democratization will support our bid to join more international
activities and organizations," Ku said.</P>
      <P>Ku is scheduled to leave the Netherlands for home on March 5,
ending his 50-year career in the military and government services.
Ku said he will continue dedicating himself to promoting ROC-Dutch
ties after his retirement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SHOULD SUPPORT TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN INT'L BODIES: U.S. SENATOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Sen. Max Baucus Tuesday urged the
Bush administration to support Taiwan's entry into international
organizations that do not require statehood for membership.</P>
      <P>Stressing Taiwan's need for "international space," the
Democratic senator from Montana also said the United States
should work creatively for Taiwan's involvement when statehood is a
requirement.</P>
      <P>In his address "The Contours of a Bipartisan China Policy"
presented at the Nixon Center, Baucus said the the United States
should recognize and support the positive economic and political
developments on Taiwan in recent years by changing its policy
relating to the exchange of visits between Taiwan and the United
States by their senior government officials.</P>
      <P>Baucus described as "absurd" the notion that he could meet
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian in Taiwan last December
but not in the United States when Chen stopped over in Los Angeles on
his way to Central America in August last year.</P>
      <P>"Chen Shui-bian is the democratically elected leader of the 22
million people on Taiwan. He should be able to visit the United
States and meet with whomever he wants," Baucus said, adding that
U.S. Cabinet members should also be able to travel to Taiwan and meet
with senior leaders there.</P>
      <P>Baucus said that although Beijing is expected to object, the
United States must lay the ground work carefully for this policy
change. He stressed that "the decision should be ours to make,
not Beijing's."</P>
      <P>The senator noted Beijing is concerned that the United States may
sell Taiwan destroyers with Aegis defensive and war-fighting
capability and that the United States may include Taiwan in a Theater
Missile Defense system for Northeast Asia. He added, however, that
"in a very real sense, China has brought this problem on itself."</P>
      <P>Baucus explained that this is because Beijing continues to refuse
to renounce the use of military force against Taiwan. "Instead, they
build up conventional and missile forces along the coast facing
Taiwan. Military threats aimed at intimidating Taiwan continue," he
said.</P>
      <P>"If China were to act in a less provocative way, there would be
less pressure in the United States to sell new weaponry (to Taiwan).
Absent a fundamental change by China, Taiwan will need a modern and
sophisticated defense, and the United States will provide it," said
the senator.</P>
      <P>In the view of Baucus, the true bedrock of Taiwan's security and
stability does not lie in military hardware. Instead, he said,
Taiwan's long-term prospects depend on its continuing development as
a robust democracy and a thriving market economy, on its growing
economic, cultural and political contacts with the mainland and
others in the region, on the abiding commitment by the United States
to a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan question, and on America's
ability to help incorporate China into the regional and global
economic and political systems.</P>
      <P>Baucus indicated that the American message to Beijing and Taipei
is unchanged: they must resolve their differences through
negotiation; a settlement must be found by peaceful means; and
neither side should take any unilateral steps to change the
situation.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China government spokesman Su
Cheng-ping was quoted Wednesday by Beijing's official Xinhua News
Agency as saying that news exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait could not significantly expand if cross-strait dialogue
were not restarted.</P>
      <P>Su, who gave an exclusive interview Monday for two Xinhua News
Agency reporters, Fan Liqing and Chen Binhua, said if any
restrictions or inconveniences exist for the mainland Chinese
journalists covering news in Taiwan, it is only out of security
considerations.</P>
      <P>"It's all because cross-strait relations are still technically in
a state of hostility," Su was quoted by the Xinhua News Agency
reporters as saying.</P>
      <P>Su, director-general of the Government Information Office (GIO),
said a total opening with no strings attached of news coverage by
Taiwan and mainland Chinese reporters of each other's territory must
be the result of cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that if cross-strait dialogue were not resumed
in the near future, Taiwan would still be willing to "implement the
parts that it could handle."</P>
      <P>Noting that there has been no significant progress in the
development of cross-strait relations since the time Taiwan opened
its doors to the mainland Chinese media last November, Su said big
changes on this policy are not expected unless the cross-strait
dialogue is reopened.</P>
      <P>Taiwan agreed last November to allow mainland media organizations
to post journalists and camera crews on the island for up to one
month per visit in an effort to improve bilateral relations and
facilitate new exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Su said the policy will be reviewed by the government shortly,
the Xinhua News Agency reported.</P>
      <P>To wrap up their Wednesday report, Fan and Chen, who were the
first two mainland Chinese reporters allowed to be stationed in
Taiwan and who began covering news on the island on Feb. 8,
criticized the amount of red tape involved in the Republic of China
government's receiving and processing of their applications to work
in Taiwan, saying some of the regulations are "irrational and
discriminative."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEPUTY USTR MEETS ROC OFFICIALS ON IPR PROTECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
Claude Burcky met with senior Republic of China trade officials
Wednesday on further cooperation in intellectual property rights
(IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>Burcky, heading a delegation of officials of the Office of
the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), arrived in Taipei Tuesday for
IPR talks under a special clause of the U.S. Omnibus Trade Act of
1988, also known as "Special Article 301."</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Burcky first paid a courtesy call on ROC Vice
Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long and then went to the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) to
begin consultations on relevant issues.</P>
      <P>BOFT Director-General Wu Wen-ya served as the chief ROC
negotiator in the one-day IPR talks.</P>
      <P>The USTR is scheduled to unveil an annual report trade
barriers imposed by America's major trade partners between March and
April. According to the ROC Representative Office in the United
States, the USTR is likely to include the ROC in the "priority watch
list" in its "Special 301" report this year.</P>
      <P>The ROC was placed in the "Watch List" in 1998, 1999 and 2000.
If the ROC is really included in the "Priority Watch List" this year,
it would mark a setback for its bid to spare Taiwan from any USTR
watch lists for possible U.S. trade sanctions over alleged IPR
violations.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said they would do their utmost to convince the
USTR delegates to remove Taiwan from any "Special 301 List" as
Taiwan has made strenuous efforts to crack down on commercial
counterfeiting or piracy over the past year.</P>
      <P>For instance, the officials said, the ROC is the only country in
the world that has adopted Chip Marking and SID Code systems to
prevent exports and domestic sales of counterfeit CD-ROM disc. In
addition, the officials said, Taiwan has also
implemented many other measures to stem commercial piracy and IPR
infringements.</P>
      <P>Quoting U.S. customs tallies, the officials
said Taiwan-originating counterfeit goods seized by the U.S. customs
authorities have declined sharply in the past year.</P>
      <P>U.S. customs confiscated an estimated US$45 million worth of
counterfeit products between October 1000 and September 2000. Of
the amount, about US$15 million, or 32 percent of the total, came
from mainland China, making the mainland the largest source of
counterfeit exports to the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan came in second, with the seizure of about US$6 million
worth of Taiwan-originating fake goods or 14 percent of the
total. The figure marked an 86 percent decrease from the 1999 level.</P>
      <P>"The substantial drop also indicates that our
anti-counterfeiting operations have borne fruits," said BOFT
Director-General Wu.</P>
      <P>In 2000, local law enforcement authorities confiscated NT$7.96
billion (US$247 million) wroth of counterfeit products in Taiwan,
with music recordings accounting for the lion's share. Among the
seizures were 50,000-plus computer software disks and 65,000 video
game cassettes.</P>

(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine members of the U.S. House of
Representatives introduced a House resolution Monday, urging the
United States to press for the passage of a resolution at the annual
United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) session in March
calling on Communist China to end its "egregious human rights
violations."</P>
      <P>Led by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the congressmen pointed out
when introducing the resolution that according to the State
Department and international human rights organizations, human rights
abuses continue to occur on a widespread basis throughout mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The resolution urges the U.S. government to seek co-sponsors to
introduce a resolution at the forthcoming UNCHR session in Geneva,
calling on Beijing to end its human rights abuses. It also urges the
United States to take the lead in organizing multilateral support to
obtain passage of such a resolution by the commission because:</P>
      <P>--Beijing has yet to demonstrate its willingness to abide by
internationally accepted norms of freedom of belief, expression and
association by repealing or amending laws and decrees that restrict
those freedoms;</P>
      <P>--Communist China continues to ban and criminalize groups it
labels as cults or heretical organizations;</P>
      <P>--The Beijing regime has repressed unregistered religious
congregations and spiritual movements, including Falun Gong, and
persists in persecuting persons on the basis of unauthorized
religious activities using such measures as harassment, prolonged
detention, physical abuse, incarceration and closure or destruction
of places of worship;</P>
      <P>--Authorities in Communist China have continued their efforts to
extinguish expressions of protest or criticism, have detained scores
of citizens associated with attempts to organize a peaceful
opposition, to expose corruption, to preserve their ethnic minority
identity, or to use the Internet for the free exchange of ideas, and
have sentenced many citizens so detained to harsh prison terms;</P>
      <P>--The Beijing authorities continue to exert control over
religious and cultural institutions in Tibet, abusing human rights
through instances of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention of
Tibetans without public trial for peacefully expressing their
political or religious views;</P>
      <P>--Bilateral human rights dialogues between several nations and
Communist China have yet to produce substantial adherence to
international norms; and</P>

and Political Rights, but it has yet to take the steps necessary to

    <HEADLINE>OTTAWA AREA FRIENDS BID FAREWELL TO ROC REPRESENTATIVE IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several hundred people, including members
of Parliament, ambassadors from major "friendly" countries, and
Chinese community leaders from Montreal, bid farewell to Dr.
Fang Chin-yen of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada
and his wife Tuesday.</P>
      <P>At a reception he hosted at the Chateau Laurier Hotel just beside
Parliament Hill in downtown Ottawa, Fang thanked Canadian and foreign
friends for their support of the Republic of China on Taiwan during
his four-and-a-half years in office in Canada.</P>
      <P>Among the crowd of guests were ranking envoys from countries that
do not have diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Most of them preferred that
their names not be be publicized.</P>
      <P>Not provoking an open fight with the PRC Embassy in Canada has
been a major "policy" of the TECO under Fang's leadership. Privately,
he has worked to convince Canadian bureaucrats to deal with Taiwan
"in their own way."</P>
      <P>For example, when Communist Chinese diplomats attempted to meddle
in the Maersk Dubai case in 1996-97, Fang suggested to Canadian
officials that they did not have to carry out Beijing's
"instructions" in handling the case.</P>
      <P>In that saga, Taiwan and Romania wrestled for jurisdiction over
the shipping liner on which Republic of China officers were accused
by Filipino crew members of throwing three Romanian refugees
overboard in the Atlantic Ocean. The Republic of China eventually won
the right to try the case and the accused were sent to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Fang, a former vice minister in the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, was widely credited with settling the Maersk Dubai dispute,
a knotty issue that threatened to jeopardize bilateral ties between
Taiwan and Canada.</P>
      <P>Two-way exchanges between Canada and Taiwan have blossomed since
then, with merchandise trade topping C$6 billion (US$3.29 billion)
last year. Exchanges in the fields of culture, tourism, education,
and science and technology have also increased.</P>
      <P>Fang and his wife have bid farewell to friends in Vancouver,
Toronto and Montreal in separate parties over the past few weeks.
Fang is scheduled to leave Canada for Taiwan next month, ending a
45-year career as one of Taiwan's top diplomats. The 69-year-old said
he is looking forward to a retirement life in which his only boss
will be his beloved wife.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER DECLINES TRANSPORTATION MINISTER'S OFFER TO RESIGN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung declined
Transportation and Communications Minister Yeh Chu-lan's offer
Wednesday to resign to bear political responsibility for the
mishandling of an oil spill in southern Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>Chang said a period of Cabinet soul-searching is under way and no
officials, particularly political appointees, will be allowed to
resign before the "overall examination and reassessment" process is
completed.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a legislator-turned-minister and a stalwart of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, submitted her oral resignation Tuesday
soon after the premier said he is considering punishing several
ministerial-level officials.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the punishments would demonstrate the
government's willingness to shoulder responsibility for the catalogue
of errors and omissions following the oil slick caused when a Greek
freighter ran aground on the southernmost tip of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh was quoted by officials from the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications as saying Wednesday that she would rather resign
than face disciplinary action.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who said at the Legislative Yuan Tuesday that she would
accept all the responsibility for the incident if people consider
that it was poorly handled by the government, is expected to submit a
formal written resignation to Chang Thursday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a number of legislators from the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) pointed the finger at Chang, saying that it is Chang himself
who should step down to bear responsibility for all the political and
social upheaval that Taiwan is facing.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers said if President Chen Shui-bian does not
change the premier and the Cabinet line-up, the people's disapproval
rating of the government will change into dissatisfaction with the
president.</P>
      <P>According to the latest public opinion poll conducted by KMT
Legislator Pan Wei-kang, the government officials that the Taiwan
general public want most to be replaced are Chang, Environmental
Protection Administrator Lin Chun-yi and Economic Affairs Minister
Lin Hsin-yi, in that order.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that as high as 90 percent of the poll
respondents said Chang should be replaced, while 88.5 percent said
Environmental Protection Administrator Lin should be dragged down and
77.2 percent said Economic Affairs Minister Lin should be ousted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the same poll also found that Education Minister Ovid
Tzeng enjoyed the highest approval rating among all government
officials, with a rating of 65 percent, followed by Justice Minister
Chen Ding-nan (55 percent), Chairwoman of the Council for Cultural
Affairs Chen Yu-hsiu (45 percent), Central Bank of China Governor
Perng Fai-nan (34.5 percent) and Chairman of the Atomic Energy
Council Hsia Der-yu (33.8 percent).</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC GOVERNMENT CONCERNED OVER MURDER OF TAIWAN STUDENT IN PARIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tzeng expressed
sadness Wednesday over the reported murder of Taiwanese music student
Wei Yen-fen in Paris.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said he had asked the Education Ministry's Bureau of
International Cultural and Education Relations and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs first thing in the morning to provide immediate help
to Wei's family.</P>
      <P>It was learned that Wei's two sisters left Taipei late Tuesday
for Paris upon being informed of Wei's death at her Paris apartment
that morning.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Henry Chen also said Wednesday
that the Foreign Ministry is doing everything it possibly can to help
Wei's family.</P>
      <P>Wei, 27, a music student at the National Musical Normal College
of Paris, was found by Liu Xiaoyen, Wei's classmate from mainland
China and one of her best friends, lying in a pool of blood on her
bed on Monday, apparently having been stabbed to death earlier that
day.</P>
      <P>Paris police disclosed that Liu's boyfriend, a man from the
French island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea, is the prime
suspect in the murder and that they are looking for him for
questioning.</P>
      <P>According to Wei's family in Hsinchu City, northern Taiwan, who
were in almost daily contact with Wei, Liu and her boyfriend
quarreled often and she went to Wei's apartment every time the couple
had a fight.</P>
      <P>Wei, a graduate of the Department of Music of Taiwan's Tunghai
University, was described as "an angel to everybody" with a good
temper and great friendliness. She began to attend the Paris musical
institute two years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILIES OF CREW OF MISSING GRAVEL SHIP APPEAL FOR GOVERNMENT HELP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One year after the disappearance of a local
gravel ship off the coast of Taiwan, the families of the crew
appealed for government help Wednesday to resolve the mystery
concerning the fate of their beloved.</P>
      <P>The grieving and fatigued families of the 21 crewmen of the
6,000-ton Hualien No. 1, which went missing Feb. 28, 2000 on its way
from the eastern Taiwan port of Hualien to Tamsui in northern Taiwan,
made the public appeal at a press conference held at the Legislative
Yuan in the company of opposition People First Party Legislator Diane
Lee.</P>
      <P>Fan Li-ping, wife of the captain of the missing ship, said the
"21" is not just a figure, but represents 21 lives.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that all relevant government agencies can drop
their parochial mentality and join forces to make an effective search
for the freighter and its crew," said a tearful Fan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ship, carrying a cargo of gravel, was equipped
with four sets of emergency relief and distress call facilities, Fan
said she simply could not understand why none of those devices had
sent out any signals.</P>
      <P>"As all the devices had undergone a full inspection before the
ship started its voyage exactly a year ago, relevant government
authorities should probe whether any Hualien port inspection officers
should be held responsible for the incident," Fan said.</P>
      <P>Lee said naval authorities once told her that the Republic of
China Navy's radar system could not detect the whereabouts of the
Hualien No. 1 because there were many ships in the area at the time
the ship disappeared.</P>
      <P>"But is it true that we really have no way of knowing whether a
6,000-ton ship like the Hualien No. 1 was either sunk or taken by
pirates?" Lee asked, adding that the "enigma" has kept the families
of the crew hanging in the air over the past year.</P>
      <P>"The families can only wait, as they have been unwilling to hold
any funeral rituals for their loved ones," she noted, adding that so
long as the ship's whereabouts cannot be determined, their families
can never find "peace of mind" nor can they stop their search for
their menfolk.</P>
      <P>Lee further urged the government and all local shipowners to work
together to provide safe working conditions for sailors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the families of the Hualien No. 1 crew pushed relevant
government agencies to join forces with the Legislative Yuan and
insurance companies to amend the existing regulations to offer better
protection for seamen and their families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH SINOLOGIST RECEIVES ROC-FRANCE CULTURAL AWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Feb.  28 (CNA)
(By M.J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>French Sinologist Andre Levy received this
year's ROC-France Cultural Award Tuesday in a ceremony held at the
prestigious Institute de France.</P>
      <P>Tchen Yu-chiou, chairwoman of the Republic of China's Council of
Cultural Affairs, presented a citation and a check for 250,000 francs
(about US$33,000) to Levy amid cheers and applause from his family,
friends and Institute de France academicians.</P>
      <P>Tchen said Levy is more than qualified for the award as he has
contributed much to the promotion of exchanges between European and
Chinese cultures.</P>
      <P>Noting that Levy has dedicated himself to the study of classic
Chinese literature, Tchen said he has not only translated many
ancient Chinese literary works into French but has also spared no
efforts to introduce contemporary Taiwan literary masterpieces to
European readers.</P>
      <P>Levy, who was born in the French settlement in Tianjin, China in
1925 and moved to France in 1937, is versed in Chinese, Indian and
Sanskrit languages.</P>
      <P>Of the 20-plus Chinese literary works he has translated, Levy
said he is most satisfied with his version of "Journey to the West"
and "Chin Ping Mei," both of which have been included in the
collection of epic translations compiled by the authoritative French
publishing house "Pleiade."</P>
      <P>Levy's translations of Chinese classics also include "Liao Tsai
Chih Yi," a collection of ghost fiction authored by Pu Sung-ling in
the Ching Dynasty, and "Peony Pavilion," penned by Tang Hsien-tsu in
the Ming Dynasty.</P>
      <P>Levy, who has taught at Paris University, said his love for
classic Chinese literature has its roots in his personal life
experience. "I hope to convey this asset of mine to a new generation
of French and European readers," he said in his acceptance speech.</P>
      <P>The ROC-France Cultural Award, founded in 1996 by the ROC's
Council of Cultural Affairs, is bestowed every year to encourage
academic research or activities that promote exchanges between French
and Chinese cultures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2001 Beijing-Taiwan Portable Computer
Technology Development Seminar took place in Beijing Wednesday with
the aim of promoting technical cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation in the
computer industry.</P>
      <P>More than 40 CEOs of computer companies from the two sides of
Taiwan Strait attended the annual seminar that was opened by Beijing
Mayor Liu Qijin, indicating that Beijing considered the event to be
of some importance. Liu said he hoped that manufacturers, scholars
and entrepreneurs on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will participate
in portable computer technology and information industry construction
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>A senior official of the Beijing City Urban Planning Committee
said that the seminar was held to promote exchange and build an
application market so as to attract Taiwan computer manufacturers to
produce notebook computers and related equipment in Beijing.</P>
      <P>In mainland China, portable computer technology chiefly refers to
notebooks and personal digital assistants (PDAs).</P>
      <P>Miao Feng-chien, president of Mitac Inc., said that the time is
ripe for cooperation between the computer industry on either side of
the Taiwan Strait, noting that the seminar attracted more than 20
computer makers from Taiwan. He added that participants from both
sides of the strait have already tentatively reached consensus for
cooperation on notebook computers and liquid crystal display
technology.</P>
      <P>According to statistics, a total of 419,000 notebooks were
sold in the mainland in 2000, representing a 40 percent increase
over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-made notebooks accounted for 60 percent of the global
production and the domestic industry has also eagerly expanded its
market in the mainland, the statistics show.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL PROMOTES 1ST ABORIGINAL PILOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) recently promoted Chu
Chun-shen to serve as a pilot, making him the first aboriginal pilot
to fly a Boeing-747 in Taiwan, according to Wednesday news reports.</P>
      <P>Chu, 49, whose mother is chief of the Paiwan tribe in Pingtung,
southern Taiwan, said that ever since his childhood, he had wanted to
fly.</P>
      <P>Although he wanted to enter the air force, his father, who saw
many Japanese military planes shot down by the United States during
World War II, was against the idea and persuaded him to join the army
instead.</P>
      <P>However, he was given the opportunity to fly helicopters while
serving in an army aviation unit and after his discharge in 1978, he
transferred to civil airlines to fly helicopters.</P>
      <P>A decade later, he was recruited by China Airlines to serve as a
co-pilot on 747s on probation and only passed the tests necessary to
allow him to be promoted to pilot last month.</P>
      <P>Chu said that he informed his 80-year-old mother of the good news
and noted that she was baffled about the difference between co-pilot
and pilot, asking quizzically: "Haven't you been flying a plane for
about 20 years?"</P>
      <P>Chu said that it is a major achievement to serve as a pilot for
one of the country's major airlines and added that he plans to throw
a party for his tribespeople the next time he returns to his hometown
so that they can share his joy and happiness.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that more aboriginal people can enter
the aviation industry.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. also has aboriginal pilots and CAL
is reportedly training aboriginal women to become pilots. Eva Airways
has recruited aboriginal cabin crew since last year.</P>

(By Chang Hui-yen and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to
the United States Chen Chien-jen said here Tuesday that although the
U.S. government has always treated Taiwan well, Taipei and Washington
relations still have room for improvement.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that the Bush administration will treat the
head of state of the Republic of China with state honors when he
makes stopover visits in the United States and will assist Taiwan's
admission into international organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a keynote speech on U.S.-ROC relations
at the Foreign Relations Association in Dallas.</P>
      <P>More than 50 U.S. political and business leaders attended the
closed-door gathering in which Chen gave a briefing on Taiwan's
current situation, U.S.-ROC relations and cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Clinton administration was "very friendly"
toward Taiwan over the past eight years and expressed hope that the
Bush administration will further improve U.S.-ROC ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC is not a "trouble maker" and noted that
ROC President Chen Shui-bian made a stopover in Los Angeles on his
way to Central and South American countries last year but was
prohibited from meeting U.S. friends.</P>
      <P>Asked how the ROC government plans to improve the trade surplus
with the United States, Chen said Taiwan is America's fifth-biggest
trade deficit-holder and added that the ROC government has done its
best to narrow this trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>He also visited Texas Instrument Corp., where he thanked the
company for its donation of US$350,000 in relief aid after the killer
earthquake which jolted central Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999. Chen also said
that Texas Instruments' Taiwan factory, which has 2,800 local
employees, has greatly contributed to Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen also gave an exclusive interview to the Dallas Morning News,
the largest newspaper in the area, before returning to Washington
after his 24-hour whirlwind visit.</P>
