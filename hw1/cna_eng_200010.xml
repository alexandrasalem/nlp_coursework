    <HEADLINE>ROC VICE PRESIDENT VISITS MAYAN CULTURAL SITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Guatemala  City,  Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu and Anita Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu visited a Mayan archaeological site in the northern
tropical rain forests of Guatemala Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu visited the famous Tikal archaeological site accompanied by
the wife and daughter of Guatemalan Vice President Juan Francisco
Royes Lopez.</P>
      <P>Lu climbed to the top of the steep second shrine in one stretch,
and said that she was impressed by the grandeur of Mayan culture. She
also said that she wishes to introduce Mayan culture to Taiwan people
so that they will be able to appreciate its greatness.</P>
      <P>Lu later attended a luncheon hosted by Guatemalan Vice Foreign
Minister in her honor near Tikal, during which she spoke of her
"journey of soft diplomacy" -- her ongoing four-state trip which also
included El Salvador, Honduras and Belize.</P>
      <P>Lu said that during her meetings with the leaders of the four
states, she got a deeper understanding of their style and charisma.
She noted that the president and vice president of El Salvador are
both scholars-turn-politicians, and added that they have high
expectations of economic development and the future of their country.</P>
      <P>They are also young -- between 40 and 50 years of age -- and
some emerged as national leaders from opposition parties, she said. Lu
added that such experience and backgrounds make her and all those who
have long fought for democracy and human rights in Taiwan feel close
to them.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that she couldn't see much during her whirlwind visit of
the four countries. But she added that the aim of the trip was to
cement diplomatic relations and to share the experience of Taiwan's
democracy, human rights, technology and love with the allies, as well
as to increase substantial cooperation with them.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the warm hospitality she received during the trip
was beyond her imagination, which showed the importance these
countries attached to her visit. She added that she was deeply
touched.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that she had taken US$40,000 with her on the trip,
and presented US$10,000 each to charity groups in each nation that
she visited, in order to let people there feel Taiwan's love and
caring.</P>
      <P>After her return to Taiwan, she will also launch a drive to
promote adopting underprivileged children in the four nations, with
Taiwan communities donating money to the children by supporting them.
She said that this would enable Taiwan people to have more exchanges
with the people in those countries.</P>
      <P>Lu stressed that her visit was planned as a complement of
President Chen Shui-bian's recent tour, so she visited the four
allies in Central America that Chen did not go to in August. She
stressed that she is visiting the countries on behalf of the ROC, and
not in her own personal capacity.</P>
      <P>Lu will conclude her "journey of soft diplomacy" in Central
America after a joint press conference in Guatemala and a dinner
hosted by local overseas Chinese Sunday. She is scheduled to return
to Taipei via San Francisco Wednesday morning.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUKE PLANT RECOMMENDATION DRAWS MIXED COMMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi reiterated
Sunday that he will respect Premier Tang Fei's final decision at the
end of the month on the fate of the controversial fourth nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>However, Lin added in a television interview that he is more
concerned about the nuclear waste being produced by Taiwan's three
existing nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>With the addition of a fourth plant, which is approximately 30
percent complete, Taiwan will have to dispose of a total of 920,000
barrels of low-radiation waste material, as well as over 7,000
kilograms of high-radiation waste, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin, who had presented a recommendation Saturday to Tang to halt
the nuclear plant project completely, said that allowing private
companies to build alternative sources of power in its place will
only cost NT$75 billion (US$2.4 billion), while the completion of the
nuclear plant will cost another NT$120 billion (US$3.8 billion) on
top of the NT$90 billion (US$2.9 billion) already spent on its
construction.</P>
      <P>Taking the different costs and environmental concerns into
account, Lin advocated scrapping the nuclear plant in favor of other
energy sources that do not generate nuclear waste material.</P>
      <P>However, former Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang of the
opposition Kuomintang disagreed with Lin's proposal. He said that the
construction of natural gas power plants will present more risks,
such as having to use pipelines to send natural gas from southern
Taiwan to the plants, which would be located in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that the issue of carbon dioxide emissions from the
plants cannot be ignored, either. Therefore, he concluded that Lin's
alternative energy proposal is "not very feasible."</P>
      <P>Wang, who had promoted the fourth nuclear plant project during
his tenure as economics minister, went on to say that the new nuclear
plant will be able to generate approximately 2.7 megawatts of energy
a year.</P>
      <P>He noted that it would take 100 ships to deliver the amount of
coal needed to generate the same amount of power if alternative plans
call for using fossil fuels, while the island would need just one
airplane to break through any possible blockade of Taiwan to deliver
the necessary fuel for a nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>Wang also pointed to the safety of the nuclear plant and the
"direct blow" that scrapping it will deal to industrial firms that
want to stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who is a member of the KMT's Central
Standing Committee, also voiced his support for the continued
construction of the plant.</P>
      <P>Ma said that despite differences in opinion within the Cabinet --
with the premier taking on the KMT's pro-nuclear stance and the
economics minister recommending an anti-nuclear energy policy as the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party's principles dictate -- the final
decision is ultimately up to the premier, under the rules of Taiwan's
government system.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that abandoning the nuclear plant project will
have adverse effects not only on the downward-spiraling domestic
stock market but also on the nation's credibility in the world.</P>
      <P>However, Lai Shih-pao, convener of the opposition New Party's
legislative caucus, said that the impact of halting the plant's
construction on the economy and the stock market will only be
short-lived. He urged Tang to make a decision on the issue as soon as
possible instead of waiting until the end of the month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN TO INTERVIEW NSB OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A member of the Control Yuan special task
force in charge of investigating a former National Security Bureau
chief cashier's suspected involvement in embezzlement said that his
team will interview several NSB officials during the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shih-chi said that the Control Yuan -- the nation's highest
supervisory body -- has already compiled financial records on Col.
Liu Kuan-chun and other related NSB personnel.</P>
      <P>Kuo went on to say that his team is in the process of collecting
and verifying more evidence through interviews with NSB chief
accountant Chao Chun-kuo, former NSB chief accountant Hsu
Ping-chiang, and NSB cashiers.</P>
      <P>He added that he will also ask NSB Director Ting Yu-chou to
explain related case material to the Control Yuan in the future.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that his task force is also looking into whether other
NSB officials have helped cover up the alleged NT$90 million (US$2.9
million) embezzlement and whether Liu's disappearance may lead to a
breach in national security due to the amount of sensitive
information he may have come across in the past.</P>
      <P>Kuo added that although Liu has never received intelligence
personnel training, he nonetheless handled classified items while he
was the NSB's chief cashier from 1998 to May 2000.</P>
      <P>Two other members of Kuo's team said that they will double up
with another Control Yuan task force that is investigating the case
of former NSB Personnel Director Pan Hsi-hsien, who had traveled to
mainland China immediately after his retirement earlier this year, a
violation of NSB regulations. Pan is currently being detained by
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Liu had sought for and was granted a two-month leave starting
July 16. He has since failed to answer subpoenas requesting him to
explain suspicious transactions under his bank accounts, maintaining
that the money belongs to his family and relatives.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 15, he applied to extend his leave until the end of
September. The special task force in charge of investigating his case
has found no record of Liu leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have issued a warrant for Liu and banned him from
leaving the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World Summit on Arts &amp; Culture to be held in Ottawa</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Canadian Council for the Arts is
planning to host a World Summit on Arts and Culture, with some two
thousand representatives of arts councils and funding bodies from
more than 50 countries meeting in Ottawa this coming December.</P>
      <P>Jean-Louis Roux, chair of the council, said the organization
can't stand still in the face of globalization. "We can no longer
afford to look at the arts in a purely national context. The wide
world is on our doorstep and we are part of it."</P>
      <P>The desire to build international alliances by arts groups has
been driven by political issues, including fear of liberalized trade
agreements and globalization.</P>
      <P>But it goes further than that, according to Shirley Thomson,
director of the council, who said that the market for art is no
longer limited to Canada. "We can no longer ignore the fact that we
are part of that international market, and it seems to me building a
link of federations with other arts councils is one way of
solidifying that infrastructure."</P>
      <P>The new network is likely to be based in Australia and will meet
every two years. The groundwork will be laid at the world summit in
December.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST PEOPLE BACK CONSTRUCTION OF 4TH NUKE POWER PLANT: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of respondents to a recent
poll said they support the construction of Taiwan's controversial
fourth nuclear power plant, according to the results of a survey
published Sunday by the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,100 people was conducted by a private consulting
company from Sept. 22-24 on the commission of the KMT. Its results
show that 59.2 percent of those polled said they back the continued
construction of the fourth nuclear plant, while 29 percent of them
disagree.</P>
      <P>The fourth nuclear power plant was initiated by the KMT while it
held the reins of administrative power. After the Democratic
Progressive Party came to power in May, the new administration began
to mull whether or not to continue with construction of the nuclear
power plant.</P>
      <P>The poll also shows that 63.8 percent of the respondents said
they agree that a referendum on the issue should be held, while 33.9
percent expressed disapproval of such a general vote.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 62.3 percent of the respondents said they also support
the idea of the government conducting referenda to decide other
crucial national policies, while 34.3 percent of the surveyed said
they did not back the idea.</P>
      <P>The results of the poll show that 63.5 percent of the respondents
thought the government is not well-prepared for any possible oil
crisis. Less than 10 percent of the respondents expressed approval of
government preparations, according to the survey's results.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL STORM COULD ERUPT IF PREMIER TANG FEI STEPS DOWN</HEADLINE>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A political storm could result if Premier
Tang Fei steps down from office, a local political commentator said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, secretary general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, has repeatedly opened fire on Premier Tang Fei,
causing internal DPP factional strife, he told the media, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that members of the current administration under
the joint control of President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Tang Fei
face challenges from both the Legislative Yuan and the ruling DPP
itself.</P>
      <P>After the March presidential election, the Legislative Yuan, the
nation's highest law-making body was still under the control of the
opposition Kuomintang. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan can block
Executive Yuan decisions.</P>
      <P>Few DPP members were chosen to take Cabinet posts. At present,
only Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, Minister of Justice Chen
Ding-nan, Minister of Transport and Communications Yeh Chu-nan, Vice
Education Minister Fan Hsun-lu and the newly appointed deputy
representative of the Republic of China in the Unites States are DPP
members.</P>
      <P>As a result, Tang can not easily implement the new government's
policies, not to mention the DPP's policies, the expert said.</P>
      <P>DPP factional strife has also been a key factor in making the new
government inefficient in regards to policy implementation.</P>
      <P>The DPP caucus in the Legislative Yuan has been dominated by
three main internal factions -- the New Tide, Mainstream and New

    <HEADLINE>LEE KUAN YEW 'LESS PESSIMISTIC' ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT TIES AFTER VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.1  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said he was "less pessimistic" about cross-strait ties than he had
been before his recent visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The respected statesman, who visited Taiwan Sept. 23-26, made the
comments in an interview with the Straits Times and its sister
Chinese-language publication, Lianhe Zaobao.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that President Chen Shui-bian has been told by the
United States, Taiwan's principle backer, that "independence is out,
and he knows it is not practical."</P>
      <P>Lee also spoke about meeting with the leaders of the two major
opposition parties, Chairman Lien Chan and Vice Chairman Vincent Siew
of the Kuomintang, as well as Chairman James Soong of the People
First Party. He said that the leaders had indicated that they support
the resumption of cross-strait talks on the basis of the 1992
consensus.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that President Chen in his inaugural speech did not
reject the 1992 consensus, in which each side is allowed its own
interpretation of "one China."</P>
      <P>However, the president subsequently refereed to it as the 1992
"spirit," not "consensus." This was because of opposition from
pro-independence fundamentalists in Taiwan, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also said that Chen spelled out his policy in detail in his
inaugural speech, which sketched a well-balanced position that had
helped defuse tensions. Since then, however, he has elaborated and
modified his position, including his recent statement that
reunification is not the only option.</P>
      <P>In Lee's observation, Chen's policy is "still in the process of
formulation and has not finally crystallized. He seems to be sounding
out reactions in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee said that in the end, "President Chen will have to make up
his mind about whether he represents pro-independence fundamentalists
or the majority of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He also said that Chen's adviser Lee Yuan-tseh told him that at
least 70 percent of people in Taiwan do not want immediate
reunification, nor do they want independence for Taiwan. Taiwan
people want the status quo, the Singaporean senior statesman said.</P>
      <P>He added that he had told Lee Yuan-tseh, a Nobel laureate, that
maintaining the status quo is only possible if the island does not
drift further away from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The respected academic and Nobel laureate understands that, and
believes the status quo can be maintained under the umbrella of a
"one China" in terms of history, tradition, and blood ties -- but not
yet politically, Lee Kuan Yew said.</P>
      <P>The senior minister also said the stalemate between mainland
China and Taiwan should not drag on. "It must be broken, the sooner
the better," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that should the cross-strait logjam drag on into next
year, the next U.S. president should encourage Taiwan and Beijing to
talk by going back to the 1992 consensus on "one China," with each
sides stating its view of the meaning of that concept.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO CONVENE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SEMINAR SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
will soon convene a seminar on the nation's financial and economic
issues at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Presidential Office said President Chen has
expressed great concern about the current financial and economic
situation in Taiwan, especially with the domestic stock market having
slumped badly recently.</P>
      <P>The officials added that Prime Minister Tang Fei, related
ministers and representatives from industrial sectors will
participate in the seminar. They added that the agenda of the seminar
will also include the controversial fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Chen last week met with Wang Yung-ching, chairman of Formosa
Plastics Group, and Douglas Hsu, head of Far Eastern Group, the
country's two industrial heavyweights, to exchange views on the
current economic situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of industrial heavyweights and trade and
economic intellectuals on Sunday urged the government to implement
measures to prop up the local stock market, which dropped heavily
last week.</P>
      <P>Tseng Fan-cheng, director general of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., said that Taiwan's industrial fundamentals are
sound, and the drastic stock market collapse was caused by a lack of
confidence in the government among domestic and foreign investors.</P>
      <P>Kuan Chun-jung, professor of agricultural economy at National
Taiwan University, said it is contradictory that the Chen
Administration prefers not to construct the fourth nuclear plant on
the one hand, but plans to stimulate Taiwan's traditional industries
on the other hand. Halting construction of the fourth nuclear power
plant will have the greatest impact on these same industries, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lei Li-fen, also a National Taiwan University professor,
indicated that the heavy domestic stock market slump has not just
affected investors, but has also reduced private consumption,
resulted in a decrease in the nation's gross national product, and
shut down enterprises -- thereby exacerbating the unemployment
problem.</P>
      <P>She urged the government to use the national stabilization fund
to help the stock market in order to prevent a macroeconomic
collapse.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's attempt to gain a niche in the
Guinness Book of Record for flying the longest kite in the sky failed
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The kite, which was measured at 1,300 meters in a morning
ceremony at the Police Academy stadium, was sent to Chuwei beach in
northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County in the afternoon to challenge the
old record of 1,035 meters.</P>
      <P>Many people were on the beach in the afternoon waiting to see the
feat. Taoyuan County Stadium and Kueishan Township, sponsors of the
activity, sent staff to check every part of the giant dragon kite
meticulously, hoping that everything would go smoothly for the world
record.</P>
      <P>At 3:15 p.m. buoyed by the winds, the kite began its slow ascent
into the sky. Spectators cheers excitedly whenever pieces of the kite
surged into the air.</P>
      <P>The winds seemed to help too. But after 10 minutes of the first
part of the kite being in the air, a section was swept toward some
nearby trees. Part of it then hit a tree branch, and the whole kite
slumped to the ground. It is estimated that only about 996 meters of
the kite actually got off the ground.</P>
      <P>The sponsors said that they were disappointed about the failure,
but added they would wait for more appropriate time and place to make
a second bid.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC V.P. BLASTS BEIJING FOR INSINCERITY, BACKWARD MENTALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Guatemala  City,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Anita Chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu criticized Beijing Sunday for its lack of sincerity and
"backward mentality" of insisting on its cherished "one China"
principle as a precondition to negotiations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said at a press conference in Guatemala City, the last stop on
her four-state Central American visit, that Taiwan's 23 million
people cannot accept Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of
mainland China.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that the "one China, two systems" model
Beijing used to incorporate Hong Kong into mainland China is not
suitable for Taiwan. Furthermore, she added that the system has
already received many complaints in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Regarding the trend that Taiwan's Central American diplomatic
allies have been increasing bilateral exchanges with mainland China
while maintaining that their relations with Taiwan are strong and
steady, Lu said that Taiwan cannot stop its allies from making other
friends.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that Taiwan should be confident and understanding
about its allies' contacts with mainland China, adding that the heads
of state of El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala all clearly
expressed during her week-long visit their continued support for the
ROC's bid to rejoin the United Nations.</P>
      <P>She said that the presidents of El Salvador and Honduras as well
as the prime minister of Belize will visit Taiwan in November and
December, while the president of Guatemala will visit Taiwan in
March.</P>
      <P>She also pledged that the new ROC government will honor the
former administration's promises of economic assistance, and she
suggested that the Central American nations can send representatives
to Taiwan to learn agricultural and food processing technology as
well as high-tech skills.</P>
      <P>After departing from Guatemala, Lu and her entourage stopped in
Acapulco, Mexico, before arriving in San Francisco for a 30-hour
stopover. She will return to Taipei Wednesday, ending her first
overseas trip since becoming vice president.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is looking to secure its western
regions through colonization and forcing ethnic minorities in both
Tibet and Xinjiang to abandon their cultures and eventually their
religions through various restrictions, reported the Australian on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Communist Chinese government is
pushing to consolidate its hold on the outer fringes of the country
by encouraging the migration of Han and Hui people to Tibet and
Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government has encouraged Hui Muslims and Han Chinese
to open businesses in these places in order to facilitate the further
integration of both Tibet and Xinjiang into the Chinese fold, the
daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily cited the town of Langmusi, which was once a
predominantly Tibetan pilgrimage center, as an example illustrating
the demographic shifts that are occurring as a result of government
polices, noting that the white skull caps of the Hui Muslims are
becoming a common sight among the brightly colored tunics of the
Tibetans.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Robbie Barnet, an analyst and scholar of Tibetan
studies at Columbia University in New York, as saying that the Hui
have laid the foundation for the Chinese traders now flooding Tibet.</P>
      <P>These developments seem to signal something that Tibetans have
dreaded for decades -- a real Chinese determination to integrate
Tibet into the Chinese economy, said Gabriel Lafitte, a Tibet policy
analyst based at Melbourne University.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao on Monday denied reports that the Solomon Islands is
considering switching its diplomatic ties away from the ROC to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the foreign minister of the Solomon Islands
visited Taiwan before Tien departed for his recent European trip and
that bilateral relations with the south Pacific nation remain stable.</P>
      <P>Tien was responding to questions about a foreign media report
that quoted Solomon Islands government sources as having said that
the new government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has been
rethinking the issue.</P>
      <P>According to the report, observers believe that the Solomon
Islands may be using the issue to obtain more financial aid from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tien said that the Solomon Islands urgently needs various kinds
of funding to help regain its political stability, but no one country
-- "certainly not Taiwan" -- can bear the entire weight of the
financial support.</P>
      <P>He added that the Solomon Islands government has already
contacted the World Bank and countries such as Australia, New
Zealand, and the United States to seek the emergency financial
assistance that it needs. As a diplomatic ally, Tien said that the
ROC will certainly provide assistance if it can.</P>
      <P>Tien concluded that Taiwan "will not and has not agreed to take

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SAYS NUKE PLANT `LESSER EVIL'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Monday that he does
not think that nuclear power is "absolutely safe" and the "only
option", but he is choosing the "lesser evil" in meeting Taiwan's
energy needs.</P>
      <P>Tang, who has said he personally supports the completion of
construction on Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear power plant,
made the remarks while fielding questions in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Premier said that from the angle of safely, it is not logical
to scrap the much safer fourth plant, while maintaining the less safe
first and second nuclear power plants, which the Ministry of Economic
Affairs does not plan to scrap until perhaps a decade later.</P>
      <P>He added that he is not saying that the fourth plant will have
no "problems," but one has to choose the "lesser evil" in sorting
out the thorny problem of meeting Taiwan's energy needs.</P>
      <P>Tang said the controversial project will involve many questions
and challenges related to politics, society, and the economy.</P>
      <P>He noted that the factors to be taken into consideration include
nuclear safety, nuclear waste disposal, future sources of energy,
air, water and nuclear pollution, and also the question of whether
the alternative proposals can make up for the scrapping of the fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>He also added that consideration will be given to the issues of
Taiwan's international credibility, the implementation of government
authority, the project's budget which had already been approved in
the Legislative Yuan in 1996, whether there will be enough time to
hold a referendum, and the impact on Taiwan's overall economic
development.</P>
      <P>The Premier earlier told members of the Economic Committee in the
Legislative Yuan that the Executive Yuan will not rule out an
announcement of its decision within one or two weeks on whether to
continue construction on the plant in Kungliao, Taipei County, which
is now 30 percent complete.</P>
      <P>Tang said that the Executive Yuan had originally planned to
announce its decision by the end of the month, but considering the
fact that it could have a great impact on Taiwan's overall economic
development, it has decided to make an announcement earlier.</P>
      <P>In related developments, Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi
said that because of regional imbalances, only the northern part of
Taiwan does not have enough electricity to meet its needs.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, although
located in the northern part of Taiwan, will rely on central Taiwan
for its power supply and will not be affected by limited supplies in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin asked how can an industrial park attract foreign investors if
there is not enough electricity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Tze-nan, the acting secretary-general to
President Chen Shui-bian, responding to reports that Premier Tang
could step down because of his support for the continued construction
of the fourth nuclear plant, said that although the president and the
premier do not see eye to eye on the project, the Executive Yuan will
have the final say on the fate of the plant.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the premier, in the eyes of the president, is the
"most ideal person" for the premiership and that both will have the
"same stance" on the project in the end, adding that reports
speculating on Tang's imminent departure from his post are "unfair"
and "impolite."</P>

    <HEADLINE>'THREE MINI LINKS' TO BE OPENED BY MID-DECEMBER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By  Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) confirmed
Monday that direct trade, postal and transport links between the
offshore outposts of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China will be
implemented after mid-December.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that the opening of the "three mini links" in a
"gradual and partial way" is aimed at promoting economic prosperity
in the offshore islands, taking care of the daily needs of their
people, cutting the underground illicit small trade now rampant
despite the ostensible bans, and promoting positive exchanges between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council in charge of the charting of the
nation's mainland policy gave a briefing on the background of its
report on the impact and assessment of "three mini links" across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It said that Kinmen and Matsu will be the priority in the
implementation of the "three mini links," and that the premise will
be "one region to one harbor" -- meaning Kinmen is to be linked to
the opposite mainland city of Xiamen, while Matsu and its opposite
city, Fuzhou, will maintain designated transport routes.</P>
      <P>After the initial transport links are on track, the MAC will
assess limited links of another offshore island -- Penghu -- with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that because of the concerns about the defense of
the offshore islands and the added burden of security checks, the
opening of links will be conducted in a "gradual way." It added that
the scale and the volume of transport links and exchanges of
personnel and cargoes across the Taiwan Strait will also be subject
to reasonable regulation.</P>
      <P>As for using Kinmen and Matsu as "mid-point" or berthing places,
the MAC said that such an arrangement would be out of the question,
considering Taiwan's current mainland policy, national security and
long-term economic benefit.</P>
      <P>The government will only give special consideration to requested
connections on a case-by-case basis, such as religious pilgrimages,
the report also said.</P>
      <P>On linking water and electricity supplies between the offshore
islands of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China, the MAC said that as

    <HEADLINE>ROC-DOMINICA RELATIONS TO REMAIN STABLE AFTER P.M.'S DEATH: TIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said Monday that Taiwan deeply regrets the death of Dominica
Prime Minister Roosevelt Douglas, but that bilateral relations
between the two nations will be unaffected by his passing.</P>
      <P>Douglas, who took a friendly attitude toward Taiwan during his
eight-month stint as prime minister, died at his home unexpectedly
Sunday. Asked if his death will lead to adverse changes in
ROC-Dominica relations, Tien predicted that Dominican internal
politics should remain much the same for the next five years, because
Douglas' governing coalition between the Dominica Labor Party and the
Dominica Freedom Party still retains a majority in the parliament.</P>
      <P>Douglas, who served concurrently as Dominica's foreign minister,
last visited Taiwan in early August to attend the fourth annual
meeting between the foreign ministers of the ROC and its four
Caribbean allies.</P>
      <P>Douglas had said during his stay in Taiwan that the voices of the
23 million people in Taiwan needed to be heard by international
society, and that Dominica's determination to support the ROC's bid
to join various international organizations would not be swayed.</P>

(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's entry into the World Trade
Organization is likely to be delayed until next year, perhaps around
Easter, the Hong Kong Mail reported today.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the prediction comes as new snags have
emerged in Beijing's negotiations with 100 other nations on the terms
of its accession to the global trade group, forcing a near-breakdown
of the latest talks in Geneva, after three weeks of intensive
efforts.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the stalemate, the United States has contacted
Beijing for a new round of talks to solve the seemingly intractable
issues, the White House confirmed.</P>
      <P>Reports quoted a White House spokesman as saying that U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky "has contacted the mainland
Chinese government, but no date has been set for a trip."</P>
      <P>The U.S. trade representative "still feels it can be done by year
end, but the time is getting short," the spokesman conceded.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong Airport Authority Chairman Fung Kwok-king was less
optimistic. With negotiations involving more than 100 parties, "you
would expect that there would be some bumps along the road," it
quoted Fung as saying in Washington.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's first port
exclusively for industrial use will be inaugurated by the end of this
year. The port is located in Mailiao, Yunlin, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mailiao Harbor in southern Taiwan's Yunlin County has an area of
476 hectares, and is similar in size to Taichung Harbor, in central
Taiwan. It will be the deepest of Taiwan's ports, and will be
navigable to ships of up to 260,000 tons, according to the port
administration.</P>
      <P>The volume of goods that can be handled at the port will reach 60
million metric tons annually in the initial stage, after its official
inauguration at the end of this year. That figure is greater than the
volume capacities of Taichung and Keelung Harbors put together.</P>
      <P>The volume of goods handled at Kaohsiung Harbor, the largest port
in Taiwan, is 100 million metric tons. The Mailiao Harbor
administration officials noted that their facility has tremendous

      <P>It is hoped that this government-owned and private

(By Elisa Kao)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA): U.S. firm Lam Research Co. has announced
that it will invest NT$2 billion (about US$645.1 million) to set up a
research and development center and production facility in Tainan
Science based Industrial Park in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A ground-breaking ceremony was held on Monday, and was witnessed
by officials including Lin Hsin-yi, ROC economics minister, Steven
Dunn, director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Kaohsiung
Office, and Merrit Cook, chief of the Economic Division at AIT's
Taipei office.</P>
      <P>Lam Research first entered into a strategic alliance with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs in 1995. The firm then set up its Taiwan
branch at Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in 1994. The company
is a supplier of products needed by semiconductor makers in Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>The new R&amp;D center in Tainan will be the second such facility
that Lam has set up outside of the United States, with the first one
in Japan. Taiwan will give the firm excellent access to mainland
China as well as Southeast Asian countries, a source with the company
said.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsin-yi said that Lam Research's increased investment in
Taiwan meant that foreign investors still have confidence in Taiwan's
economic climate and conditions.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, a total of 937 foreign investment
applications totaling US$5 billion were approved during the
January-August period, an increase of US$2.82 billion, or 109.9
percent, over the previous year's level.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Monday that he is not
ruling out a possible tax hike to cover the imbalance between
government revenues and expenditures.</P>
      <P>Tang made this clear while answering questions raised by
Legislators Lee Chuan-chiao and Chiu Ching-tsun at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session.</P>
      <P>Opposition lawmakers asked Tang how the national budget will be
balanced if the government fails to implement previously decided
construction work while trying to maintain the projected 6.6-percent
annual economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>Lee also asked Tang to make his final decision on finishing or
scrapping construction of the controversial fourth nuclear power
plant as soon as possible. On Saturday, Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi suggested to Tang that he discontinue work on the facility,
thus sparking further debate.</P>
      <P>Chiu pointed out that Tang told the legislature that the nation's
economic growth rate will reach the government's projected figure of
6.6 percent for 2001, but the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development had thereafter immediately lowered its
growth estimate. The KMT legislator said that this is an indication
that the coordination between members of the Cabinet is poor.</P>
      <P>Tang replied that it will be impossible to balance revenues and
expenditures if government income is reduced while expenditures are
increased. Raising taxes is one method of balancing the deficit that
the government will consider, Tang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chuan, director general of the Directorate General
of Accounting, Budget and Statistics, said in a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session that the government will be forced to hike
health insurance premiums if the deficit continues to worsen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan inaugurated a new committee on
non-governmental organizations under its Ministry of Foreign Affairs
Monday as part of the island's efforts to enhance non-official
exchanges with the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the ceremonial launching of the Non-Governmental
Organization Committee, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao said
that NGOs, which number more than 24,000 and account for 8 percent of
the world's 300,000 international organizations, will play an
increasingly important role amid the ongoing trend of globalization.</P>
      <P>He said that the NGOs have exercised far-reaching influence on
many important international issues, as some 1,000 such groups are
recognized by the United Nations as its consultative partners.</P>
      <P>Turing to domestic NGOs, Tien said that many have won high praise
from the international community for their contributions to
international disaster relief and other humanitarian services, which
Tien cited as examples of President Chen Shui-bian's idea of "Taiwan
standing up and reaching out."</P>
      <P>Tien said that his ministry is trying to establish a "partner
relationship" with local NGOs while respecting their independence and
operations as well as sharing with them its experience in
international affairs, so as to enable Taiwan to make a greater
contribution to the world.</P>
      <P>The NGOC, which will offer "one stop" services to local NGOs to
help nurture their ability to take part in international affairs,
will for the foreseeable future run as a task force of the Foreign
Ministry, a ministry official said. He added that it will be
incorporated into an official department once the ministry's
organization regulations have been revised.</P>
      <P>With Vice Foreign Minister Wu Tzu-dan serving as its concurrent
chairman, the NGOC will consist of three divisions responsible for
communications, education and evaluation, and international
cooperation and development.</P>
      <P>Members of the NGOC, which will number between 10 and 15, will be

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT CONCERNED ABOUT IMPACT OF 4TH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As part of the government's efforts to avert
a possible chain reaction stirred up by a proposal to halt the
building of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, Economics Minister
Lin Hsin-yi has launched a tour of large firms to help bolster local
business investment confidence.</P>
      <P>Although the proposal submitted over the weekend by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs to the Executive Yuan represents only the point
of view of the MOEA, it caused the local stock market to continue to
plummet Monday and many firms voiced grave concern over the country's
sluggish economic prospects.</P>
      <P>At the same time, relevant government agencies are seriously
concerned about subsequent developments, as any halt to the ongoing
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant is expected to greatly
shake the investment willingness of the local business community,
dealing a heavy blow to the already deteriorating local economy.</P>
      <P>In a bid to prevent local enterprises from moving out amid such
bearish sentiments, the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, Taiwan's highest-level government economic planning
authority, has instructed its subordinate agencies to extend
assistance to large-scale domestic investment projects launched by
local businesses.</P>
      <P>Lin himself was first to kick off the confidence-building
measure, taking part in a ground-breaking ceremony for the
construction of a research and development center funded by the
U.S.-based Lam Research Co. in the Tainan Science-based Industrial
Park in southern Taiwan. He is scheduled to visit other companies
located in the park in the coming days.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the MOEA Sunday, Lin
praised the U.S. firm's decision to invest in Taiwan and stressed
that he has been seeking to improve Taiwan's water and electricity
supply since assuming his post in May.</P>
      <P>The press release also pointed out that the MOEA has worked out a
comprehensive package of alternative options should construction of
the controversial nuclear power plant really come to a halt. It said
that "the measures will undoubtedly meet Taiwan's long-term demand
for electricity," and asked both local and foreign companies to erase
any worries in this regard.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA statistics, foreign and overseas Chinese
investment in Taiwan totaled US$5.023 billion in the first eight
months of this year. The figure represents an increase of 109.9
percent over the level posted during same period of a year ago, but
government officials have showed grave concern, as the majority of
the investment money has gone to the finance sector.</P>
      <P>A recent MOEA-commissioned poll also found that unclear
government economic policy, as well as insufficient water and power
supplies and labor protests, are usually the leading factors in the
eroding business investment confidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`MINI  DIRECT  LINKS' WITH MAINLAND CHINA TO  OPEN IN DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct shipping and trade links between two
of Taiwan's frontline islands and mainland China will begin in
mid-December, according to an announcement Monday from the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>In a background briefing, the MAC said the measures are aimed at
bolstering the prosperity of the islands of Kinmen and Matsu.
However, the briefing said that an abrupt opening of trade links
would endanger the security of the two islands, given Beijing's
refusal to renounce the threat of force against Taiwan, which would
in turn compromise Taiwan's safety.</P>
      <P>In order to balance the needs of prosperity against the security
risk, the MAC said it has been decided to ease the ban on direct
shipping and trade between the two islands and the mainland
gradually, adding that the move will be limited to specific harbors.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the links will start between Kinmen and the
mainland port of Xiamen, and between Matsu and the mainland port of
Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>Initially, there will also be strict limits on the type of goods
allowed to be imported from mainland China and the number of
passengers allowed to travel on the routes, and trade centers on the
two islands are being considered to ensure the limits are observed,
said the MAC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ships will be prohibited from taking advantage of the
direct links by sailing to mainland China via the two islands, and
Taiwan exporters will not be allowed to ship their goods to the
mainland through Kinmen or Matsu.</P>
      <P>Voyages for religious purposes, such as carrying Taiwan pilgrims
to mainland China, may be exempt from the restrictions on a
case-by-case basis, according to the MAC briefing.</P>
      <P>Once in place, the measures are expected to curtail the rampant
smuggling between the two islands and mainland China, and might be
expanded to Taiwan's offshore county of Penghu, said the MAC.</P>
      <P>Given that Kinmen and Matsu are self-sufficient in water and
electricity supplies, the MAC ruled out the possibility of importing
water and electricity from mainland China to supply the two islands.</P>
      <P>The MAC also stressed that mainland China's cooperation is vital
for the pilot program's success and added that it will take Beijing's
reactions into account and adjust the measures if necessary.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kinmen county government has worked out a proposal
to set up four sites for cross-strait trading, three of which will be
on the main Kinmen island and one on Little Kinmen Island.</P>
      <P>The proposal calls for a register to be maintained of mainland
Chinese who want to conduct small-scale trade, together with limits
on the ships they can use.</P>
      <P>Once the sites are open, trade outside of them or after their
business hours will be prohibited, according the county government.</P>
      <P>Both the new Taiwan dollar and the renminbi would be accepted as
currency, and mainland traders would be able to keep whatever
revenues they earned.</P>
      <P>The proposal is subject to the approval of the county council and
the MAC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's aid to Macedonia was given to help
the Macedonian people and consolidate bilateral ties rather than as a
means of buying friendship, Government Information Office Deputy
Director-General Frederic Chang said recently.</P>
      <P>In an interview with Macedonia's Utrindke Vensik daily newspaper,
Chang disputed the interviewer's accusation that the Republic of
China practices "checkbook diplomacy," arguing that Taipei engages
with other countries on the basis of "equality, mutualism and
respect," which he said is a far cry from buying diplomatic
recognition.</P>
      <P>He also said the ROC's treaties with Macedonia will be kept
intact, despite the recent change of government in Skopje, stressing
that Taipei will honor its commitments of aid to Skopje, no matter
who is in power.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although the Macedonian government has not yet
received the ROC ambassador's credentials, Skopje is processing the
matter according to international protocol and the time-consuming
diplomatic process will not affect the flow of aid from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that Taiwan's investment in the Balkan state has
not grown as fast as had been expected and attributed this to "the
geographic distance between the two countries." However, he held out
hope that the distance problem will be overcome through the joint
efforts of the two countries.</P>
      <P>The interview, conducted between September 17-19 when Chang
visited Skopje to open a photographic exhibition on Taiwan, was
carried in the Sept. 28 edition of the paper, a copy of which reached
Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Taipei forged diplomatic ties with Skopje in 1999, touting the
Balkan state as its springboard to Europe. Macedonia is Taiwan's only
ally in Europe other than the Vatican.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUKE PLANT CONSTRUCTION `A TEST OF POLITICAL WISDOM' SAYS ROC PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei said Tuesday that continued
construction of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant is a
test of political wisdom as well as a choice between the lesser of
two evils.</P>
      <P>Tang told legislators at an interpellation session that the
nuclear power plant issue involves far-reaching political and
economic concerns. He added that Taiwan has no other sources of
energy besides a limited hydroelectric capability, that fossil fuels
will one day be depleted, and that a reliance on natural gas to meet
future energy needs would present various difficulties in terms of
feasibility and execution.</P>
      <P>Later, at a Budget Committee interpellation, he told legislators
that the decision on whether to continue or halt construction of
Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant will be based on national
interests and not on political party preferences.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is a member of the opposition Kuomintang, added that
his personal stance after evaluating the issue is that the nuclear
plant project should continue.</P>
      <P>He pledged Monday that a final decision will be made within one
or two weeks to minimize the adverse effects that the plant's
uncertain fate has had on the local economy. However, he added
Tuesday that the decision will not be whipped out so fast that it is
made "in the blink of an eye," and that an upcoming Cabinet meeting
on Wednesday is only for the Economics Ministry to make a report on
the issue.</P>
      <P>Tang, who is scheduled to meet President Chen Shui-bian later in
the evening to discuss the issue, said that it is best to find a
solution that is acceptable to the majority because he does not wish
to see the issue lead to a huge political storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, who is also a member
of the KMT but supports halting construction on the nuclear power
plant, said in a radio interview that he did not take on his stance
simply to endorse the president's position.</P>
      <P>He added that he was not pressured by any American interest
groups during the decision-making process that led him to recommend
scrapping the plant, which uses General Electric technology.</P>
      <P>Opposition KMT legislator Chang Fu-hsing called for Lin to step
down because he said that Lin had made "unprofessional" comments by
ignoring industry and commercial support for the nuclear power plant
and instead taking on "an environmental protection administrator's
line."</P>
      <P>Lin's proposal of a natural gas power plant as an alternative to
the nuclear power plant also came under fire from opposition People
First Party legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh, who said that the
installation of natural gas pipelines would cause just as much public
resistance as the nuclear plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR SEEKS INTERPRETATION OF LAWS TO RESOLVE NUKE CONTROVERSY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party legislator Feng
Ting-kuo said Tuesday that he is passing around a petition to ask the
grand justices to interpret related laws that may help resolve the
controversy surrounding the fourth nuclear plant project.</P>
      <P>Feng's petition, for which he hopes to obtain the signatures of
at least one-third of the legislators within two days, seeks an
interpretation of Budget Law Articles 71 and 88 as well as the
legality of the various solutions that have been proposed to end the
nuclear plant impasse.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislators have insisted
that the Cabinet can stop the plant's construction simply by
withholding the allocated budget for the plant according to a
provision in the Budget Law that allows for a reduction in cases of
"special national circumstances."</P>
      <P>Backed by the director-general of budget, accounting, and
statistics, Premier Tang Fei had countered on numerous occasions that
the Cabinet has no legal basis to halt the nuclear plant project even
if it decides in favor of such a move because only the legislature
can overturn an approved budget through another vote.</P>
      <P>Tang said Tuesday that a grand justice interpretation may be too
late to save the "urgent" situation because everyone can see the
adverse impact that the controversy has already had on the local
economy. Tang pledged Monday that he will make a final decision on
the matter within one or two weeks.</P>
      <P>Feng said that stopping the plant's construction midway would
cost the public a total of NT$90 billion (US$2.9 billion) in
compensation to various interests. Added to the NT$46.7 billion
(US$1.5 billion) already spent on the project, he said that scrapping
the project would cost almost as much as completing the project,
which has an allocated budget of NT$160 billion (US$5.1 billion). He
went on to ask, "Why not finish using this budget?"</P>
      <P>He added that the new nuclear power plant -- which is already
about 30 percent complete -- would be far safer than the first and
second nuclear plants, which he noted could be retired earlier than
previously planned, thereby increasing the overall safety level.</P>

      <P>The defiant Falun Gong is becoming a real
political threat to the Communist Chinese leaders and their rule over

increasing instead of decreasing and as more of them are becoming

    <HEADLINE>TERMINATION OF NUCLEAR PLANT CONTRACTS TO IMPAIR ROC CREDIBILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Oct.   2   (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's credibility in the
international market will be impaired if it finally decides to
scrap its business contracts concerning a controversial nuclear power
plant project, a U.S. business executive said Monday.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the Clinton administration kept mum on the
controversy surrounding Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant
construction project.</P>
      <P>Both the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce
would not make any comment on the possibility of Taiwan
discontinuing construction of the controversial nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The two departments said they are not in a position to comment
on the issue because it is basically the Republic of China's domestic
affair.</P>
      <P>The office of the U.S. Trade Representative also said whether
Taiwan will uphold or shelve the project has nothing to do with
trade barrier issues and that no American firms have so far ever
pressured the USTR to help them resolve the project-related trade
deals.</P>
      <P>A senior business executive, who once worked with the U.S.
government, said it's no easy task for Taiwan to decide whether
to continue or discontinue the nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>He stressed what American business people care is not Taiwan's
political wrangling but rather its general business climate,
including the stability and continuity of its major industrial
policies and availability of electricity and energy supply.</P>
      <P>The executive, who demanded anonymity, said if Taiwan suspends
its nuclear power plant, it must compensate General Electric Co. a
large sum of money in accordance with an existing contract
between them concerning the project.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the executive said, GE is not expected to
incur a great loss from termination of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power
plant project. The real loser will be Taiwan itself as its
international credibility will be at stake and foreign investors
will become more cautious in launching any politically sensitive
investment projects on the island, he noted.</P>
      <P>The debate over the project has raged in Taiwan for 10
years. When the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) held an open
tender in 1996 to choose a supplier for nuclear reactors to be
installed in the new plant, major U.S. companies, including GE,
Westinghouse and ABB, had competed fiercely for the contract. At
last, GE won the US$1.8 billion contract.</P>
      <P>GE reportedly has completed more than half of the work
for the nuclear reactor deal with Taipower. ROC Economics Minister
Lin Hsin-yi's suggestion last weekend that the government should
replace the fourth nuclear power plant project with alternative
power supply plans. Lin's statement has caused concern in the
relevant U.S. business community.</P>
      <P>Frank C. Carlucci, chairman of the U.S.-ROC (Taiwan) Business
Council, and Rupert Hammond-Chambers, acting president of the
council, are currently on a visit in Taiwan. They are scheduled to
meet with President Chen Shui-bian and other senior ROC financial and
economic officials to exchange views on the strengthening of
U.S.-Taiwan trade and economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>They will also convey American business people's common hope that
Taiwan's investment climate will not be affected by political
factors.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei district prosecutors searched the
editorial office of a local newspaper and the residences of two of
its editors Tuesday in an apparent move to discover how the
transcript of an interrogation had been leaked to the media.</P>
      <P>Led by Senior Prosecutor Huang Chuan-lu, district prosecutors and
local staff members of the Justice Ministry's Investigation Bureau
sealed off the offices of the China Evening News and spent over an
hour going through its desks and files. At the same time, another
team searched the homes of the paper's news center director Sung
Chao-tsin and society section editor Liao Hsiao-lung.</P>
      <P>Huang did not comment on the purpose of the search or whether the
prosecutors had found what they were seeking. Sung was brought back
to the Investigation Bureau's Taipei branch office for further
questioning.</P>
      <P>Taipei District Prosecutor Office Prosecutor-General Huang
Shi-ming said that the media leak is a matter of national security
and must be thoroughly investigated. He added that he will explain
the ins and outs of the investigation after it has ended.</P>
      <P>Reportedly, investigators and prosecutors were looking into how
the China Evening News had come across the information that led Sung
to write a Sept. 30 article that included interrogation transcripts
from an ongoing investigation into the alleged embezzlement and
money-laundering case of Col. Liu Kuan-chun, a missing former chief
cashier at the National Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Association of Taiwan Journalists released a statement
protesting what they said was the prosecutors' serious infringement
on freedom of the press and basic human rights guaranteed by the
Constitution. The group added that the case signified a huge step
backwards for Taiwan's democratic reforms, as well as a huge irony in
light of the recent handover of political power to a new
administration.</P>
      <P>China Evening News editors present during the search said that
the newspaper respects the investigators, but that the media deserves
more respect in terms of both action and attitude.</P>
      <P>The newspaper later made an announcement to protest the
"improper" sealing off of its editorial department during the search,
which it said had affected its operations and infringed on its press
freedoms.</P>
      <P>The paper declared that it cannot shirk its duty to track the
ongoing investigations into Liu's alleged embezzlement case, as the
scandal involves the nation's highest intelligence agency and has
far-reaching effects on national security.</P>
      <P>It went on to state that the investigation agencies should focus
on the source of the scandal instead of the reporters who unveiled
the scandal, adding that Western nations would not rely on press
reports as evidence for their investigations, much less investigating
and interviewing the press.</P>
      <P>Citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled the New York
Times was not guilty of revealing secrets and endangering national
security for exposing a Pentagon report on the Vietnam War, the
newspaper also urged the legislature to amend current laws to strike
a balance between freedom of the press and the necessary supervision
involved in intelligence agency scandals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, responding to claims that the transcripts were leaked
out by NSB Deputy Director Han Kun, Han released a written
announcement to assert his innocence. He pointed out that he was
never involved in the interrogations because he was neither a
military prosecutor nor a Justice Ministry investigator. Therefore,
he had no access to any transcripts, he stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSPORTATION HEAD AIMS TO GIVE TAIWAN TOURISM A BOOST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister
Yeh Chu-lan said Tuesday that she plans to give a boost to Taiwan's
tourism industry.</P>
      <P>With the five-day workweek to be put into practice next year, and
Taiwan's likely entry into the World Trade Organization having an
impact on the island's economy, Yeh says that leisure activity will
become a more important part of Taiwan life, which she said will help
promote tourism.</P>
      <P>She noted that the Executive Yuan now considers tourism to be one
of the island's strategically important industries, and hopes to
transform Taiwan from an industrial island to an attractive tourism
destination.</P>
      <P>In her report to the Legislative Yuan Wednesday, Yeh is expected
to propose using tourism for diplomacy as well as making money.</P>
      <P>Under Yeh's desired target for 2003, Taiwan will welcome 3.5
million overseas tourists and 100 million domestic tourists, with
total tourism revenue accounting for 5 percent of the island's gross
domestic product.</P>
      <P>On domestic tourism, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has mapped out a development plan for Hengchun
Peninsula in Pingtung County, hoping to turn it into the "Hawaii of

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR PROPOSES NEW KIND OF CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator Tuesday proposed another kind
of link between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, saying that the
top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait should gather together
to talk about the concept of "one China."</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Cheng-tse of the Kuomintang suggested in the
Legislative Yuan that the ROC executive and legislative heads and
their mainland China counterparts hold such a meeting to help solve
cross-strait problems.</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Taiwan's stock market had nearly crashed through
the psychologically important 6,000-point threshold, which has dealt
a serious blow to investors. He added that the government should help
solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Lin said that some people say that domestic economic development
has reached a bottleneck and that Taiwan may have to give in to
mainland China and open direct trade, postal and transport links.</P>
      <P>But as cross-strait relations have been stalled over the "one
China" question, he has therefore suggested that the top leaders
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait meet each other to
communicate on the "one China" concept.</P>
      <P>Premier Tang Fei, responding to Lin's proposal, said that such a
meeting does not "hinge on us, but on mainland China."</P>
      <P>The legislator then suggested that perhaps the use of a third
party will help -- meaning that figures from Taiwan, mainland China
and the United States would all meet to talk.</P>
      <P>The premier said that of course an intervening third party would
be helpful, but he noted that there is not even a national consensus
on the question on the unification or independence of Taiwan. "How
can we talk about anything with the other side of the strait?" Tang
asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CEPD BACKS CONDITIONAL OPENING OF CASINOS ON OFFSHORE ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development called an inter-ministerial meeting Tuesday
to discuss the feasibility of allowing opening of casinos on offshore
islands on an experimental basis.</P>
      <P>CEPD Vice Chairman Chang Ching-sen, who chaired the meeting,
said the council basically supports conditional opening of casinos
on offshore islands since Taiwan has been unable to
completely eradicate gambling games.</P>
      <P>Quoting a CEPD study, Chang said Taiwan can follow measures
adopted by advanced countries in legalizing casino business. For
instance, he said, the government can hold an open tender for
hopefuls to bid for the rights to operate casinos and impose a
ceiling on the total number of casinos in each selected region.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also suggested that the Tourism Bureau of the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of the
Interior work out accompanying measures to ensure orderly opening of
casinos on an experimental basis and to minimize the possible
adverse impact of the liberalization.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD report, prepared by the council's Sectoral
Planning Department, 105 countries or regions around the world now
have legally licensed casinos. Both Taiwan and Singapore have not
legalized casino business.</P>
      <P>The report said the government can consider allowing selected
offshore islands or disaster zones hardest-hit by last year's
devastating earthquake to operate casinos on an experimental basis
to help boost economic development in those regions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report said, local governments should hold a
plebiscite first to explore the opinions of local residents
about the proposal. Without the support of the majority of local
residents, the report said, the ban on casino business should be
maintained.</P>
      <P>Chang said speakers of the county councils in less-developed
offshore and eastern Taiwan counties, including Penghu and
Taitung, suggested opening of casinos in their counties on an
experimental basis during their meeting with President Chen
Shui-bian on June 20. Cabinet Secretary-General Wea Chi-lin then
asked the CEPD to assess the feasibility of the proposal.</P>
      <P>In addition, tourist industry operators in the 921
earthquake-stricken zones have also urged the government to permit
them to operate casinos to help revive the battered tourist industry
in the regions.</P>
      <P>Officials from the CEPD, the Ministry of the Interior, the
Tourism Bureau, the National Police Administration and the Ministry
of Justice as well as scores of scholars and experts attended the
inter-ministerial meeting.</P>
      <P>While CEPD and tourist officials gave a thumbs-up to the
proposed conditional opening of casinos in selected areas, officials
from other government agencies and most scholars strongly opposed
the proposal.</P>
      <P>The opponents said casino business will only have limited
positive effects on local tourist industries, but will cause serious
social and criminal problems. No consensus was reached at the
meeting.</P>

(By Mike Chang &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has unilaterally declared a "first
island defense line" which includes waters surrounding the Tiaoyutai
Islands, Spratly Islands, Taiwan and Singapore.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese mass-circulated daily newspaper,
quoted a source from the Japanese Self-Defense Force as saying that
in order to ensure that the area's vast oceanic resources come under
its control, Beijing intends to enforce its claims by 2020.</P>
      <P>Yomiuri also quoted Kazuya Natsukawa, ex-chief of the General
Staff of Japan's military, as reporting that Beijing has insisted
that it can safeguard Asian stability with its own forces.</P>
      <P>The paper also reported that a two-week submarine rescue training
exercise initiated by the United States is currently being held in
the South China Sea about 360 kms northeast of Singapore. A total of
11 countries in the region are to take part in the joint training
course, which began Monday.</P>
      <P>Japan, Singapore, and South Korea have all dispatched submarines
or rescue vessels to take part in the training, in addition to the
United States. The drill is focused on training military personnel
how to conduct rescue operations for both nuclear-powered and
conventional submarines that run aground or suffer accidents while
operating more than 100 meters beneath the sea.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, Great Britain, Australia, Indonesia, Chile,
Canada and Russia have sent observers to the training.</P>
      <P>The exercise is being held in waters that fall within the first
island defense line unilaterally claimed by Beijing. The United
States and Singapore have invited Beijing to take part in the rescue
training, in order to avoid isolating mainland China in this region.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Deutsche Schule Taipei held a special
"knocking down the Berlin Wall" ceremony Tuesday to mark the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the 10th anniversary of German
reunification.</P>
      <P>The ceremony was co-chaired by Klaus Rupprecht, the new German
representative to the Republic of China, Sabina Hagemann-Unlusoy,
director of the German Cultural Center, and Michael Lagler,
headmaster of the German school in Taipei.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony held on the school campus in Yangmingshan,
suburban Taipei, the participants jointly knocked down a wall modeled
on the Berlin Wall to symbolize the falling of "mind walls" that
separate individuals.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Lagler said the specially built Berlin
Wall replica symbolized a wall between people and a barrier between
countries. "We hope the special knocking-down ceremony will remind
all mankind to get rid of their `mind walls' and forge friendship
with each other," he added.</P>
      <P>Hagemann-Unlusoy noted that what remains of the Berlin Wall can
now be seen only in museums. Describing the Berlin Wall as a prison
wall that prevented the people of the former communist East Germany
from fleeing to the free world, she said it is a wonderful thing that
the Berlin Wall no longer exists.</P>
      <P>Rupprecht said young Germans may have little memory of the Berlin
Wall, but added that although the Berlin Wall has already fallen,
there are still "mind walls" in the hearts of West and East Germans.
The de facto German ambassador to Taiwan encouraged all
schoolchildren to remove their "mind walls."</P>
      <P>In addition to German, French and British students on the Swire
European Campus, representatives of German companies in Taiwan and
student delegates from several local schools also attended the
special celebration activity. Many students took home "debris" of the
Berlin Wall replica as souvenirs.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Vice President
Annette Lu said Monday she was saddened by restrictions imposed by
the U.S. government on her activities during her layover in the
United States.</P>
      <P>Lu arrived in San Francisco Sunday evening for an overnight
transit stay on her way home after a four-state "journey of soft
power diplomacy" aimed at shoring up the ROC's diplomatic
relations with its allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Lu, who concurrently heads a Presidential Office
science-technology advisory committee, said she originally planned
to visit two U.S. high-tech companies in the Silicon Valley on
Monday. However, Lu said she was forced to change her schedule
after the U.S. government pressured the two firms --
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Cisco System Co.-- to reject her visits.</P>
      <P>During a dinner hosted by Tseng Ching-yuan, director of the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in San Francisco,
Lu said she is by no means a troublemaker.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS PRIORITY OF ROC GOVERNMENT: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,   Central  Taiwan,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China
President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that he will make economic
development the priority of all his policies after the political
environment improves.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a visit to Taichung County, also
home of a major industrial park and many companies including the
Wheel Giant, Inc., the manufacturer of Giant bicycles.</P>
      <P>Chen indicated that after cross-Taiwan Strait ties, diplomatic
concerns and security issues are all stable, he will give priority to
economic development. He added that he will not forget any of the
social welfare measures that he promised in his electoral campaign,
and said that they will all be implemented in the future.</P>
      <P>Chen said he feels that there are no "sunset industries," and
people cannot define absolutely what is a traditional industry and
what is a high-tech one. He urged industrial sectors to pursue
reforms in order to reap the maximum financial benefit.</P>
      <P>As an example, he cited Taichia township in Taichung County,
which used to be famous for its straw mat industry, but now makes one
of the most well-known bicycles in the world, and has also developed
sophisticated biotechnology firms.</P>
      <P>Although the bicycle industry has been called a traditional
industry, Wheel Giant, Inc. has been pursuing renovation and its
bicycles are a best seller in Taiwan, mainland China, Europe and the
United States.</P>
      <P>"That proves that if there is dream, there is hope," Chen said,
adding that as long as people have confidence and do not abandon
traditional industries, there is definitely a bright future for them.</P>
      <P>Chen also cited his personal example, saying that he has done
what was once considered impossible. He urged the public to have
faith in the country.</P>
      <P>Amid the recent chaotic financial and economic situation in
Taiwan, Chen said there are some people who still cannot accept the
results of the election held in May. Chen went on to say that he will
focus on various reforms and make economic development the priority
of his administration.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen
said Tuesday that he sees an opportunity for Taiwan and mainland
China to improve relations after an "apparent change" in Beijing's
attitude toward Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Somehow there's a way to bridge that difference if people of
goodwill and creativity take advantage of the opportunity," he said
during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a private research institute in Washington.</P>
      <P>Cohen said that he saw "a change in both the tone and the
content" of Beijing's message when he visited mainland China in July.</P>
      <P>He noted that, a year ago or less, the Beijing leadership was
talking about the possible use of military force against Taiwan and
setting a deadline for cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>During his discussions with the same leaders in July, Cohen said,
the message was that "they did not give up the right to use force but
they had no intent to use force."</P>
      <P>"I think there was quite a significant difference in both the
tone and the content of that message," Cohen said, although he
admitted that others may fail to see a change in Beijing's position.</P>
      <P>Another reason for his optimism about cross-strait relations is
his perception that the two sides are in fact not too far apart.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese leadership would say it's `one China, two systems,'"
he said. "And if you listen to the new Taiwanese president, he's said
`one China, two interpretations.'"</P>
      <P>Until both sides find a way to bridge their differences
peacefully, he said, the U.S. will maintain its position.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has a one-China policy, supports the three joint
communiques with Beijing and also supports the 1979 Taiwan Relations
Act, he went on.</P>
      <P>On relations between Washington and Beijing, Cohen said that
mainland China "wants to get back on a solid track with the United
States" after a year-long hiatus in the wake of the bombing of
Beijing's embassy in Belgrade in May 1999.</P>

between him and Chen as to whether or not construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant should continue. Tang, a member of the opposition
Kuomintang, supports the continued construction of the plant, while
Chen and the DPP are resolutely opposed.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Acting Secretary-General Chen Che-nan
confirmed Tang's resignation later in the evening, saying at a press
conference that the president accepted Tang's resignation on the
grounds that Tang indeed has health problems and has voiced his
intention to resign several times over the past several months.</P>
      <P>President Chen and the Presidential Office offered their
sincerest gratitude to Tang for his devotion to the administration
and expressed hope that he will return to the government team as soon
as he has recovered, the acting presidential secretary-general said.</P>
      <P>Tang, 68, was born in Jiangxu Province of mainland China. A
graduate of the ROC Air Force Academy, Tang sought advanced military
education at the Warfare College of the Armed Forces University.</P>
      <P>An air force pilot-turned officer, Tang has been military attache
to the ROC Embassy in South Africa, president of the ROC Air Force
Academy and director of the Political Warfare Department under the

      <P>Other prominent posts he has held before becoming premier include

    <HEADLINE>KMT CRITICIZES PROPOSAL FOR SCRAPPING FOURTH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 3 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The secretary-general of a Kuomintang think
tank criticized Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi Tuesday for "lacking
professionalism" by proposing to halt construction of the island's
fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang said that although Lin presented alternatives to the
fourth nuclear power plant while proposing to scrap the nuclear power
project, there is no guarantee that his alternatives are feasible.</P>
      <P>Lin's decision to propose a halt to the project "lacked
professionalism and conscientiousness," said Chiang, a former
economics minister and former Council for Economic Planning and
Development chairman.</P>
      <P>The controversial plant has been a political hot potato, with
Premier Tang Fei, a KMT member, supporting continued construction,
while President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party are opposed to the project.</P>
      <P>Tang told legislators that he himself was not satisfied with the
alternatives presented by Lin and resigned from the premiership
Tuesday evening, although poor health was cited as his reason for
quitting.</P>
      <P>Chiang criticized Lin for allowing "political consideration" to
influence his proposal and disregarding Taiwan's economic needs and
national security.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the fourth nuclear power plant will be "10 times as
safe" as the existing first, second and third plants, and that the
nuclear waste produced by the fourth plant will be only 25 percent of
that produced by any of the existing ones, Chiang said that if the
government wants to cease the on-going project, it should first scrap
the more hazardous ones.</P>
      <P>Regarding the alternatives submitted by Lin, Chiang said that
there is no guarantee that they can be finished in the next few
years.</P>
      <P>He added that Lin also failed to mention the air pollution
problems which arise when coal and natural gas are used as the fuel
for thermal power plants.</P>
      <P>The transportation of coal and natural gas from foreign countries
for thermal power plants are also vulnerable to a blockade by
mainland China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's position, he said, is to continue construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant, while also carrying out projects for
alternatives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The search of a major newspaper's head
office Tuesday by Taipei District Prosecutors Office sparked
criticism from local political parties.</P>
      <P>Several prosecutors and investigators led by Prosecutor Huang
Chuan-lu of the Taipei District Prosecutors Office went to the head
office of China Times Express and the houses of two of its reporters
to search for the transcript of an interrogation which had been
leaked to the media and carried in last Saturday's China Times
Express.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party legislators described the district
prosecutors office's action as "serious and gross" and urged
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Tang Fei, and Minister of Justice
Chen Ding-nan to extend their apologies to the public.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Lee Ching-an, PFP spokesperson in the
Legislative Yuan, said the PFP respects the judicial system but added
that the freedom of the press is very important and "can never be
trampled on."</P>
      <P>Legislator Shen Chih-hwei said now that Taiwan has entered the
era of freedom of speech, such tactics should not be tolerated. She
urged Tang and Minister of Justice Chen to express their apologies
and called for the Control Yuan (Taiwan's highest government watchdog
body) to investigate to see if the prosecutors' search infringed on
human rights and the freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-hua said that President Chen had lauded the
China Times a day earlier on its 50th founding anniversary for the
newspaper's contributions to the promotion of democracy in Taiwan.
However, the incident which occurred less that 24 hours later made
Taiwan's democracy "a big joke in the international arena," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-cheng, secretary-general of the opposition Kuomintang,
also expressed his party's concern over the incident, saying the KMT

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Council for Economic Planning and
Development Chairman P.K. Chiang urged Tuesday the formation of a
coalition government to stabilize the political situation following
Premier Tang Fei's resignation.</P>
      <P>He told the media that the best way to stabilize the political
situation and win back the support of the people would be to form a
coalition government.</P>
      <P>After the March 18 presidential election, Chiang said, the
Kuomintang, which still controls most seats in the Legislative Yuan,
tried to persuade the Democratic Progressive Party government to let
the KMT form the Cabinet, but failed.</P>
      <P>Later, he went on, the KMT demanded the formation of a coalition
government, but the proposal was also rejected by the DPP.</P>
      <P>As the present situation is urgent, Chiang said, President Chen
Shui-bian, who gained only 40 percent of the vote in the presidential
election, should also listen to the views of the remaining 60 percent
of Taiwan's voters.</P>
      <P>For the sake of keeping industries from leaving the island, he
said that all parties should sit down to discuss effective measures,
and added that the KMT is willing to cooperate in this aspect. Chiang
is now the secretary-general of a KMT think tank.</P>
      <P>At the same time, DPP Legislator Trong Chai affirmed Tang's
contributions to assisting the new government during his four-month
stint as premier.</P>
      <P>But Chai urged the president to select a new premier with great
care, so as to avoid having another short-lived premier, as it is
very important now to ensure sound operations in economic

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan faces a fresh round of political
turmoil with the sudden resignation of Premier Tang Fei, the
opposition People First Party said Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said the country is encountering a
political upheaval and he urged all political parties to put the
country's interests over party benefits and work together to pull the
country out of the difficulty.</P>
      <P>He called on President Chen Shui-bian to stage an all-party
conference to draw up a common front on issues concerning the
national interest.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chen Cheng-sheng warned after Tang's announcement
of his resignation that the island is facing a period of political
uncertainty, economic collapse, domestic industry exodus and
international doubt as to its credibility.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a local cable television station, Chen said
it is a pity that Tang quit because he flew in the face of Chen by
insisting on pressing ahead with the construction of the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>He said it has turned out that Chen, who touted his
administration as a "government for the whole people" rather than for
any political party, has chosen to follow the Democratic Progressive
Party's dictate in preference to what he claimed is "the majority
public opinion" on the issue.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang spokesman Jason Hu told a press conference
that his party appreciates Tang's contributions during his four
months in office and is disappointed at his departure, which he
described as a loss to the government and the people.</P>
      <P>He criticized Chen for over-stepping his constitutional mandate
by disregarding the premier's authority, which he said led to Tang's
resignation, although Tang himself cited ill-health as his reason for
leaving his post.</P>
      <P>He promised that the KMT will do its utmost to secure the welfare
of the people while the country faces a possible political
disturbance.</P>
      <P>KMT leaders went into a huddle immediately after Tang's
resignation, in a meeting expected to continue late into the night.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan was quoted as wondering why Tang would
quit after Chen had promised to respect his decision on the nuclear
plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan, He Chih-hui, predicted a
political storm is forming in light of the government budget, still
pending approval at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He blamed Chen for deserting the premier after milking him for
all he was worth.</P>
      <P>Minority New Party leader Hau Lung-ping regretted Tang's
departure, calling it an unfortunate loss for not only the DPP but
also the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Tang's resignation is an indication that Chen's
"government for the whole people" has collapsed and that the country
is moving into uncharted territory.</P>
      <P>The DPP remained tight-lipped on Tang's resignation Tuesday
night. Secretary-General Wu Nei-jen, who has publicly criticized Tang
as incompetent and has long been prodding him to resign, said his
party would call a press conference the following morning.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet will not necessarily have to
resign en masse following Premier Tang Fei's resignation Tuesday
evening, a government spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chung Chin, director general of the Government Information Office
said at a press briefing that Tang had only asked for his "personal
leave" and he thinks that his move would not necessarily mean that
the other members of his Cabinet would have to follow in his
footsteps.</P>
      <P>But Lee Juo-i, deputy director-general of the Central Personnel
Administration pointed out that whether the Cabinet should quit en
masse should be decided by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>While meeting President Chen Shui-bian earlier in the evening,
Tang again submitted his resignation, the fourth time he has done so
since Sept. 19, Presidential Office Secretary-General Chen Che-nan
said, adding that after taking into account Tang's health condition,
the president approved his resignation.</P>
      <P>Tang was hospitalized for removing his chest tumor even before
his swearing-in, and was later readmitted when his surgical wound
become infected.</P>
      <P>Chung said that the outgoing premier will be present at the
weekly Cabinet meeting, to be presided over by Vice Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung Wednesday, to bid farewell to his Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Tang, who assumed his office on May 20, was the
shortest-serving premier of the nation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Legislative Yuan official responsible for meeting
affairs said that the budget plan now being deliberated at the
legislature has to be dropped and the incoming Cabinet will have to
prepare a new one.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan fails to complete screening and approval
of the new budget plan, government agencies will be able to make
temporary use of the budget amount set for last fiscal year for
ordinary administrative affairs in accordance with the regulations
set forth in Budget Law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has appointed Vice
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to take the place of Tang Fei as premier,
it was announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, acting secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said in a brief press conference that Yu Shyi-kun, the former
vice premier, will serve as secretary-general to the President.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the Cabinet will immediately undergo a minor
reshuffle and that the new Cabinet will strengthen its economic and
financial team in order to meet the expectations of the public.</P>
      <P>Chang, 62, a long-term legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), served as Chen's campaign manager during the
presidential race and then as secretary-general to the President.</P>
      <P>Yu, 52, a former two-term magistrate of Ilan County and
spokesperson of the DPP presidential campaign, last served as the
vice premier before resigning to take responsibility for a failed
rescue operation in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The acting secretary-general also said that President Chen
reaffirmed his intention of inviting leaders of the major opposition
political parties to a discussion on national affairs, adding that he
hopes the opposition leaders will overcome their own differences with
the DPP and attend the roundtable meeting.</P>
      <P>He also said that President Chen is deeply sorry about Tang's
departure and that he expressed his sincere praise and appreciation
for Tang's role over the past four months.</P>
      <P>Tang, citing that his poor health made him unfit for the
premiership, tendered his resignation Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>Observers had said that his departure was inevitable as the
veteran Kuomintang member, invited by President Chen to form "a
government of all people," had to step down as his position on the
continued construction of the controversial fourth nuclear plant ran
directly counter to that of the Presidential Office and the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT WON'T SIT IDLY BY POLITICAL TURMOIL: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the major opposition
Kuomintang, expressed the hope Wednesday that the political turmoil
will soon be over one day after the resignation of Tang Fei as the
premier.</P>
      <P>Tang tendered his resignation Tuesday evening, citing his ill
health as the reason. His deputy, Chang Chun-hsiung, has been
appointed to take over the post.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lien said that Tang's departure is not due to the
ostensible health reasons, saying that the veteran KMT member had to
step down because his ideals and policies differed sharply from that
of the president.</P>
      <P>Lien said that with cross-strait relations stalled, stock and
currency markets slumping, economic development down, and government
attitude wavering, the KMT, as the major opposition, cannot sit idly
by the political turmoil and watch the nation's past glory and
economic prosperity being trampled.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the government will place national
stability and economic development as its priority, stressing that if
the turmoil continues, then it is meaningless for this government to
continue to rule the nation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, James Soong, chairman of the People First Party (PFP),
said Wednesday that in the interests of the general public, political
parties have to make national stability their responsibility.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the PFP supports the president's idea of
convening a roundtable meeting to discuss major national issues.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chien, the PFP spokesperson, criticized the Presidential
Office for its lack of sincerity in pushing for the proposed
roundtable meeting, saying it was only using the idea as a facade to
stabilize the political situation because of the problems it was
facing as a minority government.</P>
      <P>Sun said that both the KMT and PFP have been preparing for the
meeting for a long time, and he urged the Presidential Office to be
sincere in squarely facing the constitutional crisis confronting the
nation.</P>
      <P>Sun also said that this is a critical time when the political
wisdom of the president, new premier and new Cabinet will be tested,
and he called for the establishment of a communication mechanism
between the ruling party and the Legislative Yuan, which is dominated
by the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>On the question on whether to overturn the Cabinet, another minor
opposition New Party member said that the NP is against the idea.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao, NP whip in the Legislative Yuan, said that from the
point of view of national stability, the NP will not work toward
toppling the Cabinet just because of Tang Fei's departure.</P>
      <P>Lai said that toppling the Cabinet will mean a non-confidence
vote, and as the NP still does not know how the new premier will
perform, it is not advocating the action.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, spokesperson for the PFP, said reshuffling the
Cabinet is one of the president's rightful powers and should not be
used as a reason for toppling the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>She said however that if the new Cabinet goes against the will of
the people, then her party will propose following such a course of
action.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN LAMBASTS DPP AS ALL TALK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
said Wednesday that the KMT is as sorry as the Taiwan public about
Premier Tang Fei's resignation the previous day, labeling it the
result of a political struggle rather than due to Tang's "health
problems."</P>
      <P>Lien lambasted the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as being
all talk and little useful action over the past four months, saying
it had "constantly held the premier back and hindered him rather than
helping his performance."</P>
      <P>Lien said the new government has not only been disrespectful
towards the majority in the legislature, but has disregarded the
premier's authority that is mandated by the Republic of China
Constitution.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a meeting with Premier Tang Fei who
submitted his resignation Tuesday for what he described as "health
reasons." Tang's resignation was accepted by President Chen Shui-bian
that evening.</P>
      <P>Tang, who said Tuesday that his resignation took effect
immediately, visited the KMT Central Committee the first thing in the
morning. When he arrived, the KMT chairman gave Tang, a KMT member, a
bear-hug welcoming him "home."</P>
      <P>Tang told Lien that he chose to resign because he felt he could
not implement his ideals that he believes are all in the interests of
the nation and the people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang said he has done his utmost over the past four
months as the premier, particularly on issues regarding domestic
affairs and the development of cross-strait relations. "I have no
regrets," he noted.</P>
      <P>Lien invited Tang to be a senior adviser to the KMT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN FACES MAJOR TEST AFTER TANG'S DEPARTURE: JAPANESE MEDIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several national newspapers in Japan
Wednesday gave prominent coverage to the news of Republic of China
Premier Tang Fei's resignation, saying his departure means Chen's
four-month-old government will now face some daunting challenges.</P>
      <P>Asahi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nihon Keizai
Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun, and Tokyo Shimbun all reported that because
Tang's stance of supporting the continued construction of the
controversial fourth nuclear plant pitted him against President Chen
Shui-bian, he tendered his resignation Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Asahi Shimbun said that the resignation of Tang has plunged the
"government of all people" led by President Chen into crisis and that
Chen will be forced to make major judgment calls on how to run his
government now.</P>
      <P>Mainland China will quietly eye political developments in Taiwan,
and progress on the stalled cross-strait relations is expected to be
more difficult, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Chen faces his biggest test as his
"government of all people" has been shaken after only four months. It
added that the Kuomintang, the largest opposition party and the
dominant force in the Legislative Yuan, will now step up its
offensive and the political situation will continue to be unstable.</P>
      <P>Mainichi Shimbun said that President Chen faces the biggest
crisis of his four-month old administration. It added that the weak
basis of his political power has been revealed and that the
opposition camp will now step up its pressure on the ruling party,
making political turmoil inevitable.</P>
      <P>Another widely circulated newspaper, Nihon Keizai Shimbun, echoed
this view.</P>
      <P>Sankei Shimbun said President Chen's credibility in running the
government will face major challenges and he will have to review the
idea of "the government of all people" or study the possibility of
forming a "coalition government," adding that the political situation
in Taiwan is turbulent.</P>
      <P>Tokyo Shimbun said it is very obvious that the Cabinet members
have different views on domestic and foreign issues and that the
Cabinet will have to undergo a major reshuffle, adding that the
government's foundations will probably not become solid in the short
term.</P>
      <P>President Chen will face a major test regarding his handling of
the controversial fourth nuclear plant and also the daunting task of
maintaining stability through the political turmoil, the daily said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PREMIER VOWS TO MAINTAIN POLITICAL STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said
Wednesday he will do his utmost to maintain domestic political
stability and ensure continued economic development.</P>
      <P>The legislator-turned-premier made the vow at a press conference
held after he was named premier by President Chen Shui-bian and
chaired a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>"Political stability and economic growth will be our highest
priority," Chang said, adding that he understands very well the
needs of the public -- a safe political environment, continued
economic growth and stable stock market.</P>
      <P>Chang, mindful of likely clashes with a hostile parliament
dominated by the main opposition Kuomintang, also called for a new
political culture of cooperation instead of conflict.</P>
      <P>Chang said he will attentively listen to the "voice of the
people" and sincerely and modestly accept the supervision of
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>In the future, Chang said, his Cabinet will strengthen
communications with the Legislative Yuan and all major political
parties. "I earnestly hopes that both the ruling and opposition
parties can understand general public expectations of political
stability and continued economic growth and work together to
realize these goals," he noted.</P>
      <P>Chang's appointment to the premiership on Wednesday took control
of the Cabinet away from a member of a rival political party. Chang
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party replaces KMT stalwart
Tang Fei who resigned late Tuesday for health reasons.</P>
      <P>Chang, 62, lauded Tang for his dedicated services during his
four-month stint as premier. "Tang has brought peace, harmony and
stability to our country following Taiwan's first-ever democratic
transition of power between different political parties," Chang
said, adding he is convinced that all local people will remember
Tang's outstanding contribution to the country forever.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet resigned en masse in a formality Wednesday following
Tang's surprise resignation the day earlier. Chang said most of the
Cabinet members would be retained and a "very small-scale reshuffle"
will be made in the shortest period of time possible.</P>
      <P>He further said the Cabinet will withdraw its draft budget plan
for fiscal 2001 from the Legislative Yuan Thursday for
certain necessary revisions.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Cabinet would submit a revised budget plan to the
legislature after taking into consideration the views of opposition
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang confirmed that Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen has
agreed to remain on the post. However, Chang said, Finance Minister
Shea Jia-dong has expressed his firm determination to step down
from his current post.</P>
      <P>Chang would not confirm reports that Central Bank of China
Governor Perng Fai-nan will serve as vice premier and that Chiou
I-jen, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council,
will be named Cabinet secretary-general. "I'm still mulling some
personnel arrangements and no final decisions have
been made yet," he added.</P>
      <P>Chang cut short his sixth term in the legislature to become
secretary-general to the President in May. In late July, he was
appointed vice premier when his predecessor, Yu Shyi-kun, resigned
to take political responsibility for a botched rescue of four
workers killed by flash flood in the Pachang Creek after waiting in
vain for help for hours.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER REFRAINS FROM SAYING WHETHER TO STAY ON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
Wednesday he had tendered his resignation, and would not comment on
whether or not the resignation would be accepted.</P>
      <P>Lin, in the eye of a political storm triggered by Tang Fei's
resignation as premier the previous evening, said last week that his
ministry would advise against the continued construction of the
island's fourth nuclear power plant, but he also said that should the
premier decide to go ahead with construction, he would forego his
"personal values and feelings" and implement the project.</P>
      <P>Lin, faced with a barrage of criticism because of his opposition
to the fourth nuclear plant, said that he was "very sorry" for
becoming the "flash point" of the political storm and that he would
resign.</P>
      <P>He said that the fourth nuclear power plant has been the focus of
controversy for several years and that it is a problem that will have
to be faced by any economics minister, adding that the criticism
directed at him is "not fair."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang said that the
fourth nuclear plant should not be halted now and that proposals for
alternative energy sources put forward by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs are not feasible.</P>
      <P>Reporting on the Central Standing Committee meeting of the
opposition Kuomintang, Wang said the only reason for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to halt the project is political
considerations, and added that the DPP should not cause the national
economy to collapse to further its owns selfish ends.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed that in terms of power supplies, the northern part
of Taiwan has faced long-term electricity shortages and that the
system of more transferring power from southern Taiwan to the north
is not based on a sound foundation. The early completion of the
fourth nuclear power plant, he said, would enable Taiwan to "shrug
off the nightmare of power rationing."</P>
      <P>He said that the island's reserves of gas, the alternative
proposed by the DPP, can be maintained for only two weeks. If
mainland China were to impose a blockade on Taiwan, the supply of gas
would immediately run into difficulties, bringing unprecedented
disaster to the island.</P>
      <P>Wang stressed that the government's attitude toward the scrapping
of the project is based on the DPP's platform that stipulates its
opposition to nuclear power and because President Chen Shui-bian
committed himself to scrapping it during the presidential campaign.
He added that the DPP has totally ignored the fact that a moratorium
would have a disastrous impact on the diminishing domestic economy
and the ailing stock market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MEMBERS NOT ALLOWED TO JOIN CABINET WITHOUT PARTY CONSENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang Legislative Yuan
caucus resolved Wednesday that no KMT member will be allowed to join
the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-held Cabinet in his or her
capacity as an individual without party endorsement.</P>
      <P>Violators of the resolution will be dealt with by the party, the
KMT legislative caucus decided during a meeting called less than one
day after President Chen Shui-bian accepted Premier Tang Fei's
resignation.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators took turns to lambaste Chen for "dumping"
Tang after "using" him.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chieh-ju forecast that the next Cabinet to be
headed by DPP's Chang Chun-hsiung, who was vice premier during Tang's
four-month tenure, will last no longer than the Tang Cabinet, given
that the DPP is still the minority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Fu-hsing said there is no feasible option for
the DPP to find a way out of a political turmoil which is looming
ever-larger. The opposition KMT should step forward to offer to form
a coalition government so as to provide hope for the current Taiwan
political situation, he added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Hsieh-sheng suggested that unless consent is
reached between the DPP and the KMT, no one from the KMT will be
allowed to join the DPP-led Cabinet in his or her capacity as an
individual. Chen's suggestion was passed unanimously.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus announced at a press
conference that the DPP's "government for the whole people" has
already collapsed and claimed that the new Chang Cabinet will be
doomed to fare no better than the Tang Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus stressed, however, that the time is not yet ripe
for a no-confidence vote against the newly formed Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the opposition People First Party called
Wednesday for the suspension of the general budget screening and the
general interpellation at the Legislative Yuan until the new premier
has been in office for "a certain period of time."</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the surprise resignation of
Republic of China Premier Tang Fei, the fifth sub-Cabinet economic
dialogue between Taiwan and the U.S. will be held in Washington, D.C.
Thursday as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Four ROC deputy financial and economic chiefs -- Vice Economics
Minister Lin Yi-fu, Central Bank of China Deputy Governor Chen
Shih-meng, Vice Finance Minister Sean C. Chen and Ho Mei-yueh, vice
chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development -- have
already arrived in Washington in preparation for attending the
sub-Cabinet meeting to be held at the U.S. Treasury Department.</P>
      <P>The ROC representative office in the U.S. said the one-day
sub-Cabinet meeting will not be affected by Taiwan's Cabinet
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>ROC and U.S. officials will exchange views on a broad range of
issues, including the general economic situation, intellectual
property rights protection, government procurement measures,
transparency in financial institution operations, liberalization of
Taiwan's undersea cable market and other related topics.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the U.S. Chen Chien-jen and American
Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard Bush will head the ROC and the
American delegations, respectively, while Lin Yi-fu and Under
Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner will serve as chief ROC and
U.S. negotiators, respectively.</P>
      <P>The agenda will not include Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear
power plant project because it has nothing to do with any trade
barriers between the two countries, Clinton administration officials
said. The project mainly involves trade deals between an individual
U.S. firm -- General Electric -- and the ROC's state-owned Taiwan
Power Co.</P>
      <P>The four ROC deputy economic and financial chiefs paid visits to
the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Treasury Department,
the Department of Commerce and the Federal Reserve System Tuesday for
preliminary talks with relevant U.S. officials.</P>
      <P>The annual sub-Cabinet meeting is the highest-level ROC-U.S.
dialogue mechanism in the absence of formal diplomatic relations. It
takes place in Washington D.C. and Taipei alternately.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRUDEAU'S SON QUOTES ROBERT FROST TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO FATHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,   Oct.  3  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pierre Elliott Trudeau's eldest son
paraphrased poet Robert Frost to say good-bye to his father Tuesday,
saying "the woods are lovely, dark, and deep. He has kept his
promises and earned his sleep."</P>
      <P>"Je t'aime, papa," Justin Trudeau said with tears in his eyes at
the end of his eulogy at a state funeral in Montreal, triggering more
tears among all those attending in person and watching the ceremony
via a live broadcast.</P>
      <P>Canada has mourned the death of celebrated former Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau for the past five days. It was Justin's poignant
eulogy to his father that brought an entire nation to tears.</P>
      <P>"Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the words convey so many things to so
many people -- statesman, intellectual, professor, adversary,
outdoors man, lawyer, journalist, author, prime minister, but more
than anything, to me, he was dad. And what a dad. He loved us with
the passion and the devotion that encompassed his life," he said.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old son forgot one word, lover. His father had been a
real life lover at least to several famous women, including
constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne, who brought her daughter with
Trudeau, nine-year-old Sarah, to the memorial service. Movie actress
Margot Kidder, an ex-girlfriend of Trudeau's, also turned up at the
funeral clutching a bouquet of white roses.</P>
      <P>Absent was classical guitarist Liona Boyd, who had an eight-year
relationship with Trudeau during the 70s and 80s. Boyd said she chose
not to be there out of respect for Trudeau's former wife Margaret and
his family.</P>
      <P>Another former girl friend, singer-actress Barbara Streisand, has
rarely been mentioned by the Canadian media over the past few days,
although she had had a very open affair with Trudeau.</P>
      <P>Cuban President Fidel Castro and former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter were among 21 honorary pallbearers. Carter praised Trudeau as
a symbol of democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Castro declared three days of mourning in Cuba for his old friend
Trudeau and ordered all flags lowered to half-mast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DECLARES WAR ON CARP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian government Thursday
declared war on the carp, a fish that has experienced a population
explosion and has been dubbed by farmers as the rabbit of the water.</P>
      <P>The Howard government has begun mapping out plans to control the
freshwater fish that was introduced to Australia in 1859. The carp
has become notorious for contributing to the degradation of rivers,
according to the Department of Primary Industries.</P>
      <P>DPI Minister Warren Truss told reporters Wednesday that the
carp's population density has reached one fish per square meter of
water surface in some areas. It has dominated Australian waterways
for 30 years and now accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the fish
biomass in Australian rivers.</P>
      <P>He said the spread of the carp is causing chaos in the natural
environment by increasing water turbidity, damaging aquatic plants,
and making aquatic habitat less suitable for native fish.</P>
      <P>The DPI on Tuesday put out four publications on carp research and
management as part of its efforts at substantially reducing numbers
and restoring environmental balance in major rivers.</P>
      <P>DPI, helped by experts, came up with a national strategy for carp
management, which includes genetic technology to control fish
fertility and also the manipulation of the food chain.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's personal computer giant Acer
Inc. has successfully transformed itself from a leading personal
computer maker into an Internet organization and is progressively
launching a new generation of products and services to meet changing
global demand.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Acer
chairman Stan Shih said the strategy has been working since the
company's transformation to an Internet appliance and services
provider.</P>
      <P>This is expected to lead to new relationships in the
communications sector where Acer is likely to negotiate deals with
regional giants, including the government-owned telecommunications
firm Telstra Corp. of Australia, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Shih's move came as Acer's PC sales had been languishing. The
company's business fortunes are expected to reverse in the long term
with the growth in the Internet and new technological advances,
reported the daily.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Shih as saying that "our PC business is not too
good, but we believe this will turn around. A major original
equipment manufacturer customer in the U.S. is recovering, and
although the third quarter results were disappointing, we expect to
see the first quarter of the next year looking stronger."</P>
      <P>The daily reported that Acer has been investing in its long-term
future, casting its net wide across key technologies, such as storage
technology, chip sets, power modules, cable modems, software and
communications technology, and whatever is needed to establish a
strong service structure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT `NEVER PUSHED FOR INDEPENDENCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui told U.S.-based Voice of America Monday that he disagreed
with mainland China's idea of unification but "has never pushed for
Taiwan independence."</P>
      <P>In a simultaneous TV and radio Chinese-language broadcast aimed
at a primarily mainland audience, Lee said that it is wrong to have
"only one central government to which all local governments answer,"
adding that the Chinese people deserve more democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that issues such as lifestyles and promoting
agriculture should be left up to local government. How a handful of
people in Beijing can control 1.3 billion people "is truly, seriously
difficult," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the Kuomintang government, which ruled Taiwan for
the past five decades before being ousted on March 18 this year,
should have established a local government with Taiwanese people at
its core to help the local people rule themselves. Instead, he went
on, the KMT ruled "with the ways of the dynasty era."</P>
      <P>However, he continued, Taiwan at least "had some accomplishments"
in its political system and has "continually strived to promote
democracy and human rights." In fact, he said, Taiwan's history can
serve as a model for mainland China because "all being Chinese, if
Taiwan can, why can't mainland China?"</P>
      <P>Lee said that the promotion of democracy and political reform in
Taiwan should be of "immense help" to the 1.3 billion people in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Regarding the harsh criticism from mainland China aimed at him,
Lee said that both the National Unification Council and the National
Unification Guidelines were established during his time in office,
and that while the late ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo legalized
visits to mainland China by veterans, "real exchanges between the
people began in my term."</P>

    <HEADLINE>`BUSINESS AS USUAL' IN ROC-U.S. RELATIONS: U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. State Department spokesman said
Tuesday it is convinced that unofficial relations between the U.S.
and the Republic of China will remain "business as usual" following
ROC Premier Tang Fei's surprise resignation.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the U.S. government is aware that Tang has
resigned for health reasons. "We are confident that our unofficial
relations with Taiwan will continue smoothly," he added.</P>
      <P>As for Tang's possible successor, the spokesman said the State
Department has no comment on such a purely domestic issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwan affairs expert said the only U.S. concern
about the issue is whether Taiwan's military reform will be affected
by Tang's departure.</P>
      <P>Stephen Yates, a senior policy analyst with the Heritage
Foundation, a right-wing think tank, said that if Tang's resignation
leads to a slowdown or a complete halt to Taiwan's military reform,
the scenario will certainly have an adverse impact on U.S. arms sales
to the country.</P>
      <P>Tang, a four-star-general-turned-politician, won U.S. recognition
for his efforts to promote Taiwan's military modernization during his
stints as air force commander-in-chief, chief of the General Staff
and defense minister. With U.S. assistance, Taiwan has worked hard to
upgrade its defense capabilities in recent years.</P>
      <P>Yates said it would be a wise move if President Chen Shui-bian
were to appoint Vice Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to succeed Tang.</P>
      <P>Yates, who is familiar with Taiwan's general political situation,
said that since Chang served as the top aide to President Chen before
assuming the post of vice premier, he will be able to work smoothly
with Chen after taking over the premiership.</P>
      <P>Yates also said he does not think the main opposition Kuomintang,
which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20, will initiate a
no-confidence vote against the new premier following Tang's
resignation because the KMT's support rating has remained low since
its embarrassing defeat in the March 18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>If the KMT broaches a no-confidence vote, the move will certainly
lead to Chen's decision to disband the KMT-dominated Legislative
Yuan. Should that be the case, Yates said, the opposition People
First Party will be the top beneficiary and the KMT will very likely
lose its majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Except for military reform, Yates said, Tang's resignation is not
an important event to the U.S. unless Tang's successor makes
significant changes to Taiwan's policies toward mainland China and
the U.S.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Tang's departure will facilitate realization of any
U.S. policy goals, Yates said the U.S. government has so far given a
"neutral" or "slightly favorable" evaluation of the performance of
Chen's administration.</P>
      <P>However, some other U.S. observers said Tang's resignation
reflects the cold reality that the Democratic Progressive Party-led
ROC government has not yet gotten out of the starting blocks.</P>
      <P>Robert A. Manning, head of the Asian Study of the New
York-based think tank Council of Foreign Relations, said since this
is the first time that the DPP has wielded power, the Taiwan people
should give their new government a longer period of time to settle
in.</P>

Institute, the first Chinese president of the authoritative steel
organization, IISI sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wang was elected at the IISI's annual meeting held in Melbourne

for the last two years.</P>
      <P>The IISI, a non-profit international organization, is composed of

major steel plants in the U.S., the U.K., France and Japan are all
IISI members.</P>
      <P>None of mainland China's steel plants are IISI members and the

companies to the organization will be one of Wang's major tasks, as
the mainland will represent a tremendous steel market after its entry
into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Members of IISI churn out 750 million metric tons of steel each
year, accounting for 70 percent of the world volume.</P>
      <P>As one of the few Taiwan entrepreneurs occupying an important

      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank
Hsieh issued a three-point statement Wednesday, throwing his full
support behind President Chen Shui-bian's decision to promote Vice
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to the premiership.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, also mayor of Kaohsiung City, issued the statement at a
press conference aimed at defusing public jitters over the possible
adverse impact on domestic political and economic stability of
Premier Tang Fei's surprise resignation the previous day.</P>
      <P>Former DPP chairmen Yao Chia-wen, Chang Chun-hung and Lin
Yi-hsiung, as well as Peng Shao-chin, secretary-general of the DPP
caucus in the Legislative Yuan, were also present at the news
conference to throw their weight behind Chang's promotion.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said President Chen, a DPP stalwart, has appointed Chang to
succeed Tang, a member of the main opposition Kuomintang, mainly
because Chang is a savvy politician used to the cut and thrust of
domestic politics and parliamentary operations.</P>
      <P>"The quick decision is also aimed at minimizing domestic
political uncertainty caused by Tang's departure," Hsieh explained,
adding that the DPP fully backs the president's decision.</P>

contributed much to helping stabilize the domestic political

      <P>Republic of China Vice
President Annette Lu returned Wednesday from her four-state "journey
of soft power diplomacy" aimed at shoring up the ROC's diplomatic
relations with its allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Lu and her entourage arrived after a 30-hour layover in San
Francisco, where she toured a science and technology museum in San
Francisco and met with several scholars in her hotel room to exchange
views on Taiwan's science and technology development.</P>
      <P>She had left Taipei Sept. 22 for her first post-inauguration
overseas journey, which took her to El Salvador, Honduras, Belize,
and Guatemala. She also made transit stops in Los Angeles and Miami
on her way to El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Before returning from Guatemala, the last stop on her trip, Lu
said that the four heads of state had all told her that they will
continue to lend support to the ROC's bid to rejoin the United

      <P>The presidents of El Salvador and Honduras as well as the prime
minister of Belize will visit Taiwan in November and December, while
the president of Guatemala will visit Taiwan next March, she added.</P>

"careful deliberation." Therefore, everyone should respect the
president's decision, she said.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that Tang's resignation marked a "metamorphosis and
transfer" of political power which would allow Chen's administration
to strengthen its grasp on power. Chen had acquired only "an
approximate amount of power" on May 20, she said, adding that taking
real control was a gradual process.</P>

      <P>The president stressed that his "government of all people" has
not failed. So long as political party leaders put the interest of
the nation and the people higher than that of their party or
themselves, the spirit of the "government of all people" will live
on, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the party affiliation of the next premier will have
no effect on the idea.</P>
      <P>Tang's resignation has shocked people in Taiwan and overseas.
Local and international as well as mainland Chinese mass media have
played up the event, putting Taiwan's short-term political situation
in the worldwide spotlight.</P>
      <P>Therefore, President Chen put aside all his afternoon business to
give an exclusive interview to the Washington Post.</P>
      <P>According to a presidential aide, the Post reporter asked Chen
whether the resignation of Premier Tang Fei meant the failure of his
advocated "government of all people." President Chen replied that it
did not.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the "government of all people" is a
conviction of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. The DPP-led
administration has faced a lot of difficulties since assuming power
on May 20, he noted, adding that competition between the political
parties is normal in a democratic country like Taiwan. An
administration that accepts the supervision of opposition party is
also normal, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about an opposition proposal to set up a coalition
government, Chen stressed that the true minority or majority parties
are not decided by the number of seats in parliament, but whether the
government policies win the people's support or not. He cited the
Clinton Administration, which is not a minority government despite
the fact that Republicans outnumber Democrats in both the Senate and
House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Asked about the affect on mainland China of the internal change,
Chen said that the partial reshuffling of the Cabinet has nothing to
do with cross strait relations.</P>
      <P>But Chen pointed out that Beijing has employed a "united front"
against Taiwan, and has tried its best to divide business and
industrial groups in Taiwan, overseas Chinese communities around the
world, and Taiwan's diplomatic allies. "At this moment, we (the
people of Taiwan) must stand united to cope with Beijing's united
front," the aide quoted Chen as saying.</P>
      <P>Regarding the economy, which is worsening daily, Chen said that
the government will invite more economists and experts to join the
Cabinet, so as to effectively deal with financial issues.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Paul Cassingham, president of the American
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, said Wednesday that foreign
businessmen in Taiwan are still optimistic about the island's
economy, despite the sudden resignation of Premier Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>He told the media that foreign investors are in Taiwan because
they are optimistic about its long-term economic development, and
added that their views are not influenced by short-term incidents.</P>
      <P>Cassingham went on to say that it is a normal thing to see
government officials step down in democratic countries.</P>
      <P>When then-U.S. President Richard Nixon resigned over the
Watergate scandal some 20 years ago, he noted, the U.S. economy was
not adversely affected.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Ho Wei-ling, chairman of Compaq Computer
Taiwan, said that after learning of Tang's resignation, she exchanged
views with business friends and colleagues, all of whom agreed that
Taiwan's economy will not be affected by the premier's resignation,
as the island's economic fundamentals remain sound.</P>
      <P>But Ho pointed out that political stability is important for
foreign businessmen who have come to Taiwan for investment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Local financial magazine Business Weekly
announced Wednesday its annual list of Taiwan's wealthiest 100
technology industry leaders.</P>
      <P>Despite the broad stock market plunge, Hon Hai Precision Industry
Chairman Terry Kuo, who was last year's number-two wealthiest man in
the local technology industry circle, nevertheless leaped into first
place with a NT$31.1 billion (US$1 billion) boost in his total
fortune, which worked out to be approximately NT$97.9 billion (US$3.1
billion) as of Sept. 8.</P>
      <P>Kuo's net worth is equivalent to approximately half of what
Amazon.com founder Jeffrey Bezos -- Forbes' No. 10 ranking
techno-billionaire -- is worth, at US$6.1 billion. But Kuo's treasure
pile is still a far-cry from the US$60 billion amassed by William H.
Gates III, the world's wealthiest man.</P>
      <P>Kuo ranks 212th on Forbes' list of billionaires from around the
world, based on prevailing valuations on May 22 which put his net
worth at US$2.8 billion. His company makes computer parts for Compaq,
Apple, and other U.S. companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's richest technology leader from last year, Quanta
Computer's Lin Pai-li, lost NT$51 billion (US$1.6 billion) this year
to end up second with a net worth of NT$66.9 billion (US$2.1
billion).</P>
      <P>Via Technologies Chairwoman Cher Wang, the second daughter of
Formosa Plastics Chairman Wang Yung-ching, was named the wealthiest
woman in Taiwan with a net worth of NT$18.4 billion (US$588 million).</P>
      <P>Wang ranked No. 6 in the Business Weekly top 100, while her
father ranked No. 122 on the Forbes list of billionaires with a net
worth of US$4.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.'s Morris Chang ranked
No. 21.</P>
      <P>According to the local survey, which calculated the worth of
stocks owned by the chairmen, trustees, major stockholders, and
presidents of all listed local technology companies, approximately
one-third of last year's hi-tech elite were overtaken by other
up-and-coming entrepreneurs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAMES SOONG SUGGESTS THAT ADMINISTRATION FORM COMMUNICATION MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Chairman James
Soong on Wednesday urged the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the
ruling party to establish a communication mechanism to deal with
current political instability and prop up the local stock market,
which has been in the doldrums recently.</P>
      <P>Tang Fei's resignation as premier Tuesday shocked Taipei
political circles, resulting in Wednesday's stock market plunge
beneath the psychologically-important 6,000-point level.</P>
      <P>Despite Tang's claim that he was resigning for poor health, it is
widely believed that the true reason for Tang's resignation was his
pro-nuclear power stance, which flew in the face of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's anti-nuclear power platform.</P>
      <P>The number of DPP seats in the legislature is less that of the
opposition KMT, but Soong said that forming a coalition government is
not the only way to solve the current political turmoil. If the
DPP-led administration does not intend to face current political
reality, it should resort to the people -- and dismiss the
legislature to hold a legislative election.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that under their respective situations, the KMT
and DPP will not necessarily support such a legislative election.
Therefore, he suggested that a communication mechanism be established
among the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the ruling DPP.</P>
      <P>With Chang Chun-hsiung replacing Tang Fei as premier, Soong said
that the possibility of forming a coalition government is lower than
before. But he urged opposition parties to engage in rational
interpellation in the legislature, and called for the administration
to acknowledge political reality and communicate with opposition
parties on major legislation.</P>

perfect divine nature without any misgiving, shows that he
understands the nature of man."</TEXT>

new administration led by Chang absolutely has the potential to win
back the people's confidence.</P>
      <P>Su, who holds a master's degree in civil economy from Germany's
Frankfurt University and has been a senior economics consultant with
the German Trade Office in Taipei, said he is confident that the new
administration will enjoy pleasant approval ratings from the Taiwan
public before long.</P>
      <P>Citing examples of similar slow starts by new administrations in
the United States and Germany in the past, Su said it took President
Bill Clinton time before his administration began running smoothly
after he won the presidency from the Republicans who had held the
White House for 12 consecutive years. He also said the same thing
happened in Germany when the Social Democratic Party's Gerhard
Schroeder became chancellor following 12 years of Christian Democrat
rule.</P>
      <P>Su noted that temporary low approval ratings for President Chen
and his government are also understandable since voters had pegged
high expectations on the new government taking over after five
decades of rule by the Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Poor approval ratings for the new Democratic Progressive Party
government should be reversed if the public gives the administration
more time, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Su, 50, a commentator and editorial writer with the Taiwan Daily
News, is expected to be sworn in as the new government spokesman at a
formal ceremony Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA CHAIR OPENLY OPPOSES 4TH NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The founder of Taiwan's plastics giant
Thursday openly expressed his opposition to the continued
construction of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant, saying
that nuclear power is not only costly but also unsafe.</P>
      <P>At a press conference sponsored by himself, Wang Yung-ching,
founder and chairman of the Formosa Plastics Group, said his stance
is identical to that of the new Democratic Progressive Party-led
government, which is resolutely opposed to resuming construction of
the controversial power plant.</P>
      <P>Wang reiterated that the drawbacks involving the fourth nuclear
power plant, including high construction and maintenance costs,
serious environmental protection problems, and the questionable
safety of the power plant, have led him to say no to the mammoth
project.</P>
      <P>Wang told the nation's entrepreneurs not to worry about power
shortages, saying that there are always alternatives when it comes to
generating power.</P>
      <P>As for the NT$90 billion (US$2.88 billion) that Taiwan has
already spent on the project, Wang suggested that the cost be
absorbed over five years, but he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>It is understood that Wang openly made the remarks mainly because
the FPG controls Taiwan's second "powerhouse" -- the electricity
generating plant located in Mailiao, Yunlin County -- which is poised
to break Taiwan Power Company's monopoly as the sole supplier of
power in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FPG's two thermal-powered generator units in Mailiao have

    <HEADLINE>NO U.S. PRESSURE OVER 4TH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to
the United States Chen Chien-jen said Wednesday that the U.S.
government has never pressured Taiwan over the controversial fourth
nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Chen said neither American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard
Bush, the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, nor any Clinton administration official has
ever pressured Taiwan either to uphold or scrap its fourth nuclear
power plant project.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the U.S. Department of State issued
a statement expressing its stance on Taiwan's fourth nuclear power
plant project.</P>
      <P>The State Department readout said: "Whether to continue the
fourth nuclear power plant is a decision of the Taiwanese authority
to make. The U.S. government's major concern is the contract
provisions which mutually agreed upon in the past are fulfilled."</P>
      <P>Chen said the readout just expresses the U.S. hope that Taiwan
faithfully carries out the provisions of a contract it
previously signed with the U.S. firm concerning the project.</P>
      <P>"Nothing is unusual for the United States to show concern about
whether Taiwan fulfills its obligations under its contract with an
American company," Chen noted, adding that in the fourth nuclear
power plant case, the main U.S. concern is that if Taiwan
finally decides to scrap the project, it must compensate the U.S.
contractor in accordance with contract provisions.</P>
      <P>General Electric Co. of the United States has won the US$1.8
billion bid to supply Taiwan with nuclear reactors and other
related equipment to be installed in its fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Although the ROC's former Kuomintang government already approved
the budget for the new power plant, opposition to the project has
never abated. The controversy raged again after the Ministry of
Economic Affairs suggested an end to the project last weekend. The
political storm triggered by the controversy already led to the
resignation of Premier Tang Fei and a subsequent minor
reshuffle of the Democratic Progressive Party-led government.</P>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson would not make
any comment on Taiwan's Cabinet shakeup over the controversial power
plant project.</P>
      <P>In his speech to the Foreign Press Club Wednesday, Richardson
just stressed that nuclear energy is clean and safe. He said the real
problem lies in the disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear power
plants.</P>
      <P>Richardson said most U.S. nuclear power plants have failed to
take effective measures to help ordinary American people
understand the safety of nuclear energy. He also admitted that the
United States has not yet found a suitable place for permanent
disposal of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>An official with the ROC Representative Office in the United
States said the Clinton administration is now evaluating the
feasibility of building a facility in Nebraska State's Yucca mountain
region for permanent disposal of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said even if the U.S. government
finally agrees to the proposal, it is unlikely to give a green
light to the shipment of Taiwan's nuclear waste to Yucca for
permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a GE spokesman said Wednesday that GE has continued
production of equipment for Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant
because it has not received any notice from Taiwan demanding a halt
to the project.</P>
      <P>"We will fully respect Taiwan's final decision on the fate of
the project," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>GE sources said the company will incur little financial loss
even if Taiwan decides to scrap the project.</P>

      <P>Chang said that the Executive Yuan under his leadership will

    <HEADLINE>CHANG'S PREMIERSHIP NOT TO WORSEN CROSS-STRAIT TIES: DPP CHAIR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The appointment of Vice Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung as Taiwan's new premier will not strain cross-strait
relations, Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank Hsieh said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in a radio interview after President Chen
Shui-bian appointed Chang to take over the Premiership following Tang
Fei's surprise resignation on Tuesday. Both Chen and Chang are DPP
stalwarts.</P>
      <P>Although Tang, a senior member of the main opposition Kuomintang,
cited "health reasons" for his decision to quit, many observers feel
that the main cause of Tang's departure was the DPP's insistence on
calling a halt to the controversial fourth nuclear power plant
project.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, some observers said they are worried that
Chang's promotion to the Premiership may further chill the already
frigid cross-strait ties because of the DPP's pro-independence
platform.</P>
      <P>However, Hsieh said such worries are unfounded, stressing that
the DPP's current stance on cross-strait relations is to maintain
Taiwan's present status quo, not to pursue outright or de jure
independence for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as mayor of Kaohsiung, said he
doesn't think that mainland China will intensify its hostility toward
Taiwan simply because of Chang's appointment to the Premiership.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said that the DPP should adjust its established policy
goals to cater to Taiwan's mainstream values, with a view to
facilitating the DPP's transformation from a "minority opposition
party" to a "majority ruling party."</P>
      <P>With Tang's departure and Chang's promotion, Hsieh said, the DPP
is now the Republic of China's real ruling party. Nevertheless, as
the DPP controls only 68 seats in the 221-member Legislative Yuan,
Hsieh said that the party should modestly and sincerely consult with
other parties concerning major policy issues.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should also revise or adjust its previous policy goals
and proposals in order to live up to the public's expectations,"
Hsieh urged, adding that the DPP should refer to prevailing
mainstream values in formulating its party platform and amending its
party charter.</P>
      <P>"Self-examination and self-adjustment are necessary in pursuit of
progress and continued growth," Hsieh said, adding that all DPP
members should forge an intraparty consensus and unity to fulfill the
responsibility of governing.</P>
      <P>Noting that the recent stock market slump has mainly resulted
from the public's doubts about the government's capacity to manage
various financial problems and ensure continued economic growth,
Hsieh said the top priority of Chang's Cabinet will be to rebuild
public confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>In the future, Hsieh said, the DPP will play a role of
"integration and coordination" to help ensure smooth government
operations.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that both the Presidential Office and the Cabinet
will speak with the DPP headquarters before formulating any major
policy. We will then coordinate the support of all major intraparty
factions in the DPP legislative caucus," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsieh said, the DPP will strengthen communications
and consultations with major opposition parties, including the KMT,
which controls more than half of all parliamentary seats.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Consumer prices increased by 1.75 percent in
September, the highest such monthly figure in 19 months, the
Directorate General of the Budget, Account and Statistics announced
Thursday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials attributed September's consumer price increase to
Typhoon Bilis, which hit Taiwan at the end of August, sending the
prices of fruits and vegetables skyrocketing. The price of food was
estimated to have increased by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>They also cited state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.'s move to
increase petroleum product prices, which hiked the price of
transportation by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>Increased tuition costs and miscellaneous school fees in
September also forced parents to increase educational and other
expenses by 30 percent during the month.</P>
      <P>The officials said that consumer prices increased by 1.14 percent
in the first nine months of the year. As the fourth quarter typhoon
season has passed, and international oil prices are also expected to
stabilize, they said that monthly consumer price increases are
expected to remain within the 1.55 percent predicted by the DGBAS for
the entire year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Kuang-yu, director of the Ministry of
Justice Investigation Bureau, met with representatives of the
Investigators Reform Association Thursday to discuss MJIB structural
reforms.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that Wang had met IRA representatives since
a group of reform-minded grassroots MJIB agents formed the
association on Sept. 9 to push for a sweeping overhaul of the
bureau's operations and functions.</P>
      <P>Pai Po-wen, an IRA spokesman, said after the meeting that the IRA
representatives reached a preliminary consensus with Wang on the
MJIB's internal reforms.</P>
      <P>Wang was quoted as having assured the IRA delegates that he is
pleased to see the formation of the new association.</P>
      <P>"Wang also agreed to assign a senior official to meet with IRA
representatives once every three months to discuss various reform
programs," Pai said.</P>
      <P>According to Pai, the IRA presented a five-point reform program
to Wang. One of the proposals is to transform the MJIB into a purely
crime-fighting agency and to free it from five decades of political
manipulation. The association has also come up with a draft bill on
supervising intelligence-gathering operations and making them
impartial.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, the MJIB is under the authority of the
Ministry of Justice. But in fact, it has been instructed to conduct
controversial "national security condition surveys" under the
guidance of the National Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>Pai said the association has asked Wang to push for revisions of
current laws to free the bureau from being asked to conduct such
surveys, which have long been lambasted by opposition political
figures as government-sponsored "white terror" political persecution
tactics.</P>
      <P>In reply, Wang was quoted as having told the IRA representatives
that the MJIB must operate strictly in accordance with the law.
Before the current regulations are revised, Wang said, MJIB agents
must still conduct "national security condition surveys." However, he
agreed to gradually cut such kinds of surveys.</P>

      <P>Finance Minister-designate Yen Ching-chang
said Thursday he will do his utmost to let local stock prices
reasonably reflect Taiwan's current economic fundamentals after he
assumes office.</P>
      <P>Yen, an incumbent vice finance minister who will be sworn in as
new finance minister Friday, told a news conference that current
stock prices fail to reflect Taiwan's robust economic fundamentals
and general business records of companies listed in the Taiwan Stock
Exchange and the OTC (over-the-counter) market.</P>
      <P>Noting that the bourse forms an integral part of a country's
capital market, Yen said the recent fall in local stock prices
is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>As the Democratic Progressive Party-led government has
failed to articulate its financial and economic policies, the
local stock index has shed more than 2,000 points since May.
Yen said he will strengthen communications and coordination with
relevant government agencies to upgrade the administrative quality
in order to regain the public's confidence in the
government's capabilities to ensure continued economic growth.</P>
      <P>Yen also reminded local stock investors that foreign
capital only accounts for 5.5 percent of total stock market
turnover. "Local investors need not be affected by foreign financial
institutions' recent selling spree," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen voiced opposition to the proposal that the
Ministry of Finance cut the stock transaction tax rate, which
stands at 0.3 percent at the moment, to help lure back stock
investors.</P>
      <P>"As the tax rate was very low, I don't think a further cut will
have any effect. Moreover, a cut in the transaction tax rate may
fuel speculative money games and hinder healthy development
of our stock market in the long run," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOPPLING CABINET IS ONLY PERSONAL OPINION OF LAWMAKERS: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng said Thursday that a proposal to topple the new Cabinet
represents only the "personal opinion" of the KMT legislators who
brought up the idea and does not represent the stance of the party.</P>
      <P>Lin added that time must be taken to contemplate such a proposal,
while KMT Chairman Lien Chan would not comment on the idea. "It is
inappropriate to speculate on the issue," the KMT head stressed.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan were to vote to topple the Cabinet,
President Chen Shui-bian would have the authority to dismiss the
legislature, which would bring about an immediate legislative
election. Otherwise, a regular election is already scheduled for
December of next year.</P>
      <P>Chao Shou-po, director-general of the KMT's Department of
Organization Affairs, which handles mobilizing KMT members, said that
the KMT has not considered the issue of holding such a re-election.</P>
      <P>Responding to ruling Democratic Progressive Party Chairman Frank
Hsieh's comment that the KMT may not benefit from toppling the
Cabinet because both the DPP and the KMT's approval ratings are
dropping, Chao only said that all levels of the KMT's local
committees will be prepared to fight it out in next year's
legislative, county magistrate, and mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held by the KMT's legislative caucus,
lawmakers urged newly appointed Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to decide
the fate of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant without
delay, and to allocate more expenditures for economic infrastructure
in his revised national budget draft.</P>
      <P>Legislator Her Jyh-huei said that he hopes the president will let
Chang take charge of Cabinet affairs without interfering, so that
Chang can be a "constitutional premier," meaning someone with real
power to promote his policies.</P>
      <P>Her added that the public's greatest worry is that the DPP's
pro-independence and anti-nuclear platforms are having adverse
effects on cross-strait relations and the economy. Therefore, he
urged the DPP to abandon these two party platforms altogether.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chieh-ju said that vague economic policies have
caused immense harm to the economy, adding that if Chang does not
decide on whether to continue building the nuclear plant, he will
tread on the same path as former Premier Tang Fei, who resigned over
the same issue Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liao Fung-te urged Chang to make revisions to the
national budget proposal according to the recommendations of the
opposition parties. If Chang changes only "the name and the cover,"
the lawmakers will not accept such a budget plan, Liao added.</P>

SEPTEMBER FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES RECORDED AT 8-MONTH LOW</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA) Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves in
September totaled US$11.16 billion, the lowest level in eight months,
Central Bank of China officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The officials said the figure represents a decrease of US$1.36
billion from the previous month, but preserved the country's standing
as the holder of the third-largest foreign reserves in the world next
to Japan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>But the officials said that September's figure is a sharp
increase of US$10.01 billion from the same month of last year, mainly
because of the continuing influx of foreign capital to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipei foreign currency dealers said that the new Taiwan dollar
faced heavy pressure of depreciation in September, and the CBC
intervened actively by selling U.S. dollars to prop up the Taiwan
dollar, resulting in the shrinking of foreign reserves for the month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A young man donated 60 percent of his liver
to his father in a transplant operation that was the only way to save
the older man's life, doctors from National Taiwan University
Hospital said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 57-year-old father of Hung Chien-hsiung is a carrier of the
hepatitis-B virus who in the past year had suffered from jaundice and
liver failure that had taken him to the brink of death.</P>
      <P>When the patient's three sons learned that their father needed a
liver transplant, they all expressed willingness to donate their
livers to save their father's life. After evaluation, doctors decided
to use part of 27-year-old Hung's liver for the transplant.</P>
      <P>The 14-hour transplant operation was conducted on Aug. 9, doctors
said, adding that at present, Hung's new liver is functioning well
and his jaundice index has been restored to a normal level.</P>
      <P>The liver possesses a strong regeneration ability and the younger
Hung's liver will grow to its original size within six months, the
doctors said.</P>
      <P>This is NTUH's first successful live adult-to-adult liver
transplant among the nine liver transplants it has carried out. Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital, the first Taiwan hospital to complete a live

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
has told the Washington Post that he is confident he will be able to
deal with the "temporary doubts and concerns" caused by the current
political instability.</P>
      <P>In an article published Thursday in the Post and concurrently on
the front page of the International Herald Tribune, Chen is quoted as
saying in an interview conducted the previous day that his government
is not facing a crisis despite the crashing stock market, the divided
legislature and the sudden resignation of the premier, a member of
the opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>He also warned that mainland China has been playing at
divide-and-conquer with Taiwan's legislators, and he urged both
ruling and opposition party members to be cautious of such tactics.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has already invited about one-third of Taiwan's
legislators to visit Beijing in a bid to isolate Chen.</P>
      <P>"They are working very hard to sabotage the internal unity of
Taiwan, so this is something that we must be worried about," Chen
said. "We are concerned that some people and some groups here are
receptive to China's wooing and can't distinguish between friend and
foe."</P>
      <P>He urged the establishment of "a sense of friend and foe, a sense
of caution, and a sense of crisis."</P>
      <P>According to the Post, analysts are split about Chen's prospects,
and the KMT has been working to create the impression that political
chaos reigns on the island.</P>
      <P>However, the article went on to say that Legislator Parris Chang
of Chen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party is optimistic about the
change in premiership to someone with DPP roots.</P>
      <P>"This will help ensure that we have not abandoned our
principles," Chang said. "We should not abandon our roots."</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
thanked Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell Thursday for the
Caribbean nation's support of the ROC's bid to join various
international organizations such as the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Chen also thanked Mitchell for Grenada's voicing of support for
the ROC in the U.N., describing Mitchell as a leader with "one of the
world's greatest senses of justice." Chen added that he is touched by
such unwavering friendship.</P>
      <P>He noted that the two countries have remained close since
establishing diplomatic relations 11 years ago and that high-ranking
government officials exchange frequent visits. This being Mitchell's
fifth visit to Taiwan, Chen added that Mitchell should be able to
notice Taiwan's progress and development.</P>
      <P>Mitchell, who is in Taiwan to attend ROC National Day
celebrations on Oct. 10, exchanged opinions with Chen on issues
related to the Caribbean region and urged the ROC to strengthen
cooperative relations with the region.</P>
      <P>Chen assured Mitchell that all the cooperative projects and
agreements between the two countries will not be affected under his

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang official in charge
of the party's mainland China affairs claimed Thursday that the
change of Taiwan's premier will affect the future development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>But Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT Mainland Affairs
Department, said that the effect will be of a "hidden nature" and
that there will be no immediate worsening of bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks upon his return from a month-long visit to
the U.S. at the invitation of the Culture Department under the
American Institute in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked about the U.S. reaction to the change of premier, he said
that when President Chen Shui-bian named Tang Fei as premier last
May, it was lauded as a "wise move."</P>
      <P>"Now that Tang has gone," he went on, "there will not be a good
reaction."</P>
      <P>The KMT's mainland policy planner said that Tang, a former
defense minister under the KMT administration, had played a
significant role in helping stabilize cross-strait relations and the
military situation.</P>
      <P>Claiming that new Premier Chang Chun-hsiung is unable to display
these functions, he said that the government should "handle
cross-strait relations with great care in the future."</P>
      <P>Tang resigned from the premiership earlier this week, mainly
because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party insists on its
sticking to its policy of scrapping the on-going construction of the
island's fourth nuclear power plant, a policy with which Tang and his
party disagrees.</P>
      <P>Chang further claimed that this may cause new apprehension over
whether the DPP will also insist on its pro-Taiwan independence party
platform, although there has been no evidence to suggest that this
will be that case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE IN AFRICA WORRIES TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   5  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's campaign to increase its
diplomatic presence in Africa has set Taipei on edge, according to an
analysis by the Mainland Affairs Council released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Beijing's efforts, most recently represented by its call for a
forum in Beijing with the African states from Oct. 10-12, betrays its
ambitions to be the leader of the world's developing states and to
undermine or destroy Taipei's diplomatic relations with its eight
African allies, the analysis said.</P>
      <P>Pitching for a new international order and closer cooperation
between the People's Republic of China and the Dark Continent through
the discussion, Beijing has invited Taipei's eight allies to attend
the forum as observers, some of whom have agreed to participate.</P>
      <P>Beijing's promises to beef up its consultation with African
states on international issues on the basis of equality, mutual
respect for sovereignty, and reciprocity, sound attractive to certain
African states which are plagued by heavy foreign debts and low
international status.</P>
      <P>What most concerns Taiwan is the scenario that the forum, if
successful, could be institutionalized and gradually developed into a
full summit of African leaders which would boost Beijing's bid to be
the leader of the third world and accordingly curb Taiwan's
diplomatic activities in Africa, according to the MAC.</P>
      <P>Beijing's long-standing claim of holding an anti-hegemony
position and its claim of fiercely opposing power politics make it a
hero among many developing states in Africa, who rally behind Beijing
in the hope that it will speak out for their causes on the
international stage, said the MAC analysis.</P>
      <P>Along with the growth of its national strength, Beijing's
hoped-for role as point-man for the developing states might be
reinforced, warned the analysis.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never passed up any chance to shut Taiwan out of the
international community and its officials have always gone out their
way to make a case for Beijing's claim that "there is only one China
in the world and Taiwan is a part of it." It will certainly try to
use its leverage with African states to drive Taiwan out of the
continent, the analysis concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MISERY INDEX LOWEST IN ASIA: CENTRAL BANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Bank of China Governor
Perng Fai-nan said Thursday that the domestic misery index, measured
by adding the country's unemployment rate and its consumer price
inflation rate, ranks lowest among the major Asian countries.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, Taiwan's misery index reached only 4
percent, Perng said at the CBC's third-quarter board of directors
meeting.</P>
      <P>He added that this shows that Taiwan's overall economy is healthy
and that consumer prices are stable. Taiwan's misery index is
comparatively low even when measured against those of developed
countries, he said.</P>
      <P>Perng said at a press conference after the board meeting that
maintaining the stability of consumer prices is the foremost
responsibility of CBC. Other than doing its utmost to maintain
consumer price and currency exchange rate stability, he said that the
bank will also make efforts to promote economic growth.</P>
      <P>Within these operational parameters, he added, the board of
directors believes the best measure at the moment is for the bank to
maintain the current interest rate.</P>
      <P>Responding to whether the board of directors has recommended that
the CBC depreciate the local currency once and for all to increase
export competitiveness, Perng said that the foreign exchange market
often overreacts and that the directors did not make such a demand.</P>
      <P>In terms of consumer prices, Perng said that Taiwan's export
growth has reached as high as 24 percent. With the future accession
into the World Trade Organization and the future increased taxes on
tobacco and liquor, the consumer price index is expected to go up by
0.6 percent per year, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, if the price of international crude oil
remains at US$32 per barrel, then the domestic CPI should go up by
another 0.6 percent a year, bringing the total to approximately 1
percent. Therefore, the central bank must do its utmost to maintain
consumer price stability, he stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Shih Tsun-hua, the CBC's deputy director of economic
research, the first two quarters of this year marked strong
expansions in Taiwan's foreign trade, driving domestic demand and
allowing the economic growth rate to reach 6.68 percent.</P>
      <P>He went on to point out that the stock market plunge since April
has slowed down the domestic economy. However, he added that the
continued flourishing export industry, the uncertain private sector
investments, and the speeding up of post-quake reconstruction
projects in central Taiwan should be able to prop up the
third-quarter economic growth rate to 6.67 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet's Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting, and Statistics, this year's economic growth rate should
be approximately 6.57 percent, representing a "fairly good" domestic
economic situation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro published
Thursday that the people of Taiwan will not accept Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>The interview, conducted in Taipei at the end of last month, was
prominently carried on the paper's international page.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan is a democratic and sovereign
independent country whose residents espouse a variety of values.
Therefore, he said, the government must respect the people's will,
and he declined to define a conclusion on "China's future."</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the Taiwan people will never accept
the "one country, two systems" formula to become a second Hong Kong
or Macao, or a part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan and mainland China have reached no consensus on the
"one China" issue, he said that the two sides should move to find a
mutually-acceptable definition of "one China" through dialogue and on
the basis of the 1992 negotiations.</P>
      <P>In order to resolve the cross-Taiwan Strait problems at an early
date, Chen stated that Beijing and Taipei should start engaging in
negotiations now, otherwise the differences will not be overcome and
mutual misunderstandings may widen.</P>
      <P>On former President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition last year of the
current cross-strait ties as a "special state-to-state relationship,"
Chen said that if Beijing renounces the threat of force against
Taiwan, he will never write the "state-to-state theory" into the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's approval rate
plunged in various polls Thursday after former Premier Tang Fei
resigned.</P>
      <P>In a survey conducted by The China Times, more than 40 percent of

      <P>Chen's approval rate has dipped from 74 percent in April to 43
percent on Wednesday in a serious of surveys by the newspaper.</P>
      <P>In the polls conducted among more than 700 adults, the people who
disapproved with Chen's performance on the job outnumbered those who
approved of him 45 percent to 43 percent -- for the first time since
his swearing in May, said the China Times.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the poll gave Tang an approval rating of 73 percent,
similar to the rating at the end of August.</P>
      <P>Similar findings were found in a poll Thursday by the United
Daily News, which had Chen's approval rating at 42 percent against 45
percent before Tang resigned.</P>
      <P>That figure is equivalent to that of former President Lee
Teng-hui in 1999 when he was showing signs of political wear and tear
after ten years in the presidency.</P>
      <P>Tang's quitting has also taken its toll on Chen's Democratic

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government has never demanded
that Taiwan complete the fourth nuclear power plant project nor that
it scrap it, said Darryl Johnson, deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs Thursday.</P>
      <P>He did add that the U.S. government does of course have normal
concerns that the contract provisions concerning the project are
fulfilled because it is the government's responsibility to safeguard
the interests of U.S. businesses.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the contract provisions should be addressed,
however, is a matter for the parties concerned to work out, he said
during a cocktail party after the ROC-U.S. sub-Cabinet meeting
wrapped up.</P>
      <P>Johnson categorically denied rumors that certain U.S. companies
have tried to exert pressure on Taiwan through the U.S. government
and have even threatened that Taiwan may risk losing weapons
acquisitions from the United States if the project is discontinued.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement
expressing its stance on Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant project.
The readout said: "Whether to continue the fourth nuclear power plant
is a decision for the Taiwanese authorities to make. The U.S.
government's major concern is that the contract provisions which were
mutually agreed upon in the past are fulfilled."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu, chief Taiwan
negotiator to the fifth ROC-U.S. sub-Cabinet economic dialogue, said
matters concerning the fourth nuclear power plant project were not
discussed during the one-day meeting.</P>
      <P>Lin mentioned, however, that officials from the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) did visit the Ministry of Economic Affairs
and expressed their concerns about the fulfillment of contracts
signed between U.S. companies and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But AIT officials said that the U.S. government will not
intervene whether the nuclear power plant project is continued or
scrapped, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the United States Chen Chien-jen, who
headed the Taiwan delegation to the meeting, reiterated that neither
AIT Chairman Richard Bush nor the U.S. government has formally
expressed concerns to him about the possible discontinuing of the
project.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By N. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Canadian scientists who visited Taiwan
soon after last year's Sept. 21 earthquake and have been following
the island's recovery efforts said Thursday that Taiwan now has one
of the world's best seismic research systems.</P>
      <P>Dr. Guy Felio and Dr. David Lau also praised Taiwan's government
and research community for making all earthquake data available to
the world and for being willing to help other countries benefit from
the knowledge they acquired from the earthquake, which killed 2,320
people and injured about 8,000 others.</P>
      <P>One of the direct beneficiaries is British Columbia, Canada's
most earthquake-prone province. Felio said that Vancouver's municipal
government and the B.C. provincial government have adopted his team's
recommendations on seismic risk evaluation on public buildings based
on the data collected from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ching-cheng Kuan, information director of the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office in Canada, said that in the aftermath of
the 1999 earthquake, Taiwan established an emergency response team
"that stands ready to assist others in time of need."</P>
      <P>The three were speaking at the "Update on Taiwan Earthquake: One
Year Later" seminar sponsored by the TECO's information division.
Kuan used the opportunity to thank Canada for providing timely cash,
medical, and technical assistance to help in Taiwan's relief work.</P>
      <P>Carleton University Civil Engineering Professor David Lau, a
mission member, said the Chi-Chi earthquake produced 400 records that
are very useful for seismic and construction studies.</P>
      <P>With more than 600 monitoring stations around the island as well
as rich resources and top-notch facilities, Taiwan's National
Earthquake Center has made a significant impact on reducing the
hazards in future quakes, he said.</P>

farewell and changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>Composed and peaceful, Tang delivered a short speech thanking

together.</P>
      <P>Tang, an air force pilot-turned official who served in the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over the
swearing-in ceremony of new Cabinet members and other top government
officials, including Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and Secretary-General
to the President Yu Shyi-kun, at the Presidential Office Friday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet underwent a partial reshuffle after the resignation
of Tang Fei as premier Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>The new and old government agency heads faced the national flag
and a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of modern China, to
give their oath of dedication to serving the nation and the people.</P>
      <P>The swearing-in ceremony was witnessed by Vice President Annette
Lu, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Judicial Yuan President
Weng Yueh-sheng, Examination Minister Hsu Shui-teh, Control Yuan
President Frederick Chien, National Security Council Secretary
General Chuang Ming-yao, as well as two deputy secretary-generals to
President Chen Tze-nan and Eugene Chien.</P>
      <P>Following the ceremony, the new premier and the outgoing premier
held another changeover ceremony at the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he accepted the new mandate with a guarded
attitude and expressed the hope that the opposition parties could
forego their past rivalries to work together for the benefit of the
nation, adding that political stability and economic development will
be the top priorities of the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Another two changeover ceremonies were held at the Government
Information Office and the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>Su Cheng-ping, editor of the Taiwan Daily News, replaced Chung

step up the publicity campaign internationally so that foreign
countries are more aware of Taiwan's achievements.</P>
      <P>Vice Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang took over as new Finance

    <HEADLINE>NEW PREMIER PITCHES FOR NORMAL, PEACEFUL CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Friday
he earnestly hopes that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can forge
a normal, peaceful relationship.</P>
      <P>Chang made the call in a speech delivered at the inaugural
ceremony for an inter-party parliamentarian association aimed at
protecting the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwanese investors
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang, the Republic of China's first premier from the young
Democratic Progressive Party, said he is very pleased to see the
formation of the new non-partisan group to help promote benefits of
Taiwanese investors on the mainland.</P>
      <P>"This is a good omen of inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation as legislators from across the political spectrum have
now found a common cause regarding the sensitive cross-strait policy
-- protecting the rights of our investors," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang, himself a six-term legislator before joining President
Chen Shui-bian's administration, added that he looks forward to
seeing the new group succeed in realizing its goals.</P>
      <P>Chang, now Taiwan's third most powerful leader, further said he
hopes Beijing can resume dialogue with Taiwan as early as possible
to facilitate the development of a normal, peaceful cross-strait
relationship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, which
charts Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, said the latest partial
Cabinet reshuffle will have little impact on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The basic tone and axis of our policy on cross-strait relations,
outlined in President Chen's May 20 inaugural speech, will remain
intact in the wake of the minor Cabinet shakeup," said MAC Vice
Chairman Lin Chong-pin.</P>
      <P>Noting that the top goal of the DPP government's mainland policy
is to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait, Lin said the
Cabinet's personnel adjustment will not change this fundamental
policy goal.</P>
      <P>"Since the axis of our cross-strait policy remains the same, we
don't think mainland China will change its basic attitude toward
cross-strait relations simply because of our Cabinet reshuffle," Lin
explained.</P>
      <P>Lin also renewed his call on mainland china to resume
interaction and consultations between Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation and Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait with a view to resolving problems through dialogue.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung on Friday formally took over the premiership
from Tang Fei, who resigned Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Because Chang has temporarily withdrawn the government's budget

asked that a subsidy for the elderly be included in the new budget,
the new Cabinet has returned to square one on the budget issue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six mainland Chinese fishing boats and 15
people aboard were nabbed Friday for conducting illegal "small scale"
transactions with Kinmen locals, the Kinmen Coastal Patrol Squad
reported.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen coastal patrol forces, which have stepped up patrols
in recent months due to the increasingly rampant illegal trade in
waters near Kinmen, discovered a cluster of mainland Chinese fishing
boats lingering around Chiunglin Bay in northern Kinmen and managed
to nab six of them before they dispersed.</P>
      <P>The boats, remodeled from oyster collecting boats, were found
full of agricultural products and bamboo handicraft originating from
the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen coastal patrol forces even found that several of the
15 mainland Chinese people were "faces familiar" to them, indicating
that some had already made illegal cross-strait trade their regular
way of making a living.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chin-lung, an official with the Kinmen Red Cross Society, who
rushed to the coastal patrol squad headquarters to learn more about
the latest development, urged the mainland Chinese people to refrain
from conducting illegal trade since the so-called "mini direct links"
-- direct trade, transport, and communications links between the
ROC's outlying posts of Kinmen and Matsu and mainland China -- have
not been officially approved yet.</P>
      <P>After being interrogated and receiving a punishment notice, the
15 mainland Chinese citizens were ordered to take their vessels and
leave Kinmen waters.</P>
      <P>According to the Kinmen coastal patrol authority, mainland
Chinese citizens have become increasingly daring and active in recent
months, sailing to Kinmen to conduct illegal "small scale" trade with
the Kinmen locals.</P>
      <P>This "small scale" trade activity is so easy and widespread that
some Kinmen-based travel agencies have even incorporated it into
their tourist itineraries for visitors from Taiwan. If a tourist is
interested in taking a look at the illegal trade, the travel agency
simply makes a phone call, and within half an hour, mainland fishing
boats arrive at a predetermined spot where the tourists are not only
entertained by watching the transactions, but can also make purchases
of their own.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Friday
ruled out the possibility of the U.S. government interfering with
Taiwan's decision on the fate of the controversial fourth nuclear
power plant project.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said as the project is purely the
Republic of China's domestic affair, the U.S. executive branch is
unlikely to interfere with Taiwan's decision-making procedure
regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government will fully respect our decision on the
project," Chen stressed, adding that if Taiwan finally decides to
scrap the project, it will faithfully fulfill its obligations to
compensate the U.S. supplier of the nuclear power generation
equipment in line with the contract provisions mutually agreed upon
in the past.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks echoed a U.S. State Department readout issued on
Wednesday, which said: "Whether to continue the fourth nuclear power
plant project is a decision for the Taiwanese authorities to make.
The U.S. government's major concern is that the contract provisions
which were agreed upon in the past are fulfilled."</P>

      <P>But Johnson stressed that the U.S. government does have normal

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS `STONE' METAPHOR REFERRED TO DPP ITSELF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian took the initiative
to explain that the "stone" in his comment that "the stone has been
removed from the path" of his four-month-old government actually
referred to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) itself and
not to any specific person.</P>
      <P>The president's "stone" metaphor on Thursday immediately drew
widespread speculation as to what he was actually referring to.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang said the president was referring to
outgoing Premier Tang Fei, who as a former defense minister and a
veteran member of the Kuomintang was invited to head the Cabinet in
May. Many believe Tang did not resign due to "health reasons" as
stated, but was in fact forced to resign over his support for the
continued construction of the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The DPP, trying to assuage public misgivings about the
president's remarks, said that the metaphor actually referred to the
shedding of an old system and old burdens of the past.</P>
      <P>The president therefore said the "stone" actually referred to the
party itself, adding that the DPP as a ruling party has to take more
responsibility now.</P>
      <P>The president's "stone" remark was hotly debated in the
Legislative Yuan Friday, with the KMT legislators lamenting the fate
of Tang turning from a "gem to a stone."</P>
      <P>Legislators from the People First Party said sarcastically that
the president himself is the biggest stone on the road and that if
the political situation turns from bad to worse, then the 22 million
people on Taiwan may decide one day to remove Chen from the political
scene.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu said that the KMT would not take the
opportunity to speak ill of Chen during his present difficulties, but
added that more gaffes from the president will backfire someday.</P>
      <P>On the KMT's assessment of the new Cabinet, Hu said that it has
taken the political situation into consideration even less than the
previous Cabinet did, adding that the personnel changes occurred
without consultations with the legislature or even with the DPP
itself and was a "worrisome" development.</P>
      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, a long-term veteran of the DPP, formally took
over as premier Friday, thereby signifying a step away from President
Chen's professed goal of setting up a broad-based government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC, U.S. CALL FOR TAIWAN'S WTO ENTRY BY YEAR'S END</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  5   (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China and the United
States expressed their common hope Thursday that Taiwan can become a
member of the World Trade Organization by the end of 2000.</P>
      <P>The appeal for Taiwan's early WTO accession was outlined in a
joint press statement issued at the conclusion of the Fifth
Subcabinet-Level Economic Dialogue between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the two sides met at the U.S. Department of
the Treasury to exchange views and consider future areas of
cooperation on a broad range of bilateral and regional issues
affecting the economic, financial, trade and investment relations
between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>As the two countries do not maintain formal diplomatic ties, the
one-day meeting was held under the auspices of the American
Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office (TECRO) in the United States.</P>
      <P>Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu and Timothy F. Geithner, under
secretary of the treasury for international affairs, served as chief
ROC and U.S. negotiators, respectively.</P>
      <P>During the morning session, Lin and Geithner delivered
reports on trends and developments in the U.S. and Taiwan economies
as well as the outlook for Asia. In the afternoon session, the
participants were divided into three groups for discussion on three
subjects -- banking and finance, trade, and law enforcement.</P>
      <P>In the financial panel discussion, Taiwan's efforts to modernize
its financial system and to become a regional financial center were
recognized. The two sides also discussed the merits of allowing
market forces to play a greater role in the determination of the
exchange rate and stock prices in Taiwan, the importance of adequate
regulation and supervision, prospects for greater participation by
foreign-owned financial service firms in Taiwan, particularly in
asset management.</P>
      <P>In the trade sector discussion, the United States asked Taiwan
to make an unequivocal commitment that it will indeed abide by its
WTO commitment to liberalize fully its telecommunication market as
of July1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the United States recognized Taiwan's ongoing efforts
to strengthen its protection of intellectual property rights, but
noted the need for the adoption, implementation, and enforcement of
an effective optical media law that controls copyright piracy at the
manufacturing source by strictly regulating optical disc
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan raised several sanitary and phytosanitary issues affecting
Taiwan's agricultural exports to the United States. Both sides
agreed to further discuss relevant trade issues at the next
bilateral meeting to be held under the Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement.</P>
      <P>During the subcabinet-level meeting, the two sides also explored
the potential for greater cooperation and coordination on combating
international financial crimes and curbing Internet crimes. Such
cooperation and coordination will include possible mutual visits and
training programs.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lin Yi-fu, members of the ROC delegation also
included Vice Finance Minister Sean C. Chen, Central Bank of
China Deputy Governor Chen Shih-meng and Ho Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>The annual subcabinet economic meeting is the highest-level
official dialogue mechanism between Taiwan and the United States in
the absence of formal diplomatic ties. It takes place alternately in
Taipei and Washington, D.C.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC V.P. PLEASED WITH BETTER U.S. TREATMENT DURING RECENT TRANSITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Friday that she was pleased to have achieved several
breakthroughs during the U.S. stopovers on her recent "journey of
soft power diplomacy" to four of the ROC's allies in Central America.</P>
      <P>Lu, who returned Wednesday from her first overseas trip since
becoming vice president, said at a press conference that her stops in
the United States were marked by numerous "major breakthroughs,"
especially compared to ROC President Chen Shui-bian's transit in
August.</P>
      <P>She cited the facts that she was allowed to stop in three cities
instead of just one and was treated like a head of state, with a new
limousine to welcome her at the airport. She added that overseas
Chinese leaders, U.S. Congressional representatives and academics
were all allowed to meet with her.</P>
      <P>She went on to criticize the U.S. government's "rudeness" during
Chen's Aug. 13 stopover in Los Angeles on his way to the Dominican
Republic. She said that it was this treatment of Chen that made her
particularly concerned about her own transit, which led to the
improved treatment.</P>
      <P>Chen's short hop from Los Angeles International Airport to his
nearby hotel was delayed by 25 minutes because of engine problems of
his limousine arranged by the United States.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chen was not allowed to meet with U.S. Congress
members or any U.S. officials other than American Institute in Taiwan
Chairman Richard Bush. Nevertheless, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Cal)
called on Chen in defiance of a publicly announced U.S. State
Department objection to any such meetings with Chen during his
16-hour transit stop.</P>
      <P>Lu said that every successful U.S. transit would lay the
foundation for the next one, adding that Taipei cannot show too much
weakness, for fear that others will "dig deeply into the soft soil."</P>
      <P>She also noted that U.S. treatment of the ROC president also
triggered the concern of many U.S. congressmen. She said that she
hopes they will urge the next U.S. administration, to be sworn into
office in January, to improve Washington's treatment of senior ROC
officials during transits on U.S. soil.</P>
      <P>Lu also thanked the four countries she had visited -- El
Salvador, Honduras, Belize, and Guatemala -- for continuing to voice
their support for the ROC in the United Nations. She added that the
only reason Taiwan still cannot rejoin the world-governing body is
mainland China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Lu also praised former Premier Tang Fei, a retired air force
general, as being "a learned military man," adding that it was a
shame he belonged to a different political party and was in poor
health. Tang was succeeded by incumbent Vice Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung in a formal inauguration ceremony Friday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The watchdog Control Yuan passed a
resolution Friday to impeach Pan Hsi-hsien, a former personnel
department chief of the National Security Bureau, for his impairment
to national security.</P>
      <P>The impeachment proposal was broached by Control Yuan members
Huang Wu-tse and Kang Ning-hsiang and passed by a vote of 12-1.</P>
      <P>The resolution accused Pan of lacking consciousness of mainland
China's hostility toward Taiwan and having acted recklessly to
hurt Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that Pan filed an application for mainland
China's "Taiwan compatriot certificate" when he was still working
with the NSB.</P>
      <P>Noting that the move was part of Pan's preparations for visiting
mainland China, the resolution said Pan left for the mainland
shortly after his retirement from the NSB.</P>
      <P>According to current Republic of China regulations, a
retired civil servant must apply for a government approval of his
or her mainland travel plan if he or she has not yet retired for
three years.</P>
      <P>The resolution said it is very regrettable that Pan, a
high-ranking security official in charge of mainland
China-related intelligence affairs, has failed to abide by
such travel rules aimed at protecting national security.</P>
      <P>The resolution suggested that the Committee on the Discipline of
Public Functionaries mete out the maximum harsh penalty on Pan in
accordance with current law.</P>
      <P>Pan has been taken into custody by mainland Chinese
security authorities since local media reported his travel activities
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Following Pan's detention on the mainland, the NSB reportedly has
changed its communication codes with its agents stationed abroad
in a remedy measure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. INTENDS TO TRANSFER NUKE WASTE MANAGEMENT TECH TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Energy has shown that
it intends to transfer nuclear waste processing and storage
technology to Taiwan, as it sent a special aid to Taiwan recently to
learn about related developments here.</P>
      <P>C.K. Chou, a special assistant at the U.S. Department of Energy
and director of the Fission Energy &amp; Systems Safety Program under the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, visited Taiwan over the past
several days meeting officials from the Cabinet-level Atomic Energy
Council as well as Taiwan Power Co., owner of the
temporarily-suspended fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Although the U.S. government has continuously insisted that it
will not interfere in Taiwan's decision to uphold or scrap the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant project and is only
concerned that "private" contracts previously signed are fulfilled,
Chou's low-profile visit to Taiwan calls Washington's neutrality on
the issue into question.</P>
      <P>Chou, in Taiwan to assist in U.S. and Japanese nuclear waste
management technology transfers, said he was shocked to learn that
Taiwan's natural gas reserves are only sufficient to provide the
island with power for 14 days, while 36 percent of the island's
electricity is already natural gas-generated, and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs has proposed to increase that ratio.</P>
      <P>Chou, who departed for the United States Friday after spending
the previous days exchanging opinions with Taiwan, Korean and
Japanese nuclear experts, noted that the three countries have very
similar environments, with a marked lack of natural resources.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that Japan already has 53 nuclear reactors with
four being constructed, and that South Korea has 16 nuclear reactors
with four being built and another eight planned for operations by
2015.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he noted, Taiwan currently has three working
nuclear power plants, while the fourth is approximately 30 percent
complete.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been garnering
support to scrap the fourth plant midway into its construction, while
opposition parties have been largely opposed to the idea. The plant
is designed to run two U.S. General Electric reactors.</P>
      <P>Chou said before his departure that the main object of his Taiwan
trip was to promote U.S. and Japanese nuclear waste management
technology transfers in the hope that an international nuclear waste
disposal research center can be established, so as to allow nuclear
power consuming countries like Taiwan to run their own "geologic
repositories."</P>
      <P>The U.S. government is reportedly not only concerned about
whether the GE contract is fulfilled, but is also worried that
Taiwan's anti-nuclear power sentiment will become an issue that
requires a plebiscite to decide. This is seen as likely to trigger
new tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Washington political observers believe that the last thing
Beijing would like to see is Taiwan holding plebiscites to decide on
major national issues. A plebiscite on the fourth nuclear power plant
project is seen as the possible precursor to another plebiscite to
decide the Taiwan independence issue.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that

      <P>Chen said as long as a person persists and never gives up, a

if one wants to; and similarly, one can always find excuses and

executive secretary-general of Life Line International, at the
Presidential Office. Thonell is currently on a business tour in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that on the road to becoming a society of
modern citizens, Taiwan needs at least three vital factors in its
social fabric -- humanity, knowledge and volunteer work.</P>
      <P>"We were all left with vivid impressions of the voluntary work
that was driven by simple compassion in the wake of the devastating

    <DATELINE>Chiang  Rai,  northern  Thailand, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven legislators
from the Republic of China on Friday expressed the hope that the
government of Thailand will continue to offer equal treatment to
former ROC soldiers and their families residing in the mountainous
areas of northern Thailand.</P>
      <P>A batch of ROC soldiers entered northern Thailand in the early
1950s, after the Kuomintang government was defeated in the civil war
with the Chinese Communists and retreated to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Most of the ROC soldiers settled in the mountains of northern
Thailand at the time, and have since become naturalized Thai
citizens.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the legislative delegation at a dinner with
Chiang Rai Provincial Governor Samrerng Poonyopakorn, Legislator
Hsiao Chin-lan thanked the Thai government for its treatment of the
former ROC soldiers and their families, and said he hopes that the
legislators' visit will further promote understanding and cooperation
between the Thai and Chinese peoples.</P>
      <P>In turn, Gov. Samrerng said that there are many minority ethnic
groups in Chiang Rai province, and they are all offered equal
treatment by the Thai government. The ROC veterans and their families
have been especially well-treated, and most of them have been
naturalized as citizens of Thailand, he noted.</P>
      <P>Former Gen. Chen Mao-hsiu, a representative of the ROC veterans
in Thailand, thanked the 11 ROC legislators for their visit, and
praised Samrerng for his achievements as head of Chiang Rai province.</P>
      <P>The 11 ROC legislators are traveling from Chiang Rai province to
Mae Haun Saun province to visit former ROC soldiers and their
families. They are scheduled to fly to Bangkok on Oct. 9, where they
will attend a reception organized by the ROC representative office in
Thailand to celebrate the ROC's National Day on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>They are scheduled to depart for Taipei on Oct. 11.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The downfall of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic this week is being closely watched by his
supporters in Beijing, as Europe's last dictator was swept away by a
democratic election, indicating that the clock is ticking for
politically inflexible regimes that are reliant on nationalism.</P>
      <P>In an analytical article, The Australian Financial Review noted
that when a NATO missile hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade during
the war against Serbia last year, a propaganda campaign was unleashed
in China portraying Milosevic as the champion of his people against
cruel Western imperialists.</P>
      <P>With Milosevic cowering in a bunker and Serbian cities crammed
with people celebrating his downfall, Zhongnanhai must be aware that
it has backed another loser, as it did with other "people's heroes"
such as Pol Pot and Ceausescu, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The daily noted President Jiang Zemin's determination to rebuild
his party's popularity through nationalism, and to carve his own name
in history as the Great Unifier of China. "Taiwan -- the jewel in the
crown following the Pearl River pearls, Hong Kong and Macau, flies in
the face of today's pluralistic trends," the paper said.</P>
      <P>Chinese people, like the Yugoslavs, experienced too much in the
20th century to keep trusting cadres, mandarins or tsars to do their
talking or their decision making for them for ever, the daily said.</P>
      <P>They want a say in their future, they are well acquainted with
what happens when others decide for them, it added.</P>
      <P>The daily noted the Soviet Union survived for 70 years before
imploding. "Can the People's Republic of China outlast it?" the paper
asked.</P>

      <P>Ticket sales for the 2000 Paralympic Games
are booming, and only about 2000 tickets remain unsold for the
opening ceremony on October 18, according to the games organizers.</P>
      <P>The 2000 tickets to the opening ceremony have trickled back to

be A-category seats, and about 87,000 seats are available to the
public, they said.</P>
      <P>The tickets for the finals of the men's and women's wheelchair
basketball matches have already been sold out, and tickets for all
swimming events have also sold out, they said.</P>
      <P>The organizers originally expected to sell a total of 650,000
tickets and to sell out both the opening and closing ceremonies to
reach their US$10 million sales target, they said. But they
discovered that demand was better than expected, and they have
already raised US$9.7 million from ticket sales, with most of the
sales going to schools and concession holders, they noted.</P>
      <P>More than 4000 athletes from 125 countries will compete in the

    <HEADLINE>S&amp;P AFFIRMS TAIWAN'S AA+/A-1+ RATINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Standard &amp; Poor's affirmed its AA+ long-term
and A-1+ short-term issuer credit ratings for Taiwan in a report from
Singapore Friday and announced that the outlook on Taiwan's long-term
ratings remains stable.</P>
      <P>The ratings apply to both foreign and local currency obligations.</P>
      <P>S&amp;P cited progressive democratization as a force heralding a
"revolutionary transformation" of the island's political and
institutional makeup. The report went on to say that the changes
could reduce some of the "murky links" between government and
businesses.</P>
      <P>However, S&amp;P also warned that the new government is faced with
fewer political and economic resources. With the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party still a minority in the legislature, S&amp;P predicted
that there may be short-term turmoil during the transition period.</P>
      <P>The international ratings agency added that failure to control
the national deficit, overcome policy and legislative paralyses --
including the passing of the next budget -- and address contingent
risks could impair economic growth prospects, the fiscal balance
sheet, and subsequently, Taiwan's creditworthiness.</P>
      <P>According to S&amp;P, Taiwan's ratings are bolstered by factors such
as a strong external balance sheet, ample international liquidity,
and an "innovative" and "robust" export-oriented economy.</P>
      <P>The ratings agency report stated that Taiwan's "negligible"
external public-sector debt and high external net asset position,
estimated to be at least 70 percent of its exports in 2000, both
surpass the medians for both AA and AAA rated countries.</P>
      <P>In terms of international liquidity, S&amp;P said Taiwan's huge
foreign exchange reserves -- surpassed only by Japan and mainland
China -- was also a factor in support of the agency's ratings.
Taiwan's reserves are expected to reach US$115 billion by the end of
the year, exceeding short-term external debt by more than 400
percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing flexibility, especially in the electronics
and information technology sectors, as well as an abundance of
"nimble" small- and medium-sized firms, also help sustain economic
and employment growth, according to S&amp;P.</P>
      <P>Negative factors cited by the agency as constraining Taiwan's
ratings were political and economic "vulnerabilities" posed by
Taiwan's relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>S&amp;P predicted that cross-strait relations are likely to remain
uncertain in the face of mainland China's demands for reunification.
This may result in increased tensions, S&amp;P added, "but the risk of
armed conflict remains low."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stable outlook balances Taiwan's good growth prospects,
external flexibility, and prospects for improved government
transparency and accountability against potential weaknesses in
fiscal strength, S&amp;P indicated in its report.</P>
      <P>Continuous fiscal deficits, which have averaged 4.4 percent in
the past decade and may persist for the next few years, are causing a
deterioration in the government's net creditor position, S&amp;P added.</P>
      <P>"Fiscal flexibility is hamstrung by an antiquated tax system and
political pledges against tax hikes on the revenue side, and high
spending pressures, especially social and economic, on the
expenditure," stated the credit agency.</P>
      <P>"Fiscal pressures could also increase from contingent liability
resulting from the high private-sector leverage, and the government's
propensity to support financial institutions and the asset markets,"
S&amp;P added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines
have raised their opposition to an Australian plan to merge the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area and the
Australia New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement,
resulting in an abrupt end to the wider free trade alliance.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Chiang Mai, Thailand, The Australian Financial
Review on Saturday reported that the opposition by the three ASEAN
members was a blow to Australian hopes of making progress on an
ambitious plan to merge the 10 ASEAN countries and Australia and New
Zealand into a single market of 530 million people, with an annual
gross domestic product of about US$1.1 trillion.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA, Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile
nevertheless said that Australia has taken an important step towards
closer economic integration with Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>"Ministers agreed to work towards a Closer Economic Partnership
linking the 10 ASEAN countries, Australia and New Zealand," Vaile
said.</P>
      <P>But the Review reported that Australia's ambitious plan was
scuttled on Friday at a meeting of ASEAN economic ministers in Chiang
Mai, which adopted a Malaysian initiative to weaken the Australian
proposal.</P>
      <P>The watered-down proposal is concerned with "technical assistance
and capacity building measures," and is not as broad as the one
proposed by Australia, the daily reported.</P>

      <P>Mainland China's ambitious effort to
bolster economic growth by boosting domestic consumption with
"holiday economics" are not working out, mainly due to the lack of
support from Chinese consumers.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Hong Kong, The Australian Financial Review

the break to travel in early October, but figures from the past few
days indicate that their holiday destinations have been fairly close

      <P>Meanwhile, the Review quoted the China Daily as revealing that
only 23,000 people had visited the Great Wall at Badaling, near
Beijing, on Sunday. This was less than half the site's daily tourism
capacity.</P>
      <P>China has been trying to boost consumption levels over the past
year by extending its three main holidays in the belief that the

      <P>Canada will lift economic and trade
sanctions against Yugoslavia and work to help the country get back on
its feet, Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Chretien made the statement after learning that former Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic had conceded defeat and that
president-elect Vojislav Kostunica will take power.</P>
      <P>"First I would like to say that I have just sent a letter to the
new president of Yugoslavia -- President Kostunica -- and I offered
my congratulations to him and offered my best wishes," Chretien said
during a brief visit to Edmonton, Alberta.</P>
      <P>Milosevic started and lost four wars in the Balkans during his 13
years in power, and sanctions imposed by the United Nations, Canada,
the United States and Europe have left much of Yugoslavia
impoverished and isolated.</P>
      <P>Some of those controls were eased after Milosevic signed the 1995
agreement to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, other
sanctions were imposed again in 1998 after Milosevic launched a

    <HEADLINE>TANG'S DEPARTURE INDICATES BEIJING'S IMPOTENCE REGARDING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent resignation of Tang Fei from the
Republic of China's premiership highlights Beijing's impotence in
dealing with Taiwan-related affairs, according to The Economist
magazine.</P>
      <P>The London-based weekly said although Tang's departure from
Taiwan's political scene may bring Beijing some anxiety, the event is
not expected to have an immediate impact on relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the weekly said, Tang's surprise resignation
earlier this week seems to have made mainland Chinese leaders better
understand their impotence concerning Taiwan-related affairs.</P>
      <P>According to The Economist, mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said at a Beidaihe policy review meeting in August that he
felt frustrated with the ineffectiveness of mainland China's policy
strategy toward Taiwan over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The weekly further said Beijing leaders seem to have come to
terms with the cold reality that mainland China's military
muscle will not be strong enough to swallow Taiwan in the next few
years and that during this period mainland China can only
endeavor to deepen trade and economic relations with Taiwan
to prevent the island from drifting further away.</P>
      <P>Tang, a four-star general-turned-politician and a senior member
of the long-ruling Kuomintang, had helped stabilize Taiwan's
domestic political situation and cross-strait relations
following the island's first-ever transition of administrative power
from the KMT to the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party in
May.</P>
      <P>The Economist said Tang's resignation indicates that President
Chen Shui-bian's drive to run "a government of all people" has
failed. As the ROC constitution has not clearly defined the powers of
the president, the premier and the parliament, the British weekly
predicted that Tang's abrupt departure will bring Taiwan a period of
"political uncertainty."</P>
      <P>The weekly also said the KMT will very likely try to block the
DPP government's economic reforms and even boycott its budgetary plan
to undermine President Chen's credibility.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's booming two-way trade showed no
signs of slowing down in September, thanks to continued economic
growth in the United States and Europe, the Asian recovery, and
strong domestic demand, sources from the Ministry of Finance said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$12.95 billion worth of products in September,
up 22 percent over the same month of the previous year, and the
third-largest single month export figure in Taiwan's history, the MOF
officials said.</P>
      <P>In the same month, Taiwan imported US$11.78 billion worth of
commodities, an increase of 28 percent over the year-earlier level,
they added.</P>
      <P>September's monthly trade surplus of US$1.17 billion exceeded the
US$1 billion mark, the first time since last December that this has
been achieved, the MOF officials noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's total foreign trade exceeded the US$100
billion mark during the first three quarters of this year, an
indication of the island's strong competitiveness in world trade, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>If two-way trade remains brisk in the last three months of 2000
-- usually the high season for exports -- and monthly foreign trade
figures average US$13.60 billion during the last quarter, this year's
annual growth of imports and exports will reach 30.8 percent and 24
percent, respectively, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they stressed that there are several negative
factors that could adversely impact the country's foreign trade,
including recent economic and political instability -- which is
poised to rattle investor confidence and consumer spending -- coupled
with increasingly higher international oil prices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS VOICE SUPPORT FOR REPORTER ACCUSED BY MILITARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers across the political spectrum on
Saturday voiced their support for a local newspaper reporter who has
been accused by the Defense Ministry Friday of revealing military
secrets.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, the legislators criticized the military
for being "absurd" in denying the content of the reporter's article
while using the same report to prosecute him.</P>
      <P>Hung Che-cheng, a Power Daily reporter, was accused by military
prosecutors of attempting to pry into national secrets, an offense
that carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Hung was investigated for writing a story on the eve of President
Chen Shui-bian's May 20 inauguration that three Beijing warships were
spotted within 30 nautical miles of Suao Harbor in northeastern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He was spared a court martial because he is a civilian, and was
instead sent to Taiwan High Court prosecutors for indictment on the
criminal charges. He was also subpoenaed by the military court to
serve as a witness.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that the military's accusation may be difficult for the
public to accept, because digging up news and "reporting the truth"
is a duty that the media cannot shirk. He urged the military to
reconsider whether the reports in question are serious enough to be
prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the majority opposition Kuomintang
noted that the recent series of searches and indictments is "not a
coincidence," adding that the new government may be using the
opportunity to intimidate the local media, which has traditionally
been aggressive.</P>
      <P>Hung's indictment was the second high-profile case within a week
in which the press has run afoul of the judiciary for its coverage of
military scandals.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, the office of the mass-circulated China Times Express
was searched by prosecutors for publishing transcripts of a
deposition given by two military officers on the corruption of an
army colonel at the National Security Bureau. Also searched were the
homes of two of the paper's journalists.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, leading a group of police, swooped in on the
China Times Express office Tuesday morning in a vain attempt to seize
a copy of the deposition, which they billed as "secret," claiming
that its leakage would put the pursuit of the scandal in peril.</P>
      <P>Regarding the more recent case, Legislator Lee Ching-an of the
opposition People First Party questioned whether the military was
attempting to cover up the truth when it made its accusations based
on a report whose accuracy it had denied.</P>
      <P>Speaking for the military at the press conference, military judge
Hsiao Fu-ming said that "nobody said Hung was guilty," but only that
he "was suspected of a crime." Hsiao added that only the judicial
system will be able to determine whether Hung is guilty.</P>
      <P>Deputy director Liu Chih-chien of the military spokesman's office
reasserted that the military had not discovered any mainland Chinese
warship activity outside of Suao Harbor prior to President Chen's May
20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's National Press Council urged the executive
and legislative branches of the government to define the reasonable
limits of "national security" and "divulging secrets" in order to
allow the media to enjoy its press freedom under the principle of
self-regulation.</P>
      <P>The NPC also questioned how Hung could be indicted over "prying
into national secrets" if his report had been false, as the military
had immediately moved to deny its accuracy.</P>
      <P>Because the ethics of journalism demand that sources remain

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T SHOULD IMPROVE EFFICIENCY IN POST-DISASTER RECONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts and academics at a Saturday
symposium on post-quake reconstruction urged the central and local
governments to improve their coordination and efficiency in
delivering disaster relief and settlement assistance, as well as
pursuing reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh noted that although some
observers have said that clearing away the current chaos is
"something that only God can do," the minute he walked into a region
hit hard by last year's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake, he
"discovered that God has already done a lot, and the rest is what we
have to do."</P>
      <P>Lee, a Nobel laureate who serves concurrently as the convener of
the National Public Sector Post-Disaster Reconstruction Alliance,
went on to say that everyone should do their best to remove the
metaphorical "stones," adding that the thing to be feared the most
would be to discover that "we ourselves are the big stones" that
block progress.</P>
      <P>Chu Hai-yuen, vice convener of the alliance, said that the
function of the Cabinet's own post-quake reconstruction committee is
unclear. He added that minority peoples living in the disaster region
have not been sufficiently cared for, the legal system is inadequate
for the task, and the participation of the public in the
establishment of reconstruction policies has also been insufficient.</P>
      <P>Chu questioned the efficiency of all levels of government, adding
that the local government's performance particularly was "not quite
ideal" in all areas, including disaster relief, assistance for people
who need new dwellings after their homes were destroyed, and ongoing
reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>He noted that local governments have also had problems with
embezzlement, referring to a case where relief items were discovered
in the home of a local official.</P>
      <P>Chu went on to say that the different levels of government also
have a "serious problem" with communicating and cooperating with each
other, and have therefore come up with very few objective and
constructive suggestions.</P>
      <P>He urged a simplification of the administrative process and the
establishment of a supervision system to ensure that waste and
overlapping of budgets for the reconstruction do not occur.</P>
      <P>At the same symposium, members of reconstruction teams from the
disaster regions did not entirely agree with the "Taipei viewpoints"
and the "professional perspectives," insisting that the voice of the
people living in those regions should be heeded.</P>
      <P>The team members pointed out that although planning is important,
people in the disaster regions face the immediate issues of shelter,
food, unemployment, and transportation. They added that the people do
not want short-term work, but rather want long-term jobs.</P>
      <P>The people don't want beautiful and expensive houses that require
long-term mortgages, they said. Rather, durable and reasonably priced
houses that can be lived in immediately are called for, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HALVING MAXIMUM SINGLE-DAY FALL OF STOCK PRICES REMAINS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang announced
Saturday that the special measure cutting the maximum single-day fall
of equity prices on the Taiwan Stock Exchange to 3.5 percent will be
continued until Oct. 11, as originally scheduled.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Tang Fei's sudden resignation Tuesday shocked the
island, and in order to minimize its impact on the stock market,
former Finance Minister Shea Jia-dong announced a temporary change in
stock market regulations. Normally, the maximum amount a stock's
price is allowed to fall in a single day is 7 percent, but the
ministry decided to halve that figure to 3.5 percent for six business
days, starting on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite an overnight plunge on the New York Stock Exchange, the
TAIEX benchmark weighted index rallied a hefty 324 points Friday,
thanks to intervention by the government's national stabilization
fund and the temporary change in maximum single-day falls. The index
was stable Saturday, closing just 1.64 points lower.</P>
      <P>Yen originally considered ending the temporary measure on Monday,
ahead of schedule. But some investors thought such a move would have
an adverse effect on the stock market, and Yen finally decided to
allow the measure to remain until Oct. 11.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB TO END 'POLITICAL SURVEILLANCE' WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
will formally phase out its controversial "political surveillance"
work soon, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirmed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen was responding to a China Times front-page report that the
MJIB had directed its agents Friday to immediately stop "political
surveillance" operations in a move to show the bureau's support for
"neutrality in intelligence gathering".</P>
      <P>Chen said at a press conference that the National Security Bureau
under the Presidential Office has reached a consensus with the
Executive Yuan that the MJIB will focus on criminal investigations
and national security affairs, and will no longer conduct any
politically-motivated reconnaissance of the activities of specific
political parties or individual politicians.</P>
      <P>According to the MJIB's current organizational statute,
"political surveillance," also known as "national condition surveys,"
ranks among the bureau's nine major categories of responsibilities,
and is performed under the guidance and supervision of the National
Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>The China Times report said MJIB Director Wang Kuang-yu decided
to order an immediate halt to the controversial "political
surveillance" work after meeting with a grassroots group of
reform-minded MJIB investigators Thursday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Chen said although the MJIB is required
to complete certain legal procedures before adjusting its functions,
the bureau should suspend its "political surveillance" work first as
an expedient measure.</P>
      <P>Chen said since he took office in May, the Justice Ministry has
on many occasions asked the MJIB to stop the previous Kuomintang
government-initiated practice of "political surveillance", more
commonly known as "white terror" political persecution of political
dissidents and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The formation in September of the Investigators Reform
Association, a group of MJIB agents, helped accelerate the scrapping
of the decades-old practice.</P>
      <P>With the support of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and
under strong pressure from other major political parties, the NSB has
agreed to free the MJIB from the controversial "political
surveillance" work.</P>
      <P>NSB sources said the bureau has formed a special task force to
study how to adjust NSB and MJIB duties. "The task force is scheduled
to finalize a report within one month," said an NSB official, adding
that the bureau plans to complete necessary legal procedures to
adjust the MJIB's role by the end of October.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition New Party Legislator Elmer Feng said NSB
Director Ting Yu-chou has promised him that the MJIB will scrap
"political surveillance" and conduct only "national security surveys"
in the future.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the "national security surveys" will focus on
investigating mainland Chinese infiltration or other subversive
activities, foreign nationals' anti-ROC government activities,
terrorist activities, financial crimes, general public opinion and
social trends.</P>
      <P>"All these are positive changes in line with the principle of
maintaining neutrality in intelligence and law enforcement
operations," Feng said.</P>
      <P>New Party parliamentary whip Lai Shih-pao said he will initiate a
proposal to add an anti-political surveillance provision to the
current National Security Law.</P>
      <P>The provision would ban the government from wire-tapping and
monitoring any individuals, except for those who are suspected of
being involved in activities strongly detrimental to national
security and social stability, Lai explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW CABINET'S APPROVAL RATING STANDS AT 63.2%: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The approval rating of the newly reshuffled
Cabinet stands at 63.2 percent, according to the results of a recent
public opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,040 randomly selected adult residents,
conducted by Eastern Multimedia Group (EMG) Friday, found that 63.2
percent of the respondents are satisfied with the partial Cabinet
shakeup following Tang Fei's surprise resignation from the
premiership on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 34.2 percent of those interviewed said they are
dissatisfied with the small-scale Cabinet reshuffle, which saw the
promotion of Chang Chun-hsiung from the post of vice premier to the
premiership and changes of chiefs of a few government agencies.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that 62.8 percent said they feel
Chang is suitable for the premiership, while 35.3 percent said they
think otherwise.</P>
      <P>A cross analysis of the poll results further found that the
approval ratings of both Premier Chang and the new Cabinet are
similar among different groups of the respondents divided in terms
of gender, age and party affiliation. This indicates that the new
Cabinet personnel arrangement is acceptable to the majority of local
people.</P>
      <P>However, a series of EMG polls found that President Chen
Shui-bian's approval ratings have been on a declining streak.
According to the latest poll, Chen's approval rating stood at 48.3
percent, the lowest level since he assumed office in May.</P>
      <P>The EMG survey center said Chen enjoyed an approval rating of
higher than 80 percent after delivering his inaugural speech on May
20, and that his popularity rate still stood at 77.2 percent on the
eve of his first month in office. His approval rating plunged to
49 percent following the Pachang Creek tragedy in July, which
claimed four lives and led to the resignation of then-Vice Premier Yu
Shyi-kun to take the blame. Chen's approval rating has since never
exceeded 60 percent, according to EMG surveys.</P>
      <P>Although the new Cabinet has pledged to give the top
priority to ensuring continued economic growth, the latest poll
found that 54 percent of those interviewed have no confidence in
the government's ability to realize this goal. Confidence of the
supporters of the main opposition Kuomintang and the People First
Party was especially low.</P>
      <P>More noteworthy was that 66.1 percent said they have no
confidence in the new pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party-dominated Cabinet's ability to stabilize relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 48.4 percent said they believe that relations between
the new Cabinet and the KMT-controlled Legislative Yuan will become
increasingly better, but 31.5 percent said they don't think that the
Cabinet-parliament relations will improve, while 20 percent said
they cannot forecast the future development of Cabinet-parliament
ties.</P>
      <P>The poll further found that 77.4 percent do not support the
proposal of an early re-election of the legislators, while 22.3
percent gave a thumbs-up to the proposal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FM FORESEES NO BIG CHANGES IN U.S. POLICY TOWARD ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There will be no dramatic changes in
the U.S. policy toward the Republic of China no matter who
wins the upcoming U.S. presidential election, Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao predicted Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tien made the forecast in a radio talk show on the
development of Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the two major U.S. parties' policies on
relations across the Taiwan Strait have shown a trend of
continuity, Tien said he doesn't foresee an about-face in the U.S.
policy toward Taiwan following its November presidential election.</P>
      <P>"Either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party wins the
presidency, the U.S. policy on cross-Taiwan Strait relations will be
based on its three joint communiques with mainland China and its
Taiwan Relations Act, a U.S. law that regulates Washington-Taipei
exchanges in the absence of formal diplomatic ties," Tien explained.</P>
      <P>Of course, Tien said, the new U.S. president will make an
overall review of the U.S. policies toward Taiwan and mainland
China. "But basically there will be no U-turn in its policies toward
both sides of the Taiwan Strait," he added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tien said if Republican candidate George W. Bush
wins the presidency, his administration will certainly re-evaluate
the U.S. policy toward mainland China as one of Bush's senior
campaign aides has said that the Republican Party will treat
mainland China as a "competitor," not a strategic partner as the
current Clinton administration does.</P>
      <P>The international affairs expert-turned-minister further said he
thinks the ROC government should pay close attention to the
possible shakeup of mainland China's policy-making political bureau
as some members are getting old.</P>
      <P>"We should carefully monitor how the mainland political bureau
will be reshuffled as well as whether Beijing will adjust its
strategy or policy toward Taiwan," Tien noted.</P>
      <P>Tien further said he doesn't think that Taiwan needs to care
about Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's forecast that the
United States will regard mainland China as the key negotiating
target for cross-strait relations and that Taiwan's role in the
process will be overlooked.</P>
      <P>"We need not worry about that. Although Taiwan is the smallest
in the triangular relations, the United States has on many occasions
stressed that cross-strait issues must be resolved by peaceful means
and that any settlement proposals must have the consent of the
people of Taiwan," Tien said.</P>
      <P>Turning to relations with the Solomon Islands, Tien said the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is still checking why the Solomon Island
foreign minister didn't arrive in Taipei Friday as originally
scheduled.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Island minister's abrupt cancellation of his arrival
to attend the ROC's Double Ten National Day celebrations has caused
speculation about the prospects of diplomatic relations between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Tien said the political situation in the South Pacific island
nation has not yet fully stabilized. According to Tien, the
Solomon Islands has asked Taiwan to offer financial aid. But as the
amount exceeds Taiwan's financial ability, Tien said, the government
is still mulling the issue.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
gave a luncheon Saturday in honor of a 13-member delegation headed
by former Mongolian Prime Minister Janlaviin Narantsatsralt.</P>
      <P>As the ROC's Double Ten National Day is at the corner, Chen

      <P>Chen got acquainted with Narantsatsralt three years ago when he
visited Ulan Bator to sign a sister-city agreement with Ulan Bator in
his capacity as Taipei mayor. Narantsatsralt was the mayor of Ulan

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Airlines will resume its
Kaohsiung-Manila passenger service Sunday morning, with over 100
passengers going to board the first flight.</P>
      <P>CAL's passenger service between Kaohsiung and Manila has been
suspended for nearly one year because of the termination of the
aviation agreement between the Republic of China and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>The two countries signed an agreement to restore their air link
recently.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for CAL's Kaohsiung office said that a Boeing
737-800, which is capable of carrying 158 passengers, will be used on
the first flight to Manila Sunday morning, and added that more than
100 passengers have booked for that flight.</P>
      <P>During the initial period, CAL will operate one flight between
Kaohsiung and Manila daily. The one-way flying time is one hour and
40 minutes.</P>
      <P>The CAL spokesman said that he is optimistic about the
business on the resumed service between Kaohsiung and Manila, because
it can save Manila-bound passengers about four hours in time and

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. official dismissed Saturday as
"irrelevant" reports from Taipei that Washington was lobbying Taiwan
to continue the construction of the nation's fourth nuclear plant,
which involves U.S. firms.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, told
CNA that the U.S. State Department has already issued a statement on
this issue, and its off-hands policy still stands.</P>
      <P>The United States announced on Sept. 4 that it is Taipei's
decision whether to proceed with the plant, and the U.S. government
is only concerned that all contract provisions are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>In first-page stories on Sunday, two mass-circulated newspapers
in Taipei quoted unidentified government officials as saying that
Washington is expected to pressure Taipei to continue the
construction of its fourth nuclear plant, which would use a reactor
manufactured by U.S. firm General Electric Co.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News quoted an official of Taiwan's Atomic
Energy Council as saying that AIT officials, displeased with
President Chen Shui-bian's public statement that even the United
States is unable to properly dispose of nuclear waste, have lodged a
complaint with the Taiwan nuclear regulatory agency.</P>
      <P>Both the United Daily News and the China Times reported that AIT
officials are working on a position statement to be addressed to
President Chen, with the aim of dissuading Taiwan from abandoning
nuclear power.</P>
      <P>Chen, who campaigned for president on an anti-nuclear platform,
has made moves to scrap the island's fourth nuclear plant. The plant
is already 33 percent finished, and some NT$48 billion (US$1.54
billion) has already been spent on it.</P>
      <P>Chen's administration has estimated that scrapping the plant will
cost the country NT$75 billion (US$2.41 billion) to NT$90 billion
(US$2.9 billion) in compensation for contractors.</P>

      <P>Suspended air links between Taipei and
Manila were resumed Sunday after a protracted dispute over air
rights.</P>
      <P>Lee Yun-ning, chairman of China Airlines, and Rodolfo Reyes,
director of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, jointly presided
over a ceremony commemorating the resumption of direct flights to
Manila at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Reyes said that the Taipei-Manila air link is unlikely to be
scrapped again, as the new aviation agreement between the two sides
was signed in consideration of the mutual interest of the Republic of
China and the Philippine Islands.</P>
      <P>Reyes pointed out that many Filipino laborers now working in
Taiwan will again be able to fly directly between Taiwan and Manila
without a stopover in a third country, which will save them a lot of
time and money.</P>
      <P>He added that the resumed air link will make his country more
attractive to Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that the Taipei-Manila air link began in 1967,
and has greatly contributed to mutual understanding and friendship
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He expressed his belief that the resumption of the direct air

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Sunday 
urged livestock farmers to be on guard against outbreaks of foot and
mouth disease and rigorously follow vaccination measures against the
disease.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine, said that Taiwan is still affected
by FMD, as the virus is still latent in the environment. He added
that sporadic FMD cases could erupt at any time.</P>
      <P>Lee said that farmers should be especially cautious at this time
of the year, because animals lose their resistance to the virus as
cold weather approaches.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has not seen any FMD cases in hogs in nearly
18 months, and no such cases in cattle in nine months. The latest FMD
cases among goats were reported in February.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that the lack of new FMD reports does not mean
that the disease has been eradicated in Taiwan. He added that
officials from his bureau will work with their local counterparts to
ensure that all livestock farmers rigorously follow livestock
vaccination procedures.</P>
      <P>FMD is an acute, contagious, febrile disease that occurs in
cattle, hogs, sheep, and other hoofed animals. It is caused by an
array of various rhinoviruses and is characterized by vesicular
eruptions in the mouth and about the hoofs and udders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first reported an outbreak of FMD three years ago,
resulting in the large-scale slaughter of the nation's hogs, which
dealt a serious blow to the nation's pork exports.</P>

increase their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remark at a ribbon-cutting ceremony of Prokia
Technology's new high-tech manufacturing facility in southern
Taiwan's Tainan Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Lien said that faced with a slumping economy, the government and
industrial sectors should work together to push the development of
high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan industries need to upgrade and change their
structure so that they can increase their competitiveness and
survive.</P>
      <P>With high-tech manufacturing accounting for 60 percent of
Taiwan's total production, Lien said that high-tech industries should
get more attention from the government and industrial sectors.</P>

      <P>A recent public opinion survey by the
Kuomintang Policy Coordination Committee indicates that 63 percent of
the island's eligible voters are worried about the country's future
development following the resignation of former Premier Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey was conducted among 1,138 voters between
Oct. 4-5. The results were made public Sunday.</P>
      <P>When asked which party they would support following Tang's
resignation, 23.81 percent named the People First Party, followed by
the KMT with 23.11 percent, and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party with 21.44 percent.</P>
      <P>Forty-seven percent said that Tang's resignation was not good for
the country's political and economic stability, while 28 percent said
it was beneficial.</P>
      <P>Tang's greatest contribution to the country during his four-month

    <HEADLINE>U.S. PLANS TO HELP TAIWAN, SOUTH KOREA HANDLE NUCLEAR WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Energy is willing to
help Taiwan and South Korea handle highly radioactive nuclear waste,
and will do so in two stages, a trade source said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the first stage will
implement the transfer of technology while the second stage will
transport solidified radioactive waste to a foreign country for deep
burial. At the present time, the U.S. plans to bury the nuclear waste
in Siberia.</P>
      <P>The plan will be implemented once the Russian Parliament approves
the project, the source said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Energy announced in September that it is
willing to share its nuclear waste disposal technology and experience
with countries around the world.</P>
      <P>C.K. Chou, a special assistant at the U.S. Department of Energy,
said that the U.S. is now conducting a study on handling highly
radioactive nuclear waste in such a facility, the results of which
are to be submitted to the U.S. president and the Congress for
approval next year. If approved, the department will formally apply
for a license to build a nuclear waste dump.</P>
      <P>Expert sources said that only 3 percent of an amount of nuclear
waste must be solidified and sealed before permanent burial, while
the other 97 percent can be recycled for further use.</P>
      <P>South Korea is said to have originally planned to send the waste
from its nuclear power plants to Europe for handling, but suspended
the plan after objections from the United States.</P>
      <P>The United States and Russia are now planning to build a nuclear
waste dump site in Siberia, but the plan is subject to the approval
of the Russian Parliament.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run Taiwan Power Co. has also reportedly contacted
Russian government agencies on the issue of dumping its nuclear waste
there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER THROWS WEIGHT BEHIND NUCLEAR PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen threw his
weight behind the island's controversial fourth nuclear power plant
Sunday despite the fact that the cabinet seems determined to stop its
construction.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from reporters in Kaohsiung, Wu said that
nuclear power would serve the nation's security interests better than
any other form of energy.</P>
      <P>Although both nuclear and fossil fuels have to be imported to the
island, a single Boeing 747 can deliver enough nuclear fuel to supply
a nuclear plant with a capacity of 2.7 million kilowatts for one
year, compared to 100 ship-loads of coal to supply a thermal
electricity power plant with a similar capacity for the same amount
of time, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Taiwan's shipping routes are vulnerable to a
blockade, adding that nuclear power generation would not be hindered
by such a situation, while coal-burning power plants would be
paralyzed.</P>
      <P>He said he doesn't think that the island's nuclear plants would
become a target of military attacks by Beijing, because the
radioactive fallout from the destruction of the plants would be a
huge risk to the mainland itself.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lee Ying-yuan,
who has been designated as Taiwan's deputy representative to
Washington, said Saturday that the DPP will not alter its
anti-nuclear stance, regardless of Washington's concerns about
Taiwan's decision to halt the construction of its fourth nuclear
plant, which would be equipped with U.S.-made reactors.</P>
      <P>Characterizing it as a private-sector issue, Lee said he believes
that Washington will respect Taiwan's decision, as long as it is not
detrimental to U.S. contractors.</P>
      <P>He was asked to comment on Sunday's reports that Washington was
lobbying Taiwan to continue the construction of the plant. A U.S.
State Department official in Washington denied the report earlier in
the day, and reiterated Washington's hands-off policy on the issue.</P>

      <P>The latest public opinion survey shows that
most people in Taiwan hope the new government will give priority to
resolving the island's pressing economic problems.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the National Tendency Public Opinion
Research Center among 1,073 people between Oct. 6-7. The results were
made public Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Sixty-two percent of respondents said the government should focus
its energy on resolving Taiwan's economic problems, followed by
social security issues (7.3 percent), black-gold corruption (4.6
percent), and cross-Taiwan Strait relations (2.6 percent).</P>
      <P>Forty-two percent of those polled attributed the sharp drop in
President Chen Shui-bian's approval rating to the government's
failure to resolve Taiwan's economic problems.</P>
      <P>The survey indicates that 63 percent of respondents support the
appointment of Chang Chun-hsiung to replace Tang Fei as new premier,
and 46.7 percent said they have confidence in Premier Chang and new
Vice Premier Lai Ying-chao.</P>
      <P>Thirty-eight percent said they would consider giving the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party more seats in the Legislative Yuan in
next year's elections, while 39 percent said they have no such
consideration.</P>
      <P>A great majority of those polled said they would give the new
administration more time to display its efficiency, because four
months is not enough time to make a fair judgment on the government's
performance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is planning to ship several million
condoms to Africa as part of the World Health Organization's efforts
at fighting AIDS on that continent, sources from the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Invited by the WHO delegation in Liberia, the MOFA agreed to
donate 5 million to 6 million condoms to Liberia, which maintains
formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, said Andrew
Hsia, director of the MOFA's Department of International
Organizations.</P>
      <P>It was learned that the U.S. government has also promised to
contribute 1 million condoms to the same WHO project, Hsia said.</P>
      <P>He added that the MOFA plans to send the condoms early next year
when members of Taiwan's private, voluntary medical group, Luchuhuei
(the Roadside Bamboo Society), embark on a voluntary medical mission
to Liberia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Hsia, the MOFA is also planning to
cooperate with the WHO, the World Bank, and other non-government

Africa.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, the
presidents of the five Yuans, and ministers of the Cabinet were also
on hand to welcome the guests from Haiti.</P>
      <P>This trip represents President Preval's second visit to the ROC
on Taiwan during his tenure. He last visited Taipei in April 1998.</P>
      <P>The occasion marked the second time President Chen has hosted a
ceremony honoring a foreign head of state with a military salute
since he assumed the ROC presidency in May this year. The first
occasion was on July 1 when Panamanian President Mireya Elisa Moscoso
Rodriguez visited Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his stay, President Preval is expected to meet with
President Chen and Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao to exchange views
on the international situation and on matters of mutual concern, said
officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>Preval, an agronomist-turned-president who studied agriculture at
Belgium's UC Louvain, is also scheduled to meet with Chen Hsi-huang,
chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture, for discussions
on agricultural cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Haitian president is also scheduled to visit several
agricultural and aquacultural establishments around Taiwan during his
stay, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The ROC has maintained close and cordial relations with Haiti
over the past four decades since the two countries forged formal ties
in 1956, MOFA officials noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan businessmen have invested more than
US$24.5 billion in mainland China, said Central Bank of China (CBC)
Governor Perng Pai-nan on Monday while fielding questions in the
Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Wen-lang of the Democratic Progressive Party said
that the nation's trade surplus has shown negative growth and that
its foreign currency reserves in September were down by more than
US$1.3 billion, showing a serious capital flight from the nation,
which he said is related to Taiwan businessmen's investments in the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Perng said Taiwan's trade surplus in the first nine months of
this year totaled US$4.6 billion, down from last year's figure,
mainly because of rising oil prices. In addition, citizens of Taiwan
spent US$7 billion annually on overseas tourism.</P>
      <P>Perng said official statistics from the mainland show that Taiwan
businessmen have invested US$24.5 billion, but he noted that many
businessmen, trying to evade taxes, invested indirectly via the
Virgin Islands, so he estimated the actual amount is higher.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. representative office in the
Republic of China issued a press statement Monday to clarify its view
on the current debate in Taiwan over whether to continue or cease
construction of the island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan first
stressed that whether or not to continue construction of the Lungmen
nuclear power plant is a decision for the Taiwan authorities to
make.</P>
      <P>The AIT went on to say that the major U.S. concern is that
contract provisions that have been agreed upon are fulfilled in
either case, whether the construction of the power plant is continued
or is halted.</P>
      <P>Noting that there have been regular exchanges and visits between
U.S. and Taiwan experts on nuclear energy for many years, including
on issues related to handling and disposing of nuclear wastes, the
AIT press release said there is no linkage between the recent visit
of a U.S. nuclear waste expert and the construction of the
controversial Lungmen nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The statement also said the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
has certified the design of the type of reactor being incorporated
into the Lungmen plant as safe for construction in the United
States.</P>
      <P>The controversy surrounding the fourth nuclear power plant has
recently led to the resignation of Tang Fei from the premiership,
and there has been speculation that the Clinton administration is
pressuring the ROC's Democratic Progressive Party-led government to
uphold the project.</P>
      <P>The latest AIT statement was aimed at clarifying the
speculation. Meanwhile, Ou-Yang Min-sheng, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Atomic Energy Council, also denied reports that the
U.S. government is either pressuring or lobbying the ROC government
to continue construction of the Lungmen nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Ou-Yang further said the main purpose of the recent visit to
Taipei of a U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission delegation was to
promote cooperation in nuclear energy technology and safety and had
nothing to do with the fate of the fourth nuclear power plant
project.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Military Intelligence Bureau on Monday
categorically denied that it has conducted political surveillance
domestically, saying that the MIB has only done intelligence work
directed at mainland China.</P>
      <P>MIB officials made the denial after the bureau was accused by
People First Party Legislator Chin Huei-chu of conducting political
surveillance in Taiwan in the name of safeguarding national security.</P>
      <P>The officials stressed that it is not the MIB's job or
responsibility to conduct political surveillance within Taiwan,
noting that there has of course been no reason to wiretap any Taiwan
individual or organization's phones.</P>
      <P>They said that in the bureau's early days when the international
and cross-strait situations were different and the burea's special
missions were different from today's, all the bureau's internal
phones were equipped with recording devices. But the practice was
scrapped in recent years, they stressed.</P>
      <P>MIB Director Hsu Chu-sheng, in an interview with CNA reporters
the other day, also made it clear that the MIB has not and will not
conduct political surveillance in Taiwan and will only conduct
intelligence work aimed at mainland China.</P>
      <P>At Monday's press conference, Legislator Chin urged the National
Security Bureau not to only declare the suspension of political
surveillance by the Ministry of Justice Bureau of Investigation.</P>
      <P>She said if the government is indeed to suspend all political
surveillance in Taiwan once and for all, all related agencies,
including the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Military Police
Headquarters, the Maritime Police Administration, and the National
Police Administration, should all be ordered to stop with the secret
surveillance business.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei.  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Company said
Monday that losses resulting from the scrapping of the fourth nuclear
power plant could hit NT$90 billion (US$2.87 billion).</P>
      <P>In the wake of the Ministry of Economic Affairs suggestion that
the controversial project be scrapped, Taipower has begun an
assessment of the projected losses from the halting of the project
and also of the options for dealing with such a decision.</P>
      <P>Taipower said that General Electric Company of the United States
won the bid to build the reactors for the proposed power plant in
Kungliao, Taipei County, in 1995. The reactors are scheduled to be
shipped to Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>GE has said that after it receives official notification of the
project's termination, it will begin to draw up a compensation list
regarding Taipower's breach of contract.</P>
      <P>Taipower has estimated that construction on the nuclear power
plant is already one third complete and that the money already spent
on the project has reached US$48.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Taipower, which will shoulder all losses resulting from a
termination of the power plant project, said that options it is
considering include raising electricity fees or drawing a part of its
targeted annual surplus every year to make up for the losses.</P>
      <P>Taipower stressed that the people will suffer under the
implementation of either option, pointing out that this year's
targeted surplus is NT$54 billion (US$1.72 billion), and if NT$10
billion is drawn, then this will mean that the national coffers will
be short NT$10 billion. It added that if electricity fees are hiked,
this will certainly have a direct impact on the general public.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Chang Po-ya Monday threw
her support behind the proposal that a plebiscite be held to decide
the fate of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Chang gave a thumbs-up to the proposal in response to an
interpellation by ruling Democratic Progress Party Legislator Lee
Chun-yi at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee asked Chang whether she backs continued construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant and whether she supports the holding of a
plebiscite to resolve the controversy surrounding the project.</P>
      <P>In reply, Chang said the time is still not right for her to
express her personal view on the issue because the Cabinet has not
yet formally discussed the project.</P>
      <P>As for the "plebiscite" proposal, Chang said she feels that the
measure may be able to provide a solution to this thorny issue. "As
the government and major opposition parties have been unable to come
to terms on whether to continue or scrap the project, a plebiscite
can probably help free the government from its current plight," the
minister noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said the Ministry of the Interior is drafting a
referendum bill. "The ministry is still mulling which issues can be
decided by a referendum and how a referendum vote will be held," she
explained.</P>
      <P>In view of the urgency of the issue, Chang suggested that the
government immediately form a "serious dispute commission" to handle
the contentious fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Chang said the proposed commission can be authorized to host a
series of public hearings to help the general public fully understand
the pros and cons of the project before a referendum vote is held.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's Central News Agency
signed an agreement with the Macedonian Information Agency Monday
to exchange news and other services.</P>
      <P>CNA President Bill Wang and MIA President Zivko Georgievski
signed the agreement on behalf of the two organizations at CNA's head
office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, the two news agencies will supply
English-language news items as well as photographs for distribution
to each other's subscribers. The two wire services will also engage
in journalistic exchanges, including co-sponsoring activities to
promote professionalism.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the signing ceremony, Wang noted that the two news
organizations had actually started cooperating last year. In June
1999, when the Macedonian prime minister came to Taipei, CNA supplied
MIA with news pictures about his visit. When ROC officials later
visited Macedonia, MIA returned the favor by assisting CNA reporters
with their coverage of the visit.</P>
      <P>Wang promised that CNA will do its best to provide whatever
services its Macedonian partner needs.</P>
      <P>Georgievski said that his agency, established by parliamentary
edict in 1992, is very happy and proud to cooperate with CNA because
of its long history. "We can show to the rest of the world and our
neighbors how we can work together," he said.</P>
      <P>Ms. Vera Modanu, minister of the Macedonian Embassy who was
invited as a special guest to witness the ceremony, expressed
confidence that the agreement will enhance understanding and
friendship between the two nations.</P>
      <P>P.N. Chang, deputy director-general of the ROC Government
Information Office, was also present at the ceremony. He pointed out
that the ROC has initiated a number of projects to help Macedonia
improve its economy, but added that the projects have not been
publicized very well and are not widely understood.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes the news exchange agreement will improve
mutual understanding between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The Central News Agency was founded in 1924. It now has over 400

      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw said Monday local
stock investment trust and consulting firms as well as banks
which have been authorized to operate trust business will be allowed
to engage in stock investment activities on behalf of clients.</P>
      <P>Lai made the announcement after chairing a meeting of the
Cabinet's special financial and economic task force, which was

economic affairs.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Lai said, the Ministry of Finance will
begin to accept applications by stock investment trust and
consulting firms and banks on Oct. 11 for operating stock investment
deals on behalf on their clients.</P>
      <P>Lai said as individual investors form the bulk of Taiwan's stock
investors, the new measure will help change the domestic stock market
structure and thus increase market stability.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lai said, the task force has directed the finance
ministry to push for an early passage of a bill aimed at allowing
financial institutions to merge among themselves to facilitate
Taiwan's financial globalization and upgrading of local banks'
competitiveness in the world financial service market.</P>
      <P>Lai said the finance ministry will also propose revisions to the
current income tax law to allow merged banks to write off debts
under certain conditions in order to encourage merger among local

      <P>The task force was originally headed by the premier. From now

    <HEADLINE>7,000-PLUS OVERSEAS CHINESE RETURN FOR NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An estimated 7,000 overseas Chinese have
returned for the Republic of China's Double Ten National Day
celebrations this year, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The number marks a nearly 50 percent decrease from the number of
returnees three years ago, according to official tallies.</P>
      <P>Following the island's first-ever transition of the Presidency
from the long-ruling Kuomintang to the relatively youthful Democratic
Progressive Party in May, different faces can be seen among the
returning overseas Chinese.</P>
      <P>OCAC officials said a number of Taiwanese expatriate
organizations have organized delegations to return to Taiwan to
celebrate National Day for the first time this year.</P>
      <P>According to OCAC officials, the number of returning Taiwan-born
expatriates is roughly the same as that of elderly overseas Chinese,
most of whom moved abroad directly from mainland China.</P>
      <P>OCAC officials attributed the decline in the number of returning
expatriates in part to the fact that many overseas Chinese already
attended the May 20 inauguration of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The number of overseas Chinese returning for the Double Ten
celebrations once reached a high of more than 20,000, but the figure
has been in a steady decline in recent years, partly because of
mainland China's intensified efforts to woo older-generation overseas
Chinese by returning confiscated real estate and other assets to
them, OCAC officials said.</P>
      <P>Another reason is the change in Taiwan's domestic political
situation, OCAC officials said. Because of the government's budget
problems, the OCAC has earmarked only NT$5 million (US$161,290) for
receiving overseas Chinese this year, compared to the nearly NT$100
million that mainland China spent for the same purpose during its
Oct. 1 National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese sources said Taiwan's domestic political
uncertainty under the DPP administration and the devastating
earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21, 1999 have also
discouraged overseas Chinese from returning for National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources said, an increasing number of elderly
overseas Chinese are now willing to attend celebrations of both the
ROC and PRC National Days in their resident countries. In the past,
most elderly overseas Chinese would only take part in celebrations
marking the ROC's Oct. 10 National Day.</P>

      <P>Joseph Zen Zekiun, a Catholic church bishop, said in an

      <P>Two practitioners of Falun Gong have
been arrested after they took an unprecedented legal action against
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and two other Beijing
officials in August for giving orders to crack down on the spiritual
movement.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Falun Gong organization in Hong Kong said
Monday at a press conference that the two plaintiffs, Chu Keming and
Wang Jie, were arrested on Sept. 7, after they filed a law suit with
the Supreme People's Procuratorate in Beijing against the three
Beijing leaders. Chu is a Hong Kong resident, while Wang is a
mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>The spokesman expressed the hope that leaders of Hong Kong and
foreign countries will do something to help secure an early release
of the two Falun Gong practitioners.</P>
      <P>China outlawed the Falun Gong sect as an "evil cult" and began
to crack down on it last year.</P>

Liberia -- may attend the forthcoming "Chinese-African Cooperation
Forum" sponsored by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tien told the media that Beijing has sent invitations to the

      <P>He said that most have taken Taipei's advice and declined the
invitation, but a few still intend to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Tien disclosed that Malawi will dispatch a delegation to the

      <P>The South Korean chapter of Amnesty
International condemned the South Korean government Monday for its
denial of an entry visa for Wang Dan, a leader of China's democracy
movement.</P>
      <P>The local chapter of the worldwide human rights group said in a
statement that the South Korean government's action was akin to
abandoning human rights and South Korea's own national sovereignty in
order to flatter a great power. The statement urged the South Korean
authorities to change its policy and unconditionally allow Wang Dan
to enter the country.</P>
      <P>The statement pointed out that Wang Dan is not only a
world-renowned symbol of China's democracy movement, but also a
representative of the world human rights movement.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International added that its members will exhort world
leaders at the third Asian-European Summit to pay more than just lip
service to issue of democracy in China. The Third Asian-European
Summit is scheduled to be held in Seoul on Oct. 20-21, and the group
decided to invite Wang Dan to attend a series of activities
accompanying the meeting of the leaders of Asia and Europe.</P>
      <P>The statement stressed that by yielding to political pressure
from Beijing, the South Korean government has not only denied an
entry visa for Wang Dan, but has also run roughshod over the will of

    <HEADLINE>MOFA WATCHING TO DETERMINE SOLOMON FOREIGN MINISTER'S WHEREABOUTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said Monday that it is watching closely to determine the
whereabouts of Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Denny Philip, who had
been due to arrive in Taipei last Friday to attend the Republic of
China's National Day on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Philip's absence at a ministry reception to welcome
foreign journalists, ROC Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao said that he
was indeed surprised by Philip's failure to appear on the eve of ROC
National Day, adding that his ministry has maintained close contact
with Solomon authorities.</P>
      <P>Tien quoted a foreign news wire service as saying the Solomon
Islands government announced Monday that its foreign minister
postponed a trip to Taipei because of political uncertainty in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Former ROC Premier Tang Fei suddenly offered his resignation last
Tuesday, which sent shock waves through the island's political
circles. Although Tang cited poor health conditions as a reason for
his resignation, it is widely thought that the true reason was that
his pro-nuclear power stance conflicted with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's anti-nuclear platform. Tang is a member of the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Since June this year, conflict among ethnic groups has flared in
the Solomon Islands. Although talks are being held at an Australian
military base in northeastern Australia, the South Pacific nation's
political situation is still very tense.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the current political situation in the Solomons
will provide mainland China with an opportunity to persuade
authorities there to shift the island nation's diplomatic recognition
from Taipei to Beijing, Tien was reluctant to make a reply. He said
only that all ROC embassies and representative offices abroad are
actively collecting information on the issue.</P>
      <P>Foreign news media also reported that Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the Solomon government is awaiting
political developments in Taipei before dispatching Philip to open
the country's embassy.</P>
      <P>The announcement appeared aimed at dispelling rumors that Beijing
is offering Solomon Islands financial aid in return for withdrawing
its diplomatic recognition from Taipei, according to the foreign news
wire reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTER CALMS DISPUTE OVER CHINESE ROMANIZATION SYSTEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tseng promised
Monday to present a Mandarin Chinese romanization system used in
mainland China along with a system developed by a local scholar to
the Cabinet to make a final choice.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned minister made the comment in an attempt to
calm the dispute currently pitting Taipei City Government against an
expert commission under the ministry.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that as head of the Education Ministry, he has to
respect the conclusion of the National Language Promotion Commission,
which recommended the use of the Tongyong system, which was developed
locally. But he added that as a linguist himself, he prefers
Beijing's Hanyu system, now used by Taipei City on its street signs.</P>
      <P>The problem stems from the previous government's demand in the
late 1990s for a modern, standardized Romanization system to help
foreigners pronounce Chinese words as one step in transforming the
island into a worldwide business hub.</P>
      <P>As a result, the National Language Promotion Commission under the
Education Ministry recommended in August 1999 that Taiwan adapt
Beijing's Hanyu Pinyin system, on the grounds that it is widely used
around the world and is recognized by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Although adopting Beijing's system would be politically difficult
for the island in light of its painstaking efforts to distinguish
itself as a sovereign entity separate from mainland China, the
Cabinet under former Premier Vincent Siew agreed to endorse the plan,
but demanded supplementary measures to facilitate its implementation.</P>
      <P>Siew and his administration stepped down before the system was
officially adopted by the government, and a new panel under the
Education Ministry canceled the decision. The panel members argued in
favor of the Tongyong System, which was developed by a local scholar
from the new National Language Promotion Commission.</P>
      <P>They recommended the Tongyong System on the grounds that it
accounts for various existing systems used to teach local dialects,
whereas the Hanyu system does not.</P>
      <P>The panel's decision has caused an outcry from Taipei City Hall,
which has already begun changing the capital's road signs according
to the Hanyu romanization system.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-hsiou, director of the city's Civil Affairs Bureau,
criticized the panel for its "flip-flop" on the issue because of what
he called its paranoid fear of being "unified by Beijing" simply by
using the same romanization system.</P>
      <P>"The romanization system is aimed at helping foreigners to
recognize Chinese characters, rather than as an instrument for
promoting local dialects." said Lin. "A system unique to Taiwan will
only further isolate the island, rather than help it integrate into
the world."</P>
      <P>While Education Minister Ovid Tseng's promise might ease the
dispute to some extent, no conclusion is likely in the near future,
since Premier Chang Chun-hsiung made it clear Monday that there is no
urgency to decide on the issue. Chang said he would refer whatever
recommendation Tseng gives him to an ad hoc commission for in-depth
study.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
Tuesday urged his fellow citizens to strive fearlessly forward on the
path of freedom, democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>In his National Day message that was given to the media the day
prior to ROC National Day, which falls on Tuesday, Chen said that the
role of the Republic of China in the 21st Century should not only be
that of a truly democratic nation, but also that of "a protector of
peace in the Asia Pacific region" and "an active participant in the
international community."</P>
      <P>"The political and economic achievements of the 23 million people
of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu did not suddenly fall from the
sky, but result from the accumulation of the relentless efforts made
generation after generation," President said.</P>
      <P>"For the past fifty-odd years, we have, on this island of the
Pacific Rim, followed in the footprints of our forefathers to create
step by step an economic miracle and set the course for our
democracy. These demonstrated inherent strengths of Taiwan and its
people have thus repeatedly and inevitably attracted attention of the
world."</P>
      <P>"Beginning from the time when our ancestors sailed from across
the sea to Taiwan hundreds of years ago, and running through the
blood of all, from the indigenous people to the frontierless
e-generation, the Taiwan Spirit is shared by all of our 23 million
compatriots."</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan Spirit originates from the interaction and mutual
influence of Han culture and Austronesian islands cultures. It was
successfully forged through all of our hardships and dreams. From the
shores of the Pacific Ocean to the top of Mount Jade, all the people
living on this land spare no effort, wisdom, confidence and hope in
order to see the best understanding of this Taiwan Spirit recorded,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said that although people here came from different places and
different clans -- including the indigenous peoples and more recently
arrived residents -- they are now all merged in the Taiwan Spirit,
sharing both their fortunes and mishaps. "No matter if we are called
'Taiwanese', 'Chinese' or 'global citizens', we will not confine our
vision of the future nor forget where we stand," the president said.</P>
      <P>"'The Taiwan Spirit' will continue to guide and lead us. With
this unparalleled confidence, mutual trust and eternal faith, we will
create the most spectacular and beautiful Formosa in the 21st
Century," the President concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following is the full text of the Republic
of China President Chen Shui-bian's National Day message:</P>
      <P>Today marks the 89th National Day of the Republic of China. I
would like to thank all the distinguished guests and overseas Chinese
who have come from afar to share with us this solemn moment of joy.</P>
      <P>During the almost one hundred years of the history of the
Republic of China, from establishing the nation to modernization and
democratization, none of the achievements it made came about without
our having to overcome many obstacles and difficulties. Success
through each stage did not depend on the strength of any single
individual or group, but rather came as a result of the awakening of
the whole society and the resolve of the entire people.</P>
      <P>Likewise, the political and economic achievements of the 23
million people of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu today did not
suddenly fall from the sky, but result from the accumulation of the
relentless efforts made generation after generation. For the past
fifty-odd years, we have, on this island of the Pacific Rim, followed
in the footprints of our forefathers to create step by step an
economic miracle and set the course for our democracy. These
demonstrated inherent strengths of Taiwan and its people have thus
repeatedly and inevitably attracted the attention of the world.</P>
      <P>We have successfully gone through the stages of hard-won economic
development and difficult democratic reform. The Taiwan Experience of
the past half century should gave us much confidence. Beginning from
the time when our ancestors sailed from across the sea to Taiwan
hundreds of years ago, and running through the blood of all, from the
indigenous peoples to the frontierless e-generation, the Taiwan
Spirit is shared by all of our 23 million compatriots.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Spirit originates from the interaction and mutual
influence of Han culture and Austronesian islands cultures. It was
successfully forged through all of our hardships and dreams. From the
shores of the Pacific Ocean to the top of Mount Jade, all the people
living on this land spare no effort, wisdom, confidence and hope in
order to see the best understanding of this Taiwan Spirit recorded.
Although we came from different places, and although there were once
differences between the Hoklos, the Hakkas, the indigenous peoples and
more recently arrived residents, we are now all merged in the Taiwan
Spirit, sharing both our fortunes and mishaps. No matter if we are
called "Taiwanese", "Chinese" or "global citizens", we will not
confine our vision of the future nor forget where we stand.</P>
      <P>Me dear fellow countrymen, in the last year of the 20th century,
the people of Taiwan completed the first alternation of political
parties in power of our history. We are confident that the future
will prove that peaceful transition of political power does not
simply mean win or loss for any individual or political party.
Rather, it is a victory for all people and a victory of democracy.
Building on this glorious foundation, we cannot but have more
confidence in ourselves in facing the new century. (more)</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As we constitute a new paradigm of democracy for all Chinese
societies, we should fearlessly strive to move forward on the path of
freedom, democracy and human rights. Yet the role of the Republic of
China in the 21st Century should not only be that of "the realizer of
democracy", but also that of "a protector of peace in the Asia
Pacific" and "an active participant in the international community".</P>
      <P>In facing the new political scene after the first alteration of
political parties in power, we are a bit like the patient after
surgery, in need of growing new bone tissue and blood, while at the
same time we face both internal and external challenges.</P>
      <P>Since May 20 in order to seek the greatest welfare of the
people, yet in a very short time, we cautiously but vigorously
worked on stabilizing the situation across the Taiwan Strait,
preserving our national security, expanding our international space,
and weeding out corruption while at the same time promoting good
virtues. As a newly established government, we are keenly aware that
there are still many things to be improved. I myself, the national
leader, as well as all members of the new administration should
exercise some self-examination and remain alert all the time.
Meanwhile, we would like to once again sincerely plead with all
political parties, both ruling and opposition, that they jointly
uphold the common ideals of "national interest first, people's
welfare first".</P>
      <P>The Amis indigenous people of eastern Taiwan hold the belief
that the oceans, the rivers, the land, the fruit trees and mothers
are the "breeders" of all that is in the universe. They are supreme
and cannot be profaned. Pondering carefully and feeling with our 
hearts the significance of this belief, we can see that it contains
the idea of creation, nourishment and tolerance. It is a warm and
touching symbolism, which contains no sense of antagonism or hatred.
If all things in the universe can thus be created, then why can it
not be so for our national future? Reflecting upon the spirit of our
ancestors when they crossed the Taiwan Strait from Tangshan, apart
from learning from their adventurous courage and creativity, we
should always remember the virtues of self-confidence, trust in
fellow countrymen, and faith in the land. These are the most solid
foundations upon which to build our home.</P>
      <P>My dear fellow countrymen, as we celebrate together the founding
day of the Republic of China both at home and abroad, we should
ponder solemnly upon the common destiny of the 23 million people in
Taiwan. Although Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu are only tiny
islands in the Pacific, our morale has never been daunted and our
vision has never been blocked. "The Taiwan Spirit" will continue to
guide and lead us. With this unparalleled confidence, mutual trust
and eternal faith, we will create the most spectacular and beautiful
Formosa in the 21st Century!</P>
      <P>I wish prosperity to the Republic of China and good health and
happiness to all of citizens and all of the distinguished guest.
Thank you!</P>

      <P>New Zealand's government has indicated
that it will ease immigration rules in a bid to counter the effects

Australian on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Immigration Minister Lianane Dalziel as
signaling plans to lower the NZ$1 million (US$450,000) investment
threshold by NZ$250,000 (US$112,500) to lure more wealthy immigrants
to the country as more and more New Zealanders move abroad, mainly to
Australia, as a result of weakening economic growth.</P>
      <P>In the year to August, more than 72,000 New Zealanders left their
country, with over half of that number moving to Australia, the daily

      <P>The government of New Zealand will also increase its annual

      <P>The Military Police Headquarters solemnly
clarified its role in the national security/intelligence
operation system Tuesday, saying it has never been authorized to
conduct political surveillance.</P>
      <P>The headquarters issued the statement after opposition People
First Party Legislator Chin Huei-chu claimed on Monday that the MPH
is among a list of government agencies responsible for politically
motivated surveillance of activities of opposition parties and their
leading figures.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MPH forms an integral part of the Republic of
China's national security/intelligence operation system, the
headquarters said it has focused on special service security survey
and military security survey.</P>
      <P>The MPH further said it has been performing its duties
under the guidance and coordination of the General Staff Headquarters
under the Ministry of National Defense and the National Security
Bureau under the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>"In our overall national security/intelligence operation system,
the MPH has not been charged with the mission of political situation
survey," an MPH spokesman said, adding that military police have
never gotten involved in the so-called political surveillance work.</P>
      <P>The spokesman went on to say that the MPH will continue to carry
out its official duties in line with the principles of
"military nationalization, administrative neutrality and rule of
law" in the future.</P>
      <P>At a Monday press conference, Legislator Chin pushed the
National Security Bureau not to only free the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) from the controversial political
surveillance job, also known as "white terror" political persecution
tactics initiated by the previous Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>Chin said if the new Democratic Progressive Party-led government
is indeed to phase out the decades-old "white terror" tactics
against opposition politicians once and for all, all other related
agencies, including the Military Intelligence Bureau, the Military
Police Headquarters, the Maritime Police Administration, and the
National Police Administration, should also be allowed to halt
the secret political surveillance operations.</P>
      <P>Under heavy pressure from opposition parties and protest of
reform-minded MJIB agents, the National Security Bureau and the
Ministry of Justice have recently reached a consensus on freeing the
MJIB from the controversial political surveillance work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CELEBRATES 89TH NATIONAL DAY AMID FANFARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of cheerleaders, honor guards,
dragon dancers, and performers from different walks of life joined
tens of thousands of onlookers in front of the presidential office
Tuesday to celebrate the Republic of China's 89th National Day.</P>
      <P>Amidst hails of "long live freedom and democracy," "long live the
people of Taiwan," and "long live the Republic of China" following
President Chen Shui-bian's lead, the festivities kicked into high
gear, beginning with the crowd's all-time favorites -- the rifle
drill performances by the tri-service military and Taipei Municipal
First Girls' Senior High School honor guards.</P>
      <P>This year's "Double Ten" celebration was the first for the new
Democratic Progressive Party government, which came into power May 20
after over five decades of rule by the Kuomintang. Last year's
National Day celebration was canceled while the government
concentrated its resources on post-disaster relief efforts after the
killer earthquake that struck Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>In a gesture to illustrate the new administration's affirmation
of a pluralistic society, this year's event organizers balanced such
traditional numbers as dragon dances and rifle drills with
crowd-pleasers like an aboriginal dance performed to the beat of
uplifting percussion and a parade of cross-country racing
motorcycles, touring sedans, and all-terrain dune rovers.</P>
      <P>President Chen said in his address that the 23 million people of
Taiwan have spared no effort, wisdom, confidence, and hope in
attaining the "Taiwan spirit." He added that this spirit will
continue to lead the people of Taiwan to create a better Formosa in
the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Four selected college students recited an ode to the ROC's
National Day using the four primary dialects of the people of Taiwan
-- Mandarin Chinese, Fukienese, Hakka, and an aboriginal tongue --
instead of the manifesto that had traditionally been recited by a
single youth representative in one language.</P>
      <P>The mostly foreign imported music used during previous National
Day festivities was replaced by local music, which made up about 75
percent of this year's musical numbers and background music.</P>
      <P>An official tally put the total number of performers at this
year's hour-long celebration at 3,074, while the number of local
spectators, returning overseas Chinese, and foreign guests reached
the 26,000 mark.</P>
      <P>Similar festivities took place in towns and cities around the
island as people celebrated the 89th year of the Republic of China,
which was founded in 1912. Fireworks are expected to grace Taiwan's
skies in the evening, with the largest pyrotechnic display scheduled
to be held in the southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Later in the afternoon, ROC Vice President Annette Lu is expected
to join the crowd at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to watch Peking
operas, lion dances, and other cooperative performances that seek to
integrate the cultures of Taiwan's different ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is scheduled to host a National
Day banquet at the Taipei Guest House in the evening to entertain
foreign dignitaries, while a gala for the public will be held in the
meantime at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, a landmark that was built to
honor the memory of the founder of the Republic of China and the
father of the nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday again
urged leaders on the other side of the Taiwan Strait to set aside
differences and resume dialogue with Taiwan so as to break the
current deadlock and achieve a "win-win" situation.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing more than 400
central and local government officials, elected representatives, and
overseas Chinese representatives at the Presidential Office to mark
the Republic of China's National Day.</P>
      <P>President Chen said the government is sincere in seeking
"goodwill reconciliation, active cooperation, and long-lasting
peace," and he called on the leaders of mainland China to join us in
 returning to the spirit of 1992," putting aside disputes and
resuming dialogue and exchanges as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>But the president also reiterated the position that "the
resolution of cross-strait issues and the future of Taiwan must
respect the will of the 23 million people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Now that the emotional heat generated by the election campaign
has subsided, he said the nation faces not "only the serious ills and
corrupt practices left by the past authoritarian regime, but also the
verbal attacks and military threat from the Chinese mainland, which
serve to put the wisdom of the new government to a serious test."</P>
      <P>President Chen said that maintaining a stable, peaceful, and
secure environment has become the top priority of the new government,
adding that "if we cannot immediately ease cross-strait tensions,
strengthen our diplomatic front, and boost the morale of our armed
forces, it will be impossible for us to implement various domestic
reforms."</P>
      <P>He also said that the new government "based on the solid
foundation that has been laid, has committed itself to a series of
reforms that will instill the nation with uplifting energy."</P>
      <P>The president then received 264 foreign dignitaries, including
Haitian President Rene Preval, foreign diplomatic corps, and foreign
media heads who had come to attend the "Double Ten Day" festivities.</P>
      <P>Chen later addressed a rally of more than 26,000 people in front
of the Presidential Office. The theme of his speech revolved around
the notion of the "Taiwan spirit."</P>
      <P>He said that although the people of Taiwan have come from
different places and although there were once differences between the
Hoklos, the Hakkas, the indigenous peoples, and the more recent
arrivals to the island, the 23 million people of Taiwan "are now all
merged in the Taiwan spirit, sharing both fortunes and mishaps."</P>
      <P>Saying that Taiwan completed the first successful transfer of
political power from one party to another in its history, Chen said
that "we are confident that the future will prove that peaceful
transition of political power does not simply mean victory or loss
for any individual party," but instead victory for all the people and
for democracy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the role of the ROC in the 21th century should
not only be that of the achiever of democracy, but also that of "a
protector of peace in the Asia-Pacific region and of an active
participant in the international community."</P>
      <P>At the end of his National Day message, the president led the
crowd in shouting "long live democracy," "long live the people of
Taiwan," and "long live the Republic of China."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Multiparty Task Force on relations
across the Taiwan Strait will meet again Saturday to work out
strategy for helping the government break the current cross-strait
stalemate.</P>
      <P>This will be the task force's second meeting since its
formation in August. The 25-member group, headed by Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, met for the first time on Sept. 2.</P>
      <P>Sources said task force members have proposed more than
80 topics concerning the development of cross-strait relations. The
upcoming meeting is expected to map out a list of priorities for
discussion.</P>
      <P>Among the proposed topics, the issue regarding the so-called
"1992 consensus" between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait will
be given the priority. SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary
bodies authorized by their respective governments to handle
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>In addition to discussing principles and directions for the
future development of cross-strait ties, sources said, the Multiparty
Task Force is also expected to come up with some concrete proposals
for forging cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>As the people of Taiwan remain divided over future
cross-strait ties, President Chen Shui-bian has appointed Lee,
a Nobel laureate, to organize the Multiparty Task Force to
help forge a national consensus on the thorny issue.</P>
      <P>The task force, composed of representatives from across the
political and social spectrum, will serve as President Chen's
advisory board in formulating Taiwan's policy and strategy toward
mainland China.</P>
      <P>As the task force has yet to work out detailed procedural rules,
sources said, it still takes a certain period of time before the
panel can present concrete recommendations on substantive
cross-strait issues.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following is the full text of Republic of
China President Chen Shui-bian's address delivered Tuesday at a
Presidential Office ceremony marking the Dorble Ten Naitonal Day:
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN</P>
      <P>Today is the 89th National Day of the Republic of China. We are
solemnly celebrating our country's birthday with thanks, as this
year's national day has particular historical significance.</P>
      <P>At the end of the 20th century, the 23 million people on Taiwan
achieved, with love and courage, the first peaceful transfer of power
through a change of ruling parties in the history of the Republic of
China or any other Chinese society for that matter. After many years
of living under emergency-decree and authoritarian rule in Taiwan, we
finally used ballots to proudly announce to the world: "The people in
Taiwan now stand up. Taiwan is now part of the worldwide trend of
democracy and freedom."</P>
      <P>From the very moment of my inauguration as President on May 20, I
have felt not a sense of gratification or elation, but a deep sense
of responsibility. Now that the emotional heat generated by the
election campaign has subsided, we face not only the serious ills and
corrupt practices left by the past authoritarian regime, but also the
verbal attacks and military threats from the Chinese mainland, which
serve to put the wisdom of the new government to a serious test.</P>
      <P>Thus, maintaining a stable, peaceful, and secure environment has
become the top priority of the new government. If we cannot
immediately ease cross-strait tensions, strengthen our diplomatic
front, and boost the morale of the armed forces, it will be
impossible for us to implement various domestic reforms, because
nothing can be achieved without the guarantees of national security
and a secure international status.</P>
      <P>We fully understand that all our fellow countrymen have high
expectations of the new government. The international community is
also waiting to see how the new government will ensure peace in the
Taiwan Strait. However, no reform can be achieved in no time. Nor can
the backlog of encumbrances that has been accumulated for decades be
completely cleared in just a few months. Normalizing cross-strait
relations also takes greater wisdom and patience.</P>
      <P>Over the past five months or so, the new government has been
subjected to severe oversight and criticism from citizens and the
opposition. We modestly accept advice and make improvements. After
the recent adjustments, the new government, with more experience, is
leaving the meandering and rugged mountain path behind and moving
onto a smooth highway. The government is now ready to launch at full
throttle into its very full agenda. We are confident that the new
administration will implement various reforms on a planned basis and
efficiently.</P>
      <P>In light of the international trends and the domestic demand, we
must expedite national development projects and meet the expectations
of the people. The following reforms and initiatives will be carried
out:</P>
      <P>Firstly, we must crack down on money politics and corruption,
raise government efficiency, improve law and order, speed up judicial
reform, implement educational reforms, and establish a partnership
between the government and private enterprises. These actions will
strengthen our basis for national development as we face an
increasingly competitive world. (more)</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With regard to economic development, we will keep abreast of the
international trend of developing the knowledge-based economy, and
use Taiwan's high-tech comparative advantage to realize our goal of
turning Taiwan into a "Green Silicon Island." As we are entering the
World Trade Organization, we have to help traditional industries
initiate necessary changes and upgrading and remove obstacles to
foreign investment. They will then be better able to cope with a more
liberalized world.</P>
      <P>As to social security, we will strengthen our preparations and
defenses against natural disasters. We will also eliminate the
narrow-minded and self-centered mentality and the habit of passing
the buck. We must instead forge a community sense of lending a hand
to those who suffer. Lastly, we will guarantee social justice, ensure
the rule of law, and safeguard the welfare of the disadvantaged
groups so as to establish a safe, stable, and secure society.</P>
      <P>In the field of national security, we will upgrade essential
military equipment, strengthen civil defense and psywar preparedness,
and continue to carry out the military downsizing and enhancement
program. Furthermore, as a contributor to regional peace, we support
security in the Asia-Pacific region and world peace.</P>
      <P>In cross-strait relations, we are sincere and patient in seeking
"goodwill reconciliation, active cooperation, and long-lasting
peace." We call on the leaders of the other side to join us in
returning to the "spirit of 1992", put aside disputes, and resume
dialogue and exchange as soon as possible. Thus, we can break the
deadlock and achieve a "win-win" situation. Meanwhile, we reiterate
our position that the resolution of cross-strait issues and the
future of Taiwan must respect the will of the 23 million people in
the Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen, during its 89-year history the ROC has
experienced an initial period of trials and tribulations, received
assistance from foreign nations and become self-reliant, undergone
colonial and authoritarian rule, and won worldwide acclamation with
an economic miracle. Finally, before the end of the century, Taiwan
has accomplished a democratic change of political parties in power, a
"political miracle" that gives impetus to our entry into the new
century.</P>
      <P>Despite a difficult survival amid internal worries and foreign
threats, the ROC still stands on its feet and strides forward. This
demonstrates the unyielding and unswerving spirit of the people on
Taiwan. We can proudly stride forward on the world stage because of
our economic and democratic record.</P>
      <P>On the threshold of a new era, our new government, based on the
solid foundation that has been laid, commits itself to a series of
reforms, which will instill uplifting energy into the ROC. At the
turn of the century, I sincerely urge all our citizens to place the
interests of the nation and our people above those of any political
party or individual. Together, we take upon ourselves the lofty duty
of enhancing the welfare of our descendants.</P>
      <P>On this glorious day, I invite my 23 million compatriots to
join me in wishing the Republic of China the best of everything. May
the Republic of China enjoy a long and prosperous future and all my
compatriots peace and happiness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DOES NOT RULE OUT UNIFICATION: HSIEH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party does
not rule out "unification with mainland China" as an option for
Taiwan's future, DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said in a recent interview
with the Voice of America, which was broadcast Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also said if mainland China adjusts its policy and
strategy and shows brotherly love for Taiwan, the number of
pro-unification Taiwan residents will certainly increase.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further warned in the interview with the VOA
Chinese-language program "China Forum" that if military force is
used in resolving the disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the future generations of the people on both sides will
surely suffer from its after-effects no matter whether the result is
unification or Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who concurrently serves as mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan's
second largest city, said the DPP's ultimate mission is to
protect Taiwan people's freedom and legitimate rights to choose
their own lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Hsieh said, the DPP's basic stance lies in its
insistence that any change to Taiwan's present status quo -- either
unification with the mainland or the establishment of a Republic of
Taiwan -- must be decided by its people through a plebiscite.</P>
      <P>As for how the people of Taiwan will decide, Hsieh said the DPP,
now the Republic of China's ruling party, does not rule out any
option and will fully respect the people's choice.</P>
      <P>Noting that the main reason behind Taiwan people's opposition to
unification at the moment lies in the fact that the People's
Republic of China lacks appeals. "Few of our people agree with
the PRC's repressive rule," he explained.</P>
      <P>Hsieh went on to say that if the PRC shows more goodwill toward
Taiwan -- such as renouncing its attempt to use force against Taiwan
-- more Taiwan residents may lean toward unification.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that if mainland China displays its brotherly
love for Taiwan and stops blocking Taiwan's bid to enter the
United Nations, the number of Taiwanese people supporting
unification will increase steadily," Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>The lawyer-turned-politician stressed that the current
cross-strait problems does not lie in the DPP's opposition to
unification nor have anything to do with the party's
pro-independence platform. "The reality is that the people of Taiwan
do not want unification," he noted.</P>
      <P>For the DPP, Hsieh said, unification is not the sole option for
Taiwan's future, but is indeed one of the options.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said mainland China should make self-reflection on
Taiwan people's opposition to unification. "The PRC has hurt Taiwan
people's dignity by intimidating and coercing them to accept the
Beijing-proposed unification terms," he said, adding that none of
residents in democratic Taiwan would buy Beijing's intimidation.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, the DPP has not dictated any option for
Taiwan's future. "What we have set is a process for changing
Taiwan's present status quo -- holding a plebiscite," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC WILL NOT BE 'BLACKMAILED' BY SOLOMONS, SAYS MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of uncertainty over diplomatic
relations with the Solomon Islands, the Republic of China has
measured the situation and is prepared for the worst, sources from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The unexpected absence of Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Denny
Philip from the celebrations of ROC National Day Tuesday has
triggered speculation that bilateral ties between the two countries
may be hanging in the balance.</P>
      <P>Philip was scheduled to arrive in Taipei last Friday for a
six-day visit, but he never showed up. In addition to joining
celebrations of Taiwan's National Day, he was scheduled to officially
open the Solomon Islands embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed sources said Philip has left the Solomon Islands and
is on his way to Beijing. The MOFA officials said they could not
confirm that report.</P>
      <P>But one thing is sure, MOFA officials said -- the ROC will not be
"blackmailed" by the Solomon Islands if Beijing lures the Pacific
nation into its fold with dollar diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao noted that it is still too
early to speculate on relations between the Solomons and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On financial assistance to the Solomon Islands, Tien said
continued cash aid is likely, but it should not exceed what Taiwan
can afford. He added that as a foreign minister, he is also
responsible for watching over the government's purse.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao claimed that Beijing has no idea about Philip's whereabouts,
but added that the PRC is willing to foster formal relations with all
nations -- as long as they recognize that there is only one China in
the world.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Solomon Islands reported that the political
situation there is very much on the brink, with political tensions
among rival factions that have simmered over the last two years now
coming to a boil.</P>
      <P>Under the brokerage of Australia and New Zealand, warring Solomon
Islands factions began talks Tuesday in Sydney. The negotiations are
widely seen as the last chance to bring about peace in that country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER WELCOMES RESUMPTION OF AIR LINK WITH PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,   Oct.   10   (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of
Transportation and Communications Yeh Chu-lan on Tuesday welcomed the
resumption of Taiwan's direct air link with the Philippines, and
urged both sides to treasure their bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Manila, Yeh said that the resumption of the direct
air link between Taiwan and the Philippines also represents the
reopening of all kinds of exchanges between the two countries. She
urged both sides to work hard for their mutual benefit, and to ensure
that the air link is permanent.</P>
      <P>The ROC's first female transportation is in Manila at the
invitation of the Philippines' General Chamber of Industry and
Commerce. She made the remarks in a speech at the organization's
annual meeting.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that Taiwan is promoting the liberalization of its
telecommunications industry in order to satisfy public demand for
telecommunications services.</P>
      <P>She added that Taiwan is also working to step up its Internet
know-how in an attempt to be a part of what she called the
frontierless global economy.</P>
      <P>Referring to tourism, Yeh indicated that the Philippines, which
is rich in tourist attractions and friendly people, is a favorite
destination for Taiwan travelers. However, the number of Taiwan
tourists visiting the Philippines fell significantly during the
dispute over air rights, she added.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the resumption of the direct air link between Taipei and
Manila is likely to bring about more frequent exchanges between the
two countries in the economic, commercial, tourist and cultural
areas.</P>
      <P>Air links between the ROC and Philippines had been suspended for
nearly one year because of the termination of the aviation agreement
between the two countries and the failure to agree on a new one.
Taipei and Manila finally signed an agreement to restore their air
link in late September.</P>

      <P>The Chinese National Federation of

week to discuss issues related to domestic industries.</P>
      <P>The new government has put forward a series of new policies since
taking power on May 20, such as shortening of the work week, reducing
the number of foreign laborers, and implementing a five-day workweek
on an all-out basis. The moves have sent shock waves throughout the
island's industrial circles.</P>
      <P>The most controversial issue of all -- the fight over whether to
continue the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant --
resulted in the resignation of former Premier Tang Fei last Tuesday,
aggravating bearishness sentiment in the local stock market and
causing further public anxiety about the island's economic outlook.</P>
      <P>Tang, a member of the opposition Kuomintang, supports going ahead
with the construction of the nuclear power plant, which contradicts

      <P>CNFI officials said that although the Cabinet has completed a
minor reshuffle, the issues that concern domestic industries have

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two mainland Chinese fishing boats and 16
people aboard were nabbed Tuesday for poaching in territorial waters
of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In a routine patrol along the coast off Penghu, a patrol boat of
the Coast Guard Administration Penghu Squad spotted two mainland
Chinese fishing boats -- the Minlungyu 0234 and the Minshihyu 0250 --
fishing in an area only 8 nautical miles off the coast of Penghu's
Hsiyu, or Western Isle.</P>
      <P>The two boats -- both roller bottom trawlers -- were caught red
handed operating in ROC waters, the maritime police said.</P>
      <P>One of the seized boats, the Minlungyu 0234, was actually found
to be the same vessel that was caught by the Penghu coastal patrol
forces and released on Sept. 3.</P>
      <P>The two trawlers were dragged to Makung Harbor for investigation.
They were released after the seizure of their catches and
environmentally destructive fishing gear. The seized equipment is of
a design that not only catches small fish, but also unnecessarily
kills other ocean lives.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese fishing boats have become increasingly daring
and active in recent months, brazenly cruising ROC waters to poach or
conduct illegal trade in the belief that the Taiwan authorities can
not effectively deal with them, the Penghu maritime police sources
said.</P>

to mark the Republic of China National Day at Nantou County's Chichi
Township, ground zero of last year's disastrous Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Also present at the ceremony were more than 100 local victims of the

      <P>Lien criticized the Democratic Progressive Party-led
administration as failing to speed up earthquake reconstruction work,
now languishing far behind schedule.</P>
      <P>As a result, over 60 percent of quake victims are awaiting jobs

jobless and have no prospects for employment, Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also told the participants that the KMT has carried out all

KMT lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan had enacted relevant

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-RUSSIA AIR LINK STILL FACING LONG ROAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By S.F. Wong &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Talk of establishing air links between
Taiwan and Russia seemed to have sparked up again following a visit
by a group of Russian parliamentarians to Minister of Transport and
Communications Yeh Chu-lan, with China Airlines and Russia's
Transaero resuming talks on cooperation.</P>
      <P>However, an official of the Civil Aeronautics Administration
under the MOTC said that Taiwan and Russia have a long road ahead
before a direct air link between the two countries can be
established.</P>
      <P>Actually, the Taipei -Moscow Economic and Cultural Coordination
Commission's office in Moscow and its counterpart's office in Taipei
inked the protocol for an aviation pact between Taipei and Moscow in
1993.</P>
      <P>However, the Russian side canceled the agreement shortly after it
was signed.</P>
      <P>Talks resumed again in 1997, and a breakthrough seemed imminent
when China Airlines and Transaero were chosen to fly the
Taipei-Moscow route. CAL planned to inaugurate air services between
Taipei and Moscow in September 1997, but Russia denied the aviation
agreement again, on the grounds that the protocol was incomplete.</P>
      <P>In the beginning of 1998, Russia again sent a delegation to three
days of talks with Taiwan agencies concerned. But the agreement died
again in the wake of the Russian government's reshuffling.</P>
      <P>Despite the repeated setbacks, periodic contacts have continued
over the past two years. The Russian side has insisted that in
addition to signing the aviation agreement, the two parties must sign
a commercial agreement. CAL is now carefully studying the contents of
the proposed commercial agreement.</P>
      <P>A CAL staffer said that the Taipei-Moscow line would not be
particularly beneficial from a business standpoint, so CAL is
negotiating with the Russians to obtain third-country air rights.
This would allow a link to Frankfort, Germany, which would make the
Taipei-Moscow line profitable. But he added that CAL has balked at
the high price Russia has demanded for the rights.</P>
      <P>The CAL official said that the two parties have already managed
to reach some consensus, but there are still some differences that
need to be addressed.</P>
      <P>According to an official who took part the negotiations for an
aviation agreement between Taipei and Moscow, Russia intends to sign
a commercial agreement to replace the aviation agreement. Taiwan is
reluctant to accept Russian proposal because it would not only
downgrade Taiwan's status but also cause many harmful aftereffects,
he said.</P>
      <P>A CAA official said judging from past negotiations with the
Russians, an aviation agreement that would uphold both sides' dignity
is not likely to be signed anytime soon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's travel agents have been busy
planning new travel packages for local tourists, as they look forward
to next year's implementation of a five-day workweek for public
servants.</P>
      <P>According to surveys conducted by tourist agencies, travel
packages that offer a two- or three-day itinerary are currently most
popular among local customers. Some tourism entrepreneurs, including
managers of entertainment parks and hot spring hotels, have already
begun intensifying efforts to lure local tourists.</P>
      <P>However, the implementation of a five-day workweek is not the
only reason that travel agencies are stepping up efforts to lure
customers. The other reason is simple survival, as tourism is
expected to take a blow from the slumping stock market. The past four
months have seen a bear market that has so far resulted in the loss
of nearly NT$3,000 billion (US$96.8 billion) in equity capital.</P>
      <P>According to official statistics, the decrease in the value of
all the stocks on the local bourse represents an average loss of
NT$200,000 (US$6,450) for every ROC citizen.</P>
      <P>When personal wealth decreases, consumers generally first cut
their expenses in traveling, and then stop spending on cars, jewelry,
and clothes.</P>
      <P>Travel agents said that since the stock market slump began,
inexpensive travel packages have become more popular than before.
Meanwhile, some agents have made their prices for expensive packages
negotiable.</P>
      <P>Despite a weak stock market, travel agencies are not giving up
hope, and instead are urging people to take more vacations so as to
take advantage of the current cheap prices for travel packages.</P>

      <P>The Solomon Islands' formal and cordial
relations with the Republic of China have not changed, and its stance
in support of the ROC in the international community also remains
unchanged, the Solomons envoy in the ROC stressed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Seth Gukuna said that any visit to Beijing by his
country's foreign minister, Denny Philip, should be viewed as a
"personal" act that will have no impact on bilateral relations
between the ROC and the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>Gukuna said his government will issue a statement Wednesday to
officially announce that formal and cordial ROC-Solomons relations
remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Gukuna was obviously in an awkward situation Tuesday evening,
when he attended a state banquet hosted by the ROC government on the
occasion of Taiwan's Double-Ten National Day. The Solomons envoy was
hotly pursued by Taipei reporters, who demanded an explanation of
Philip's unexpected visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Solomons foreign minister was scheduled to arrive in Taipei
last Friday for a six-day visit, but he never showed up. In addition
to joining the celebrations of ROC National Day, he was scheduled to
officially open the Solomon Islands embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Officials from the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been
scrambling to ascertain Philip's whereabouts for the last five days
amid rumors that he had shifted his destination from Taipei to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Gukuna also rebuked foreign wire service reports that the
Solomons government had instructed Philip to delay his visit to
Taipei because of Taiwan's recent political problems as "groundless."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien Hung-mao said earlier in
the day that Philip was "probably in Beijing," but added that it is
still too early to speculate on relations between the Solomons and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tien noted that Taiwan is likely to continue its financial
assistance, but he stressed that the aid should not exceed what
Taiwan can afford. He added that as a foreign minister, he is also

at the Ching embassy in London. He was later rescued by his British

weeks of negotiations and that unsolved problems are to be settled by
a political consultative conference.

Inner Mongolia from the Chinese communists.

1957: The world's largest steerable radio-telescope goes into

1975: A two-day national conference on "Building a New Asia
Through Moral Rearmaments" opens in Taipei.

Lesotho, Swaziland, and South Africa.

opens at the Taipei Municipal Stadium with 13 teams from Asia,

China begins.

1992: President Lee Teng-hui and Panamanian President Guillermo
Endara sign a joint communique on expanding bilateral cooperation.

1997: Leaders of some 40 nations end a rare Council of Europe
summit with pledges regarding human rights and human cloning.

outskirts of Taipei to mourn the 2,321 people who died in the
devastating earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only he in this world who is
possessed of absolute truth that can order and adjust the great
relations of human society, fix the fundamental principles of
morality, and understand the laws of creation of the Universe."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LANGUAGE POLICY SHOULD BE DECIDED BY HIGHER-LEVEL SAYS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Education Minister Ovid Tzeng insisted
Wednesday that the government's Romanization spelling system, which
is of vital importance to the nation's language policy, should be
decided on by a level of government higher than the Ministry of
Education (MOE).</P>
      <P>Tzeng said the MOE is working to present two Romanization systems
-- mainland China's Hanyu Pinyin scheme and the locally-developed
Tongyong spelling system -- to the Cabinet for final decision on
which to make standard in the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Answering a question raised by People First Party Legislator Lee
Ching-an at the Legislative Yuan, Tzeng admitted that he personally
prefers the Hanyu Pinyin system.</P>
      <P>Tzeng, himself a linguist, stressed that while most
Mandarin-speaking people in the rest of the world use the Hanyu
Pinyin system, "we cannot ask them not to use it," adding that it's
important for the people in Taiwan to "cope with world trends."</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-minister said he believes that he will not be
forced to step down because he holds a different opinion from those
in the MOE or other related government agencies. "Language policy
should be made after rational considerations," he noted.</P>
      <P>Tzeng's remarks came three days after Vice Education Minister Fan
Shuan-lu announced that the ministry, in accordance with the
conclusion made by a group of linguistic experts, had decided to
adopt the Tongyong system.</P>
      <P>During a news conference jointly held by Tzeng and Fan on Monday,
Fan called on the different groups concerned to view the issue in a
more open-minded way.</P>
      <P>Fan said the gap between the two systems is not as wide as many
people imagine. Around 85 percent of the two systems are the same,
she added.</P>
      <P>"It's a thorny issue for the new government -- although the
former administration decided earlier to adopt the Hanyu Pinyin
system, it failed to put it into practice due to too much discord --
but no antagonism should be produced because of it," she noted.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said that as head of the education ministry, he has to
respect the conclusion arrived at by the National Language Promotion
Commission. But he added that as a linguist, he prefers Beijing's
Hanyu Pinyin system, now used by Taipei City for road signs and place
names.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the issue stems from the previous
government's demand in the late 1990s for a modern, standardized
Romanization system to help foreigners pronounce Chinese words as an
important step in transforming the island into a worldwide business
hub.</P>
      <P>As a result, the National Language Promotion Commission under the
MOE recommended in August 1999 that Taiwan adopt Beijing's Hanyu
Pinyin system on the grounds that it is widely used around the world
and is recognized by the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Although adopting the Hanyu Pinyin system would be politically
difficult for Taiwan in light of its painstaking efforts to
distinguish itself as a sovereign entity separate from mainland
China, the Cabinet under former Premier Vincent Siew agreed to
endorse the plan, but demanded supplementary measures to facilitate
its implementation.</P>
      <P>Siew and his administration stepped down before the system was
officially adopted by the government, and a new panel under the
education ministry canceled the decision. The new panel members
argued in favor of the Tongyong system, which was developed by a
local scholar from the new National Language Promotion Commission.</P>
      <P>They recommended the Tongyong system on the grounds that it
accounts for various existing systems used to teach local dialects,
whereas the Hanyu Pinyin system does not.</P>
      <P>The panel's decision has caused an outcry from Taipei City Hall,
which has already begun changing the capital's road signs according
to the Hanyu Pinyin Romanization system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DIRECT AIRLINKS WITH EUROPE TO BE EXPANDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three European countries have agreed to
exchange "temporary aviation rights" with the Republic of China to
facilitate bilateral visits, the Civil Aeronautics Administration
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Chang Yu-hern confirmed a newspaper report
that Spain, Denmark and the Czech Republic have promised to offer
third and fourth freedoms to Taiwan carriers.</P>
      <P>With the third and fourth freedoms, Taiwan carriers will be able
to transport passengers and freight directly from Taiwan to the three
European countries.</P>
      <P>Chang said the three countries have expressed welcome to the
opening of direct flight services by Taiwan's China Airlines and EVA
Airways to their major cities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the Netherlands has agreed to allow
Taiwan carriers to increase two weekly cargo flights from Oct. 29.
Chang said Taiwan's flagship China Airlines (CAL) will be granted the
right to operate the additional cargo flights to Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the CAA sent an official delegation to visit
the four European countries in late September to explore the
possibility of expanding the ROC's airlinks with Europe.</P>
      <P>The delegation consistently kept low profile during its 12-day
visit to avoid mainland China's boycott as the four European
countries all recognize Beijing and only maintain unofficial ties
with the ROC.</P>
      <P>The ROC has long maintained a formal aviation agreement with the
Netherlands, allowing carriers from both countries to operate direct
passenger and cargo flight services between Taipei and Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chang said, the CAA delegation easily
reached a consensus with the Dutch civil aviation authority on the
revision of the existing bilateral aviation accord to allow CAL to
add two weekly cargo flights to its service schedule.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Chang said, the CAA delegation only scored
"symbolic" results in its aviation rights negotiations with Spain,
Denmark and the Czech Republic.</P>
      <P>The ROC has never signed any formal aviation pact with the three
European countries. For fears of offending mainland China, the three
countries are reluctant to seal any formal accords with the ROC.
They would only sign "temporary aviation pacts" with Taiwan on a
reciprocal basis.</P>
      <P>"As the civil aviation policies of the three European countries
remain very conservative, the ROC must seek a major diplomatic
breakthrough before it can convince them to sign formal aviation
accords to pave the way for permanent direct airlinks," Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Noting that none of the three countries would offer the critical
fifth freedom -- the right to extending flights to third destinations
-- to Taiwan carriers, Chang said their offer to exchange "temporary
aviation rights" has only symbolic meaning and has little substantive
effect.</P>
      <P>"Without the fifth freedom, Taiwan carriers will have little
interest in opening direct flight services to the three European
countries due to gloomy profit prospects," Chang said, adding that
the third and fourth freedoms will only enable local carriers to
transport cargoes and passengers directly to the three countries.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said, the proposed temporary aviation
agreements can be suspended at any time and provide little
guarantees to Taiwan carriers' rights and interests.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chang said, the CAA hopes that local
carriers will not open direct passenger flights to the three European
countries until after the ROC manages to sign formal aviation pacts
with them.</P>
      <P>As it is easier for carriers to cope with the aftermath of
abrupt suspension of cargo flights, Chang said the CAA will not
oppose plans by any local carrier to open such services to the three
European countries.</P>
      <P>In addition to the Netherlands, Taiwan has also signed formal
aviation agreements with three other European countries -- Italy,
France and Britain, allowing its carriers to operate direct flights
to Rome, Paris and London.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NSC NOT WORRIED ABOUT OUTFLOW OF LOCAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) is
dedicated to solving problems for domestic technology industries and
does not worry about their outbound investment, said NSC Chairman
Weng Cheng-i on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Weng made the remarks while fielding questions about the trend of
domestic technology industries shifting abroad and the attitude of
the NSC toward the problem.</P>
      <P>Weng noted that only about 300 computer peripheral companies in
the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park are investing in the
mainland, saying there is no reason to worry.</P>
      <P>He said that the NSC has been dedicated to solving the problems
of high-technology industries and that statistics have demonstrated a
net influx of technology talent so far, so there is no need to worry
about the outflow of technology industries and a talent drain.</P>
      <P>He also said that the NSC is now working with the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to revise the regulations concerning high-tech
mainland Chinese talent working in Taiwan. He expressed the hope
these skilled workers will be allowed to stay in Taiwan for up to
three years at a time so as to help develop domestic industries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Weng also said that even if the fourth nuclear power
plant is scrapped, there will not be any power shortage problems for
science-based industrial parks.</P>
      <P>He said that Tainan Science-based Industrial Park needs about
1,000 megawatts of electricity over the long term, adding that it can
rely on the thermoelectric-power plant as well as the second and
third nuclear power plants in southern Taiwan for its power supply.</P>
      <P>As for Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, Weng said that it
is estimated that the park will reach its peak electricity
consumption rate in 2004, at which time it will have 900 megawatts of
its own electric power, so meeting the park's power needs won't pose
a problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. MUST GUARD AGAINST MILITARY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFERS TO PRC: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Now that the issue of permanent normal
trade relations between the United States and Communist China has
been settled, the Clinton administration must take appropriate
precautions to keep the People's Liberation Army from acquiring
sensitive dual-use U.S. technology to improve its weapon-making
capabilities, warned a renowned China expert Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Larry M. Wortzel, director of the Asian Studies Center at The
Heritage Foundation, wrote in a background analysis that to help
ensure that the transfer of sensitive technology does not occur,
Congress enacted legislation in 1998 requiring the Clinton
administration to publish a list of Chinese companies in the United
States that do business with the PLA. But to date, the administration
has failed to comply with that law, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>The debate in Washington over export controls to prevent the sale
of such technology to China was temporarily set aside during the
debate over PNTR, he noted.</P>
      <P>"Congress should take up this matter now by demanding that the
administration comply with the law and publish the required list so
appropriate action can be taken to ensure that sensitive dual-use
American technology is not being acquired by the PLA," wrote the
former U.S. Army attache in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wortzel emphasized that despite President Bill Clinton's
assertions about China during his summits with Jiang Zemin in both
Washington in 1997 and Shanghai in 1998, "China is in fact not a
`strategic partner' of the United States. Its aggressive behavior
continues to threaten peace and stability in Asia."</P>
      <P>Beijing's military modernization program relies heavily on
foreign technology that it acquires through direct purchases or
reverse engineering. "If appropriate precautions are not taken by the
administration to restrict the sale of dual-use technology, a higher
volume of trade with China could increase the chances that such
sensitive technology will get into the PLA's hands," he said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wortzel wrote, China's acquisition of dual-use
technology and diversion of this technology to military use has
serious implications for U.S. national security. Beijing has
threatened to use force against the democratic Republic of China on
Taiwan, and it bitterly resents that the United States sent two
aircraft carrier battle groups to the Taiwan Straits when the PLA
conducted live-firings of missiles there in 1996.</P>
      <P>Beijing also vowed recently to respond militarily to any attempt
by U.S. armed forces to assist Taiwan in the event of an aggressive
act by China. If Beijing does attempt to solve the Taiwan issue by
force, the U.S. military will be drawn into the conflict.</P>
      <P>"The risk that U.S. technology could make the PLA more effective
against the United States in such a confrontation means that the
United States must carefully monitor high-technology sales to China.
Negligence on the part of the administration could lead to an
unacceptable scenario in which U.S. technology is used against
American soldiers," said Wortzel.</P>
      <P>He added that publishing a list of Communist Chinese companies
that do business with the PLA "will reduce both the risk to U.S.
military forces stationed around the world and the chances that sale
of American technology to a Chinese military-related company
operating in the United States could be approved by mistake."</P>
      <P>"Compiling the list might not be easy, but failing to compile it
could cost American lives. The Clinton administration owes it to the
American people to uphold the law and identify these companies,"
concluded the China expert.</P>

      <P>The Australian government has set an
ambitious target of winning a 30 percent share of the rapidly growing
markets in Taiwan and other Asian countries for the country's
liquefied natural gas within 20 years.</P>
      <P>Resources Minister Nick Minchin on Wednesday announced that
Australia's LNG industry would receive new tax relief through the
removal of tariffs on equipment used in LNG plants not available in
Australia.</P>
      <P>He said the government would still decide policy on tax
arrangements that would make new investment in the LNG industry more
competitive with international suppliers.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that the government recognizes the need to
implement strategies to remove impediments to business and to
increase international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Wednesday, Karyn Freeman of Shell
Australia said the tax incentives would have a significant impact on
the LNG industry, giving producers and exporters a more competitive

      <P>"We believe our government now recognizes the importance of the

    <HEADLINE>FINANCE MINISTER OPPOSES LOWERING TAXES TO PROP UP STOCK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang on
Wednesday expressed his opposition to suggestions that the government
lower the business tax imposed on financial institutions and the
stock transaction tax in order to help prop up the slumping stock
market.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Yen said the business
tax revenue generated from financial institutions cannot be cut as it
is one of the major sources of the government's revenue, adding that
40 percent of this income is regularly allocated to local governments
around the island.</P>
      <P>Yen, a Kuomintang member, was appointed on Oct. 5 to replace Shea
Jia-dong, who offered his resignation on Oct. 4 to take token
responsibility for the plunging stock market, which has lost
one-third of its value since the inauguration of the new
administration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Yen also said "no" to another legislator's suggestion that the
government lower the stock transaction tax or stop imposing the stock
transaction tax for one or two months so as to stimulate trading.</P>
      <P>He stressed that lowering the stock transaction tax would be an
act harmful to the healthy long-term development of the stock market
and would only benefit short-lived bargain hunting which is not a
desirable method for stabilizing the market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yen, answering a question on whether the finance
ministry will keep in place the temporary measure halving the regular
7 percent cap on the maximum allowable single-day fall in stock
prices, said the six-day mercy scheme implemented for the period Oct.
4-11 will end Thursday as scheduled and the 7 percent two-way
variation caps will resume simultaneously.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance had made an emergency announcement on
Oct. 3 that the maximum single-day fall in stock prices would be
halved beginning Oct. 4 in an attempt to minimize the impact on the
local bourse of ex-Premier Tang Fei's announcement of his
resignation, which sent shockwaves through Taiwan's political,
economic, and social arenas.</P>
      <P>On the movement of the National Stabilization Fund, which has
been used regularly by the government to prop up the market when
stock prices plummet, Yen said the fund was not instructed to buy
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao ridiculed Yen as having
"heightened" his own image and popularity by "scheming" to have the
TAIEX weighted index jump on the first day of his resuming the post
of finance minister. The finance minister is the only person eligible
to authorize the movement of the National Stabilization Fund.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the National Stabilization Fund, which has already
spent some NT$100 billion on the stock market over the past four
months, has suffered a loss of at least NT$30 billion so far, while
the Four Major Fund, another fire-fighting arm of the government's
finance sector, has lost some NT$50 billion after investing NT$500
billion in the stock market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGED TO GET IN CLOSER TOUCH WITH GRASS-ROOTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, should visit the countryside more often to get in closer
touch with the people, said Hsu Shu-po, a KMT legislator Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that if Lien stays in Taipei most of the time, then
people living in other places may not feel what the KMT is doing.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who is also a member of the KMT Central Standing Committee,
made the remarks at a KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>He said that he has concerns about the outcome of next year's
crucial legislative elections, saying that polls have shown that
support for the KMT has continued to slump.</P>
      <P>He noted that although the public is disappointed with the
performance of the new administration over its first four months in
power, public support for the KMT has not increased correspondingly,
adding that even with the ongoing drive to bring former KMT
supporters back into the party's fold, there has only been a less
than 10 percent re-registration rate.</P>
      <P>He said that many KMT veterans were so disappointed after the
KMT's crashing defeat in the March presidential election, they
cannot see why they would want to return. The KMT, although boasting
the largest number of members of any party at 2 million, still
finished third in the election with only 23.1 percent of the vote and
is therefore holding its re-registration campaign until the end of
the year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that as the KMT lost the presidency, and more recently
the premiership, if the party loses its dominance in the Legislative
Yuan after next year's elections, it will be left with nothing no
matter what it says or does.</P>
      <P>He said that the grass-roots KMT members should be made to feel
the party reforms and that the future course of the party will be
best demonstrated by what the party chairman has done. He therefore
suggested that Lien visit the countryside more often to get in real
touch with the party's grass-roots following, saying that this is
absolutely the right course to follow.</P>
      <P>He noted that the KMT cannot expect to gain greater popularity
for any single thing and that the party can only achieve this goal
through its long-term efforts, adding that the party chairman has a
crucial role in winning over the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT PITCHES FOR INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR ROC'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday urged
the international community to assist in the Republic of China's bid
to join the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while meeting with delegates to the
2000 Congress of the International Health Evaluation Association,
which is being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has not only made enviable headway in economic
development and political democratization but also have scored
brilliant achievements in public health and medical services.</P>
      <P>"Our progress in contagious diseases prevention and control,
family planning and enforcement of a national health insurance
program has won world recognition," Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, the ROC has been shut out of the WHO
for more than two decades simply because of political reasons --
Beijing's recalcitrant opposition.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is more than willing to share its experience
and achievements in various medical fields with the international
community, Chen said, its lack of representation in the WHO has
hindered such a drive.</P>
      <P>"The ROC's absence is not only a setback for Taiwan but also
a great loss for the WHO and the entire world society,"
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>The president further said polio has been eradicated in
Taiwan since 1982, while mainland China just rid itself of the
infectious disease four years ago.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, the WHO has declined to recognize Taiwan's
achievement in polio eradication. The WHO's West Pacific
branch didn't mention Taiwan in its regional polio report to the
WHO headquarters, even though the branch has listed Taiwan as a
polio-free area.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the WHO is scheduled to grant a polio-free
certificate to mainland China at the end of October and formally
declare the entire West Pacific as a polio-free region.</P>
      <P>"We feel deep regret over the WHO's discrimination against
Taiwan," Chen said, adding that political force has prompted the WHO
to ignore Taiwan's efforts in polio prevention and eradication.
"The WHO's handling of the issue is extremely unfair to the 23
million people of Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen further said despite Taiwan's economic strength --
the world's third largest foreign exchange reserves holder and the
15th largest trading power -- it has been shut out of the United
Nations, the WHO and many other major international organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC will never be daunted by the
unfavorable international conditions it faces and is
firmly determined to "stand up and walk out" into the world arena.</P>
      <P>"In addition to pursuing sustainable economic growth and
continued democratic reforms, we will seek fair representation
in world organizations and let the world hear the 'voice of
Taiwan,'" Chen pledged.</P>
      <P>He urged representatives of the International Health Evaluation
Association to assist Taiwan in realizing its bid to join the WHO, a
U.N. affiliate.</P>
      <P>No matter how the world treat Taiwan, Chen said, Taiwan will not
cease its efforts to take part in international activities and
organizations.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, was expelled from the United
Nations in 1971 when mainland China claimed the China seat in the
world body.</P>
      <P>The IHEA delegates, including its founder, Morris Collen,
and current IHEA President James B. McCormick, were accompanied by
Lee Ming-liang, head of the Department of Health, during
their meeting with President Chen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MEDICAL SECTOR PROTESTS WHO INJUSTICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Medical workers in Taiwan raised an outcry
Wednesday over what they see as the World Health Organization's
injustice in handling a polio eradication certificate.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan wiped out polio as early as 1982 and the ROC
government has been petitioning the WHO for certification of the
eradication for the past three years, the WHO decided recently to
award the certificate to mainland China instead, sources from
Taiwan's Department of Health said.</P>
      <P>DOH officials said the WHO has earmarked 2000 as the year of
polio eradication in the West Pacific, and the WHO's West Pacific
Headquarters has also decided to include Taiwan within the West
Pacific Polio Free Area this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they pointed out, the report presented to the WHO
Headquarters contains not a reference to Taiwan. When the WHO
releases the latest results of its worldwide fight against polio at
the end of October, it is expected to simultaneously award a
certificate to mainland China for effectively eradicating polio from
the Chinese community.</P>
      <P>The development is undoubtedly a blow to Taiwan's medical
community, which has made strenuous efforts to improve the island's
public health, said Hsu Kuo-hsiung, deputy director of the DOH's
Disease Control Bureau.</P>
      <P>Despite medical workers' tireless efforts to eradicate the
infantile paralysis-inducing disease, the WHO had effectively negated
their success for political reasons, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Only Taiwan has not been granted a polio eradication certificate,
Hsu said. He added that over the last three years, the DOH actively
submitted materials to argue for a WHO certification, including
reports on polio vaccination rates, case reports and laboratory
results.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Shih-chia, director of the Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, the DOH even acted as a sponsor of
a Rotary Club International campaign to recognize world governments'
efforts to eradicate polio.</P>
      <P>The campaign had compiled a fair and just report on the issue,
using international standards. But in the end, the WHO decided to let
mainland China enjoy a free lunch, Lin lamented.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's diplomatic
relations with the Solomon Islands remain normal, despite the Solomon
foreign minister's failure to show up as scheduled at the ROC
National Day celebrations, the ROC foreign minister said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After an opposition party legislator said that Foreign Minister
Tien Hung-mao believes the two countries are facing a "yellow light"
in terms of their diplomatic relations, Tien told the press that
Taiwan's attitude is to plan for the worst but hope the worst will
not happen.</P>
      <P>According to New Party legislator Lai Shyh-bao, Tien had admitted
in a closed-door budget committee meeting earlier in the day that the
Solomon Islands have indeed requested over US$20 million in emergency
financial support, but that Taiwan is still considering the request
because the ROC government does not think it is viable.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Tien went on to say that Taiwan already
allocates over US$10 million for the Solomon Islands every year.</P>
      <P>Denny Philip, the Solomon foreign minister, had been scheduled to
arrive in Taipei last Friday for a six-day visit, but he never showed
up. In addition to joining the celebrations of ROC National Day
Tuesday, he was also scheduled to officially open the Solomon Islands
embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Tien has confirmed that Philip is now in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tien told the media that the Solomon Islands government has
already pointed out that Philip's unfriendly conduct was a "personal
act" that will have no impact on bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Tien added that Taiwan is not going to abandon its Solomon ally,
which is currently facing financial difficulties due to domestic
political unrest, but that the exact amount of financial assistance
will require negotiations.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the ROC will take any opportunity to hold
talks and secure diplomatic ties with other countries. However,
responding to a legislator's claim that the ROC has recently
approached five to 10 countries on establishing relations, he added
that Taiwan has no specific country in mind at the moment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMS STANCE ON CROSS-STRAIT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan, Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>White House spokesman Jake Siewart
said Tuesday that the U.S. policy of encouraging the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to conduct constructive dialogue and resolve disputes
by peaceful means has remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>Siewart was commenting on Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's National Day address in which Chen again pitched for a
return to the "spirit of 1992" and an early resumption of
institutionalized cross-strait dialogue and exchanges to break the
current impasse.</P>
      <P>Siewart said the U.S. policy on cross-strait relations has never
changed, stressing that the United States has consistently
encouraged Taiwan and mainland China to engage in constructive
dialogue, reduce tension and seek peaceful solutions to their
disputes.</P>
      <P>Siewart also reaffirmed the U.S. stance that it will not act as
a go-between or mediator in cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, American Institute in Taiwan Chairman Richard Bush
also said Tuesday that the United States has long looked forward
to seeing Taipei and Beijing resume talks. "We fully agree with
President Chen's call for an early resumption of cross-strait
dialogue," he noted.</P>
      <P>Bush, the top U.S. liaison officer with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties, made the remarks while attending a
cocktail reception hosted by the ROC's representative office
in Washington, D.C. in celebration of the ROC's Double Ten
National Day.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Chen's call for a return to the "spirit of 1992"
as a basis for cross-strait dialogue, Bush said the United
States is not in a position to dictate the basis for Taiwan-mainland
China talks. "We only hope that the two sides can find the best way
for dialogue in the pursuit of mutual benefits."</P>
      <P>Touching on Taipei-Washington relations, Bush said the United
States and the ROC have long enjoyed a good and strong relationship,
adding that he expects this good tie to continue in the future.</P>
      <P>Stressing continuity in the U.S. government policy, Bush said
the outcome of the U.S. congressional and presidential elections will
not lead to dramatic changes in the U.S. policy toward Taiwan and
that ROC-U.S. friendship will further deepen after the elections.</P>
      <P>Bush also reaffirmed no U.S. role in Taiwan's debate on
whether to continue or scrap the controversial fourth nuclear
power plant project. "It's up to Taiwan authority to decide on the
fate of the project," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Bush reiterated what the U.S. government is concerned is whether
contract provisions which Taiwan and the American contractor --
General Electric Co. -- previously agreed upon are fulfilled.</P>
      <P>Bush said he thinks that Taiwan will fulfill its obligations to
compensate GE if it finally decides to scrap the nuclear power plant
project. As for how the scrapping of the project will affect the U.S.
industry's confidence in Taiwan, Bush said it remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 dignitaries, including Panamanian Vice President
Dominador Bazan, who is currently on a visit in Washington, and many
influential U.S. congressional members, attended the reception to
express their best wishes for the ROC.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several leading Kuomintang Standing
Committee members criticized the Democratic Progressive Party
administration Wednesday for what they called its failure to carry
out effective operations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the committee, KMT Chairman Lien Chan
said that the so-called "government of all people" formed by
President Chen Shui-bian on May 20 has virtually collapsed.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the DPP's "minority government,"
established after Premier Tang Fei's resignation last week, goes
against the principles of responsible politics and is unable to
operate effectively.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Chin-pyng, a KMT vice chairman,
said that new Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's call for "replacing
confrontation with cooperation," is actually a manifestation of the
DPP "pursuing its own interests."</P>
      <P>Wang said that the KMT, which controls the most seats in the
Legislative Yuan, must take the lead in directing national affairs
and must take positive steps to solicit greater public support.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-jen, a National Policy Research Foundation fellow, was
invited to make a special report on the prospects for the DPP
minority administration.</P>
      <P>Chou proposed that when a party controls the administration but
does not enjoy a majority in the Legislative Yuan, the president
should name the chairman of the party which controls a majority of
seats as premier.</P>
      <P>If no party controls a majority of seats, he said, a coalition
government should be formed through negotiations among the political
parties.</P>
      <P>After listening to the report, Lien said that as an opposition
party, the KMT should continue to participate in state affairs and
play its proper role as the largest party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Other KMT Standing Committee members, including Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou and Legislator Hsu Shu-po, also directed criticism against
Chen's administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S AVERAGE UNEMPLOYMENT PERIOD REACHES 22.5 WEEKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Blaming the lingering effects of the Asian
financial crisis as well as last year's devastating earthquake, a
Republic of China labor official reported that the average period of
unemployment for jobless Taiwan laborers has reached 22.5 weeks this
year.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chi-jen, vice chairman of Taiwan's Council of Labor Affairs,
said Wednesday in a report to the Legislative Yuan that Taiwan's
unemployment rate usually fluctuated between 1 and 2 percent in the
past. However, unemployment began to climb in 1994, reaching 3.6
percent in July of this year, he added.</P>
      <P>He also noted that the average unemployment period in 1990 was
only 14.8 weeks.</P>
      <P>Kuo attributed the increase in unemployment to lingering effects
of the Asian financial crisis and the temblor that struck Taiwan last
year, which have made finding a job more difficult.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, with unemployed workers mostly middle-aged and elderly
people, CLA Chairwoman Chen Chu told the legislature that public
agencies should be the first to offer job opportunities to them.</P>
      <P>She added that her council has commissioned some foundations to
train the unemployed to do jobs such as child care, teaching, and
housekeeping. She said some 14,000 people will be trained to do these
jobs over the next year.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the CLA will revise the nation's pension system
and possibly stimulate the creation of part-time jobs, which might
help middle-aged and elderly people re-enter the labor market.</P>
      <P>She also indicated that in view of the imminent privatization of
some state-run enterprises, the CLA will train laid-off workers with
new skills, or create incentives for the employers themselves to
offer such training courses, at the agency's expense.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang's Evaluation and
Discipline Committee is scheduled to meet Oct. 19 to discuss possible
disciplinary measures against Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, Finance
Minister Yen Ching-chang, and Legislator Jao Yung-ching, all of whom

      <P>Committee director-general Chien Wei-chang said Wednesday that
the KMT is displeased with Lin's decision to go against the party's
pro-nuclear platform. The economics minister declared in a Sept. 30
recommendation to the Cabinet that he is against continuing the
construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Chien went on to say that his committee will also discuss whether
Jao should be disciplined for his longtime anti-nuclear stance in the
Legislature as well as for joining the so-called "supra-party
cross-strait task force" despite the KMT's disapproval.</P>
      <P>Chien added that because the new Cabinet has already become a
"minority government" and essentially a "Democratic Progressive Party
government" following the resignation of Tang Fei, a KMT stalwart, as
the premier on Oct. 3, Yen should have reported to the KMT Central
Standing Committee before accepting his new position in the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>He added that his committee will also discuss whether other KMT
ministers who remain in their Cabinet posts following last week's
Cabinet reshuffle should report to the party again.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIRTUAL BANKS EMERGING IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11   (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Virtual banks have increasingly become
popular in Taiwan in the present e-commerce era, according to a local
newspaper report by the Liberty Times.</P>
      <P>The emergence of the so-called "virtual banks" indicates that
the physical banks are becoming less important, as just a telephone
call or logging on the Internet will provide customers with access to
banks' services ranging from depositing and lending money, as well as
offering investment, financial consultations and even firing
complaints.
 Foreign banks, such as the ABN ARMO Bank, the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. and Citibank, N.A., which noticeably lag
in numbers of branches as compared to domestic banks, are most
active to seek scope in this area by planning to increase financial
services on telephone on websites.</P>
      <P>Taking Citibank for example, about 70 percent of the bank's
total daily transactions are done at its financial services
center. An average of 50,000 calls are made to the center per day,
making the center one of the bank's most important units, the report
said.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Citibank spends around NT$500 million
each over the past three years to explore business
opportunities in this domain.</P>
      <P>Cost assessments made by foreign banks themselves indicated that
it costs about NT$140 for a bank to serve a client who personally
visits its counter, while the expense to provide similar services
through telephones, auto telling machines or online websites is only
around NT$100.</P>
      <P>Although "virtual banks" seem to be the dominant trend in the
future, if judged from the prospective of a busy executive or
investor, the report said, the new situation, however, represents a
profound change for the vast majority of customers who are not used
to dealing with just a strange voice on the other side of the
telephone line.</P>
      <P>A Citibank executive said customers will feel ill-at-ease if
their calls are transferred several times or their e-mails get no
answers from the banks, easily pushing them back to their old
habits of visiting banks personally, he noted.</P>
      <P>In efforts to tackle such problems, the key issue for those
banking institutions interested in building a network of "virtual
banks" is to win customers' trust, the Citibank executive pointed
out.</P>
      <P>According to the Citibank official, the bank requires that 80
percent of all the telephone calls reaching its financial services
center must be answered within 15 seconds. Currently, only an average
of two in each 100 calls are hanged up, while 92 percent of the
customers' demands are met with just one call, he elaborated.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Haitian President Rene Preval visited the
Republic of China Council of Agriculture Wednesday and obtained the
council chairman's promise of aid for agricultural development in his
country.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsi-huang, chairman of the COA, told Preval, who arrived in
Taipei Monday to attend celebrations of the ROC's National Day, that
American economists in 1950 said that it would be very difficult to
develop the economy of Taiwan, which had a per capita income reaching
only US$160 and poor educational institutions at the time.</P>
      <P>However, Chen added, the ROC has created an economic miracle
thanks to its government's efforts to develop agriculture on a
full-scale basis as the foundation of its industrial development.</P>
      <P>Chen cited three steps which he said can serve as examples for
Haiti in its economic development -- introducing foreign
manufacturing technology, finding products suitable for processing
and exporting, and improving manufacturing technology to expand
export market.</P>
      <P>Preval said Haiti and Taiwan share similar development
conditions, as they are both island countries with mountainous
topography. He added that therefore, Taiwan's experience in economic
development serves as a good example for Haiti.</P>
      <P>With most of the members of Haitian delegation having
agricultural backgrounds, and some of them actually agricultural
engineers, the eagerness of Haiti's government to learn something
from Taiwan's agricultural development is apparent, Preval added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that COA officials will accompany the Haitian
delegation to visit various places around Taiwan so that they can
better understand the country's agricultural biotechnology
development.</P>
      <P>The Haitian delegation is scheduled to depart from Taipei on
Oct. 15.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Finance Minister Yen
Ching-chang held an emergency meeting Wednesday to discuss measures
to stabilize the stock market, after which he announced the steps
that his ministry will take.</P>
      <P>Ahead of a defense of the psychologically-important 6,000-point
level expected for Thursday in the face of bearish sentiment on the
local bourse, the ministry declared that the Taiwan Stock Exchange
will gather officials from 25 of the market's most heavily
capitalized companies Thursday to exchange opinions on how to reverse
the downward trend in stock prices.</P>
      <P>The ministry also announced that it will promote the benefits of
establishing a stock buyback system to 20 top companies next week,
and added that the Securities and Futures Commission will coordinate
with related government agencies to crack down on rumor-mongering
aimed at manipulating stock prices.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange continued its downward streak
Wednesday, with the benchmark weighted price index moving down 168.87
points to close at 6,040.55.</P>
      <P>Selling pressure is expected to be immense Thursday, when the
temporary measure that halved the regular 7 percent cap on the
maximum allowable single-day fall in stock prices will no longer be
in place. Stock market pessimism is being further fueled by the fact
that the National Stabilization Fund has been ordered to prop up the
market only until the end of the week.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted that in the period from June 30 to Oct. 1, the
Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.73 percent, the NASDAQ composite
index lost 18 percent, the Nikkei stock average dropped 10.9 percent,
and the Hang Seng index lost 6.37 percent; while the TAIEX dropped a
whopping 26.92 percent despite strong exports, continually increasing
foreign exchange reserves, and continued growth for listed companies.</P>
      <P>The ministry went on to say that it will invite the heads of 25
of the island's largest publicly-traded companies, including China
Steel, Acer, and Winbond Electronics, to exchange opinions on the
local bourse's downward spiral.</P>
      <P>It also plans to promote the idea of buying back outstanding
stocks to the heads of 20 well-run companies that it says are
oversold, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., United
Microelectronics, China Petrochemical, Acer, China Airlines,
President Enterprises, Taiwan Cement, Formosa Plastic, and Asustek

    <TEXT>
      <P>The entry of Taiwan and mainland China into
the World Trade Organization is likely to be postponed until early
next year, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin flew to Washington in early October to attend the fifth
United States-Republic of China vice ministerial-level meeting on
economic issues. He returned to Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>While in Washington, Lin had exchanged views with U.S. Deputy
Trade Representative Richard Fisher on the world economic situation,
intellectual property rights, Taiwan's undersea cable market,
government procurement and financial transparency.</P>
      <P>Lin said the U.S. side did not formally express any concern to
him over Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, the construction of
which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party intends to suspend.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government considers the nuclear power project to be
Taiwan's internal matter, and says that it is up to Taiwan alone to
determine whether to continue the construction of the power plant,
Lin said. He added that the U.S. side does expect Taiwan to fulfill
the terms of the contracts it has signed with U.S. manufacturers.</P>
      <P>U.S. firm General Electric Co. won the bid to build the two
reactors for the controversial nuclear power plant in Kungliao,
Taipei County, in 1995. The reactors had been scheduled to be shipped
to Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>GE has said that after it receives official notification of the
project's termination, it will begin to seek compensation from Taiwan
Power Company.</P>
      <P>As for the issue of Taipei's and Beijing's WTO entry, Lin quoted
Fisher as saying that Beijing has not made sufficient progress toward
meeting the terms for entry into WTO, so the entry of Taipei and
Beijing into the world trade regulatory body will probably be
postponed to early 2001, especially if there is no further progress
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing consistently insists that it must enter the WTO prior to

      <P>A Malawi official said in Beijing
Wednesday that relations between his country and Taiwan will not be
affected by his presence at the China-African Cooperation Forum
currently being held in the mainland capital.</P>
      <P>The director of the Malawi Foreign Ministry's Political Affairs
Department, whose surname is Phiri, confirmed that Taiwan has made a
great contribution to his country in terms of its economic
development, but added that Taiwan alone cannot satisfy all of
Malawi's needs for national development.</P>
      <P>He added that Malawi is a developing country, and has to explore
every possible resource to prop up its national development. He cited
this as the reason for his presence at the forum, which he said is
merely an attempt to establish cooperative ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Phiri said that although the Beijing officials that greeted him
at the airport proposed that official ties between mainland China and
his country be established, he told the officials that he would not
touch on the issue as his trip is mainly to discuss Malawi's exports
of farm products to mainland China, as well as to solicit investment
for his country.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that almost all the members of the Southern
African Development Community sent delegates to the forum; and his
country, as a member of the community, is participating in the hopes
of obtaining assistance from mainland China in the fields of medical
care, education and infrastructure construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER TO SELL REACTORS IF 4TH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT PROJECT SCRAPPED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) will seek
buyers for the reactors meant to be installed in the fourth nuclear
power plant if the construction project is indeed scrapped, said
Taipower President Kuo Chun-huei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Taipower will seek buyers to help offset the unavoidable
losses that the state-run company is going to incur if the project
is brought to a halt.</P>
      <P>Answering questions by lawmakers at the Legislative Yuan, Kuo
noted that Taipower will also negotiate a settlement with U.S.
General Electric Company, a major builder of nuclear reactors,
regarding related facilities.</P>
      <P>Kuo disclosed that Taipower has plans to contact several
potential buyers abroad as a number of countries are beginning
construction on their own nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>Kuo pointed out, however, that it is still too early to actually
make the contacts abroad as the fate of the controversial project is
still not clear.</P>
      <P>Ex-Premier Tang Fei resigned on Oct. 3 due to stated health
reasons, but it has been widely speculated that he actually stepped
down because his support for the completion of the nuclear power
plant put him in direct conflict with President Chen and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The plant is already 33 percent finished, and some NT$48 billion
(US$1.54 billion) has already been spent on it. Kuo said scrapping
the plant will cost the country another NT$75 billion (US$2.41
billion) in compensation payments to contractors.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislators asked Atomic Energy Council (AEC)
Chairman Hsia Teh-yu, who was also present at the Legislative Yuan
interpellation session, about new revelations that the fourth nuclear
power plant is located near a fault, posing major safety threats in
the event of an earthquake.</P>
      <P>Hsia answered that the AEC has dutifully received safety
assessment reports compiled by Taipower on concerns about the
possible impact of earthquakes, typhoons, or tsunamis on the plant
and that the reports found the nuclear power plant would be safe
under all natural disaster scenarios.</P>
      <P>Hsia however stressed that the AEC is willing to invite experts
and scholars for further discussions on the plant's safety if the
lawmakers have further misgivings about the plant's proximity to a
fault line.</P>
      <P>The AEC head meanwhile asked the lawmakers to help accelerate the
passage of a legislation on radioactive waste management and related

more in significance until it becomes nothingness."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REMAINS CAUTIOUS ON FINANCIAL AID TO SOLOMONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Wu Tzu-dan
said Thursday that allegations that the Solomon Islands has demanded
US$150 million in cash aid from Taiwan for maintaining diplomatic
ties were based on sheer rumors.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was reporting at the Legislative Yuan on the nation's
latest diplomatic efforts and developments, said Taiwan is not going
to abandon its Solomons ally, which is currently facing financial
difficulties due to domestic political unrest.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that additional financial assistance to the
Solomon Islands will require negotiations and that the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs will be deliberate and cautious when making new
decisions on this issue.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that Taipei will not make any new promises on
financial aid before the government of the Solomons Islands presents
a complete reconstruction plan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already allocates over US$10 million for the Solomon
Islands every year, according to MOFA sources.</P>
      <P>The unexpected absence of Solomon Islands' Foreign Minister Denny
Philip from the Republic of China's National Day celebrations Tuesday
triggered speculation that bilateral ties between the two countries
may be hanging in the balance.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the Solomon Islands' new Prime Minister
Manasseh Sogavare has said that Philip's visit to Beijing Wednesday
was a "personal act" and that bilateral ties between the Solomon
Islands and the ROC remain unchanged, Foreign Affairs Minister Tien
Hung-mao said Taiwan's attitude is to plan for the worst but hope the
worst does not happen.</P>
      <P>Tien admitted to New Party legislator Lai Shyh-bao that the
Solomon Islands has indeed requested over US$20 million from Taiwan
in emergency financial support, but added that Taipei is still
considering the request because the ROC government does not think it
is viable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MALAWI OFFICIAL REAFFIRMS DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Malawi has no plans to forge official
ties with mainland China as it still maintains normal diplomatic
relations with the Republic of China, a Malawi official said here
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Bywell Phiri, political affairs department chief at the Malawi
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made the remarks in response to an
inquiry from Taiwan reporters about the reasons behind Malawi's
decision to send him to attend the Beijing-sponsored forum on
relations between mainland China and African countries.</P>
      <P>Phiri said the just-concluded PRC-African forum was an
international meeting with the joint participation of African
countries.</P>
      <P>"The main purpose of my attendance at the forum is to explore
how Beijing conducts trade and economic exchanges with other African
countries," Phiri explained, adding that Malawi is trying to develop
trade and economic ties with mainland China through attending the
forum.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Phiri stressed that the primary mission of his
Beijing visit was confined to discussing economic issues with
mainland China and other African countries as well as to seeking
possible trade and economic cooperation opportunities with other
countries.</P>
      <P>"Malawi has sent a delegation to take part in the Beijing forum
simply because it wants to learn from the experience of other
African countries in forging economic cooperation programs with as
many countries as possible," Phiri reiterated.</P>
      <P>Commenting on press reports that Malawi may switch diplomatic
allegiance from Taipei to Beijing, Phiri said the reports are
unfounded, adding that information about the establishment of
diplomatic relations should be released by formal diplomatic
channels, not the media.</P>
      <P>Malawi was one of the two ROC diplomatic allies that have sent
delegates to attend the PRC-African forum. The other ally was
Liberia.</P>
      <P>Malawi President Bakili Muluzi assured ROC Ambassador Chen
Hsi-tsan earlier this week that Malawi has no intention of changing
its longstanding cordial relations with the ROC.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIFICATION WITH TAIWAN BEIJING'S TOP SECURITY CONCERN: US REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing has in recent years viewed the
goal of unification with Taiwan as its "top security concern" and has
sped up its military modernization as a way of helping achieve that
goal, according to a new U.S. congressional report released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Confirming a widely-held belief, the report prepared by the
Congressional Research Service indicates a shift in the debate on
mainland China's security concerns.</P>
      <P>"Over the last two decades, the discussion of China's interests
and challenges to regional stability has shifted from its role in the
Cold War to domestic repression and instability to claims over the
South China Sea to tensions over Taiwan," says the report.</P>
      <P>"Especially since the mid-1990's, China has viewed its top
security problem as preventing Taiwan's permanent separation and as
securing unification as one China," it says.</P>
      <P>"This focus has catalyzed the modernization of the People's
Liberation Army, including the procurement of advanced foreign
military equipment", it continues.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, according to the report, experts believe that
Beijing also aims to, among other things, preclude Japan's rise as
the strongest power in Asia, support Beijing's territorial claims in
the East and South China Seas, and counter American might in the
region.</P>
      <P>The 72-page report, entitled "China's Foreign Conventional Arms
Acquisitions: Background and Analysis," is described as "one of the
most comprehensive, unclassified assessments" on Beijing's
conventional arms acquisitions.</P>
      <P>It was prepared by the research arm of Congress upon the request
of Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), ranking minority member of the
Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security.</P>
      <P>The report concludes that the operational significance of the
PLA's qualitative upgrades through foreign arms acquisitions remains
to be seen and will depend in part on its ability to achieve
effective joint military operations through training.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, Akaka said that "the Chinese are, for
the first time in modern history, developing a capability to project
air and naval forces beyond their coastal areas".</P>
      <P>"The United States needs to seek ways to address any threat to
American interests as a result of that capability," he said.</P>
      <P>The congressional report examines the major foreign conventional
weapon systems that Beijing has acquired or has committed to purchase
since 1990, with particular attention to implications for U.S.
security concerns.</P>
      <P>Experts who prepared the report say the report does not assume
that the PLA will engage in conflict with other forces in Asia, but
they point out that since the mid-1990's, "there has been increasing
concern about China's assertiveness in Asia and greater threats
against Taiwan."</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SENATOR URGES AMERICA TO FACE THREAT POSED BY BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of U.S. President Bill
Clinton signing into law the bill that grants Communist China
permanent normal trade relations, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) urged
America to face the threat posed by Beijing to U.S. national security
interests.</P>
      <P>In a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor, Kyl explained that he
voted for the PNTR bill because he recognizes the economic benefits
it will have for many American workers, businesses, and customers,
but added that "it is of utmost importance that we not lose sight of
the fact that trade alone does not define our relationship with
China. The actions and heated rhetoric of China's Communist leaders
should be of great concern."</P>
      <P>Chinese officials and state-sponsored media have time and time
again made bellicose and threatening statements aimed at the United
States and its long-standing, democratic ally -- Taiwan. They have
even gone so far as to issue implied threats of using nuclear weapons
against the United States, he noted.</P>
      <P>"The question is, will we take them at their word on these
defense matters as we did when they made trade commitments?" asked
Kyl.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he pointed out, the rhetoric from Beijing has also been
accompanied by troubling actions. China has long-range nuclear-tipped
missiles targeted at American cities and is greatly increasing the
number of short-range missiles aimed at Taiwan. Moreover, it has
taken steps to improve its ability to invade or blockade Taiwan and
has proliferated missiles and weapons of mass destruction around the
world.</P>
      <P>Kyl noted that these are but a few of the many compelling reasons
why the United States needs a national missile defense system to
protect the country and to guarantee its freedom of action. It is
also important for the United States to use the full range of
economic and diplomatic tools available to halt China's proliferation
of technology for missiles and weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>He said he believes the Senate missed an opportunity when it
failed to pass an amendment offered by Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.)
to combat this problem, but he added that hopes this legislation will
be considered and passed next year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the senator emphasized, "we need to ensure that
strong export controls on U.S.-made products are in place so we don't
inadvertently help China modernize its military. It remains to be
seen whether the rhetoric from Beijing will become reality, but in
light of China's troubling actions, prudence demands that we take
steps to address China's behavior."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PITCHES FOR DIRECT AIRLINKS WITH RUSSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he
hopes direct flight services between the Republic of China and
Russia can be inaugurated as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal while meeting with Oleg Ivanovich Lobov,
chairman of the Moscow-Taipei Economic and Cultural Coordination
Commission (MTECCC), which is authorized by Russian authorities to
handle exchanges with the ROC in the absence of formal diplomatic
ties.</P>
      <P>Chen said seven years have passed since Taiwan and Russia began
to discuss establishment of direct airlinks. "I hope the two sides
can accelerate negotiations and work together to overcome
difficulties so that direct flight services can kick off soon to
facilitate bilateral commercial, cultural, technological and academic
exchanges," he urged.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his concern about Russia's arms
sales to mainland China, saying such deals would pose potential
threat to security and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the entire
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chen said the ROC looks forward to seeing Russia
restrict quality and quantity of its weaponry sales to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said the ROC is interested in strengthening
military, scientific and technological cooperation with Russia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen lauded Lobov for his achievements during his
stints as Russian economics minister and first prime minister as
well as for his efforts to promote substantive ROC-Russian ties.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that he had happy talks with current Russian
President Vladimir Putin when he visited Moscow five years ago in
his capacity as mayor of Taipei. At that time Putin was deputy mayor
of Moscow.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Chen and Putin are the top leaders of their respective
countries. Chen said he hopes their previous encounter can help
boost the upgrading of substantive Taiwan-Russian relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC hopes to invite former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to visit Taiwan, and that he himself also looks forward to
visiting Moscow again in the not-too-distant future to pitch for
closer cooperative ties.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lobov expressed Russia's gratitude for the
assistance and spiritual support extended by the ROC when the Russian
nuclear-powered submarine Kursk sank in the Barents Sea in August.</P>
      <P>As for the direct airlinks, Lobov said Russian airline Transaero
has sent representatives to accompany him on his current Taipei
visit. Lobov told Chen that Transaero representatives have reached
a preliminary agreement with Taiwan's China Airlines on the opening
of direct flight services between Taipei and Moscow. After the two
companies work out some technical details, Lobov said, direct
Taipei-Moscow flights can be inaugurated in the near future.</P>
      <P>Lobov, heading a delegation of MTECCC officials and senior
Russian business executives, arrived in Taipei earlier this week
to attend the ROC's Oct. 10 National Day celebrations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS MOST PEOPLE FEEL DOMESTIC ECONOMY WORSENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of respondents to a recent
public opinion poll feel that the domestic economy is deteriorating
quickly, the opposition People First Party reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The PFP commissioned TVBS, a local cable TV channel, to conduct
a telephone poll Wednesday with a view to exploring local people's
confidence in Taiwan's business and economic prospects.</P>
      <P>The poll of 803 adult residents randomly selected from
around the island found that 81 percent of those interviewed said
they feel Taiwan's present business climate is worse than last
year's; 5.4 percent said they feel that the business climate
remains almost the same; and 7.7 percent said they feel the general
economic environment is better than a year ago.</P>
      <P>Moreover, more than 50 percent said they think Taiwan's economic
situation will deteriorate further next year, and only 25 percent
gave an optimistic forecast.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that nearly 60 percent think the
domestic inflationary pressure will become increasingly serious over
the next year, and that 45 percent said they are worrying about the
possibility of losing their current jobs.</P>
      <P>As for the stock market prospects, 47.1 percent said they think
local share prices will continue falling. Meanwhile, 39 percent said
they think that the government should not intervene to prop up local
share prices, while 40 percent said they prefer to see government
intervention to prevent the bourse from plunging too drastically.</P>
      <P>While 48 percent said they believe that the government's
pump-priming measures can help buoy the sagging stock market, 32
percent said they think such government efforts will be of no avail.</P>
      <P>The poll further found that 47.1 percent of those interviewed
said they remain confident of the government's ability to address a
host of financial and economic problems facing Taiwan, but about 40
percent said they have no confidence in the government's capability
to resolve all those issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that the poll results were like a no-confidence vote
against the current Democratic Progressive Party-dominant minority
government, National Chengchi University Yin Nai-ping said the
government should craft out effective measures to resolve current
economic plights in order to rekindle public confidence in the
domestic economic prospects.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Sun Ta-chien said the deterioration of Taiwan
economy mainly results from chaos in the domestic political arena.
As all residents on the island share the same destiny, Sun said,
major opposition parties should refrain from making irrational or
empty criticism of the government's policies and the ruling
DPP should also honestly face the problems and take immediate
measures to settle the issues for the benefits of all local
residents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sun said the DPP will call a meeting Friday to discuss
strategy and concrete measures for addressing Taiwan's current
economic and financial problems.</P>
      <P>Sun said a number of former economic and financial officials and
advisers to the previous government will attend the seminar to
present their views and recommendations. Among the participants will
be former Premier Hau Pai-tsun, Economics Minister Chao Yao-tung and
Wang Chao-ming, a former vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development.</P>

      <P>Republic of China
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday in earthquake-ravaged Nantou
County that the donations of overseas Chinese and their visit to the
region offer "immeasurable encouragement" to the local people.</P>
      <P>Over 6,000 overseas Chinese were in the central Taiwan county to
attend a folk culture festival organized by the Overseas Chinese
Affairs Commission as a part of events following ROC National Day
celebrations on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the festival, Chang pointed out that in the wake of
last year's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake, which killed over 2,400
people, overseas Chinese have donated more than NT$1.9 billion
(US$60.7 million) to disaster relief and reconstruction funds, while
their domestic compatriots have given their time, money, and efforts
for the same cause.</P>
      <P>He added that the concern of the overseas Chinese can be deeply
felt, and is proof that "blood is thicker than water."</P>
      <P>Commission Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei urged the guests to help
publicize the disaster region after they return to their foreign
homes so that more people will visit the area.</P>
      <P>County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien noted that many local hotels
were fully booked during the visit by thousands of overseas Chinese,
a substantial help for the region's floundering tourist industry.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the same group witnessed an aerial display by the
ROC Air Force's second-generation fighter jets at an air force base
in central Taiwan. An F-16 fighter, a Mirage 2000-5, a
locally-designed Indigenous Defense Fighter, an Rf-5E reconnaissance
plane and a E-2T AWACS flew in formation, followed by stunt flying by
the "Thunder Tiger" squadron.</P>
      <P>The overseas Chinese are scheduled to visit four different
quake-ravaged areas in the coming two days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's renowned Cloud Gate
Dance Theatre performed a dance titled "Portrait of the Families" to
an enthusiastic response from the audience at a dance festival in
Berlin Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate dancers had greatly impressed the European art
community during last year's Berlin Festival, when they performed a
dance titled "Moon Water." The festival organizers therefore invited
Cloud Gate back for this year's festival, along with other world
famous troupes such as the Frankfurt Ballet.</P>
      <P>Charles King, Taipei's representative in Germany, held a party at
the Schiller Theatre to introduce the Cloud Gate performers to the
Berlin Festival audience. It was an opportunity for Lin Hwai-min,
Cloud Gate founder and artistic director, to meet many German art and
literary figures.</P>
      <P>The troupe gave the first of its three scheduled performances in
the Schiller Theatre to a packed audience Wednesday night. About 20 
dancers performed in "Portrait of the Families," a 100-minute
examination of the last 100 tumultuous years of Taiwanese history
from the point of view of the family. The performance is said to
incorporate abstract dance, modern slide projection, and recordings
of Taiwanese telling their life stories in a variety of regional
dialects.</P>
      <P>When Lin and the dancers made curtain-calls at the end of the
performance, the thunderous ovation from the audience lasted for more
than 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>Many overseas Chinese residing in Germany came to the
performance. Some were moved to tears by the depiction of the
tumultuous years in the development of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A critic from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
 (Frankfurt General News), commenting on "Portrait of the
Families," said that Cloud Gate had proved once more that it is a
world class troupe, on par with the best dance performers in Europe
and the Americas.</P>
      <P>Before coming to Berlin, Cloud Gate had given 10 performances at
the Lyon Biannual Dance Festival. After its three performances in
Berlin, Cloud Gate will begin a U.S. tour that will take the troupe
to Kansas, New Jersey and New York.</P>

      <P>A stray shell from
a live ammunition military exercise flew four kilometers off target
into a neighboring county in southwestern Taiwan Thursday and
exploded in a rice paddy, but fortunately no one was injured.</P>
      <P>According to the police, farmers in a Yunlin County village heard

reported the incident to the police, who confirmed with the military
that an artillery unit of the Republic of China's southern Eighth

    <HEADLINE>FORMER FRENCH INSTITUTE IN TAIWAN OFFICER DEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thierry Imbot, a former officer at the
French Institute in Taiwan who helped seal the deal to sell six
French-made Lafayette frigates to Taiwan -- now at the center of
major scandals in both countries -- died Tuesday after apparently
falling from a fifth floor window.</P>
      <P>According to a Thursday report in the mass circulation newspaper
La Liberation, police have cordoned off the yard surrounding Imbot's
apartment and have begun investigating his death. They have not
dismissed the possibility that it may have been more than a simple
case of accidental death, citing his "unusual" background.</P>
      <P>Imbot, 48, had also worked in the French embassy in Beijing, and
founded a consultant company in the United States to promote arms
sales to various African nations. His father, Gen. Rene Imbot, was
the head of the French intelligence agency from 1985 to 1987, and had
recruited the younger Imbot to serve in the foreign arm of France's
intelligence system.</P>
      <P>According to the French Foreign Ministry, Imbot also held a U.N.
position at the time of his death.</P>
      <P>Police said that there was no sign of a break-in and that Imbot's
bathroom window above the yard was open. Preliminary investigations
suggest that he may have been trying to close the window when he fell
to his death. No signs of physical struggle was found on his body.</P>
      <P>Police added that several boxes in Imbot's apartment were still
unopened, suggesting that he had moved in only recently.</P>
      <P>Imbot's name appeared under many successful contracts to buy
French arms, including the Lafayette sale, which allegedly led to the
death of a Republic of China Navy captain in 1993, after which Imbot
left Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the year, reports from Paris that huge kickbacks were
paid to Taiwan officials for the purchase of the frigates fueled
speculation that the naval captain's death was just the tip of the
iceberg, and that an attempt was being made to cover up massive
corruption involving senior military officers and government
officials in both Taiwan and France.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC WRITERS ELATED OVER CHINESE WINNING NOBEL LITERATURE AWARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local writers were elated Thursday to hear
that Gao Xingjian, a Chinese dissident playwright and author, had won
the first Nobel prize for literature ever given to a Chinese in the
award's 100-year history.</P>
      <P>The Swedish Academy in its citation praised Gao "for an oeuvre of
universal validity, bitter insights and linguistic ingenuity, which
has opened new paths for the Chinese novel and drama."</P>
      <P>Gao, born in 1940, was encouraged to write, paint and play the
violin from an early age. He later studied French and literature at
the Beijing Foreign Language Institute.</P>
      <P>Considered the leading contemporary Chinese dramatist, Gao
introduced the avant-garde ideas of European theater to Chinese
audiences.</P>
      <P>Gao left mainland China in 1987 and moved to France, opting for
permanent residence there after the Tiananmen Square massacre of June
1989.</P>
      <P>Wang Chi-lung, chairman of the Chinese Art and Literature
Association, said that although the recognition is belated, it
nevertheless has brought joy to all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he feels that the central feature of Gao's work is
his humanitarian spirit. The philosophy of life in his literature is
very distinctive, which has helped his works and Chinese literature
in general to win recognition in world literary circles, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Gao's play "The Other Shore" was performed in Taiwan about a
decade ago, Wang added.</P>
      <P>The writer and historian Kuo Yi-tung, whose pen name is Po Yang,
said he never got the chance to know Gao. But as Chinese have won
Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry, he said he is excited to see a
Chinese finally took the literary award, adding that it will
encourage future Chinese writers to have a wider scope in their
writing.</P>
      <P>Writer Lucy Chen recounted that she met Gao in Beijing during the
mid-1980s, and she felt at the time that Gao was a passionate man.
She said that he was dancing at the time in celebration of the
performance of his play -- and his divorce.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese literature is rich and beautiful, both Wang
and Po expressed the hope that more Chinese works can be translated
into English and other languages, so that more people can appreciate
the beauty of Chinese literature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER TO REPRESENT PRESIDENT CHEN AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has designated
Vice Premier Lai In-jaw to attend the eighth informal leadership
meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on his
behalf, the Presidential Office said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office made the announcement after President
Chen met with Brunei's APEC envoy Pengiran Hajyusof.</P>
      <P>According to the Presidential Office, Chen informed Hajyusof
during their meeting that he has decided to appoint Lai to represent
him at the annual APEC summit to be held in Brunei in mid-November.</P>
      <P>In response, Hajyusof was quoted as having told Chen that Brunei
accepts and welcomes Lai's attendance at the APEC summit meeting on
Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen also told the Brunei envoy that Lai is
an economic and financial expert and that the Republic of China is
more than willing to share its economic development experience with
other APEC members.</P>
      <P>Chen further expressed Taiwan's desire to expand substantive
relations and cooperation with other APEC member economies.</P>
      <P>APEC is one of the few government-to-government international
organizations that simultaneously accepts Taiwan and mainland China
as its full members. Because of Beijing's recalcitrant opposition,
the ROC president has been barred from attending the annual APEC
informal leadership meeting personally and must instead appoint a
proxy to take part in the conference.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, a former premier, twice represented former
President Lee Teng-hui at the APEC summit during his stint at
chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>Another former CEPD chief, P. K. Chiang, and Koo Chen-fu, a
senior presidential adviser and Taiwan's top negotiator with
mainland China, also had attended the APEC leadership meetings on
Lee's behalf.</P>
      <P>Lai, a former grand justice who now also heads a Cabinet
financial and economic task force, will be the highest-ranking
government official to represent the ROC president at the annual APEC
summit.</P>
      <P>APEC, a 21-member regional forum, is dedicated to promoting free
trade and investment to boost regional economic integration and

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Congratulating the people of Taiwan as
they celebrated the 89th Republic of China National Day, U.S. Sen.
Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) told the Senate Tuesday that with strong and
continued American support, Taiwan will thrive and prosper far into
the future.</P>
      <P>Bunning added that the success of Taiwan must continue to "serve
as an example -- as well as a challenge -- to the people and
government on the Chinese mainland. The free, prosperous, democratic
society that Taiwan has become is a glimpse of what can come to be on
the mainland if the dictatorship in Beijing would get out of the
way."</P>
      <P>Over the last few days, seven members of the U.S. House of
Representatives also congratulated the ROC for its many remarkable
achievements during the past decades, with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher
(R-Calif.) declaring that he strongly supports Taiwan's entry into
the World Trade Organization even before Communist China is admitted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has become "a beacon of democracy in the Asia-Pacific
region, and the government of Communist China should never forget the
importance of the freedom of Taiwan to the people of the United
States," Rohrabacher stated on the House floor last Friday.</P>
      <P>Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) praised Taiwan as "truly a model of
success for many countries in the world," saying that "Taiwan
deserves our congratulations and our support."</P>
      <P>On the occasion of the ROC's National Day, Rep. Rick Hill
(R-Mont.) pointed out that "it is important to remember that Taiwan
has a strong relationship with the United States and we hope that
this relationship will continue to flourish in the years to come."</P>
      <P>Other congressmen who congratulated Taiwan and voiced their
support for its bid to join the United Nations and other
international organizations were Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.), Rep.
Phil English (R-Pa.), Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), and Rep. John
Larson (D-Conn.).</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC NOT CONSIDERING OPENING TAIWAN'S LABOR MARKET TO MAINLANDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is not at the present time
considering liberalizing regulations to allow mainland Chinese
laborers to work in Taiwan, said an official in charge of mainland
China policy Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, made the remarks while attending a public hearing on
the three direct links across the Taiwan Strait and on the rights of
laborers.</P>
      <P>The public hearing held at the Legislative Yuan was sponsored by
Legislator Wang Tuo of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if direct trade, postal, and transport links are
established between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, then
cross-strait trade will replace Taiwan's large-scale investment in
the mainland and job opportunities for local laborers will hinge on
the development of Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>If the economy continues to grow, then local laborers' job
opportunities will not decrease and their rights will be ensured.</P>
      <P>He said that as the impact of opening Taiwan's labor market to
mainlanders would be too large, the MAC's policy is to not do so even
if the current ban on the three direct links is lifted.</P>
      <P>On the government's plan to recruit more high-technology talent
from mainland China, Chen said Taiwan is still short tens of
thousands of such workers and so there is a need to introduce more
such talent, which he said will have a positive effect on economic
growth and will have no direct impact on the rights of Taiwan's
laborers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`COMMONWEALTH OF GREATER CHINA' SAID BEST CROSS-STRAIT SOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The formation of a `Commonwealth of
Greater China' would be the best solution to the cross-Taiwan Strait
impasse, said a Washington-based China expert on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jay Taylor, author of the book titled The Generalissimo's Son:
Chiang Ching-kuo and the Revolution in China and Taiwan, said the
Taiwan development experience during the Chiang Ching-kuo era is
sufficient for mainland China to emulate and the formation of a
commonwealth is the most viable option for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to break their deadlock.</P>
      <P>During a seminar held at the Congress Library, Taylor, a fellow
with Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research,
said if President Chiang Ching-kuo had lived a few years longer, the
current situation across the Taiwan Strait would have been starkly
different and Deng Xiaoping, known for being strongly in favor of
peaceful unification of mainland China and Taiwan, also would not
have ordered the bloody suppression of the democracy movement in
Tiananmen Square in 1989.</P>
      <P>Taylor, who has been serving at both the U.S. liaison office in
Taiwan and the U.S. embassy in Beijing, said if Chiang were still
alive today, he would definitely suggest that President Chen
Shui-bian support the "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Ralph Clough, a China hand with the School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, seconded Taylor's
comments, saying that if President Chiang Ching-kuo were still
around, he would suggest that Chen forsake the notion of Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>If mainland China and Taiwan formed a so-called Commonwealth of
Greater China, the Chinese Communists would be freed from worries of
losing Taiwan as part of China's sovereign territory, noted Taylor,
adding that Beijing would then be able to allow Taiwan to participate
in international organizations in the island's capacity as a member
of the Commonwealth of Greater China, fulfilling Taiwan's long held
desire to widen its international horizons.</P>
      <P>Taylor, who also has worked at the White House National Security
Council, said that under this scenario, Chen might even become the
first popularly elected president of the commonwealth.</P>
      <P>In 1976, the year Mao Zedong died, President Chiang Ching-kuo
accurately forcast Deng Xiaoping's reemergence on the political
stage, thus prompting him to accelerate democratization in Taiwan,
Taylor noted.</P>
      <P>Clough, who also served in the U.S. Embassy in Taipei, said when
President Chiang Ching-kuo appointed Lee Teng-hui as his vice
president, Chiang believed that Lee would continue to promote
Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that wide gaps still exist across the Taiwan
Strait in many areas, the situation in mainland China, particularly
the government's efforts at strangling opposition parties and seeking
further economic development, is pretty much the same as that in
Taiwan 20 years ago, said Taylor.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China is now also on its way towards democratization,
only the process is much slower," he added.</P>
      <P>"Democracy is a modern phenomenon, not a Western system, and it
means the people choose what they want, regardless of religion,
economy, or politics," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE LAUNDRY EXHIBIT BECOMES PERMANENT AT CANADIAN MUSEUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The exhibit titled "Enduring Hardship:
Chinese Hand Laundry" was unveiled Thursday as part of a permanent
display in the popular Canada Hall of the Canadian Museum of
Civilization.</P>
      <P>The new exhibit features a re-created Chinese hand laundry, based
in part on the Central Laundry in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which was
operated for many years by the late Ho King.</P>
      <P>The exhibit recreates the ambiance of the Chinese laundries found
in large numbers across Canada between 1900 and the 1950s. Artifacts
from Ho's and other laundries, as well as documentary footage
featuring interviews and individual recollections, give visitors an
intimate and compelling look at the difficult lives led by many of
Canada's early Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>Guests and journalists were treated to a visit first to a counter
area and then a kitchen area. At the laundry working area, one can
get a feel for how difficult the tasks of washing and boiling were.
It's easy to learn of the hard physical work carried out by the
laundry men in a cramped and steamy environment.</P>
      <P>Laundry was an essential means of livelihood for Chinese
Canadians during the first half of the 20th century. To many of the
laundry men's descendants, the hand laundry is a symbol not only of
hardship, but of survival, endurance, patience, and sacrifice for the
future.</P>
      <P>Large numbers of Chinese laborers were brought to Canada between
1858 and 1885 to build railways and dig mines. They then went to
different places along the Canadian Pacific Railway to set up laundry
businesses as few other jobs were available to them.</P>
      <P>Museum documents show that, at that time, Chinese immigrants were
discouraged from entering other occupations and were subjected to
legal restrictions and socio-economic discrimination. Running a
laundry, which required little capital but long hours of hard work,
thus became a common business for Chinese immigrants who spoke little
English or French. In 1921, for example, Montreal had a Chinese
population of 1,735 and 368 laundries run by Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The hand laundry trade petered out in the 1960s with the aging of
the early Chinese immigrants, but it remains an unforgettable part of
Chinese Canadian history.</P>
      <P>The exhibit was launched along with another titled "Canadian
heritage: Alberta Oil Rig of the 1920s." The museum's President and
CEO Victor Rabinovitch said these two new modules are "part of
ongoing efforts to tell a full and accurate version of Canadian
history."</P>
      <P>Ranking officials from both Taipei and Beijing, including
mainland Chinese Ambassador Mei Ping and James Tien, public affairs
director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, were invited to
attend the unveiling ceremony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER CBS DIRECTOR LEAVES TAIWAN AFTER EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former director of the Republic of China's
Central Broadcasting System, Chu Wan-ching (Gloria Chu), was
discovered Friday to have fled the country only hours after she was
released on bail after being charged with embezzlement.</P>
      <P>Chu was summoned to be questioned at the Taipei District
Prosecutors Office Friday for having allegedly embezzled some NT$10
million (US$322,580) from the CBS Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>She was released Thursday night with travel restrictions on
NT$500,000 (US$16,130) bail, on the grounds that she insisted on her
innocence and said she was willing to cooperate with judicial
authorities in their investigation, said presiding prosecutor Wang
Wen-teh.</P>
      <P>To everybody's surprise, however, Chu, who became head of the
former military broadcasting station during the era of Kuomintang
rule, was already aboard an EVA Airways flight bound for Los Angeles
at around 12 p.m. Thursday.</P>
      <P>Local political observers said they believe Chu was able to
successfully flee the country because she arrived at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport before the notice of the prosecutors' order of
travel restrictions reached the Bureau of Entry &amp; Exit.</P>
      <P>Chu, whose children are all living in the United States, left for
Los Angeles holding a U.S. passport, said unconfirmed sources.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Wang said he hopes the U.S. government will help
assist in returning Chu to Taiwan to face the charges against her.</P>
      <P>Earlier on Friday, Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of
the Civil Aeronautics Administration, said the CAA has the right to
order an ROC civil aircraft to return to Taiwan after it has landed
at a location abroad without opening its gates.</P>
      <P>This right, however, has never been utilized by the CAA because
it would involve too many complications in too many areas, including
compensation to the hundreds of innocent passengers aboard the
aircraft, Chang noted, adding that this power was also not used
against the plane Chu was aboard.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have kept mum on
this case, only saying that it is improper for the MOFA to make any
comments.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu's husband, Ho Ching-hsien, chairman of a
Chinese-language institute in Taipei, clarified in an interview with
a local TV channel Friday morning that Chu did not leave the country
to "escape" the charges brought against her.</P>
      <P>Ho said his wife had made arrangements one week earlier to leave
for Los Angeles on Thursday night in order to meet their son and
accompany him to Pennsylvania where he will attend a military
academy.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang spokesman Jason Hu said Chu's leaving the country has
nothing to do with the opposition party nor KMT Chairman Lien Chan.
Hu said he fully trusts that the ROC judiciary authorities will
handle the case justly and properly.</P>
      <P>Chu, 50, is known to have maintained very close connections with
Lien's wife over the past decade.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China government has lodged
a protest with the Solomon Islands over the recent diplomatic snub by
Solomon Islands Foreign Minister Denny Philip, said a Foreign
Ministry official Friday.</P>
      <P>Philip was originally scheduled to come to Taipei for the ROC's
Double-Ten National Day celebrations. But he canceled his Taiwan trip
without notifying Taipei, reportedly flying to Beijing instead.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director of the ROC Foreign Ministry's Asia-Pacific
Affairs Department, told the media that the Foreign Ministry had
lodged a serious protest over Philip's move.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the ROC government would never accept any
improper demands. Philip reportedly changed his Taipei visit plan
after Taipei refused to comply with his demand for US$20 million in
aid.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the Solomon Islands prime minister attended a
National Day party presided over by Teng Pei-yin, ROC ambassador to
the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>The prime minister described Philip's act as "a personal move,"
and reiterated that his government "treasures close relations between
the Solomon Islands and the ROC."</P>
      <P>Shih noted that Taipei considers the statement by the Solomon

maintain diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>According to the Foreign Ministry official, rival factions and

Australia on Oct. 9 for a three-day peace conference presided over by

    <HEADLINE>BUSH'S ADVISER RECOGNIZES ROC EFFORTS TO LOWER CROSS-STRAIT TENSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New   York,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Jennifer J. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior foreign policy adviser
to Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush Thursday
recognized Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's efforts to
reduce tension in the Taiwan Strait since his May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, the adviser, who preferred anonymity,
also said mainland China's security threat to the United States
is worrisome and deserves concern.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that if Bush wins the presidential election in
November, his administration will continue to implement the
longstanding "one China" policy which requires mainland China not to
use military force to unify Taiwan and demands Taiwan not to change
its present status quo.</P>
      <P>The adviser accused mainland China of having caused many
security problems to the United States. For one thing, she said,
Beijing opposes the U.S. military presence in Asia. Moreover, it
continues selling nuclear weapons to Pakistan, upgrading
its own combat readiness and obstructing the U.S. implementation of a
balanced "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Asked what role the United States can play in pushing for
resumption of the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue, the noted
foreign relations scholar said what the United States can do is to
help cultivate a stable environment to facilitate cross-strait
engagement and dialogue.</P>
      <P>As for the timing for resuming cross-strait talks, the adviser
said it's up to Taiwan and mainland China to jointly decide. It's
not suitable for the U.S. government to dictate a timetable, she
said, adding that the United States should also not act as a
go-between in cross-strait engagement.</P>
      <P>The adviser further said as President Chen's administration has
handled cross-strait relations in a responsible manner and
endeavored to lower cross-strait tension, she is optimistic about
the future of Taiwan-mainland China relations and does not think
that an immediate confrontation would erupt in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the U.S. troops in Asia should be posted in
the Taiwan Strait, the adviser said so long as the circumstances
need, the U.S. naval forces can be posted at any place. The key
point lies in whether mainland China poses military threats to
Taiwan, she noted.</P>
      <P>In her public speech delivered at the Council of Foreign
Relations, the senior adviser said she believes that if mainland
China continues its open-door trade policy and economic
liberalization reform, all such measures will eventually have an
impact on its political reform.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, the adviser said the bilateral
Washington-Beijing relations are very complex and that the United
States should seek to expand their relationship in a positive,
constructive direction.</P>

      <P>A delegation of mainland Chinese newspaper
industry professionals met with their Taiwan counterparts at the
Central News Agency headquarters Friday to exchange views on current
industry trends as well as future cooperative possibilities.</P>
      <P>CNA editor-in-chief Lee Wan-lai told the visitors that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have both common ground and differences in
the wake of their longtime separation, but that they should
nonetheless strive toward the grand objective of promoting exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lee added that although the current Internet fever may have had
an intense impact on Taiwan's newspaper industry, he is confident
that newspapers will never disappear.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that cross-strait exchanges should begin with
the media, because positive reporting can lead to increased mutual
understanding and decreased conflict and hostility.</P>
      <P>Leading the mainland Chinese delegation, All-China Journalists'
Association Director Huang Yenkuang said that his ten-member
delegation was in Taiwan to learn from the island's successful
newspaper experience and to share their own experience in turn.</P>
      <P>The delegation will visit tourist attractions such as Taiwan's
Sun Moon Lake and call on various media companies during their stay,
scheduled to end on Oct. 21.</P>
      <P>Republic of China National Press Council member Lin Sen-hung said
that Taiwan's newspaper industry flourished and became very
competitive after martial law-era restrictions on newspaper licensing
and publishing were eased in 1988.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that subsequent mergers and acquisitions have
shown that capital, talent, marketing, and management are all
essential elements for an enduring newspaper.</P>
      <P>Chiang An-kuo, professor of journalism at Taiwan's Ming Chuan
University, pointed out that Taiwan's newspaper industry has already
entered a stage of steady development after experiencing saturation.
He added that the traditional newspaper industry is working on an
answer to the impact of real-time news services offered by online
newspapers.</P>
      <P>Chiang also suggested that cross-strait news media cooperation

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN HAILS FIRST CHINESE NOBEL LITERATURE LAUREATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Friday hailed the
decision to grant the 2000 Nobel Prize in Literature to self-exiled
Chinese writer Gao Xingjian, saying that the honor marks Gao's
greatest achievement.</P>
      <P>Chen further said Gao's Nobel award marks a perfect end to the
20th century and a beautiful start for the 21st.</P>
      <P>"The laurel is the pride of Chinese the world over and an
encouragement to all Chinese writers," Chen said during an inspection
tour of construction of a freeway tunnel project linking Taipei and
Ilan Counties.</P>
      <P>Although official mainland Chinese media has been silent about
Gao's Nobel prize, the news made the front pages of leading dailies
in democratic Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>"Pride of Chinese the World Over," a China Times headline said
about the mainland China-born author, playwright and brush painter,
who now lives in exile in France.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News said Gao, 60, has maintained close contacts
with local writers and noted that the versatile novelist publicly
vowed in 1991 that he would not return to repressive mainland China.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a CNA correspondent in Paris, Gao said he
appreciates the support of Taiwan publishers for artistic freedom,
going on to thank his readers on the island for supporting his
literary work and painting over the past decade.</P>
      <P>Gao said he has been consistently moved by hospitality and
friendship shown by Taiwan publishers, writers and readers every time
he has visited the island.</P>
      <P>Before winning the Nobel prize, Gao said, he accepted a Taipei
City Hall invitation to make a three-month visit to the city late
this year, as the largest Taiwan city's first "resident artist" -- a
program aimed at helping promote local cultural development. Gao said
he may have to postpone the visit to a future date, due to what he
expects will be a tight schedule following his Nobel award.</P>
      <P>Lung Ying-tai, director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs of
Taipei City Hall, said she is very happy to see Gao win the Nobel
laurel, as he has a broad view of life. "But I also feel deep regret
that mainland Chinese authorities are not generous and tolerant
enough to keep Gao on China's soil," she added.</P>
      <P>Gao, born in the central Chinese province of Jiangxi in 1940,
fled his homeland in 1987 after one of his plays was banned and he
was put under police surveillance. After the 1989 blood bath at
Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he wrote "Fugitives," set against the
background of the slayings. Beijing declared him "persona non grata"
and banned his works.</P>
      <P>Gao became the first-ever Chinese-language writer to win the
Nobel award for his modernist and humanist contemporary Chinese
works. He has lived in exile since 1988 in France, where he sought
political asylum before taking French citizenship.</P>
      <P>The Swedish Academy cited Gao for his "bitter insights and
linguistic ingenuity."</P>
      <P>"In the writing of Gao Xingjian literature is born anew from the
struggle of the individual to survive the history of the masses," the
academy said in its citation. "He is a perspicacious skeptic who
makes no claim to be able to explain the world. He asserts that he
has found freedom only in writing."</P>
      <P>The writer and playwright went on a 10-month walking tour in the
central Sichuan province to avoid harassment after his play "The
Other Shore" was banned in 1986 and left mainland China the next
year.</P>
      <P>His novel "Soul Mountain" reflected that journey with several
narratives by different protaganists. "With his unrestrained use of
personal pronouns Gao creates lightning shifts of perspective and
compels the reader to question all confidences," the academy said of
the novel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RESUMPTION OF CROSS-STRAIT TALKS TOP PRIORITY: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The resumption of systematic cross-strait
consultations is still the government's main priority, an official in
charge of mainland policy said Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
noted that the Straits Exchange Foundation is still the only channel
commissioned by the government to conduct cross-strait consultations.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait communication has been stalled since former
President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait relations as "special
state-to-state relationship" in July last year. Though the new
administration has extended conciliatory gestures to the other side
of the Taiwan strait since its inauguration in May, the prospect of
resuming a cross-strait dialogue remains unclear.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the government does not rule out the possibility of
a second or third track mechanism for cross-strait talks, so long as
both sides of the Taiwan Strait increase their dialogue through
alternative channels such as foreign think tanks and scholars.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that the official designated to serve as Taiwan's
representative in Hong Kong remains unchanged, and expressed the
government's hope that Hong Kong will approve his appointment soon.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he hopes Chang Liang-jen, director of the MAC's
Hong Kong Affairs Bureau under the previous Kuomintang-led
government, will be able to assume his post in Hong Kong as early as
possible, so as to help promote exchanges with Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The two governments have not yet reach an agreement on Chang's
application for a work visa in Hong Kong, and the two sides are still
discussing the matter, Lin said. He would not comment on reports that
the new government may want to replace Chang with another official.</P>
      <P>The main hurdle for Chang's application is said to be Hong Kong's
imposition of more stringent conditions for Chang's post, including
promises that he will do nothing to violate the "one China"
principle, and that he will make no direct or indirect comments that
might give the impression that he represents the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that Taiwan would like to discuss the disposal of
nuclear waste with mainland China under the principle of equality.</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to questions about whether nuclear waste in
Taiwan could be sent to mainland China for disposal.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. is considering
many sources for the disposal of its nuclear waste, and would not
limit itself to any single place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Estrada
promised that the resumption of air links between his nation and the
Republic of China are permanent and will not be interrupted again,
ROC Transportation Minister Yeh Chu-lan said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yeh, upon returning from a low-profile five-day trip to the
Philippines to speak at the annual meeting of that nation's General
Chamber of Industry and Commerce, noted that she called on Estrada
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that Estrada had told her he was under immense pressure
on the issue of air links with Taiwan, which had been suspended for
10 months because of the termination of the aviation agreement
between the two countries and the failure to agree on a new one until
late September.</P>
      <P>Yeh said she had told Estrada that the resumption of air links
will be mutually beneficial, and that it will save both time and
money for the many Filipino workers who are employed in Taiwan. She
added that history will prove the decision was correct.</P>
      <P>Yeh pointed out that she had traveled to Manila on the first
direct EVA Airways flight from Taipei to the Philippine capital since
the resumption of bilateral air links.</P>
      <P>During her stay in Manila, she also called on the Philippine
ministers of finance, trade and industry, tourism, and labor and
employment. As Transportation and Communications Minister Vincente
Rivera was overseas, she called on his deputy.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that she also met with Taiwan businessmen in the
Philippines, who told her that the resumption of air links was a
"relief for the needy and distressed." They noted the difficulties
that they had encountered in quickly replacing Taiwan-sourced spare
parts for their factory machinery since direct air links broke off
last year.</P>
      <P>With the re-established links, if they find that they are lacking
certain spare parts in the morning, they can have the equipment
shipped on the same day's afternoon plane, she quoted them as saying.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that she has extended an invitation to the Philippine
tourism minister to visit Taiwan on Nov. 3 to attend an international
conference on tourism. The Philippine minister will have a chance to
formally brief Taiwan investors on a plan to develop Clark Air Base,
a former U.S. Air Force base, into a tourist attraction.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Malawi Information Minister and Government
Spokesman Clement Stambuli Friday reaffirmed the solid bilateral
relations between his country and the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Citing the proverb "a friend in need is a friend indeed,"
Stambuli said that Taiwan is a real friend of Malawi and his country
values its ties with Taiwan very much. He added that Malawi will
never transfer diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing just for
economic benefit.</P>
      <P>The Malawi government spokesman made the statement at a ceremony
in which he and Central News Agency President Bill Wang signed an
agreement to renew a news exchange pact between CNA and its Malawi
counterpart, the Malawi News Agency. The two agencies first entered
into cooperative relations in June, 1998.</P>
      <P>Stambuli said that Taiwan has always come to the relief of Malawi
whenever the African country suffered from famine or contagious
diseases, adding that Taiwan's agricultural and medical groups
stationed in his contry have been a great help to the Malawi people.</P>
      <P>Stambuli made the clarification amid news reports that a
six-member Malawi delegation, headed by the political department
director of that country's Presidential Office, was in Beijing for

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG ARGUES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF NEW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung, central Taiwan, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents of Metropolitan
Taichung on Friday expressed their hope that the government would
soon start building an international airport in the greater Taichung
area.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Shiow-yen of the opposition Kuomintang held a
public hearing Friday morning at Taichung City Council on the
construction of an international airport in central Taiwan. Officials
from Taichung County Hall and Taichung City Hall, parliamentarians,
and officials from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
were also present at the hearing.</P>
      <P>Lu said President Chen Shui-bian had promised during the
presidential campaign that he would push for the construction of
Taichung International Airport if elected.</P>
      <P>She added that President Chen had also reiterated at one of his
press conferences the government's determination to build the
airport. Claiming that there has been no action to follow up on those
words, Lu urged Chen to make good on his campaign promise and push
for the construction of the island's third international airport.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-chuan, head of the Navigation and Aviation Department of
the MOTC, said the ministry had in fact received instructions from
the Executive Yuan to earmark NT$10 million in the 2001 fiscal year
budget to hire a consulting company to evaluate the feasibility of
building an international airport in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin said the feasibility report will be provided to the MOTC for
its reference when it makes its decision on the issue. The
possibility of the construction of the international airport in
central Taiwan is said to be very high.</P>
      <P>Taichung County Magistrate Liao Yung-lai cited five advantages of
constructing an international airport in central Taiwan. He said that
the completed project would:</P>
      <P>-- Promote the development of the greater Taichung area's
industry and commerce;</P>
      <P>-- Act as a link to the mainland once the government approves
direct cross-strait air links;</P>
      <P>-- Promote the greater Taichung area's tourism industry by
increasing the number of tourist arrivals in the area;</P>
      <P>-- Shorten the time it takes to travel abroad from central
Taiwan; and</P>
      <P>-- Eliminate a general impression that the government is biased
toward northern and southern Taiwan at the expense of the central
region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liao urged the government to take measures in advance
to solve problems common to international airports, such as noise and
air pollution, traffic congestion, and other related issues.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
told visiting Haitian First Lady Geri Benoit-Preval Friday that the
ROC looks forward to the continued strengthening of bilateral
political and economic exchanges between the two nations.</P>
      <P>Lu said that although the two countries may be far apart
geographically, the ROC treasures the friendship of its Haitian ally,
adding that the personal visit of Benoit-Preval and her husband
Haitian President Rene Preval will undoubtedly give them an even
deeper understanding of Taiwan's current state of development.</P>
      <P>She went on to note that Taiwan was very poor in its early days,
but that the achievements of modern times came about through the
common efforts of the government and the people. She added that
Taiwan is very willing to share its successful experience with its
allies.</P>
      <P>Benoit-Preval responded that she came to realize after her visit
that Taiwan's economic miracle didn't simply drop from the sky, but
rather was the result of the industrious work of the island's people.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that she is vigorously working to improve the
status of women in Haiti, and at the same time hopes to learn from
Taiwan's handicraft industry experience in order to promote and
develop Haiti's own arts and crafts industry.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Taiwan would be very happy to cooperate with Haiti
on handicraft technical training and marketing, adding that she has
brought up in the past the idea of a "Latin Plaza" in Taiwan, where
products and cultural relics of the ROC's Central American and
Caribbean allies can be displayed, as a means for cultural and
economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Preval and Benoit-Preval arrived in Taiwan Oct. 9 for an official
eight-day visit, during which they attended the ROC's Oct. 10

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
on Friday congratulated his South Korean counterpart, President Kim
Dae-jung, for winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>"I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to you for
the contribution you have made to reducing tension and promoting
reconciliation in the Korean Peninsula, as well as to maintaining
regional stability in the Asian-Pacific area and the world,"
said President Chen in a message delivered by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen and Kim had met several times before they were both elected
to the presidency of their respective nations, according to a
presidential news release.</P>
      <P>He said that the coveted Nobel Peace Prize is a great honor,
which Kim fully deserves. "(Kim Dae-jung) has written a wonderful
page" in the history of Korean reconciliation, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the award serves to confirm Kim's efforts and
achievements in leading the Korean peninsula toward reconciliation
and peace for the 21st century, and also serves as a lesson for
Taiwan and mainland China. "We can also do that, if we want to," Chen
said, referring to cross-strait reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Ever since the media reports of the two Korean leaders creating
history by shaking hands on June 13, Seoul and Pyongyang have marched
in the right direction -- toward reconciliation and peace, President
Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Despite the great ideological differences resulting from over 50
years of confrontation between South and North Korea, Chen said he
believes both sides should be able to accomplish their "impossible
mission" as long as they have wisdom and creativity.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that he was so moved by the two Korean
leaders' "historical step" that he hung a picture of Kim Dae-jung
shaking hands with Kim Jong Il, paramount leader of North Korea, on a
wall of his study.</P>
      <P>The president said it is his firm belief that the leaders of both
Taiwan and the mainland could jointly rewrite history someday by
shaking hands like the two Kims.</P>

(By Timothy Sun &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 15th joint meeting between the
ROC-Philippine Economic Association and the Philippine-ROC Economic
Association was held on Friday in Manila to discuss how to strengthen
economic ties between the Republic of China and the Philippine
Islands.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the ROC-Philippine Economic Association,
and Tung Shang-chen, chairman of the Philippine-ROC Economic
Association, jointly presided over the opening ceremony. More than
100 Chinese and Philippine entrepreneurs took part in the one-day
meeting.</P>
      <P>In his address, Koo took up the question of why Taiwan investors
put less capital in the Philippines than its neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Koo cited statistics as saying that Taiwan investors had poured
some US$43.7 billion into Southeast Asian countries as of June of
this year, with Indonesia taking the lion's share of US$17 billion,
followed by Thailand at US$10.2 billion, and Malaysia at US$8.8
billion.</P>
      <P>He added that Vietnam ranked fourth at US$4.9 billion, and
Singapore was fifth at US$1.7 billion. Meanwhile, the Philippines
attracted less than US$1 billion capital investment from Taiwan, Koo
noted.</P>
      <P>Koo called on the participants to consider this question
carefully, since the Philippines possesses abundant resources, a
highly skilled labor force, and good investment climate.</P>
      <P>Philippine Minister of Commerce and Industry A. Rojas said that
Taiwan was the largest trade partner for the Philippines last year.</P>
      <P>He said that during the period between 1995 and 1999, Taiwan was
the Philippines' third largest export market, fifth largest source of
imports, and eighth largest source of foreign investment. In 1999
alone, Philippine exports to Taiwan increased by 70 percent, while
imports from Taiwan increased by 14 percent, Rojas said.</P>
      <P>Rojas also stressed that the Philippine government has been
implementing economic reform, economic liberalization and
privatization.</P>
      <P>Rojas also expressed his regret that ROC Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi was unable to attend the current meeting, and said he hopes
that the ministerial-level economic cooperation meeting between the
two sides can be held as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Following the opening ceremony, the meeting focused on panel
discussions and business consultation. It closed Friday afternoon.</P>

American allies feel "love from Taiwan" and help bolster mutual
friendship at the grassroots level.</P>
      <P>Lu, a women rights activist-turned-politician, went on to
encourage the women delegates to the summit to speak out for Taiwan
at international meetings so that more people in the international

    <HEADLINE>ROC REP. IN U.S. TALKS ON CHEN ADMINISTRATION'S CROSS-STRAITS STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China representative in
the United States said Thursday that ROC President Chen-Shui-bian's
administration has shown temperance toward the issue of cross-strait
ties and is trying its best to keep contacts with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen made the remarks during an interview with the
Washington Times.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Washington Times that President Chen is willing to
view the notion of "one China" as a "topic for discussion" with
Beijing, rather than as a "principle" which Beijing claims Taipei
must accept before resuming dialogue on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Friday's edition of the Washington Times said it is very
important to make this distinction, because according to mainland
China, Taiwan's acceptance of the "one China" principle would mean
Taiwan's acceptance of mainland Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>On the issue of national defense, Chen said that although
mainland China maintains an advantage in terms of weapons' quantity,
Taiwan is presently superior in terms of weapons' quality. He added,
however, that unless the United States continues to offer defensive
weapons to Taiwan, mainland China will probably also gain superiority
in weapons' quality within five years.</P>
      <P>He said the ROC's new government still enjoys a nearly 60 percent
public support rating, although this level is lower than the 80
percent support rating in April.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times said that Chen Shui-bian, who won the
presidential election on March 18 to become the ROC's 10th president,
has a style that appropriately combines toughness and gentleness,
allowing him to maintain a high reputation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MAINLAND AFFAIRS COUNCIL TO INSPECT TAIWAN SCHOOL IN PRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council and the
Education Ministry are planning to send a delegation to the southern
mainland Chinese city of Dongguan in November or December to inspect
a school for the children of Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>The council, which is in charge of mapping out Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China, cited the need to study the school's
facilities, teaching environment, and administrative operations to
serve as the basis for future policy considerations when other Taiwan
businessmen wish to follow in the school's example.</P>
      <P>The delegation of council and ministry officials will also meet
with Dongguan teachers, students, and the parents of students for
informal discussions.</P>
      <P>After five years of planning, over 700 students began their first
semester at the school in September. The school is the first to be
officially sanctioned by both Taipei and Beijing. Taiwan businessmen
in other mainland cities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai have
reportedly been preparing to apply for the establishment of similar
schools elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The council did not send any delegations to Dongguan during the
application approval process, and only one mid-level official has
inspected the school since it was officially inaugurated.</P>
      <P>The Dongguan school is run by a Taiwan principal, hires Taiwan
teachers, and uses Taiwan textbooks. Presently, it consists of a
kindergarten and a junior high school, while planning for a senior
high school is underway. Local businessmen have urged for continued
support from Taiwan to help establish the school.</P>
      <P>Many of the 35 teachers hired from Taiwan hold masters degrees or
doctorates. The Taiwan teachers, whose average age is only 35,
account for approximately 70 percent of the teaching faculty, with
the rest being hired locally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REPS PEN LETTERS URGING SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S U.N. BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven members of the U.S. House of
Representatives Friday sent letters to both Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Sen. Craig Thomas
(R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, urging the Senate to support Taiwan's participation
in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's quest for self-determination is something the United
States of America has traditionally and consistently supported. With
President Chen Shui-bian's free and fair election, Taiwan continues
to refine its democracy by improving safeguards for human rights and
contributing to the international community," wrote the congressmen
from both parties.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the letters pointed out, "Taiwan's efforts to
participate in international organizations have often been thwarted
for political reasons beyond Taiwan's control. It is unreasonable for
the people of Taiwan to be excluded from full participation in
international institutions due to threats from mainland China.
Denying Taiwan membership in the United Nations and other
international organizations, obstructs its access to important
international resources."</P>
      <P>The House on Oct. 3 passed House Concurrent Resolution 390
relating to Taiwan's participation in the United Nations. "We believe
this important legislation will once again restate our support and
commitment to the progress of Taiwan's democracy," stressed the
congressmen.</P>
      <P>They requested the senators to place the House Concurrent
Resolution on the Senate agenda "in order to insure timely passage of
this widely supported resolution," adding that "the people of Taiwan
have proved that freedom and democracy are not just American ideals;
they are universal principles that apply to every individual, to
every community, and to every nation."</P>
      <P>"China's continuing harassment and intimidation in the Taiwan
Straits underlines the urgency and necessity of Taiwan's
participation in the United Nations," noted Wen-yen Chen, president
of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs.</P>
      <P>He added that "today, the U.S. is solely responsible for Taiwan's
safety and security as laid down in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.
When Taiwan joins the U.N., the responsibility for Taiwan's safety
and security will be shifted to the international community."</P>

hope Friday that awarding this year's Nobel Prize in literature to
Gao Xingjiang will serve as a kind of moral salvation for his native
Communist China.</P>
      <P>An editorial in the National Post said Gao's award-winning novel
"Soul Mountain" describes an individual's search for his roots, inner
peace, and personal liberty, themes that are "anathema to every one
of the prescriptive literary rules laid down in 1942 by Mao
Tse-tung."</P>
      <P>For Mao, literature's primary function was to be political, while
aesthetic values were to be suppressed. Also, the writer's audience
was to consist of workers, soldiers, and peasants alone, noted the
editorial.</P>
      <P>"By contrast, Mr. Gao -- who was sent to a re-education camp
during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 -- wrote for a
universal audience and often invoked existential themes," it noted.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the Nobel committee's announcement came in the same
week that Beijing branded the banned Falun Gong a "political rival"
to the Communist Party and an "enemy of the nation," it said.</P>
      <P>One effective way to fight this kind of repression, as Gao has
shown, is to expose the violence inherent within the system, pointed
out the editorial.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA AND U.S. AGREE TO LIMIT SMOG-CAUSING POLLUTANTS</HEADLINE>

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada and the United States reached a deal
Friday to limit smog-causing pollutants that drift across the border
and are believed to be responsible for the deaths of thousands of
people in the two countries each year.</P>
      <P>The pact, officially known as the ozone annex to the Canada-U.S.
Air Quality Agreement, requires a 50 percent reduction in nitrogen
oxide emissions from fossil-fuel power plants in southern Ontario.
Their U.S. counterparts will reduce emissions by as much as 70
percent during the summer, when the effects of smog are the most
damaging.</P>
      <P>Canada's Environment Minister David Anderson said this is good
news for the state of eastern Canada's air quality. He has indicated
that he is prepared to force emission reductions on the province of
Ontario if necessary.</P>
      <P>Ground-level ozone, formed when volatile organic compounds and
nitrogen oxide combine in sunlight, damages the lungs and is blamed
for thousands of premature deaths every year.</P>
      <P>The draft agreement puts an annual cap of 39 kilotons on nitrogen
dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants in Ontario and a five
kiloton cap on emissions from Quebec.</P>
      <P>The draft commits both countries to seeking further emissions
reductions through energy efficiency, renewable energy, the use of
cleaner fuel, and alternative technologies.</P>
      <P>The deal will primarily benefit Ontario and Quebec and adjoining
states in the northern United States. A final agreement is expected
to be signed by the end of the year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT OFFERS '5 GUARANTEES' TO REVIVE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday his
administration will not raise tax rates during his four-year tenure
and will review the existing taxation system with an aim to boost
economic development and increase government tax revenues.</P>
      <P>This was one of the "five guarantees" offered by President Chen
in his speech delivered at an expanded meeting of the Cabinet's
financial and economic task force, headed by Vice Premier Lai
In-jaw.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen also promised to provide a stable investment
environment for local industries. "To ensure continued industrial
development and sustain economic prosperity, the new government will
do its utmost to create a profitable business climate with
adequate capital, manpower, water, electricity and land supplies,"
he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the government will streamline law
enforcement to wipe out irrational protests and ensure smooth
proceeding of legally approved investment and factory construction
projects.</P>
      <P>The president further pledged to upgrade administrative
efficiency to meet the demand of the industrial sector. Chen said he
has directed the Executive Yuan or the Cabinet to unveil a package of
measures within one month for establishing one-stop service counters
for new corporate registration, application for setting up plants in
industrial parks and environmental impact evaluation.</P>
      <P>Chen also pitched for an end to inter-party rivalry, saying that
a war of attrition among major domestic political parties would only
undermine Taiwan's capability to cope with severe challenges in the
increasingly competitive global market.</P>
      <P>"If the long feuding North and South Korea can move toward
reconciliation, I see no reason for continued squabbles among our
domestic parties," Chen said, adding that if all
major local parties can move toward reconciliation and cooperation,
its value will be no less than what a Nobel Peace Prize can offer to
the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Chen cited official tallies to prove that
Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain healthy and robust. For
instance, Chen said, Taiwan's exports registered a remarkable 24
percent growth in the first eight months as compared with the
year-earlier level and industrial production also grew 9 percent
during the same period.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's current economic boom shows no signs of
slowdown, Chen said he feels regret that there is a wide
gap between the island's economic fundamentals and the performance of
its financial sector.</P>
      <P>Chen said he and his new government team will work hard to
resolve present financial and economic problems and revive the
business sector and general public's confidence in his
administration.</P>
      <P>Touching on the controversies surrounding the fourth nuclear
power plant and Meinung dam projects, Chen said the government will
work out long-term plans to ensure adequate water and electricity
supplies over the decades to come. "I hope local people will have
full confidence in the government's determination to realize this
goal."</P>
      <P>The half-day economic and financial meeting was chaired by
Vice Premier Lai In-jaw. This was the first time that the
Cabinet financial task force has met at the Presidential Office. In
addition to the nine members of the task force, heads of the
island's four largest trade and industry associations also attended
the meeting to present their views on resolving current domestic
economic and financial problems, including ways to prop up the
sagging stock market.</P>
      <P>President Chen, Vice President Annette Lu, Secretary-General to
the President Yu Shyi-kun, and National Security Council
Secretary-General Chuang Ming-yao were also present at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the expanded Cabinet financial task force
meeting can provide a forum for the industry sector to strengthen
communication with his new administrative team.</P>
      <P>The task force was founded by former Premier Tang Fei to beef up
the government's handling of financial and economic affairs in the
face of a growing crisis of confidence over the new administration's
failure to articulate its financial and economic policies.</P>
      <P>In addition to Lai, the panel has eight other members -- Central
Bank of China Governor Perng Fai-nan, Finance Minister Yen
Ching-chang, Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, Chen Po-chih, chairman
of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, Lin Chuan,
director-general of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics, Minister-without-Portfolio Chung Chin, Cabinet
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER HEAD OF STATE RADIO DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former director of Taiwan's Central
Broadcasting System, Chu Wan-ching, said in Los Angeles Friday that
she did not know she was restricted from leaving Taiwan after
prosecutors had brought embezzlement charges against her Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a surprise move, Chu left the country only hours after she was
released on NT$500,000 (US$15,700) bail Thursday evening. Upon
arriving in Los Angeles, she was held for questioning at the U.S.
Immigration Office's airport detention facility because Taipei
prosecutors indicated through Interpol that she was the subject of a
criminal investigation.</P>
      <P>However, she was subsequently released Friday afternoon because
she did not violate any immigration regulations, a U.S. Immigration
Office public relations officer said.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held after her release, Chu said that she
was indignant at being suspected by prosecutors of having skipped
bail and being on the run. She added that her "so-called case" had
not yet been brought before the court and that she had not been
indicted, so she expected fair treatment from the justice system.</P>
      <P>She stressed that she left Taipei legally and arrived in the
United States with an unexpired immigration visa and that she had
only left for the United States in order to accompany her son to a
military boarding school in Pennsylvania whose reported registration
deadline is Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that U.S. immigration visa regulations dictate
that she accompany her 15-year-old son to enter the country.
Therefore, she concluded that she had no choice but to place her
son's education ahead of other considerations.</P>
      <P>Chu pointed out that her passport has already been confiscated by
the U.S. Immigration Office, which will speak with her again on Oct.
27 in what is reportedly a hearing on whether to grant her a green
card. Therefore, she added that she will ask her lawyer to file a
request for leave during this period on her behalf at the Taipei
District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>She said that if the prosecutors decide to promulgate an order
for her arrest and treat her unfairly, she is undecided on whether
she will return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said Saturday that they are considering subpoenaing
Chu and that if she does not answer the summon, they will consider an
order for her arrest.</P>
      <P>Chu was suspected of having embezzled some NT$10 million
(US$313,300) from the CBS Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, opposition New Party legislator Lai Shyh-bao
criticized the government for its "inefficiency" and added that the
prosecutors should have immediately telephoned the Bureau of
Immigration after setting down travel restrictions on Chu.</P>
      <P>Lai added that if a "suspect" can remain outside the law's reach
through holes in the justice system, the crisis that the nation would
face in times of major troubles would be "unimaginable." He called
the fact that Chu was able to leave Taiwan despite travel
restrictions "a state of anarchy."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER URGES KINMEN POLICE TO PREPARE FOR THREE MINI DIRECT LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Chang Po-ya
Saturday urged Kinmen police to prepare well in order to be able to
effectively battle the increase in crime that is likely to occur
after the government implements the "three mini direct links" with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang made the call while visiting Kinmen County Police
Headquarters during a trip to Kinmen to preside over celebration
activities for the fifth anniversary of the opening of National
Kinmen Park.</P>
      <P>Chang was accompanied by Deputy Kinmen County Magistrate Yen
Ta-jen from the airport to the police headquarters to hear a briefing
on Kinmen's public security situation.</P>
      <P>Chang Tsang-po, head of Kinmen County Police Headquarters, said
that at present, there are only 212 police officers in the whole
Kinmen area, making it difficult to cope with the increase in crime
since the government terminated the military-led civil administration
system in Kinmen many years ago.</P>
      <P>Once the government implements the "three mini direct links," it
will be even more difficult to effectively crack down on rampant
crime, he added.</P>
      <P>In reply, Chang promised to strengthen the Kinmen police force in
the near future. In addition to his pledge to beef up the police
force, Chang also asked Kinmen police to install more surveillance
equipment and strengthen civil defense in social communities in
preparation for fighting crime after the implementation of the "three
mini direct links."</P>
      <P>The government plans to first implement the "three mini direct
links" between Kinmen and mainland China's Xiamen by the end of this
year, before eventually achieving the ultimate goal of practicing
the "three direct links" with mainland China on an all-out basis.</P>
      <P>The "three links" refer to trade, postal service, and
transportation links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S CURRENT SHOWS OF FORCE NOT AIMED AT TAIWAN: KMT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's ongoing massive-scale
military training exercises are designed to signify its status as a
world military power, not directed at Taiwan, a senior mainland
affairs official with the main opposition Kuomintang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs
Department, said the People's Liberation Army is currently
conducting combined services drills in Beijing suburbs, Inner Mongol,
northeastern China and Bohai -- also mainland China's biggest military
displays in 36 years.</P>
      <P>"As the exercises highlight such missions as attacking stealth
aircraft and cruise missiles, the drills are apparently designed to
beef up the PLA's capability to fight against world-class military
powers," Chang said, adding that such large-scale military exercises
are not suitable for staging in coastal areas.</P>
      <P>In view of the adverse impact of mainland China's previous
military intimidation against Taiwan, Chang said, Beijing has
ordered coastal mainland provinces opposite Taiwan to avoid fanning
bellicose sentiments or atmosphere after Taiwan's pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party won the presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang cautioned that mainland China's current
massive-scale shows of force would deepen U.S. worry about the grave
consequences of a military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait and
thus step up its push for an early resumption of cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Should that be the case, Chang warned that mainland China will
take advantage of the scenario to reinforce its "one China" principle
to secure political interests.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that as mainland China has never renounced its
attempt to use force against Taiwan and has ordered its coastal
provinces to continue combat preparations, the DPP government should
work out effective strategy to cope with mainland China's
double-handed tricks.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin attended a training display near Beijing Friday, one of
four such shows around the country and the biggest since 1964.</P>
      <P>Jiang reportedly urged the mainland armed forces to put
high-technology to work in their training. Photographs of troops and
helicopters in action were splashed across the front pages of
mainland China's state-run newspapers Saturday.</P>
      <P>Beijing's China Daily quoted Jiang as telling troops to remember
their "historic mission" and to "incorporate hi-tech achievements
into their training".</P>
      <P>Mainland media reports gave no details of the arms used in the
displays, but a U.S. Congressional report said Tuesday mainland China
had "significantly" upgraded its conventional arms by buying
equipment from Russia and other countries in recent years.</P>
      <P>They include top-of-the-line SU-27 fighters from Russia, which
are thought to be comparable to the best warplanes in other Asian and
U.S. arsenals.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER REAFFIRMS FEASIBILITY OF NUKE PLANT ALTERNATIVES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi reiterated
Saturday that his ministry's alternative plan to build natural gas
power plants in place of completing construction on Taiwan's fourth
nuclear power plant is feasible and not an "impossible mission."</P>
      <P>Lin was responding to critical remarks by opposition People First
Party legislator Hsieh Chang-chieh who earlier in the day questioned
how Lin expected enough privately-held plants to be constructed in
time to meet the nation's energy needs when only one out of the 11
proposed plants that sought and received government permission five
years ago is now operational.</P>
      <P>With six private plants having abandoned their respective
projects and four seriously stalled due to a lack of capital and
problems with land acquisition, Hsieh wondered aloud whether Lin was
lying or simply "unaware of what was going on."</P>
      <P>Lin responded that it takes only three years to build a natural
gas power plant and that he has even allotted another extra two or
three years in case the projects face any sort of opposition, which
he said that the government would help mitigate through the clear
establishment of compensation standards next year and through the use
of official authority.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that he agrees with a suggestion to run a 161
kilovolt high voltage power line along the Taiwan High Speed Railway
to be constructed in order to resolve the problem of sending power
from southern Taiwan to power-hungry northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, if Taiwan's electricity needs increase by 5.5
percent each year, then the island will need an extra 9 megawatts by
2005. The government was originally planning to meet this need with
the fourth nuclear plant's 2.7 megawatt capacity, another Taiwan
Power Company plant's 4 megawatt capacity, as well as 2.57 megawatts
from private-owned power plants.</P>
      <P>With the government considering putting a stop to the
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant -- a decision Lin said
would be made by the end of the year -- Hsieh asked who would be held
accountable for the energy gap when it happens.</P>
      <P>Hsieh called for Lin to shoulder the political responsibility
because Lin had stated he would step down if his ministry's
suggestions were found to be "absolutely wrong." Hsieh added that he
will continue to announce related "errors" and inside stories.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM UNVEILS 8 MEASURES TO RESOLVE ECON. CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced eight
new measures Saturday as part of the government's efforts to resolve
the economic and political crisis of confidence Taiwan now faces.</P>
      <P>Chang made the announcement after the Cabinet's financial and
economic task force held an expanded meeting at the Presidential
Office to discuss measures for resuming public confidence in the
government's ability to run the domestic economy after the local
bourse lost more than 3,000 points over the past four months.</P>
      <P>Chang told a post-meeting press conference that the government
will not raise tax rates during President Chen Shui-bian's four-year
tenure.</P>
      <P>"No tax hike is not an empty slogan, but a
carefully-evaluated and feasible promise," Chang said, adding that
the Cabinet will accelerate "finding new financial sources and
cutting expenditures" in addition to promoting financial reforms to
back up its "no tax hike" pledge.</P>
      <P>For finding new financial sources, Chang said, the Ministry of
Finance (MOF) will form a national property management task force to
upgrade the use of state-owned land lots.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chang said, the government will encourage
private investment in public construction projects to help reduce
government expenditure and expand private participation in public
affairs. According to Chang, the government will offer incentives to
encourage private industries to operate such public services as
hospital and school management. Various government agencies will
also be required to implement a zero-based budgetary policy and cut
unnecessary spending.</P>
      <P>Other measures worked out at the meeting included:</P>
      <P>-- Cutting the business tax rate for the banking industry to
"zero" from current 2 percent;</P>
      <P>Chang said the tax-exempt measure is aimed at rationalizing the
country's business taxation system and offering traditional
industries easier access to securing working capital.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOF will draft a revision bill to the current
business tax law to exempt banks from the controversial business
tax. The revision bill will require local banks to use funds
generated from the business tax exemption to write off their bad
loans.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, local banks will be required to offer a six-month
grace period for companies in traditional industries with normal
business operations to repay their soon-to-be-matured loans.</P>
      <P>Chang said the tax exemption will cost the national coffers an
estimated NT$30 billion. "The MOF will raise funds from other
sources to offset this shortfall in order not to affect the central
government's financial grants to local-level governments," the
premier said.</P>
      <P>-- Coordinating local banks to pool a NT$450 billion fund for
offering low-interest (6.5 percent to percent) loans to blue-chip
traditional industry companies, with a maximum maturity period of
seven years;</P>
      <P>-- Opening door to foreign investors to set up asset management
companies in Taiwan to accelerate modernization and globalization of
the local banking industry;</P>
      <P>"The new liberalization measure is expected to help local banks
handle bad debts by using foreign expertise and capital as well as to
help increase domestic job opportunities and facilitate manpower
training," Chang explained.</P>
      <P>-- Ensuring no water and electricity shortages;</P>
      <P>Chang said the government will assist private investors of power
plants now under construction to overcome current investment barriers
and revise the existing regulations governing private investment
in the power generation industry to encourage private investment
in smaller-scale power plants and development of recyclable energy
resources.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang said, a number of new reservoirs and water
supply systems will be built in various parts of the island and many
old dams will be renovated or expanded to ensure adequate water
supplies for corporations and private homes.

      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, the Cabinet has directed the Council for
Economic Planning and Development to set aside NT$10 billion as the
industrial parks development fund to facilitate leasing of land lots
in local industrial parks so that investors can more easily acquire
pieces of land for factory construction. If necessary, Chang said,
the fund will be increased to NT$30 billion. Moreover, single-stop
service counters will be established at major industrial parks to
improve services for prospective investors.</P>
      <P>-- Assisting traditional industries and small- and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) in upgrading and transforming their operations;</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will use its
10 existing industry assisting systems and its NT$15 billion
science-technology development fund to help SMEs upgrade production,
marketing and management.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOEA will join forces with other relevant
government agencies in forming a service group to help local
industries cut production costs, strengthen research and
development, and upgrade competitiveness.</P>
      <P>-- Accelerating upgrading of the quality of local labor force and
providing a proper quantity of foreign laborers;</P>
      <P>Chang said the Council of Labor Affairs will consult with
employers, employees and legislators in drafting a revision bill to
the current Labor Standard Law for adopting an eight-week flexible
work hours system in preparation for the government's plan to
implement a five-day work week system next year.</P>
      <P>The labor council will also revise current laws to ensure gender
equality at workplace, remove employment barriers for female and
increase job opportunities for local women to resolve labor
shortage problems, Chang said.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the Cabinet financial task force

    <HEADLINE>EX-MAC CHIEF CLAIMS 'SPIRIT OF 1992' IS INVENTED BY FOREIGNER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Su Chi alleged Saturday that the term "spirit of 1992"
used in President Chen Shui-bian's olive branch to Beijing was
invented by a foreign national, not Chen himself.</P>
      <P>Su, the Republic of China's mainland policy planner during the
former Kuomintang-government era, made the remarks during a seminar
on cultivating a peaceful climate in the Taiwan Strait, sponsored by
the KMT's national security division.</P>
      <P>Su said President Chen has pitched for a return to the "spirit
of 1992" for resuming dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"This may not be a wise strategy because, logically, without a
consensus there can't be a spirit," Su said, adding that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait really had a consensus in 1992 on the
"one China, separate interpretation" principle.</P>
      <P>Based on this consensus, Su said, a historic cross-strait
summit, known as the Koo-Wang meeting, became possible in 1993. "And
the Koo-Wang meeting further led to a series of cross-strait talks on
certain practical, technical issues between 1993 and 1995," Su
explained.</P>
      <P>He claimed that President Chen, a stalwart of the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, intends to use the
term of "spirit of 1992" to replace the "1992 consensus" to cover up
his reluctance to accept the phrase that "Taiwan is part of China."</P>
      <P>Su said the KMT's stance is that both Taiwan and the mainland are
parts of China.</P>
      <P>"In the past, Beijing was unwilling to say 'both Taiwan and
the mainland are parts of China,'" Su said. After the DPP came to
power in May, Beijing has adjusted its wording and declared publicly
that both Taiwan and the mainland are parts of China.</P>
      <P>Su said the DPP government should recognize Beijing's goodwill
in making such a statement and begins to take measures to test
Beijing's sincerity, including whether Beijing would truly treat
Taiwan on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>"The DPP should government should not continue ignoring
Beijing's goodwill gesture, otherwise, the long-stalled cross-strait
relations can't make headway," Su said.</P>
      <P>He further reminded President Chen that the vague term "spirit of
1992" would only make the already confused cross-strait relations
even more turbulent and disordered.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Su said since the phrase "spirit of 1992" was invented
by an English-speaking foreigner, it remains to be seen whether the
"involvement of this foreign factor" will have a positive or
negative impact on the future development of cross-strait
relations.</P>

and industrial organizations said Saturday that they were satisfied
with the outcome of the expanded meeting of the Executive Yuan's
financial and economic task force.</P>
      <P>The meeting, held at the Presidential Office, was designed to
find ways to stabilize Taiwan's financial and economic situation,
especially the stock market.</P>
      <P>Eight measures were adopted at the meeting to help resolve the
pressing financial and economic problems, including no tax increase
during President Chen Shui-bian's four-year tenure.</P>
      <P>Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, said that his suggestions have been included
in the conclusions of the meeting and that he believes the new
government is determined to engage in renovation.</P>
      <P>He said that he will throw his full support behind the
implementation of the conclusions reached at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng, chairman of the Republic of China's General
Chamber of Commerce, voiced his appreciation on behalf of the
financial institutions for the decision to cancel the 2 percent
business tax levied on financial institutions.</P>

Wang said that he hopes the Finance Ministry will exchange views with
representatives from the insurance industry and from the financial,
commerce, and industrial circles.</P>

will invest capital in Taiwan's traditional industries and help them
in management.</P>
      <P>Tai Sheng-tung, president of the Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises' Association, said that those attending the meeting
decided to provide greater government guarantees for enterprises
applying for loans.</P>

loans will become available for Taiwan's small and medium-sized

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The president's advisory group on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations Saturday urged Beijing to resume
bilateral negotiations based on the spirit of 1992-93, which paved
the way for constructive exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Michael Hsiao, spokesman for the group, told the media after the
group's second meeting that participants of the meeting also called
on the leaders of the island's major political parties to get
together to work out the foundation for talks with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairperson Tsai Ing-wen and Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow were invited
to make reports at the meeting, which was presided over by Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, head of the group.</P>
      <P>After hearing the reports, members of the group expressed the
hope that cross-strait dialogue will be able to resume in line with
the 1992-93 spirit, under which SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu and his
mainland counterpart, Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait Chairman Wang Daohan, held their first meeting in Singapore in
April 1993.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait exchanges were interrupted by then-President Lee
Teng-hui's visit to the United States in June 1995, and have been
suspended since Lee redefined cross-strait relations as a special
state-to-state relationship in July last year.</P>
      <P>As the president's advisory group is only a consultative body,
Hsiao told reporters that the suggestions worked out by the group
will not replace the official guidelines for national unification.</P>
      <P>He said the group plans to present a report to the president on
the principle for dealing with cross-strait affairs by the end of
this year.</P>
      <P>Regarding the "one China" issue, Hsiao said that more
clarification from both sides is required, and added that this issue
was raised at the day's meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISITING HAITIAN PRESIDENT BIDS FAREWELL TO ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
reaffirmed Sunday that the ROC would like to strengthen exchanges and
cooperation with Haiti in every aspect.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that Haitian President Rene Preval
gained a better understanding of the ROC during his visit and will
work toward increasing bilateral relations based on the solid
foundation of the two countries' relationship.</P>
      <P>The Haitian president and his wife, leading an official
delegation, arrived in Taipei Oct. 9 to attend celebration activities
marking the ROC's Double Ten National Day.</P>
      <P>President Preval, accompanied by Vice Foreign Affairs Minister
David Lee, called on President Chen at the Presidential Office to bid
him farewell before departing later in the day.</P>
      <P>President Chen noted that this was President Preval's second
visit to Taiwan and that he is the only Haitian head of state to
visit the ROC twice, showing that Preval attaches great importance to
the ROC-Haiti friendship.</P>
      <P>The President said that he hopes to visit the Caribbean country
soon to reciprocate the long-term support of the ROC by the Haitian
government and people.</P>
      <P>Chen also lauded Preval as a true friend of Taiwan, saying that
although the Haitian president cannot seek re-election after
completing his five-year term as stated in the Haitian constitution,
"we welcome him to visit again as an expert in agriculture so as to
promote further exchanges and cooperation between the two sides."</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that the year-end presidential

    <HEADLINE>ROC VP URGES SPONSORING OF IMPOVERISHED LATIN AMERICA CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu Sunday urged the
people of Taiwan to take substantial action by sponsoring
impoverished children in Latin America to help cement ties with the
ROC's allies in the region.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while speaking about her recent visit to four
Central American countries at the Kiwanis International ROC district
27th Summit Convention in central Taiwan's Shalu township, Taichung
County.</P>
      <P>Lu said that during her visit to El Salvador, Honduras, Belize,
and Guatemala, the media in those countries had reported prominently
of her visit, showing the importance those countries attached to her
visit.</P>
      <P>She said that these diplomatic allies of Taiwan, under
international pressure, have demonstrated steady support for the ROC
over the years, adding that such steady support has made her realize
that the ROC does not need countries that are "too greedy," but
countries that "really support us."</P>
      <P>Lu stressed that in order to help cement the ROC's relations with
its Central American allies, she is ready to introduce the music and
dance of Mayan culture to Taiwan, adding that she was quite impressed
by Mayan culture during her recent visit.</P>
      <P>She pointed out that she will also launch a campaign for the
sponsoring of 10,000 impoverished children in Latin America, saying
she believes love is inexhaustible. She expressed the hope that
members of Kiwanis International could pool their resources to help
the nation gain more diplomatic allies during the four-year term of
the administration under President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>She also said that Taiwan's annual per capita income surge from
US$100 to US$14,000 over the past five decades could be attributed to
five factors: human rights on the island, total democratization,
peace, love, and the island's development of technology.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMY-BOOSTING PACKAGE GREETED WITH DOUBTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The measures introduced Saturday by
President Chen Shui-bian's administration aimed at boosting Taiwan's
sagging economy were greeted with doubts by economists and the
opposition Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, said President Chen's promise of no tax-hikes during
his four-year term may be welcome by tax-payers, but could backfire
by harming the country's long-term financial health.</P>
      <P>The well-known economist said the administration can probably
afford to keep tax rates at current levels for the next year, but its
ability to initiate major programs in the final three years of its
term will be heavily constrained unless it can pull in extra income.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government's budget for fiscal year 2001 is
already extremely tight despite the fact that the government has
raised loans to the legal capacity, Lee said the administration will
have difficulty in governing with the current amount of revenues, not
to mention if it implements any tax cuts.</P>
      <P>Under the economy-boosting package unveiled by President Chen,
the two percent transaction tax levied on the finance industry will
be lifted at an estimated cost of NT$30 billion (US$0.96 billion) per
year to the government.</P>
      <P>"How can a government without financial resources promote the
public's confidence in the economy?" Lee asked.</P>
      <P>Further more, Lee said, revenues from the transaction tax have
already been factored into the 2001 budget, so the loss of the NT$30
billion in revenues will force the government to sell some of the
state's assets, likely at loss, to fill the gap. Lee added that such
a move doesn't serve the public's interest.</P>
      <P>Sun Ta-chiang, spokesman for the People First Party, dismissed
the package as "a radical shot in the arm" meant to have an immediate
effect rather than provide a long-term cure for the country's ailing
economy, despite the good intentions of its authors.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the government's promise of loans to refugees of the
Sept. 21 earthquake, Sun said the move benefits only a small minority
of citizens because of the strict requirements, adding that the
offering of NT$450 billion (US$14.28 billion) in potential loans to
small- and medium-sized enterprises will also have only a limited
effect for the same reason.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, former chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development and head of a Kuomintang think tank,
criticized the government for what he called "beating around the
bush".</P>
      <P>The leading architect of Taiwan's prosperous economy under the
rule of the KMT pointed out that the pursuit of an independent and
nuclear-free Taiwan by Presdient Chen and his Democratic Progressive
Party are the main causes for Taiwan's economic woes.</P>
      <P>"Any measures not addressing these causes will miss the point and
are doomed to fail," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Chen and his party drop the advocacy of Taiwan
independence from the DPP party charter, saying this has blocked the
government's contacts with Beijing and thereby hampered the
establishment of direct shipping links between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Direct shipping links, Chiang argued, would provide a lifeline
for Taiwan's faltering manufacturing industry by creating a situation
where mainland China could be used as a manufacturing base for its
low-end products while maintaining Taiwan as a base for its factories
producing high-tech goods.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing industry is teetering on the edge of
extinction because of the high labor costs on the island and the
fierce competition from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The KMT think tank head also urged the government to continue the
construction of the island's fourth nuclear plant, which Chen's
administration is moving to scrap on environmental grounds.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the abolishment of the plant will cast doubts on the
government's commitment to boosting the economy.</P>
      <P>He also expressed doubts about the wisdom of having the president
personally involved in the task of rescuing the economy.</P>
      <P>Calling the president the government's last resort in rallying
public confidence, Chiang said he is worried that Chen may come to
the end of his tether if the economy-boosting measures fail and his
credibility suffers as a result.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPERT FORESEES NO IMMEDIATE CONFLICT ACROSS THE TAIWAN STRAIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington  D.C.  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung &amp; Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. expert on Chinese affairs
said in Washington Saturday that although no conflict across the
Taiwan Strait is expected to happen in the foreseeable future,
relations between the two sides are still unstable and a crisis could
potentially develop.</P>
      <P>David Brown, deputy director of the Asian Research Department of
the John Hopkins International Research Institute, said that although
Beijing Vice Premier Qian Qichen has proposed certain new ideas on
the issue of cross-strait relations, Beijing has been concentrating
on using Taiwan's internal disputes to push the government of Chen
Shui-bian into accepting Beijing's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>Brown, in his article recently published in a periodical on Far
East Asia's bilateral relations, said President Chen has decided not
to yield to pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Chen administration' failure to reach a compromise with the
opposition Kuomintang, which holds a majority in the Legislative
Yuan, has been the main factor paralyzing the administration's
ability to carry out its policies, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT's ability to employ procedural moves to delay
deliberations on the national budget bill and on whether or not to
continue construction on Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear power
plant has caused the serious dispute between the Executive branch and
the Legislative Yuan, he said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's economic performance has been good, the
continuing plunge in Taipei's stock market has shown the public's
lack of confidence in the administration. Despite the government's
best efforts at halting the plunge in the stock market, stock prices
have dropped over 25 percent since President Chen was inaugurated on
May 20.</P>
      <P>Brown, a career diplomat who has served in U.S. diplomatic
missions in Beijing, Taipei and Hong Kong, said that the tension
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has relaxed and that both
sides have expressed the hope of resuming dialogue.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the manner or style of dialogue has not yet
been agreed upon and the prospects of dialogue resuming anytime soon
are limited.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration has told the Beijing government that
President Chen Shui-bian's pragmatic approach to cross-strait
relations will open new opportunities for dialogue between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait, noted Brown.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJORITY OF PEOPLE CONSIDER GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PACKAGE HELPFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 70 percent of the people of Taiwan
said they think the economic promotion package passed Saturday by an
enlarged conference of government financial and economic leaders will
be helpful, according to a survey released Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the poll conducted by the Trendgo Survey Research Center, 60
percent of those interviewed said the eight-point package will at
least boost the faltering stock market, although 65 percent of the
respondents listed political turmoil and investors' lack of
confidence as the main causes for the stock market's nose-dive.</P>
      <P>The other reasons stated by interviewees for the stock market's
plummet in order were capital flight, including local investment in
mainland China, the depletion of domestic capital, the worsening of
the international economic situation, and the deterioration of the
domestic economy.</P>
      <P>The total capitalization of Taiwan's public-listed stocks has
decreased by about one third since the new government was sworn in on
May 20.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the respondents said their families owned
stocks and were therefore feeling the pinch.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 62.8 percent of the people interviewed said the
government's economic promotion package will boost non-technology
based industries, which bore the brunt of the stock price plummet,
and 75.4 percent of them said they support the package.</P>
      <P>The poll also found, 51.9 percent of the public is satisfied with
the government's efficiency in addressing Taiwan's economic woes,

    <HEADLINE>EXPERTS SAY TAIWAN ENJOYS SOLID ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several local economic experts cited
statistics Sunday to illustrate that Taiwan's economic fundamentals
are actually quite good, despite the general lack of confidence in
the government's ability to handle economic and financial issues.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, said that Taiwan's exports registered a 25 percent annual
growth rate in the period from January to September 2000, the best
performance for that period over the last 12 years. He added that
this reflects the high competitiveness of Taiwan in the world market.</P>
      <P>Wu cited the statistics after the Cabinet's economic and
financial task force held an expanded meeting to find out ways to
recover the public's confidence in the government's capability to
handle economic and financial issues, especially as the local bourse
has dropped more than 3,000 points over the last four months.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the logic that the lack of public confidence in
the stock market could also affect the economic situation is wrong,
adding that the notion that the government was forced to hold an
emergency economic meeting because of the slumping stock market is
also arguable. However, he said he personally supports the eight
measures to prop up the domestic economy that the task force came up
with in Saturday's meeting.</P>
      <P>He Mei-yueh, vice chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, said the relocation of some
industries abroad is quite normal, adding that there are also some
foreign enterprises shifting to Taiwan. She also noted that this
situation is beneficial to the changing structure of Taiwan's
industries.</P>
      <P>He indicated that local industries must experiment with change
and accept the new circumstances, saying that they can no longer
count on a large supply of cheap labor, like in mainland China, to
remain competitive.</P>
      <P>He said that in a recent vice ministerial economic meeting
between Taiwan and United States, the U.S. delegates shared the view
that Taiwan's economic development is very stable, pointing to
Taiwan's 6.5 percent economic growth rate, its 9 percent industrial
growth rate, and its low commodity price fluctuations and low
unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The U.S. delegation also saw no presence of political instability
in Taiwan, and on the contrary, stated that the existence of
different opinions between diverse political parties is quite natural
and healthy, he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian has said people are
free to criticize the government, but the best way to resolve the
nation's problems is to sit down together and discuss solutions,
adding that he agrees with his opinion that only cooperation can
contribute to economic development.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, Sunday urged the government to pay more attention to the
nation's economic problems.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks at the launching of a cultural and
educational foundation headed by Chao Shou-po, director-general of
the KMT's Department of Central Organization.</P>
      <P>Lien said he was worried about Taiwan's unemployment rate, which
recently hit its highest level in years at 3.6 percent. The average
waiting period for finding new employment also increased to six
months.</P>
      <P>Lien recalled that when Chao was the chairman of the Council of
Labor Affairs, he began to introduce foreign laborers into Taiwan.
But judging from the current economic situation, Lien expressed
worries that if the economy continues to worsen, Taiwan will turn
from a foreign labor importer to exporter.</P>
      <P>Lien also reminded the government to pay more attention to the
downsizing of the Taiwan provincial government, saying that the next
stage in the downsizing process will soon begin and measures need to
be taken to accommodate the thousands of government employees who
will be affected.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Pressure on Chinese Petroleum Corp. to hike
its oil prices has temporarily eased as international oil prices
stabilized over the weekend in light of the peace summit in the
Middle East scheduled for Monday, CPC sources said.</P>
      <P>The average international oil price declined to about US$33 a
barrel over the weekend.</P>
      <P>A CPC spokesman said a price hike in the near future is unlikely
if the summit meeting helps lead to a peaceful resolution to the
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. He added however that a
price surge would be inevitable should the peace summit fail and the
international price of oil increase to US$37 a barrel.</P>
      <P>Citing last Friday's West Texas Intermediate benchmark price,
which decreased US$1.19 from the previous trading day to settle at
US$33.8 a barrel, the CPC official said world oil prices have
stabilized after reaching a 10-year high on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CPC Vice President Tsai San-lang told reporters Monday that
chances are good that the CPC will raise oil prices if world prices
surge to US$37 a barrel.</P>
      <P>Monday's peace summit, being participated in by the leaders of
Israel, Palestine, the United States, and several Middle Eastern
nations, is not expected to have more than modest results.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2000 Paralympic Games, with almost
4,000 participating athletes from 128 different countries, is set to
kick off October 18.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Carmen McCrone, chief of the Sydney
Paralympic Organizing Committee's media relations, said the
"Paralympic Games is the world's biggest sporting event in terms of
the number of athletes and countries taking part in the 11-day
event."</P>
      <P>She said that, in addition, about 2,600 journalists, 2,000 team
officials, 1,000 technicians, and about 10,000 volunteers will
participate in what she described as "the largest contingent ever for
a single international sports event."</P>
      <P>Tim Fischer, formerly deputy prime minister of Australia and now
the Paralympic mayor, told a news conference on Monday that the "2000
Paralympic Games will be a great success because of the unceasing
efforts being made by all the organizers and the tremendous support
from the Australian people."</P>
      <P>Chinese Taipei, which will have 25 athletes taking part in six
different events, will be trying to improve on its performance at the
1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games at which it won one gold and two bronze
medals.</P>
      <P>The events Chinese Taipei athletes will compete in are track and
field, judo, power lifting, swimming, table tennis, and tennis.</P>
      <P>"Our athletes are better prepared this time, so we hope they can
perform better and win even more medals this year," said Chang
Chao-shen, deputy chief of the Chinese Taipei team, in an interview
with the CNA on Monday.</P>
      <P>All 87,000 tickets for the opening ceremony on October 18 and the
closing ceremony on October 29 have been sold out, as have the
tickets to all the major events, including basketball, swimming, and
track and field.</P>
      <P>The SPOC has spent almost A$180 million (US$113 million) on
hosting the Paralympic Games, much less than the US$3.75 billion
poured into the just-concluded Olympic Games. Part of the reason for
the lower price tag is the fact that the Paralympics will make use of
facilities built for the Olympics that are already in place, an SPOC
spokesman told the CNA.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is recruiting millions of
officials to conduct the world's largest census, reported the Sydney
Morning Herald on Monday.</P>
      <P>Beijing will utilize 6 million census officials to collect the
details of the world's most populous country. Five million of them
will knock on the doors of 350 million households to conduct
interviews and 1 million advisers will check their work, reported the
daily.</P>
      <P>In the previous census taken ten years ago, officials discovered
8 million more people than they expected. The daily reported mainland
China put the country's population at about 1,259,090,000, or 22
percent of the world's population.</P>
      <P>The daily however questioned the accuracy and efficiency of the
census because many Chinese families do not report second or third
children to census takers because they are afraid of being punished
for violating the country's strict one-child policy.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that in a society where people are deeply
suspicious of officialdom, many balk at giving intimate details about
their daily lives.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former director of Taiwan's Central
Broadcasting System, Chu Wan-ching (Gloria Chu), said Monday that she
will return to Taiwan to face justice as soon as she has her passport
retrieved from the U.S. Immigration Office.</P>
      <P>In a long-distance telephone interview with Taipei's UFO Radio,
Chu, who is currently in the United States, denied having been aware
that she was restricted from leaving Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chu, however, offered her apologies to Taiwan prosecutors and
admitted that she was wrong to have said that she will not return to
Taiwan "if the prosecutors decide to promulgate an order for her
arrest and treat her unfairly."</P>
      <P>Chu, 50, was discovered early last Friday morning to have left
the country only a couple hours after she was released on NT$500,00
(US$15,700) bail Thursday night after being charged with
embezzlement.</P>
      <P>Upon arriving in Los Angeles, she was held for questioning at the
U.S. Immigration Office's airport detention facility after Taipei
prosecutors indicated through Interpol that she was the subject of a
criminal investigation.</P>
      <P>However, she was subsequently released Friday afternoon (U.S.
West Coast time) because she was found not to have violated any
immigration regulations, said a U.S. Immigration Office public
relations officer.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held after her release in Los Angeles, Chu
said that she was indignant at being suspected by prosecutors of
having skipped bail and being on the run. She added that her
"so-called case" had not yet been brought before the court and that
she had not been indicted, so she expected fair treatment from the
justice system.</P>
      <P>She stressed that she left Taipei legally and arrived in the
United States with an unexpired immigration visa and that she had
only left for the United States in order to accompany her son to
Valley Forge, a military boarding school in Pennsylvania whose
reported registration deadline is Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>Chu noted that her passport has already been confiscated by the
U.S. Immigration Office, which will speak with her again on Oct. 27
in an interview on whether to grant her a green card. Therefore, she
added that she will ask her lawyers to file a request for leave
during the period on her behalf at the Taipei District Prosecutors
Office.</P>
      <P>On Monday, TDPO Assistant Chief Prosecutor Chang Wen-cheng
stressed that the investigation of Chu's embezzlement case will
continue and will definitely not be interrupted by Chu's staying in
the United States.</P>
      <P>Chang noted however that it is still too early to speculate on
whether the TDPO will promulgate an order for Chu's arrest. He said
that if she were to fail to appear in court after being subpoenaed
three times, an order for her arrest would be issued, but he added
that "the subpoena process has not even begun yet."</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, Prosecutor Shen Ming-lun visited Chu's Taipei
residence on Chingcheng Street to inspect the luxurious interior
decorations which were allegedly payed for using money from the
Central Broadcast System Trust Fund.</P>
      <P>Chu, who is said to have maintained close connections with
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his wife, is suspected of having
embezzled some NT$16 million (US$516,130) from the CBS Trust Fund.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN FORMULA MAY NOT SUITABLE FOR ROC'S U.N. BID: FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tien Hung-mao
said Monday that the formula used by North and South Korea to join
the United Nations may not necessarily suitable for the Republic of
China to adopt in promoting its U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Tien
said it took the two Koreas 28 years to realize their goal of
joining the United Nations simultaneously under the formula of a
divided country.</P>
      <P>As the separation of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait differs
from the division of North and South Korea, Tien said, the Korean
formula may not necessarily be useful for Taiwan's U.N. bid.</P>
      <P>Tien said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has consistently
promoted the ROC's U.N. bid based on the fact that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are separately ruled.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that mainland China can face up to this reality
and accept it," Tien said.</P>
      <P>The minister admitted that the ROC faces many hurdles in
pursuing U.N. representation and that there is no panacea to cope
with all those obstacles.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tien said, the MOFA will not be daunted by any
setbacks nor will it cease its promotional efforts because seeking a
U.N. seat provides an important opportunity for the ROC to assert
its sovereign status and defend its position and legitimate rights in
the international community.</P>
      <P>Tien said he feels regret that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait still fail to resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>Noting that the MOFA is not in a position to decide when
cross-strait dialogue can be resumed, Tien said even if Taiwan and
mainland China resume dialogue, its effect on the ROC's U.N bid
remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>The ROC, a U.N. founding member, has been shut out of the United
Nations since 1971 when the U.N. General Assembly gave the China
seat to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Since 1993, ROC allies have annually pushed the U.N. authority to
set up a special committee to work on measures to resolve Taiwan's
representation issue. The proposal, however, has been unable to make
the U.N. General Assembly agenda over the past eight years.</P>
      <P>In the future, Tien said, the MOFA will convince as many
diplomatic allies as possible to endorse the proposal urging the U.N.
authority to form a special committee to study the ROC's
representation issue. Meanwhile, he said, the MOFA will also
persuade as many countries with diplomatic ties with Beijing as
possible to adopt a neutral, impartial attitude toward the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Monday called
for the Taiwan public as well as Chinese patriots abroad to have
confidence in his government's ability to revitalize the sagging
economy.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Presidential Office tea party for representatives of
the overseas Chinese community who returned to Taiwan to attend the
National Day celebrations, Chen said the administration is only now
able to begin tackling domestic issues, now that it has dealt with
handling cross-strait relations, stabilizing foreign relations, and
boosting the morale of the military.</P>
      <P>Chen said that since he took office, cross-strait relations, the
nation's diplomatic policies, and stability in the military -- all
highly challenging issues for him -- have been resolved to at least
satisfactory levels, thanks to the efforts of the administration.</P>
      <P>The government has the time and energy to tackle domestic affairs
and related issues only now that those other major concerns have been
at least temporarily settled, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He added, however, that it will take a great deal of time and
patience to deal with domestic affairs and related reforms.</P>
      <P>Currently, the government is making extraordinary efforts on
revitalizing the sagging economy, initiating administrative reforms,
working on post-disaster rehabilitation, wiping out "black gold"
politics, and enacting judiciary and educational reforms, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen saluted ethnic Chinese residing abroad as a
special group, which he called "the mother of the Chinese revolution"
and "the father of reforms." He called for the overseas Chinese
community to continue to support the new government of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In related news, Presidential Office sources said Monday that
Chen is planning to meet personally with the heads of the other three
major opposition parties in the near future to exchange views on
major national issues.</P>
      <P>After failing to host a roundtable meeting with Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong, which
he called soon after his inauguration, Chen changed tracks recently
and planned to meet with Lien, Soong and New Party head Hao
Lung-ping, in a "face-to-face" manner.</P>
      <P>To realize that goal, Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun
will first meet with the secretaries general of the three opposition
parties to pave the way for the "one-to-one" meetings, to be presided
over by Chen himself, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Yu reportedly first met with PFP Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi
Monday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD QUESTIONS GOV'T FOR MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON 'MERE IDEOLOGY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
said Monday that the government's refusal to build a power plant when
northern Taiwan lacks electricity and a reservoir when the south
lacks water is blind worship of ideology without regard for reason.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the financial crisis facing Taiwan today
as reflected in the stock market is merely the tip of the iceberg.
Economics problems, political issues, and cross-strait relations are
all being closely watched by the public because investors look three
to five years ahead, he said.</P>
      <P>Receiving representatives of an advisory industry organization,
Lien added that people have much to complain about, with nobody
certain of cross-strait stability after the new government's
statement that unification with mainland China is not the only
option.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside criticism that opposition parties oppose the
government simply because they are unwilling to accept their election
defeat, Lien -- who was the KMT's presidential candidate in the March
18 election -- said that his party has experienced and talented
members in its ranks, and therefore has the responsibility to point
out its views on certain issues.</P>
      <P>Democratic politics is about competition where good policies,
ideologies, and ideas receive the people's recognition, he said. He
added that when certain policies or ideologies don't work out, then
it is time for the ruling party to be replaced by other parties.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that the KMT's fundamental position is to place
Taiwan's stability, prosperity, and democracy as the first and
foremost of its considerations. Under this principle, he said that
Taipei and Beijing should co-exist under a peaceful and reciprocal
manner.</P>
      <P>Other than economic and cross-strait issues, Lien pointed out the
importance of the stability of the constitutional system. He went on
to say that the ruling party must respect the rules set down by the
constitution and must especially respect the legislative majority
party -- the KMT -- so that the nation's affairs can run smoothly.</P>
      <P>He added that this is not a matter of being unable to accept
election defeat, but rather conventional practice in a democracy. He
also urged the new government to clearly establish its policies
instead of constantly changing them, which he said has left the
people at a loss as to what to do.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say that the amount of bad debts in the nation's
financial system is so high that he does not dare to predict whether
a local financial storm will erupt. He urged the government to be
courageous and wise in pointing out its views instead of "fumbling
about in a dark room."</P>
      <P>The KMT is scheduled to hold a meeting of former economic
officials Tuesday to discuss the financial issues now facing the
nation and make recommendations to supplement the eight major
economic policies declared by the government Saturday.</P>
      <P>Also on Tuesday, the KMT legislative caucus is scheduled to
discuss whether to push for a no-confidence motion against the
minority administration and force a special parliamentary election to
try to break the deadlock in the current political landscape.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng Yung-chuan, director-general of the KMT's
Department of Party-Government Coordination in the legislature,
stressed that if the timing of the no-confidence vote is detrimental
to the entire people and to political stability, he is certain the
KMT will not follow through with it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-ROC PRESIDENT ATTENDS `FORUM 2000' IN PRAGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Prague,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui chatted Sunday with Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel at
a cocktail reception in honor of the participants in the ongoing
fourth Forum 2000 conference.</P>
      <P>Havel thanked Lee for the hospitality extended by the ROC
government to his wife during a visit she made to Taiwan a few years
ago when Lee was still in office.</P>
      <P>The poet-turned-politician was also quoted as having told Lee
that he himself will consider making a trip to Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>On his way to Prague, Lee described Havel as a good friend, even
though the two had never met. Lee further said he was very happy to
have been invited to attend the Forum 2000 conference and to have the
opportunity to meet with Havel in person.</P>
      <P>Complimented by conference organizers for his contribution to
Taiwan's democratization, Lee was among the 50-plus retired heads of
state, religious leaders, influential politicians, writers and
artists from around the world invited to attend the Oct. 15-18 forum.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Havel said globalization was one
of major themes to be discussed in the conference, and added that he
is still not sure whether globalization will have a positive or
negative impact on the well-being of mankind.</P>
      <P>"But one thing is certain -- that education will be even more
important in the 21st century," Havel said, adding that education is
not only aimed at increasing people's knowledge but also at the
promotion of their well-being.</P>
      <P>Forum 2000 is a think tank jointly founded by Havel and a
Japanese foundation in 1997 to explore the values of culture and
civilization to human development. The 2000 conference will focus on
the values of education, culture and religion in what was described
as the "year of globalization."</P>
      <P>Lee and his wife were seated in the first row, together with
former South African President Frederik de Klerk, a co-winner of the
1993 Nobel Peace Prize. Lee and de Klerk had met in both Taipei and
the South African capital of Pretoria when they were still at the
helms of their respective countries.</P>
      <P>Lee, a devout Christian, was scheduled to deliver a keynote
speech on globalization-related religious issues Tuesday, at a
session chaired by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader. Lee had extensive talks with the Dalai Lama when he made his
first visit to Taiwan in 1997. It was not clear whether they will
hold closed-door talks during their stay in Prague. The Dalai Lama
was scheduled to arrive Monday.</P>
      <P>Also attending the four-day meeting are former Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres and former Polish Prime Minister Hanna
Suchocka.</P>
      <P>Lee will tour noted Czech cultural sites and tourist attractions
after the forum ends. He and his entourage are scheduled to return to
Taipei Oct. 22. Members of his entourage include former National
Security Council Secretary-General Ding Mou-shih and several of his
close aides.</P>
      <P>Mainland China last month condemned Lee's trip to Prague, saying
he should not be given a forum for activities aimed at separating
Taiwan from the mainland.</P>
      <P>A mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman accused Lee of having
always engaged in activities aimed at Taiwan independence during his
12-year stint as ROC president.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic recognizes mainland China, but maintains
friendly substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing lodged protests with London when Lee made his first
overseas visit to Britain in June following his retirement on May 20.</P>
      <P>The 78-year-old former ROC president is an outspoken critic of
mainland China's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan and infuriated
Beijing last year by declaring that Beijing-Taipei relations should
be on "a special state-to-state" basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER URGES TAIPEI-BEIJING RECONCILIATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Tuesday that the time for Taipei-Beijing reconciliation has
come, adding that the government will evaluate and plan for direct
trade, postal, and transport links with mainland China in stages.</P>
      <P>Reporting at a legislative interpellation session, Chang said
that when even the leaders of North and South Korea can step out of
their ideological frames to break their long-standing impasse,
Beijing and Taipei must do the same and replace criticisms and
diatribes with rational dialogue.</P>
      <P>He added that conflict must be replaced with negotiations and
hostility with good will so that room for "broadband communication"
between the two sides can be created, thereby establishing a new
normalized, institutionalized, and transparent interactive framework.</P>
      <P>As a gesture of good will, Chang said that Taipei will not have
any predetermined stance going into negotiations with Beijing, which
he said can take any form, take place under any occasion, and dwell
on any subject as long as both put aside their disagreements and
reach out to the future under the principles of acceptance, equality,
and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Chang also pointed out that evaluations and planning have been
completed on the "mini-three links" between mainland China's Fujian
Province and Taiwan's outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the initial stage will be based on the
principle of "one port per area," with links to be established
between set points and regular runs to occur at periodic intervals on
fixed routes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Police Administration Director-General Wang
Ching-wang was in Kinmen Tuesday to look into local law enforcement
needs. He pointed out that Kinmen's police force will be beefed up to
help prepare for the mini-three links scheduled to commence in
December.</P>
      <P>The number of tourists from Taiwan to Kinmen is expected to
increase with the implementation of the mini-three links. At the same
time, up to 700 mainland Chinese citizens will be allowed to enter
Kinmen per day and approximately 2,800 will be in Kinmen at any one
time, Wang said. Because of this sudden influx, Wang noted that
public security measures must be taken to thoroughly investigate all
smuggling channels for illegal drugs, firearms, and fugitives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT EXPRESSES VIEWS ON RELATIONS WITH CHINA (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 16 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is an English translation
of the text of an interview with Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian by Juergen Kremb and Andreas Lorenz of Der Spiegel, a
leading German news weekly.</P>
      <P>The text was provided by the U.S. Foreign Broadcast Information
Service, which collects and translates articles on political,
economic, technological and military topics published daily by news
media around the world for the reference of U.S. government officials
and contract workers.
[FBIS Translated Text]</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Mr. President, are you Chinese or Taiwanese?</P>
      <P>[Chen] I was born Taiwanese and a citizen of the Republic of
China. At the same time, I am proud of my identity as a(n) (ethnic)
Chinese. The people on both sides of the Straits of Taiwan are
distinguished by a common culture, a common language, and a common
history. We are an important part of the Chinese community.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Even though there have been milder tones recently,
Beijing still threatens to bring about reunification by force if you
declare the island's independence. How great is the danger of war?</P>
      <P>[Chen] I do not see any immediate danger. As long as the PRC does
not take violent action against Taiwan, I will not declare
independence. Nor will I change the name of our state from the
Republic of China to the Republic of Taiwan. I will not schedule a
referendum, which would change the current status, and I will not
propagate the two-states theory. However, the will of 23 million
Taiwanese on shaping their future must be respected on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] The leadership in Beijing is putting pressure of
time on you: if Taiwan were to delay negotiations on reunification
for too long, this would also be a reason for attack, they say. Do
you still have any leeway at all?</P>
      <P>[Chen] We know that we have to master a lot of difficulties.
However, Taiwan's strength lies in its strategic location in the
Pacific area. The constant threat of force by the Chinese leadership
cannot rattle us. The latest elections proved this. Threatening
gestures just take the mainland and Taiwan farther apart.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Would the People's Liberation Army actually be able
to conquer Taiwan?</P>
      <P>[Chen] Currently, the greatest threat is posed by the more than
400 short-, intermediate-, and long-range missiles that have been
stationed on the mainland. With its air force and its shore units,
the PRC can, however, not engage in a successful invasion.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] But Beijing is aggressively rearming.</P>
      <P>[Chen] We can still defend ourselves. If the Communists were to
try to occupy Taiwan, we would launch counterattacks. We would
mobilize the entire population. Studies by the U.S. Pentagon assume,
however, that the strategic balance in the Straits of Taiwan might
change after 2005.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Do you expect help from other countries?</P>
      <P>[Chen] Taiwan's security is inseparably linked with the stability
of the entire region. It is in the interests of all Pacific states,
in particular, however, of Japan and the United States, to guarantee
our security.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Washington seems to be rather unwilling at the
moment to equip your military with new warships and antimissile
systems.</P>
      <P>[Chen] Victory or defeat in a conflict depends on the will to
fight, on the kind of war, the quality of weapons and soldiers, and,
above all, on the solidarity of the people. With regard to the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, the United States committed itself to equipping
us with the necessary weapons. (more)</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 16 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] This law can be interpreted differently.</P>
      <P>[Chen] The point is not whether we get this weapons system or
that one; the point is Washington's security guarantee in the Asian
area. The fact that the Americans stand by this was proved most
recently in 1996, when the Communist leaders held maneuvers and the
United States sent aircraft carriers to the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Do you really believe that the United States would
risk a war with Beijing to guarantee Taiwan's future. China is an
emerging economic power, with whom nobody likes to butt heads.</P>
      <P>[Chen] It is not just Taiwan that is involved in this matter, but
also the strategic interests of the United States. China's missiles
are also aimed at the United States.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] So far, Beijing has not reacted to your offer to
meet President Jiang Zemin. The government there insists that you
recognize the "One-China Principle," according to which Taiwan is
only a Chinese province. You reject this. Where do you see
possibilities for a compromise?</P>
      <P>[Chen] So far, we have demonstrated great flexibility. We hope
that the Chinese authorities will give up their preconditions and
initiate a new era of relations together with us. I am willing to
work out with the other side a definition of the expression "One
China." However, all talks must preserve the principles of equality
and democracy.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Your predecessor Li Teng-hui characterized the
relationship with the mainland as a "special state-to-state
relationship," thus outraging the Communist Chinese. Do you stick to
that?</P>
      <P>[Chen] I am Chen Shui-bian and not Li Teng-hui. We use new tones.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Parts of your Democratic Progress Party continue to
strive for Taiwan's independence. How do you want to satisfy them?</P>
      <P>[Chen] The Constitution obligates me to preserve our national
security, sovereignty, and dignity. I stress that national interests
go before party interests. I did not become president to give Taiwan
for free to mainland China. The 23 million people of Taiwan would not
permit this, either.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Recently, you spoke of "two, three, and even
innumerable possibilities" for future relations with the mainland.
What were you thinking of specifically?</P>
      <P>[Chen] At the moment no side is subordinate to the other. We have
formed a working group that will soon submit specific proposals on
the issue of reunification.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] So far, your government has even banned direct
trade, transport, and postal links with the mainland. All goods must
be shipped via Hong Kong, Macao, or other countries. When will this
change?</P>
      <P>[Chen] We are willing to discuss this with Beijing. We want to
normalize economic relations with the mainland on the basis of
reciprocity and respect of market principles. We will soon establish
direct trade relations between the mainland and the Taiwanese islands
of Quemoy and Matsu. However, our security must be ensured. At the
moment, the problem is not us but the Chinese leadership, who do not
want to talk with us.

    <TEXT>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] Taiwan will soon join the WTO -- but this
presupposes free trade among the members. This means, you have to
take action.</P>
      <P>[Chen] We hope that, after joining the WTO, the leadership in
Beijing will become more open to the world, more liberal, and that
democratization will make progress. This will promote the expansion
of direct trade relations. However, WTO membership does not
automatically mean for us that we must permit direct contacts.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] You have struggled for a democratic Taiwan for a
long time and you have also made personal sacrifices. However, most
countries, including Germany, do not recognize your country. Does
this hurt you?</P>
      <P>[Chen] No. It is more important to check our own position than to
accuse other countries of being unfair. Perhaps, however, in the
future we will have to struggle with greater toughness for
recognition by the international community.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] How can you free yourself from the isolation?</P>
      <P>[Chen] We want to expand our international activities. Among
other things, we will work more for human rights at the international
level, participate more intensively in nongovernmental organizations,
and grant development and economic aid to Third World countries more
frequently.</P>
      <P>[Der Spiegel] In Parliament you do not have a majority, and the
business leaders do not seem to trust you. Since you assumed office
in May, stock exchange prices have plummeted by more than 30 %.</P>
      <P>[Chen] NASDAQ, the US technology index, has also gone down. I am
confident about Taiwan's future.</P>

Committee.</P>
      <P>The United States, Australia, Britain, and a handful of other

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REAFFIRMS STANCE ON PEACEFUL SOLUTION TO TAIWAN ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States, in an initial
response to a mainland Chinese "white paper" on defense, said Monday
it rejects the use of force or the threat of the use of force to
resolve the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>"As we have told the (mainland) Chinese at senior levels,
comments that focus on possible use of force (against Taiwan) are
counterproductive to the peaceful resolution of differences,"
said a U.S. State Department official, who asked not to be named.</P>
      <P>The mainland China's defense white paper, released Monday, offers
a gloomy assessment of ties with Taiwan and justifies a stronger
military by pointing in part to growing U.S. might.</P>
      <P>The Beijing document also repeated a threat to use "drastic
force" to prevent Taiwan breaking away, or if the island stalled
indefinitely on reunification talks.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department official, repeating longstanding U.S.
positions on Taiwan, said the United States would continue its "one
China" policy and urge both sides to refrain from actions or
statements that increase tension or complicate dialogue.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to adhere to our one-China policy. We urge the
PRC as well as Taiwan to refrain from actions or statements that
increase tensions or make dialogue more difficult to achieve. We urge
them to take steps that foster dialogue, reduce tensions and promote
mutual understanding," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He added: "We welcome greater transparency with respect to
China's military development, doctrine, spending and policies and
will be reviewing the document in detail to see how this new edition
of the white paper on defense contributes to that goal."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Department of Defense said its initial review
shows nothing that jumped out as a major concern.</P>
      <P>"We have started to review the white paper. Our initial review
does not show anything that's jumped out as a major concern," said a
Pentagon spokesman.</P>
      <P>The United States does not recognize Taiwan diplomatically, but
it does provide the island with the weapons it needs to defend itself
against mainland Chinese attempt at reunification by force.</P>
      <P>Ideally Washington would like to maintain the status quo and
avoid conflict until reform inside mainland China makes reunification
more attractive to the Taiwanese or until mainland China decides to
tolerate an independent Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Under the agreement, CNA will produce the Chinese version of the

      <P>CNA President Bill Wang and Pierre Lesourd, president of AFP

shortened the distance between people and between nations.</P>
      <P>She went on to say that the distinguishing characteristic of the
20th century has been that major powers have always worried others
for their demonstration of "hard national power" -- economic and
military might.</P>

rights, democracy, human kindness, peace, and high technology --
which constitutes the "soft national power" that Taiwan can share

    <HEADLINE>CONFIDENCE  CRISIS  IS CAUSE OF CURRENT FINANCIAL PROBLEMS: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most economic and financial experts
attending a seminar Tuesday agreed that Taiwan's current financial
and economic problems have been caused by a crisis of confidence.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Vice Chairman Vincent Siew presided over the seminar
on current financial and economic problems sponsored by the National
Policy Foundation, a KMT think tank.</P>
      <P>Participants also included former Vice Premiers Liu Chao-shiuan
and Hsu Li-teh, former Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang, and
former chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development
P. K. Chiang.</P>
      <P>Hwang Jenn-tai, convenor of the foundation's Technology and 
Economic Division and former chairman of the National Science
Council, said that the solution to current economic problems lies in
reviving public confidence.</P>
      <P>Hwang noted that though Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain
sound, the people of Taiwan have lost their confidence in the
nation's economic development. He added that this lack of confidence
has been reflected in the plunge in the Taiwan Stock Exchange's main
index, which has fallen over 30 percent since the inauguration of the
new administration.</P>
      <P>He said that the economy currently faces four problems --
government indecision on infrastructure construction, stalled
cross-strait relations, the continued worsening of the financial
environment, and rising unemployment.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the new administration's wavering attitude
toward the construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant and a
reservoir in southern Taiwan has led the public to harbor misgivings
about the future course of the nation.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that stalled cross-strait relations and the fourth
nuclear power plant are the biggest factors affecting public
confidence, adding that if the government could accept the principle
of national unification over the long term, both sides could start
talks and relations with mainland China would improve.</P>
      <P>On the plan to suspend the construction of the fourth nuclear
plant, he said that the new administration wants to scrap the plant
only because of the Democratic Progressive Party's anti-nuclear
platform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu urged the government to base its energy policy on

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PROUD OF IDENTITY AS ETHNIC CHINESE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Office officials said Tuesday
that President Chen Shui-bian is proud of his identity as an ethnic
Chinese, not a Chinese.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office made the clarification after foreign wire
service reports said Chen had said in an interview with the German
news weekly Der Spiegel that he is proud of his identity as a
Chinese.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said the reports were not correct. "What
the president has said is that he takes pride in his identity as an
ethnic Chinese (Huajen in Mandarin), not a Chinese (Chungkuojen)," a
Presidential Office official explained.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports that Chen had told Der Spiegel that the
President's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations will provide him
with clear suggestions concerning the Taiwan-mainland China
reunification issue in the near future, the official denied that Chen
had made any such remarks.</P>
      <P>"What President Chen said was he hopes the advisory group, headed
by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, can help forge a national
consensus on the development of cross-strait relations," the official
said.</P>
      <P>The official added that the group has not yet reached a consensus
on cross-strait issues, and that the conclusions presented by the
group will be important reference materials in formulating Taiwan's
future policy toward cross-strait relations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese make love 78 times a year on
average -- or once every 4.7 days -- but alarmingly, 14 percent do
not use contraceptives, according to the results of an international
survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The 2000 Durex Global Sex Survey, conducted on men and women
between the ages of 16 and 55 in 27 countries, revealed that
Taiwanese get their first taste of the forbidden fruit at an average
of 21.4 years of age. That makes them relatively late bloomers
compared to the global average of 18.1 and Hong Kong's 19, but puts
them ahead of mainland China's average of 21.9 years of age.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, respondents around the world make love
96 times per year on average, with U.S. citizens taking the lead at
132 times per year, or once every 2.8 days. Japanese lag behind other
Asians, having sex just 37 times a year, once every 9.9 days. The
reportedly romantic French came in third, at 121 times a year.</P>
      <P>But Taiwanese ranked lowest among surveyed Asian countries in
terms of contraceptive use, with 14 percent of Taiwan respondents not
using any form of contraceptive at all, compared to mainland China's
7 percent and Hong Kong's 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Some 52 percent of Taiwan respondents said that they have had
only one sexual partner in their lifetime. But the other 48 percent
are somewhat less faithful, as the average number of sexual partners
of all Taiwan respondents is 4.3, according to the results. This
figure is still less than the global average of 8.2.</P>
      <P>Exactly one third of young Taiwanese lovers said that they not
only thought their first experience between the sheets wasn't
anything to shout about, but were actually disappointed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Seoul,  Oct. 17 (CNA)
(By Y.C. Jiang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Korean chapter of Amnesty International
issued a statement Tuesday urging the Beijing authorities to
"actively improve" human rights protection for the 1.2 billion people
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Issued on the day upon the arrival in Seoul by Chinese Premier
Zhu Rongji for a formal visit, the statement by the Korean chapter of
the international human rights organization said that thousands of
Chinese people have been tortured or detained without fair trials for
participating in peaceful religious gatherings.</P>
      <P>In 1999 alone, thousands of people were sentenced to death by
mainland Chinese judiciary system, with some 1,800 being executed,
the Korean Amnesty group noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, dissident activists in Tibet and Xinjiang have also
been targets of Beijing's suppression, it added.</P>
      <P>Asserting that human rights is by no means an internal issue of
any single nation, the group stated that protection for democracy and
human rights in mainland China is an extension of peace and human
rights in Asia as well as the whole world.</P>
      <P>The group urged the Chinese authorities to immediately release
thousands of political prisoners jailed for peacefully supporting
Tibetan independence or seeking religious and political freedom.</P>
      <P>It also urged the Korean government to single out the fact of
mainland China's human rights abuses during the third Asia-Europe
Meeting slated for Oct. 20-21 in Seoul, and to see to it that an
entrance permit be granted to Chinese dissident leader Wang Dan.</P>
      <P>The Amnesty International Korean Chapter planned to invite Wang
Dan to come to Seoul for a human rights meeting between Oct. 12-15,
but the Korean authorities turned down the group's request and
refused to give Wang an entry permit.</P>
      <P>Undaunted, the group plans to make another request of the Korean

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLAR RECOGNIZES ROC PRESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jerome Cohen, a noted U.S. China hand,
said Monday he was impressed by Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian's views and efforts concerning improvement of relations
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Cohen made the remarks after Chen addressed about 100 members of
the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), a noted New York-based think
tank, via teleconference on the delicate and complicated cross-strait
issues.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that President Chen has delivered a speech
to the council on his views and stances on the development of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Cohen said he shares Chen's views that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should return to the "1992 spirit" to facilitate
resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"It is a good proposal. Back in 1992, both sides shelved their
disputes and sat down to talks. What Taiwan and mainland China lack
at the moment are dialogue and communication channels," Cohen
noted.</P>
      <P>After listening to Chen's speech, Cohen said, many CFR members
have come to believe that Chen has the capability to properly handle
thorny cross-strait issues and pursue permanent cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Cohen, who organized the teleconference with Chen, said Taiwan
and mainland China should increase contacts and cooperation. He
suggested that Taiwan further ease restrictions on visits to
mainland China by ROC officials. For instance, Cohen said, Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh, who concurrently serves as chairman of the ROC's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
should be allowed to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Cohen urged mainland China to cease any
hostile moves toward Taiwan. "The more the cross-strait exchanges,
the likelier Taiwan is attracted to unify with the mainland," he
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the vast mainland market is very important to
Taiwan, Cohen said if mainland China intends to unify Taiwan, it
should place more emphasis on practical issues. Cohen said he hopes
the next generation of mainland leaders will become even more
pragmatic in dealing with cross-strait affairs.</P>
      <P>As mainland China has recently softened its tone on
Taiwan-related affairs, Cohen said he is optimistic about the
prospects for cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Cohen further said that in short term, mainland China is not
expected to attack Taiwan at the risk of paralyzing its own economic
development.</P>
      <P>As for the possible impact of the outcome of the upcoming U.S.
presidential election, Cohen said if Republican candidate George W.
Bush wins the election, Taiwan may have greater access to more
U.S.-made defensive weapons. Except for this, Cohen said, the
electoral result is not expected to have significant impact on
other aspects of the U.S. policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For fears of offending mainland China, the U.S. State Department
bans visits by the ROC president and vice president. When he
visited Taiwan in May, Cohen suggested that Chen speak on his
policy toward mainland China through teleconference to help CFR
members better understand his cross-strait stance. Chen accepted his
proposal. Cohen visited Taipei again in mid-September to work out
details about the teleconference. In view of enthusiastic response
from CFR members, Cohen said he plans to organize another
teleconference for Chen next year.</P>
      <P>In his Monday speech, Chen renewed his call on mainland
China to resume cross-strait dialogue based on the "1992 spirit" in
order to break the current stalemate and create a "win-win"
situation for both sides.</P>
      <P>Chen also stressed that Taiwan's political democratization can
serve as beacon for mainland people. "I believe that so long as the
two sides shelve their disputes and resume dialogue and exchanges,
the much-anticipated opening of direct cross-strait trade, mail and
transportation links, commonly known as 'three links,' will be able
to become a reality soon," he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is always ready to open talks with the
mainland, Chen said the ball is in Beijing's court to break the
current cross-strait impasse. "Beijing should not impose any
precondition for resuming talks," he added.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's future, Chen said any solution to cross-strait
issues must respect the choice of the 23 million Taiwan people out of
their free will.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACER WILL STICK TO CORE BUSINESS WHILE SEEKING TRANSFORMATION (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite widespread suspicion about the
outlook for the global PC industry, Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih has
reaffirmed that his group will continue sticking to its core business
of computer manufacturing while seeking to expand into other fields.</P>
      <P>Although Acer Computer -- Acer Group's mother company and
Taiwan's largest computer firm -- has diversified into other fields
more quickly than other computer companies, Shih stressed that
overall transformation takes time and made it clear that Acer
Computer will not cease its computer production operations, despite
the fact that global demand for personal computers (PCs) is falling.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks in a recent interview with CNA, the full
text of which follows:</P>
      <P>Q: What do you think of the future of the local computer
industry? And how will Acer Computer tackle the painful phase of its
transformation?</P>
      <P>A: It is a fact that the global demand for PCs is declining and
it is also true that all electronics manufacturers will have to
undergo transformation as a result of the changing times. I know
perfectly well that outside hopes are high that Acer will hasten its
transformation, but that takes time.</P>
      <P>And I don't think that Acer is experiencing a painful transition,
because its transformation project already started two or three years
ago. The group's current eight affiliated companies, which are all
listed in the local stock market, are clear proof of the
transformation's fruitful result.</P>
      <P>The transformation which Acer Group is undergoing at the present
stage is aimed at Acer Computer -- which is determined to maintain
its core business of computer manufacture for foreign brands while
aggressively seeking to create a new lease of life for the concern.</P>
      <P>Judging from the performances of Acer Computer's eight affiliated
firms, I can assure you that Acer Computer has not had a painful
transition and that the transformation project has been carried out
as scheduled. All this should be viewed as Acer Computer's long-term
performance, and as its largest shareholder, I am not at all worried
about the firm's EPS (earnings per share) for the years to come.</P>
      <P>Q: However, institutional investors seem to hold a different view
of Acer Computer's share performances, which have posted continued
drops for a while. What is your opinion in this regard?</P>
      <P>A: It is I who will suffer the heaviest loss if Acer Computer's
share prices continue to fall, but transformation takes time and I
hope that time will eventually prove that our direction is correct.</P>
      <P>Q: In addition to the ongoing transformation strategy, what
measures will Acer Computer take to improve its core manufacturing
business and revenues?</P>
      <P>A: In contrast to what is widely assumed, producing computers for
Acer's own brands has been more profitable than manufacturing for
foreign companies. But Acer will not abandon its computer manufacture
business and will try to increase the percentage of such operations
out of consideration of reducing business risk based on a global
management revenue model.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the future, Acer Computer will maintain the proportion of its
manufacturing business and operations of own brand names at a rate
between 70 percent and 30 percent, or 50 percent and 50 percent. The
ideal percentage is 65 percent and 35 percent. Acer Computer will not
allow the manufacturing unit to exceed 70 percent of its overall
business, while the unit of own brand names will not surpass 50
percent of the total.</P>
      <P>In essence, Acer will shift the strategy to focus production on
its competitive lines while slowing down its pace in less competitive
products.</P>
      <P>Q: In light of the arrival of the "knowledge-based new economic
era," will Acer Group's "Flying Dragon Project," which aims to chalk
up a profit of NT$10 billion for the group by 2005, be the key
element of the group's next stage of transformation?</P>
      <P>A: The "Flying Dragon Project" is only a segment of the entire
group's transformation campaign. In addition to forming a software
sub-group, Acer Group will also set up a telecommunications sub-group
to pave the way for it to edge into the vast overseas markets.</P>
      <P>I originally thought that we would have to wait until 2010 for
the "Flying Dragon Project" to reach the profit target of NT$10
billion, but internal assessments show that the goal can be achieved
in 2005.</P>
      <P>Although suspicion is running high about investing in Taiwan's
software and Internet sectors after dot-com companies have shut down
one after another in the United States over the past year, I do
believe that someone has to embrace the task.</P>
      <P>The scale of the "Flying Dragon Project" is relatively small
compared to that of Acer Group's other investment projects, but Acer
Computer is planning to cooperate in the project by pouring in the
group's resources.</P>
      <P>Q: What are Acer Group's competitive edges?</P>
      <P>A: An excellent talent pool, a comprehensive distribution network
and sound financial system are Acer Group's most competitive edges.
Management of the group is therefore more difficult due to its large
and complex structure.</P>
      <P>To achieve the group's transformation goal, the vital issue is to
implement a persistent internal restructuring in order to tackle
dramatic changes from the outside world by exercising its
competitiveness to the fullest extent.</P>
      <P>Acer Group has also made several breakthroughs during its
transformation process. For instance, it has sold out Acer
Semiconductor Manufacturing Inc. to Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. and has changed the name of Acer Peripherals Corp.
to Acer Communications and Multimedia Inc., marking a noticeable
departure from traditional Chinese business philosophy, which views
splits as unusual.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DALAI LAMA TO VISIT ROC NEXT MONTH FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader, confirmed here Tuesday that he will visit the
Republic of China on Taiwan in November for purely religious
purposes.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the Dalai Lama personally confirmed
his upcoming Taiwan travel plan. Previous press reports said the
Dalai Lama is scheduled to visit Taiwan again in late November. The
Tibetan spiritual leader made his first trip to Taiwan in 1997.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama, winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, arrived in
Prague Monday to attend the fourth Forum 2000 conference, which
opened Sunday.</P>
      <P>He chaired Tuesday's session on the religious role in this era of
globalization. Former ROC President Lee Teng-hui delivered a
10-minute speech on religious themes at the session.</P>
      <P>During a coffee break, the Dalai Lama said he looks forward to
visiting Taiwan in November, but he stressed that his visit is
mainly aimed at understanding the development of Tibetan Buddhism in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama said his Taiwan visit does not carry any
political purposes. He admitted that there really exists pressure
from mainland China against his Taiwan travel plan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will meet with incumbent ROC President Chen
Shui-bian during his Taipei visit, the Dalai Lama said he will meet
with anyone whom he wants to meet during his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Dalai Lama recalled that during his 1997 Taiwan visit, he had
extensive talks with then-ROC President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Before the morning session began, Lee and the Dalai Lama
exchanged greetings in an amicable atmosphere. Lee said he
welcomes the Dalai Lama's upcoming Taiwan visit.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the Dalai Lama is his good spiritual friend. "We
are not political friends," Lee added smilingly.</P>
      <P>Lee's remarks were seen as a gesture to soften the sensitivity of
his meeting with the Dalai Lama as mainland China has recalcitrantly
opposed contacts between Taiwan and Tibet for fears of their possible
collaboration to promote independence.</P>
      <P>Lee and the Dalai Lama reportedly held closed-door talks Tuesday
noon, but neither of them would confirm the report.</P>
      <P>During Monday's session, which focused on the roles of education
and science in globalization, Lee touted the successful Taiwan
experience in economic development.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee said, the wealth gap between rich and poor
countries resulting from globalization cannot be settled easily.
Nevertheless, he said, the "Taiwan experience" is worth of
reference and emulation by developing countries.</P>
      <P>Lee, an agricultural economist-turned-politician, said Taiwan is
more than willing to share its developmental experience with other
countries.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan and an active promoter of Taiwan's distinctive identity,
infuriated Beijing last year when he said Taiwan-mainland China
relations should be on a "special state-to-state basis."</P>
      <P>This was Lee's second overseas trip since he ended his
12-year stint as the ROC president on May 20. Beijing lodged
protests with London when Lee visited Britain in June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIPEI TAXI FARES EXPECTED TO BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government formally
approved Tuesday a hike in taxi fares, allowing taxi drivers in
Taiwan's largest city to charge an average increase of 12.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Under the new taxi fare plan, which is expected to take effect at
the end of November, the flagfall will be formally increased to
NT$70, with the flagfall travel distance shortened from the current
1.65 km to 1.5 km.</P>
      <P>The plan, devised by the City Government Committee Supervising
Rates of Public Utilities and Transportation, will also see the
distance traveled for each additional NT$5 shortened to 300 meters
from the current 350 meters, according to a Taipei City Hall
spokesman.</P>
      <P>Charges for nighttime taxis and daytime waiting will also be
increased to NT$5 for each two minutes from the current NT$5 for each
three minutes, according to the new plan.</P>
      <P>On average, each taxi ride will be NT$15 more expensive than
before.</P>
      <P>Taipei County and the adjacent Keelung City will also follow suit
and implement the same plan.</P>
      <P>It will take about six months for cabbies in Taipei City, Taipei
County and Keeling City, totaling about 70,000, to have new meters
inspected and installed, said Taipei City government officials.</P>
      <P>Until all the new meters have been installed, a contingent price
list authorized by the local governments will be used, the officials
noted.</P>
      <P>According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications last month, Taiwan taxi drivers made a gross
average of NT$42,000 (US$1,350) per month in 1999, for a net income
of around NT$28,000 after expenses.</P>
      <P>The net income was a decline of 12.3 percent compared with the
results of a similar survey conducted in 1997.</P>

    <DATELINE>Prague,  Oct.  17   (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui said here Tuesday that Taiwan is one of the 30-plus
countries which have managed to successfully transformed from
authoritarian rule to a democracy over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a speech delivered in English at a
session of the fourth Forum 2000 conference, which opened in Prague
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Over the past quarter of century, Lee said, more than 30
countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America have evolved from
authoritarian rule to democracies. "We are pleased to see Taiwan
join the ranks," he added.</P>
      <P>The agricultural economist-turned-politician said regular
elections, freedom of speech, robust opposition parties and peaceful
transition of power between different political parties are common
norms of democratic countries. These features have also become
mainstream values in today's world, Lee explained.</P>
      <P>Noting that globalization is an irresistible trend, Lee said the
influence of the Global Village on each country will grow
increasingly in tandem with progress in information technology, free
trade as well as international exchanges and interdependence.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Lee said he is convinced that religion
and culture will be problems that human beings have to face everyday.
Lee, a devout Christian, said all people should face different
religions and cultures with tolerance and broad-mindedness so that
special features of various cultures and religions can continue to
grow and complement each other.</P>
      <P>Lee further said the greatest appeal of religion is to arouse
goodness in human nature. In this rapidly changing information
society, Lee said, all people should work together to let this
common appeal become an effective disciplinary force and lead the
world toward an even more harmonious and beautiful horizon.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes religious freedom can expand to every corner
of the world as early as possible. He also wished every resident of
the Global Village can enjoy peace of mind and world peace.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's session, which focuses on the impact of globalization
on religions, was chaired by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader, who is scheduled to make his second visit to Taiwan
in November.</P>
      <P>Lee and the Dalai Lama are among the 50-plus retired heads of
state, religious leaders, influential politicians, writers and
artists from around the world invited to attend the Oct. 15-18 forum.</P>
      <P>Forum 2000 is a think tank jointly founded by Czech
President Vaclav Havel and a Japanese foundation in 1997 to explore
the values of culture and civilization to human development. The 2000
conference focuses on the values of education, culture and religion
in what was described as the "year of globalization."</P>
      <P>Lee also delivered a speech at Monday's session, which focused
discussion on the roles of education and science in globalization.
Lee touted the successful Taiwan experience in economic development
during the session.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee said, the wealth gap between rich and poor
countries resulting from globalization cannot be settled easily.
Nevertheless, he said, the "Taiwan experience" is worth of
reference and emulation by developing countries.</P>
      <P>Lee further said Taiwan is more than willing to share its
developmental experience with other countries.</P>
      <P>Also attending the four-day meeting are former South African
President F.W. de Klerk, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
former Polish Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.</P>
      <P>Lee will tour noted Czech cultural sites and tourist attractions
after the forum ends. He and his entourage are scheduled to return to
Taipei Oct. 22. Members of his entourage include former National
Security Council Secretary-General Ding Mou-shih and several of his
close aides.</P>
      <P>Mainland China last month condemned Lee's trip to Prague, saying
he should not be given a forum for activities aimed at separating
Taiwan from the mainland.</P>
      <P>A mainland Foreign Ministry spokesman accused Lee of having
always engaged in activities aimed at Taiwan independence during his
12-year stint as ROC president.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic recognizes mainland China, but maintains
friendly substantive ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing lodged protests with London when Lee made his first
overseas visit to Britain in June following his retirement on May 20.</P>
      <P>The 78-year-old former ROC president is an outspoken critic of
mainland China's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan and infuriated
Beijing last year by declaring that Beijing-Taipei relations should
be on "a special state-to-state" basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ABAC TO FILE SUGGESTIONS TO APEC'S SUMMIT MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An advisory committee of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will file suggestions at the APEC
summit meeting scheduled to be held in Brunei on Nov. 15, according
to a Tuesday press release from the committee.</P>
      <P>The APEC Advisory Committee (ABAC) consists of 63 business
representatives of APEC member economies, with three representatives
from each economy.</P>
      <P>The three Republic of China representatives are Jeffrey Koo,
board chairman of Chinatrust Commercial Bank; Chang An-ping, general
manager of Chia Hsin Cement Corp.; and Kao Chih-shang, vice board
chairman of I-Mei Foods Co., Ltd.</P>
      <P>The subject of this year's ABAC suggestions to the APEC summit
will be "facing globalization in APEC way," according to the press
release from the ROC committee members. ABAC representatives will
file their suggestions on aspects such as finance, the streamlining
of commerce, sci-tech, and action guidelines.</P>
      <P>Kao said ABAC is pushing for the implementation of the "APEC
Business Travel Card (ABTC)" program, adding that the ROC will join
the program in November, becoming the 11th member of the program.
This, he said, is part of the streamlining of commerce.</P>
      <P>Kao said that member economies who join the ABTC program must set
up a special "APEC Line" at airport immigration halls, allowing
businessmen who hold an ABTC to enjoy visa-free travel and speedy
customs processing while entering and departing member economies.</P>
      <P>The ABTC program was initiated by Australia and six member
economies have joined the program -- the Philippines, South Korea,
Hong Kong, Chile, New Zealand and Australia.</P>
      <P>Thailand, Peru and Brunei are also expected to join the program
this year. So far, 3,000 people are ABTC holders.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said in Kaohsiung Tuesday that he is pleased to
have been invited to meet President Chen Shui-bian later this week.</P>
      <P>Soong told the press that he would like to meet with Chen to
discuss cross-Taiwan Strait ties, finance and economics. However, he
added that he would not respond to Chen until the following day,
after he had held a consultation with PFP cadres.</P>
      <P>He also expressed regret that Chen's intention to hold a
roundtable meeting between the leaders of Taiwan's political parties
has never been realized because of the drastic changes in the
domestic political situation.</P>
      <P>He said he would like to make some recommendations to Chen if
they would benefit the whole people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong also expressed his hope that the current minority
government will offer its services to all the people of Taiwan rather
than serving only minority people and ideological groups. He said the
behavior of the Chen administration has made the majority of the
people in Taiwan aware of the instability of the nation's future and
will eventually bring the danger of war to the people of the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
denied Tuesday a newspaper report which claimed that he was
considering quitting as head of the president's advisory group on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>The China Times Express had reported that Lee was displeased with
President Chen Shui-bian because Chen did not respect him.</P>
      <P>Lee was reported to have complained privately that "although
former President Lee Teng-hui was detestable, he respected me for two
years, while Chen respected me for less than two days."</P>
      <P>The paper noted that despite Lee's opposition, Chen insisted on
establishing a consultative group under the Presidential Office,
prompting Lee to consider resigning as head of the president's
advisory group.</P>
      <P>"I have never considered quitting as convenor of the president's
advisory group on cross-strait relations," Lee said, adding that he
will do his utmost to promote peace and constructive development
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that he has been maintaining good interaction with
the president, and will continue to provide various suggestions to
him.</P>
      <P>He also said that he had never criticized either former President

      <P>He expressed his deep regret over the failure of the paper to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO DEMAND LABELING OF GMO PRODUCTS NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) will
implement a system requiring all products made from or containing
genetically modified organisms (GMO) to be labeled starting from next
year, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shu-kong, director of the DOH's Bureau of Food Sanitation,
said the agency will adopt a combined system of compulsory and
voluntary labeling, and will first require the compulsory labeling on
soybean and corn products.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that products not included on the compulsory GMO
labeling list will be subject to voluntary labeling.</P>
      <P>He said the DOH is studying measures to examine products made
from GMO material and will then decide how much of such material will
be permitted in a product before it has to be labeled.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the European Union requires that products
containing more than 1 percent of GMO must be labeled, while in
Japan, the percentage is 5 percent.</P>
      <P>A survey commissioned recently by the DOH shows that 74 percent
of the 1,083 respondents hope the government will adopt compulsory
labeling on GMO foods.</P>
      <P>While about 70 percent of the interviewees said they had heard of
GMO foods, only 11 percent of them said they would never buy such
products.</P>
      <P>Of the respondents, 21 percent said they believe genetically
modified food is not good for the health, while 40 percent said they
think that gene modification technology violates the laws of nature.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, 73 percent of the respondents said they would
accept genetically modified foods.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Tuesday that the Executive Yuan will decide by December whether
to stop construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while answering questions raised by two

      <P>Chang added that the issue has been handed to the secretariat of
the Executive Yuan for further study.</P>
      <P>Former Premier Tang Fei resigned from the premiership early this
month because he supported continued construction of the power plant,
a stance that conflicts with the stance of President Chen Shui-bian
and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The Economics Ministry has submitted a proposal to suspend the
nuclear power project, but the opposition Kuomintang and some
industrial sectors advocate continuing the project so as to ensure

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A trade seminar to be attended by business
leaders from Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China will open Wednesday
in Beijing to tackle issues arising from the imminent entry of the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-ya, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), and Tsai Hui-yen, deputy
director-general of the Intellectual Property Office of the MOEA,
arrived in Beijing Tuesday along with a 27-member Taiwan delegation
headed by Hsu Sheng-fa, chairman of the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (TCCI). Wu will deliver a keynote speech at the annual
two-day seminar which is held alternately in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Last year's meeting, which should have taken place in Taipei, was
canceled because of Beijing's irritation over former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui's redefinition of cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Hsu expressed hope that the seminar will discover good
competition across the Taiwan Strait on a complementary basis so as
to create a win-win-win situation for Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland
China in the face of imminent WTO entry.</P>
      <P>Jing Suping, chairman of Beijing's All-China Federation of
Idustry and Commerce hosted a dinner party in honor of the Taiwan
delegation Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, the main topics at the agenda will center on
how to tackle issues that might arise from WTO entry for Taiwan and
mainland China and how to develop competition and cooperation among
Taiwan, Hong Kong and the mainland so as to seek benefits for all
three.</P>
      <P>Hsu also expressed the hope that the Beijing authorities will
offer financial services to Taiwan investors in the mainland. Issues
related to monetary services, law, Taiwan investors' interests and
Beijing's development project in its western regions will also be
included in the discussions, he said.</P>

its 100-year history, is scheduled to come to Taipei, where he has
visited twice before, sometime in January, said Lung Ying-tai,
director of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the bureau, the 60-year-old writer-painter
who has lived in self-exile in France over the past 12 years, will
stay in Taipei for more than one month in his capacity as an artist
in residence -- a program aimed at helping promote local cultural
development, Lung noted.</P>
      <P>Lung praised Gao as a true intellectual and artist who has kept
his promise to visit Taiwan despite the difficult circumstances. Kao,
an old personal acquaintance of Lung, was previously scheduled to
visit Taipei as an artist in residence for three months beginning at
the end of October.</P>
      <P>In his long-distance telephone conversation with Lung Tuesday,
Gao said he will have to postpone his visit until January and may not
be able to stay for three months at one time because "it seems many
things have come up" since he was awarded the Nobel prize. "Please
let me pay this debt in several installments," he told Lung.</P>
      <P>Gao, who was once forced to burn his writings to save himself
from radical Chinese Communists and was driven abroad by Chinese
censors, was cited by the Swedish Academy for his "bitter insights
and linguistic ingenuity."</P>
      <P>"In the writing of Gao Xingjian literature is born anew from the
struggle of the individual to survive the history of the masses," the
academy said in its citation. "He is a perspicacious skeptic who
makes no claim to be able to explain the world. He asserts that he
has found freedom only in writing."</P>
      <P>Gao, born in the central Chinese province of Jiangxi in 1940,
fled his homeland in 1987 after one of his plays was banned and he
was put under police surveillance. After the 1989 bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, he wrote
"Fugitives," set against the background of the massacre. As a result,
Beijing declared him "persona non grata" and banned his works.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a CNA correspondent in Paris on Oct. 13, Gao
said he appreciates Taiwan's publishers for their support of artistic
freedom, going on to thank his readers on the island for supporting
his literary works and paintings over the past decade.</P>
      <P>He said he has been moved by the hospitality and friendship shown
by Taiwan publishers, writers, and readers each time he has visited
the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGES RETURN TO `ONE CHINA, SEPARATE INTERPRETATIONS' BASIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
on Wednesday dismissed President Chen Shui-bian's statement calling
for a return to "the spirit of 1992" across the Taiwan Strait as
"slogan politics" that ignores the welfare of the public.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan said the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party should cast away its ideology and return to the 1992 agreement
on "one China, separate interpretations" between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait as the basis for a resumption in cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks after listening to a report by Kao
Koong-lian, who was vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council in 1992, on cross-strait relations at a KMT Central
Standing Committee meeting Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kao, who had taken part in cross-strait dialogue policy in 1992,
stressed that both sides of the Taiwan Strait did reach an agreement
on "one China, separate interpretations" in 1992 and that the
"spirit of 1992" was a term coined by President Chen, adding that the
president had used his "imagination and creativity" to fictionalize
the term "spirit" as meaning "dialogue, exchanges, and the shelving
of disputes."</P>
      <P>In fact, Kao said cross-strait dialogue began earlier in 1990
when both sides reached the Kinmen agreement on the repatriation of
illegal immigrants. Also, cross-strait exchanges began in 1987 and
the shelving of disputes between the two sides started earlier than
1992, he added.</P>
      <P>Kao said that President Chen was trying to avoid the fact that a
concrete agreement was reached in 1992 by using the vague term
"spirit of the 1992."</P>
      <P>Chairman Lien stressed that "one China, separate interpretations"
should be the basis of cross-strait talks, adding that for years the
KMT has pursued a pragmatic policy, which on one hand had increased
cross-strait exchanges to maintain stability in the Taiwan Strait,
and on the other hand had built a national consensus to help positive
cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien said that in May he had advocated exchanges between
political parties across the Taiwan Strait, which he said was for the
purpose of upholding the national sovereignty of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Lien urged the ruling government to put aside its ideology and
adopt a pragmatic approach like the previous government's in seeking
to ease the cross-strait atmosphere in order to achieve a

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU MAYOR LEAVES FOR MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mayor Tsai Jen-chien of Hsinchu City in
northern Taiwan left for Nanjing Wednesday, making him the first
local government chief to be allowed to visit mainland China since
the inauguration of the new Republic of China government in May.</P>
      <P>Tsai will attend a conference of chief administrators of
major science-technology cities around the world. Hsinchu, which
hosts Taiwan's first science-based industrial park, is home to
thousands of high-technology companies.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Tsai said he has received more than 20
groups of visitors from mainland China during his two-year mayoral
stint and that the visitors included 10-plus mayors and county
chiefs.</P>
      <P>In the past, Tsai said, only mainland local government chiefs
were allowed to visit Taiwan, a one-way exchange. "I'm hopeful
that my mainland visit will mark the start of two-way exchange of
visits by local-level government chiefs," he added.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a stalwart of the ROC's new ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, said he also hopes his mainland visit will contribute to
the development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai was invited by Nanjing Mayor Wang Hungmin to attend the
second world technology cities meeting, and the ROC government
formally approved his visit. "Therefore, I'm not a cross-strait
emissary," Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, the ROC government turned down separate
applications by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, one of the brightest
stars of the main opposition Kuomintang, and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank
Hsieh, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman, to visit the mainland
for complex considerations.</P>
      <P>In addition to attending the Nanjing meeting, Tsai will also
visit Shanghai and Xiamen, which lies very close to the ROC's
frontline island of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Tsai said cross-strait exchanges should be handled in a
pragmatic manner, adding that there should be ample room for
cross-strait cooperation in cultural and technological fields.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he will look into administrative, production and
operational mechanisms of major mainland high-tech parks
during his Oct. 18-22 visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAY RIGHTS ACTIVIST REQUESTS CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Gay rights activist Chi Chia-wei on
Wednesday again made known his appeal requesting that the ROC Council
of Grand Justice interpret why people of the same sex cannot legally
marry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chi, who has also been devoted to AIDS prevention in Taiwan over
the past 17 years, said his request for a public notarization of his
marriage to his lifetime partner, a Mr. Lin, was turned down by the
Taipei District Court in May.</P>
      <P>Chi then filed a complaint with the Taiwan High Court against the
Taipei District Court for refusing to authorize his marriage to Lin
at the court's Notarization Office.</P>
      <P>His complaint, however, was also rejected, prompting him to file
a request to the Council of Grand Justice on Sept. 21 for an
constitutional interpretation of the legal basis for the Taipei
District Court and the Taiwan High Court's decision to reject his
marriage notarization request.</P>
      <P>Chi said the ROC Civil Codes do not contain a single line saying
that people of the same sex are prohibited from marrying.</P>
      <P>Noting that what he is fighting is an ideological battle, Chi
asked why a modern society like Taiwan's, where gays and lesbians are
increasingly accepted, cannot accept the notion of marriage between
people of the same sex.</P>
      <P>Chi said the Taipei District Court rejected his marriage
notarization request on the basis that allowing a marriage between
two men would "impair social morals and tarnish traditional ethics."</P>
      <P>Homosexuality is one of the normal traits of human beings and
gays and lesbians are as normal as heterosexual people, Chi stressed.
Since they are normal and supposed to be accepted by all societies,
why are they deprived of the right to marry that is enjoyed by
heterosexuals, he asked.</P>
      <P>He said more than 20 nations around the world now officially
recognize marriage between people of same sex, adding that even in
ideologically-restricted mainland China, two men were allowed to
marry in 1990, and two women did the same in 1992.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF STRAY DOGS IN TAIPEI DECLINES NOTICEABLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of stray dogs in Taipei,
Taiwan's largest city, has declined noticeably over the past year,
down a whopping 30,000 animals over a period of a year, municipal
government sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of July, there were about 18,000 stray dogs in Taipei, down by
a remarkable 37,000 from the approximately 55,000 recorded in the
same month a year ago, officials from the Bureau of Environmental
Protection (BEP) quoted a recent survey as indicating.</P>
      <P>According to the survey conducted by Prof. Fei Chang-yung and his
team at National Taiwan University's Veterinary Medicine Department,
there was a total of about 229,000 canines in Taipei as of the end of
July, 211,000 of which were dogs kept as pets, about 1,000 higher
than the number tallied a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The number of stray dogs, however, declined noticeably over the
past year, apparently as a result of a series of measures taken by
the city government to tackle the issue that have caused concern
among international animal protection groups due to the brutality of
some of the measures.</P>
      <P>BEP officials attributed the decline in the number of strays
mainly to the more severe penalties meted out to owners who are found
to have abandoned their dogs, and also to the city government's
policy of killing abandoned, old and sickly dogs.</P>
      <P>They noted that over the past year, the BEP has made what they
described as particularly "humanitarian" efforts to catch, take in
and handle stray dogs in the hope that even unwanted animals can be
treated properly.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the officials said, a higher rate of stray dog
adoptions by institutions and individuals has also contributed to a
decline in the number of strays wandering the streets.</P>
      <P>According to Fei's survey, the number of adoptions has increased
2.7 times over the past year, a number that is equivalent to one in
every 141.6 Taipei citizens adopting a dog.</P>
      <P>The survey also asked Taipei residents' opinion of the city
government's "dog policy" over the past year, and found that 59
percent of the respondents approved of the measures taken by the
government.</P>
      <P>Non-dog owning residents were also asked why they do not have a
dog -- the number one pet in Taipei according to a 1997 survey. Among
the reasons stated by the survey respondents were a lack of space,
fear of contagious diseases, and too much trouble, in that order.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO REVISE LAW TO FACILITATE EXCHANGES WITH MONGOLIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government will
revise current regulations to facilitate exchanges with Mongolia, a
senior ROC official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Cheng-kuang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mongolian and
Tibetan Affairs Commission, made the statement during a Legislative
Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that more than 130 countries around the world, including
mainland China, have recognized Mongolia as an independent sovereign
state, Hsu said the independence of Mongolia has apparently become a
historical fact.</P>
      <P>The ROC recognized Mongolia's independence in 1946, but annulled
the recognition after moving its seat to Taiwan in 1949. Current ROC
regulations still regard Mongolia as part of the communist-controlled
Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the ROC has forged closer substantive relations with
Mongolia since Mongolia cut ties with the now-defunct Soviet bloc and
began sweeping political and economic reforms.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, controversy surrounding the ROC's stance on
Mongolia's status has hindered further development of Taiwan-Mongolia
relations.</P>
      <P>"Legally, we regard Mongolia as part of the Chinese mainland,"
Hsu explained, adding that the policy has made it difficult for the
two sides to exchange representative offices to facilitate bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The ROC government currently does not grant formal visas to
Mongolian visitors. Instead, the ROC issues Mongolians with travel
permits similar to those issued to mainland Chinese people in
accordance with the Statute Governing Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>Hsu suggested that the Executive Yuan, or Cabinet, hold an
inter-ministerial meeting to seek a solution to the thorny Mongolian
status issue on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>With a view to removing barriers to bilateral exchanges, Hsu
said, relevant government agencies should revise the existing statute
governing relations across the Taiwan Strait to exclude Mongolia from
the coverage of the statute.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Hsu said, commercial, technological and cultural
exchanges between Taiwan and Mongolia will be able to make
significant headway. "Moreover, it will also become easier for the
two sides to exchange representative offices," he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Hsu's proposal, an official with the Mainland
Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
said the proposed exclusion of Mongolia from the coverage of the
statute governing cross-strait relations will need further discussion
because it "may cause problems" related to the ROC Constitution and
even international law. However, the official, who preferred
anonymity, declined to identify what these "problems" might be.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. PAGODA SYMBOLIZING ROC-U.S. FRIENDSHIP RENOVATED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  17  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renovated marine observation tower
symbolizing the friendship between the Republic of China and the
United States was formally inaugurated Sunday in Virginia, while a
new adjacent oriental garden opened to the public for the first time.</P>
      <P>Overlooking the Hampton Roads Harbor in Norfolk, Virginia, the
waterfront pagoda was built in 1989 to commemorate a 1983 visit by
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui -- who at that time was Taiwan
provincial governor. It is supposed to symbolize "the spirit of
friendship and cooperation between Taiwan and the Commonwealth of
Virginia" as well as between their respective port cities.</P>
      <P>Norfolk Mayor Paul D. Fraim and Raymond K. Wu, president of the
Friends of the Pagoda &amp; Oriental Garden Foundation, jointly presided
over the inauguration ceremony, which was attended by approximately
250 guests including Chen Chien-jen, the ROC Representative to the
United States, and Owen B. Pickett, a Virginia U.S. House
representative.</P>
      <P>Virginia Governor James S. Gilmore III sent his congratulations
in a written message that was read at the ceremony.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out in his address that he was pleased to see the
renovations completed on the pagoda and the new garden completed with
the cooperation between the Norfolk City government and the local
public, including overseas Chinese living in the area.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that these various developments symbolize the
"growing friendship and relations" between the people of the two
countries.</P>
      <P>In the 17 years since Lee's visit, the ROC has improved by leaps
and bounds both economically and politically, Chen said, adding that
Taiwan is now the world's 17th-largest economy, the 14th-largest
trading nation, and the seventh-largest export market for the United
States.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is now a completely democratic country, he said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-American community in Norfolk established a
foundation to assist the city to refurbish the pagoda and complete
the adjacent garden, which includes a goldfish pond, three oriental
gates, a waterfall, and various oriental trees and greenery.</P>
      <P>Stephen S.F. Chen, the former ROC Representative to the United
States, donated US$50,000 to the foundation in 1998 on behalf of the
ROC government.</P>
      <P>According to the foundation, the pagoda will function as the
focal point of the oriental garden, which will be "a tranquil place
of beauty and harmony exhibiting symbolic Chinese artifacts and
historical markers which will be an educational experience and bridge
for better understanding of eastern culture."</P>
      <P>Prefabricated pieces of the pagoda were constructed in Taiwan and
shipped to the United States for assembly. The pagoda is included on
the Cannonball Trail, a new heritage trail being promoted by the
city.</P>

      <P>"The meeting will start at 8 p.m. Thursday at the Taipei
Guest House," Yu said, adding that both he and PFP's Chung will also
be present at the closed-door meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the press will be briefed on the results of the
meeting. But it remains unclear whether the two sides will hold a
joint news conference or they will brief the press separately.</P>
      <P>As for the agenda, Soong reportedly is willing to present
opinions on matters related to the common interests of all Taiwan
people, including relations across the Taiwan Strait as well as
financial and economic issues.</P>
      <P>For his part, Yu reaffirmed President Chen's open-minded
attitude toward the agenda. "Any topics helpful to national
interests and people's well-being can be raised and discussed," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>This will be the first meeting between Chen and Soong after
the March 18 presidential election, in which Soong lost to Chen with
a narrow margin.</P>
      <P>As Chen's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
controls only about one-third of the Legislative Yuan seats, Chen
has pitched for reconciliation and cooperation among major domestic
political parties since his inauguration in May.</P>
      <P>Due to complex reasons, a Chen-proposed roundtable meeting of
top leaders of major parties has long remained on the drawing board.
As a result, Chen said last week he will pay visits to PFP
Chairman Soong, main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
Hau Lung-pin, convener of the New Party National Campaign and
Development Commission, to signify his sincerity to promote
inter-party cooperation.</P>
      <P>In preparation for Chen's meetings with the three opposition
leaders, Yu already met with his PFP and New Party counterparts to
set the stage for the much-anticipated inter-party summit talks.</P>
      <P>After a meeting with New Party Secretary-General Lee Ping-nan, Yu
said the New Party welcomes Chen's visit this week. According to
Lee, Chen's visit may take place on Saturday. Nevertheless, he said,
some technical details need further discussion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu is scheduled to meet with KMT Secretary-General
Ling Fong-cheng Thursday to arrange a meeting between Chen and Lien,
who ended third in the March 18 presidential election. The
proposed Chen-Lien meeting has drawn much attention as the KMT
controls more than half of the parliamentary seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CEMENT INDUSTRY MOVING OUT DUE TO SAGGING BUSINESS CONDITIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Troubled by long-term sluggishness at home,
many Taiwan-based cement companies have accelerated their pace of
diversification and are moving off the island in search of a new
lease of life.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what had been widely believed would be strong demand
from central Taiwan areas, which were hard hit by last year's Sept.
21 earthquake, the local cement industry failed to regain momentum in
the first half of this year, due to delays in construction of several
major public projects and strong foreign competition.</P>
      <P>First-half cement sales fell by 7.7 percent as compared to the
same period of 1999. Currently, cement prices hang around a low level
of NT$2,000 per ton, industry sources said.</P>
      <P>Although it has been forecast that demand in the local market may
rebound beginning in October this year because of the building of the
island's NT$140 billion high-speed rail system and several
large-scale construction projects, many cement companies have in turn
hastened the pace of their relocation overseas or expansion into
other fields to face the challenges of the worsening domestic
business climate.</P>
      <P>Asia Cement, for instance, has already set up a cement company in
mainland China's Jiangxi Province, which is capable of producing 1.5
million tons of cement annually starting in September this year. In
addition, it has also edged into power and Internet businesses
through spin-off operations, an indication of its desire to broaden
its business scope, industrial sources said.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chien Tai Cement has also decided to invest
NT$650 million (about US$20 million) to build a distribution center
and processing plant at Manila Harbor in the Philippines, in its
first bid to expand into overseas markets. The move is expected to
create annual profits of between NT$600 million and NT$700 million
for the company in the initial stages.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Cement's NT$70 billion investment in the Hoping Special
Zone in northeastern Taiwan -- the building of a cement plant, a
power plant and a port -- has aroused a high-degree of attention from
the local industry.</P>
      <P>Two mills of the NT$20 billion cement plant -- one of which has
already started trial operations while the other one is slated to
begin operations in February 2001 -- will be able to produce 5.4
million tons of cement worth NT$10.8 billion per year after
officially going into mass production.</P>
      <P>Construction of the planned power plant, which carries a price
tag of NT$40 billion, is scheduled to be completed in September 2002.
The state-run Taiwan Power Company has decided to buy out the power
plant, which will have a designed capacity of 1.32 million kilowatts.</P>
      <P>First-phase construction of the port has recently been completed
and it is slated to begin operations later this month after having
received approval from the Industrial Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>The objective of the new port is to exclusively handle the
shipping out of the 130 million tons of cement to be put out annually
by the cement plant within the Hoping complex. The port's transport
capacity will be upgraded to 190 million tons after the second phase
of construction is complete.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsing Ta Cement has obtained approval from the
Interior Ministry for a long-term land development project in Kuansi,
northern Hsinchu County.</P>
      <P>The 150-hectare lot, which cost Hsing Ta NT$549 million (US$16.8
million), will be the location of a residential area accounting for
22 percent of the total area, with the rest of the lot earmarked for
parks, schools and forest areas.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TRADE SEMINAR OPENS IN BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,   Oct.   18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A seminar on trade and economic
cooperation among the three Chinese communities -- Taiwan, mainland
China and Hong Kong -- opened in Beijing Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two-day seminar will focus discussion on possible problems
following Taiwan's and mainland China's accession to the World Trade
Organization and feasible strategies to cope with those problems.</P>
      <P>Jing Suping, chairman of Beijing's All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, called on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
to strengthen economic cooperation in his opening remarks.</P>
      <P>Noting that the WTO entry will pose great challenges to both
Taiwan and mainland China, Jing said the two sides should strengthen
cooperation to survive in the increasingly competitive global
market.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-ya, director-general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, delivered a keynote speech
at the opening session.</P>
      <P>Wu said both the Taiwan and mainland markets will become more
transparent and predictable following their WTO entry. Moreover, he
said, the WTO accession will also help increase cross-strait trade
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu Sheng-fa, chairman of the
Taiwan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI), said most of
Taiwan's publicly listed Taiwan companies have invested in mainland
China.</P>
      <P>As many privileges currently enjoyed by Taiwan investors on the
mainland will gradually be removed following the WTO entry, Hsu said
he hopes the ongoing meeting will discuss measures to help
Taiwan-financed companies on the mainland to sustain their market
niches and competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Taiwan has completed planning work for the December
opening of the direct "mini three links," which refer to direct
trade, transport and mail links between Taiwan's frontline islands
of Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland Chinese port cities.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he hopes mainland authorities will cooperate with
Taiwan to ensure smooth opening of the direct "mini three links"
late this year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsu urged mainland authorities to resume cross-strait
dialogue to pave the way for opening of full-fledged direct "three
links" between Taiwan and mainland China as early as possible.</P>
      <P>Hsu further expressed the hope that the Beijing authorities will
offer financial services to Taiwan investors in the mainland.</P>
      <P>More than 200 business leaders from Taiwan, mainland China and
Hong Kong are attending the two-day trade seminar. Issues related to
monetary services, law, Taiwan investors' interests and Beijing's
development project in its western regions will all be included in
the agenda.</P>
      <P>Last year's meeting, which should have taken place in Taipei, was
canceled because of Beijing's irritation over former Republic of
China President Lee Teng-hui's remarks that cross-strait ties
should be on a "special state-to-state" basis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT EXPELS ECONOMICS MINISTER FROM PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's opposition
Kuomintang on Thursday expelled Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi
from the party, chiding him for "seriously opposing KMT policies and
impairing the people's interests."</P>
      <P>"The KMT has decided to expel Lin from the party because he
joined the Democratic Progressive Party-held administration as a
Cabinet member without notifying the KMT leadership in advance and
because of his evident opposition to continuing construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant, which is a set policy of the KMT," said
KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee Director-General Chien
Wei-chang.</P>
      <P>Fourteen out of the 19 members of the KMT Evaluation and
Discipline Committee took part in a meeting Thursday to discuss how
Lin should be dealt with for what he had done.</P>
      <P>At first, the participants at the meeting considered withdrawing
Lin's KMT membership as punishment. However, some committee members
argued against this, saying that Lin should be kicked out of the
party in the interests of party justice.</P>
      <P>They later decided to expel Lin, making him the first KMT member
serving as a Cabinet minister to be kicked out of the party.</P>
      <P>Upon being informed of the KMT decision, Lin said he had no
feelings and offered no opinions on it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee also
decided to have KMT Legislator Chao Yung-ching's membership suspended
for one year as a penalty for his public opposition to the fourth
nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Chao, nicknamed the "environmental protection legislator," has
for long publicly opposed continuation of the controversial project,
which has faced an unknown fate since the DPP became the ruling party
in Taiwan in May of this year. The DPP, which has long insisted upon
a "green, nuclear-free Taiwan," opposes in principle the continuation
of the project.</P>
      <P>The membership suspension will deprive Chao of the possibility of
being nominated by the KMT as a candidate in the 2001 legislative
elections. It has therefore been speculated that Chao will switch
gears and run for the seat of Taipei County magistrate as an
independent or join the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI 3 LINKS' EXPECTED TO HELP BREAK CROSS-STRAIT IMPASSE: PM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Oct. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said Thursday he
earnestly hopes that the upcoming opening of direct "mini three
links" will help push forward the long-stalled relations across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks at a central and local governments
coordination meeting, which was attended by several Cabinet members
and magistrates of offshore and eastern Taiwan counties.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming his call for replacing confrontation with
cooperation, Chang said the Republic of China government's decision
to open direct trade, mail and transportation links between Taiwan's
frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland Chinese
coastal cities, commonly known as "mini three links," is part of its
efforts to forge cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>"The planned opening of the direct 'mini three links' late this
year or early next year marks a goodwill gesture aimed at
underscoring our sincerity to improve cross-strait relations," Chang
explained, adding that he looks forward to seeing significant headway
in cross-strait relations following the opening of the direct 'mini
three links'".</P>
      <P>This was the first time since Chang assumed the premiership that
the central and local governments coordination meeting was held in
Kinmen. Chang said the move signifies the government's concern for
the development in offshore and eastern Taiwan counties, which
generally lag behind other parts of Taiwan in urbanization and
economic development.</P>
      <P>Chang said the opening of direct "mini three links" is also
partly aimed at helping boost economic development in Kinmen and
Matsu by allowing freer product and personnel exchanges with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, Chang said mainland goods that are
badly needed by Kinmen and Matsu residents in their daily lives and
do not pose any threat to national security will be allowed to
shipped directly from such mainland port city as Xiamen to the two
frontline islands, which lie very close to the southeastern mainland
coast.</P>
      <P>The premier also pitched for an end to partisan confrontation and
close cooperation among major domestic political parties to
promote national interests and people's well-being.</P>
      <P>Despite its limited land and natural resources, Taiwan has
managed to achieve economic prosperity and political
democratization mainly because it has consistently adopted supraparty
policy, wise development strategy and emphasis on education. "We
must continue this good tradition to overcome various current
difficulties and ensure sustainable national development," he
added.</P>
      <P>Other Cabinet members present at the coordination meeting
included Vice Premier Lai In-jaw, Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou
I-jen, Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen,
Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, and Lin Chuan, director-general of the
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The meeting, held at the Kinmen County Government, was also
attended by several local government chiefs and lawmakers, including
Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai, Lienchiang County
Magistrate Liu Li-chun, Penghu County Magistrate Lai Feng-wei,
Hualien County Magistrate Wang Ching-feng and Taitung County
Magistrate Chen Chien-nien.</P>
      <P>Chang and other government officials also inspected several
Kinmen infrastructure construction projects in preparation for the
opening of the "mini three links," including a new power plant, the
Liaolo port expansion project and the Shuitou commercial port
construction project, before returning to Taipei Thursday afternoon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SHOULD NOT BE ISOLATED NOR APPEASED: IRON LADY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China is far too important to
be isolated, but at the same time it should not be appeased,
particularly over Taiwan, wrote former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher in the latest issue of Hoover Digest.</P>
      <P>The Iron Lady wrote in the quarterly journal published by
Stanford University's Hoover Institution that with the end of the
Cold War, the nature of the threat to peace and stability has
fundamentally changed.</P>
      <P>"It is the activities of rogue states and the possibility of
unplanned launches of missiles armed with warheads that should now be
our main concern. We must also be able to prevent the intimidation of
friendly states like Taiwan," she said.</P>
      <P>"The way to achieve this is through the construction of an
effective system of ballistic missile defense," she stressed in the
article titled "A Time for Leadership."</P>
      <P>She pointed out that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is a Cold
War relic and now a worthless document that deserves to be consigned
to one of history's shredders. Since only America has the technology
to build a global system of ballistic missile defense, America's
allies should meet a share of the cost, and any delays must be
avoided.</P>
      <P>Lady Thatcher emphasized that "if we come to believe that the
best way to avoid danger is to evade rather than confront it; if we
think that negotiation is always the statesmanlike option; if we
prefer empty multilateral gestures to powerful national responses,
then we shall pay a heavy price -- and our children and grandchildren
will pay it too."</P>
      <P>"What we have to do now is to apply to present dangers the
lessons and insights drawn from the past. Our tasks today therefore
are threefold. First, we have to defend our homelands against present
and future threats. Second, we have to maintain our military
capabilities and alliances in good shape. Third, we have to project
our values and the institutions that nurture them across the globe,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Thatcher said she is convinced that the new threats will likely
come from China, Russia, and such rogue states as North Korea, Iran,
Iraq and Libya.</P>
      <P>"We are apt to say that victory in the Cold War meant the
collapse of communism. But, of course, that is not strictly true.
Indeed, one Communist power has actually benefited by the implosion
of the Soviet Union. China is now the main candidate to become a
superpower, and its intentions and capabilities are rightly the
subject of intense debate."</P>
      <P>Communist China is certainly a rising power -- its already vast
population is growing, as is its economy and ambitions -- all three
in contrast to those of Russia. And still more than Russia, "China's
past history and present ideology suggest that, for the foreseeable
future, it remains deeply hostile to the West," she explained.</P>
      <P>The argument that economic progress will automatically change
this underlying hostility is flawed, according to Thatcher, who said
"the ruling elite in China -- which uses the slogans, apparatus, and
methods of communism to stay in power -- is not going to go quickly
or quietly. It cannot afford to embrace democracy, and at the moment
it does not need to."</P>
      <P>"The leadership is, after all, able to repress dissent without
much difficulty. It has even perfected a system -- combining
enterprise, corruption, and slave labor -- that allows it to benefit
from growing prosperity," she added.</P>
      <P>She concluded that Communist China will likely not come to match
the United States in superpower status, but "it is a potentially
hostile regional power. In the long run, democratic India may emerge
as a counterweight, but today and for the foreseeable future, it is
Japan that must be America's strategic partner in the region. Keeping
that partnership alive and well is the fulcrum of stability in the
Far East."</P>

      <P>The 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games has
raised a record US$30 million in cash and goods and service
commitments from sponsors, US$6.3 million more than raised at the
1996 Atlanta Paralympics, reported the Sydney Morning Herald on

      <P>The daily reported that a majority of the Olympic sponsors have
thrown their support behind the Paralympic Games. The level of
support however only amounts to a small fraction of the US$1.63

      <P>"Compared to the Olympics, the Paralympics is still a developing
brand for sponsors because it is a much younger event and is not as

    <HEADLINE>PENGHU TO BE DESIGNATED "TRIAL PORT" FOR SHIPPING LINKS WITH M'LAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Offshore Penghu Island, located in the
Taiwan Strait, will be designated as the "trial port" for Taiwan in
conducting direct shipping links with mainland China, said the head
of the Mainland Affairs Council on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Reporting at the Legislative Yuan on the feasibility of the
so-called "mini three links" with mainland China, MAC chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen said the council is planning to allow Penghu to conduct
direct shipping links with mainland Chinese seaports for "special
purposes" on a "case-by-case" basis.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" that the MAC is working on implementing
refers to direct trade, transportation, and communications between
the ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and seaports in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme, which is still in the planning stage, Tsai said
Penghu could become a distributing point for gravel from mainland
China heading for Taiwan; a mid-way stop for cross-strait cultural
activity exchanges, including religious pilgrimages; a venue for
private cross-strait training activities or meetings; a location to
be developed into a computer software industrial park; or a base
where cross-strait fishing cooperation can be developed.</P>
      <P>In the long run, Tsai added, the MAC envisages the Penghu
development plan as part of the "direct three links" project --
direct trade, transportation, and communications links between Taiwan
and mainland China -- with Penghu eventually becoming a "special
economic zone" to conduct normal direct business and trade exchanges
with mainland China while simultaneously being developed into an
international tourism, vacation, and meeting center.</P>

expressed the hope that the government will ease its regulations and
allow city-to-city exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council

to visit mainland China next year.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that under current regulations, city and county chiefs

that Hsinchu Mayor Tsai Jen-chien went to the mainland along this
line.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who left for Nanjing Wednesday, will attend a conference of
chief administrators of major science and technology cities around

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to the United States
hit a new single-month record high in August, following steady
monthly increases in this sector since May this year, said sources
from the U.S. Department of Commerce on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$3.69 billion worth of products to the United
States in August, representing an increase of 19.4 percent over the
previous August's total.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC, Taiwan exports to the United States have
hit a new record high every month since May, with August's figure
being US$120 million higher than that of July.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, Taiwan's exports to the United States in the first
eight months of this year totaled US$26.45 billion, for a remarkable
increase of US$3.67 billion over the total for the same period the
previous year, the latest DOC tallies showed.</P>
      <P>With the Taiwan currency continuing to depreciate against the
U.S. dollar over the past several months to the benefit of Taiwan's
exporters, the island's total annual exports to the United States for
2000 are expected to break the US$40 billion mark, representing a new
high in the history of two-way trade between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the DOC statistics, Taiwan imported
US$2.26 billion worth of commodities from the United States in
August, up 36.5 percent over the total for the corresponding month in
1999.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports from the United States in the January to August
period amounted to US$16.47 billion, up a noticeable 35.8 percent
over the amount for the same period the previous year, the DOC
tallies showed.</P>
      <P>While both Taiwan's export and import trade with the United
States have surged over the past several months, its trade surplus
with America has diminished at the same time. In the first eight
months of this year, Taiwan's surplus with the United States totaled
US$9.98 billion, down 7.8 percent from that of the same period in the
previous year.</P>
      <P>According to the DOC figures, Taiwan is currently the United
States' seventh largest trading partner, its seventh largest import
and export market, and its sixth largest source of trade deficit.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between the two countries totaled US$36.97 billion
in the first seven months of this year, up 22.6 percent over the
figure for the corresponding period a year earlier, the DOC tallies

    <HEADLINE>MAC `CONCERNED' ABOUT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China, said
Friday it is concerned about the results of the U.S. presidential
election scheduled for Nov. 7.</P>
      <P>A senior MAC official, who preferred anonymity, said the council
is keeping close watch on the latest development in the U.S.
presidential campaign.</P>
      <P>The official said that if Democratic Party candidate Al Gore
wins, he is expected to continue incumbent U.S. President Bill
Clinton's policy on Taiwan-mainland China relations.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the Clinton administration's policy on
relations across the Taiwan Strait is characterized by four critical
elements -- the traditional U.S. "one China" policy, a peaceful
solution to the cross-strait dispute, encouraging dialogue between
the two sides and the consent of the people of Taiwan to any final
settlement of Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>If Republican Party candidate George W. Bush emerges as the
victor, the official said, his cross-strait policy may be more
favorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Judging from his remarks made in the course of the campaign, the
official said, Bush supports Taiwan's inclusion in the U.S.-proposed
theater missile defense (TMD) system and is likely to throw his
weight behind the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which is pending
congressional approval.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official noted that it remains to be seen
whether Bush will uphold his friendly attitude toward Taiwan if he
actually wins the presidency.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the official said, many of Bush's relatives have
invested in mainland China. Moreover, he went on, the influence of
the executive branch and Congress can also affect Bush's cross-strait
policy.</P>
      <P>While Gore will continue Clinton's current engagement policy with
mainland China if he takes the helm of the White House, the official
said, he is more likely to adopt decisive measures to maintain peace
and stability in the Taiwan Strait and East Asia.</P>
      <P>However, the official refrained from making any forecast
concerning the question of whether Gore will encourage Taipei to take
more active steps to cope with issues related to the opening of
direct cross-strait trade, mail and transportation links, commonly
known as the "three links."</P>
      <P>He also said Gore is more supportive of U.S. involvement in
cross-strait issues, while Bush would prefer to see less U.S.
involvement in cross-strait engagement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AIRLINES SCRAMBLING TO PROFIT OVER 'MINI THREE LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major domestic airlines in Taiwan are
scrambling to get a share of the potentially lucrative air transport
market across the Taiwan Strait as Taiwan's steps to open "mini three
links" with mainland China accelerate.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways and UNI Airlines have decided to increase their
flights from Taiwan proper to the offshore island of Kinmen from Nov.
1, while Far East Air Transport plans to operate additional flights
from Dec. 1 in the belief that direct trade, mail and transportation
links between the ROC-held frontline islands of Kinmen and Matsu and
selected mainland Chinese port cities, commonly known as the "mini
three links," will kick off at the end of the year at the earliest.</P>
      <P>TransAsia authorities foresee that once the "mini three links"
take effect, air transport of passengers and cargo between Kinmen,
Matsu and Taiwan will increase by leaps and bounds as processed
products originating from mainland China will be legally allowed to
enter Taiwan via the offshore islands.</P>
      <P>TransAsia has decided to increase one daily round-trip flight to
its Taipei-Kinmen route, giving it three such flights a day, while
its Kaohsiung-Kinmen round-trip flights will remain unchanged at
three per day.</P>
      <P>UNI Airlines will also provide three Taipei-Kinmen round-trip
flights daily, an increase of one, while the number of its
Kaohsiung-Kinmen daily round-trip flights will increase from one to
two from Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport also plans to add one daily round-trip
flight on its Taipei-Kinmen route, from Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>Currently, only UNI Airlines operates five round-trip flights and
five one-way flights between Taipei and Matsu daily and has no plans
for an increase.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian has urged Communist China to stop threatening Taiwan and
instead resume the long suspended cross-strait dialogue to resolve
problems between the two sides, saying Beijing should adopt a
"sunshine policy" to win over the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mr. Chen was referring to the reconciliatory approach taken by
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung in his efforts to seek greater
contact with North Korea as well as to ease tensions between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>The ROC president told Voice of America in an interview Wednesday
that Mainland China's saber-rattling only arouses antipathy among the
people of Taiwan and further widens the gap between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has no intention of entering an arms race with the
mainland, but the government will continue to increase its arms
purchases to prevent a war across the Taiwan Straits and to defend
the island if necessary, said Mr. Chen.</P>
      <P>A few days after Beijing published a defense white paper that
again threatens an invasion of Taiwan if the island moves toward
independence, Mr. Chen repeated comments he made in his May 20
inaugural speech, saying as long as he is president, and as long as
mainland China does not use military force against Taiwan, he will
not declare Taiwan's independence.</P>
      <P>But the president emphasized that the people of Taiwan do not
want to reunify with the mainland under Beijing's terms, adding that
the two sides should sit down and work together to solve the problem
of "one China in the future."</P>
      <P>He also said he is convinced that the leaders on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits have the wisdom and creativity to work out, based
on the principles of democracy and equality, a new definition of "one
China" that is acceptable to everyone.</P>
      <P>Communist China's leadership has said it is willing to resume a
dialogue with Taiwan only if the latter's leaders embrace Beijing's
"one China" principle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEPTEMBER EXPORT ORDERS HIT NEW SINGLE-MONTH HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export trade has continued to gain
momentum over the past several months and export orders posted a
record high in September, sources from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The value of export orders received in September amounted to
US$14.32 billion, marking a single-month high in Taiwan's foreign
trade history, thanks to a remarkable increase in orders from the
United States and Hong Kong as a result of Washington's granting
Permanent Normal Trade Relation status to mainland China, the MOEA
officials said.</P>
      <P>The September figure was a whopping increase of 33.33 percent
over the corresponding month of the previous year and was also a
record in terms of month-on-month growth, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, attributed the brisk performance in particular to sales
of metal, electronics, electronic engineering, information technology
and telecommunications products.</P>
      <P>Even the plastics, rubber and textile sectors, which showed
relatively slower growth than the metal, electronics and
telecommunications products, posted evident growth in export orders,
Chang noted.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA tallies, Taiwan received US$114.50
billion-worth of export orders in the first nine months of this year,
up 22.6 percent, or US$21.3 billion, over the corresponding period of
the previous year.</P>
      <P>The United States continued to be the major source of Taiwan's
export orders in September, placing a record US$4.66 billion-worth of
orders, while Hong Kong followed with orders worth US$2.69 billion,
also a single-month record.</P>
      <P>Orders from Japan totaled US$1.47 billion, up a whopping 44.52
percent from the August figure, while orders from Europe amounted to
US$2.42 billion, up 18.33 percent.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taiwan Institute of Economic Research President
Wu Rong-yi said Taiwan's economic and industrial structures are
fundamentally healthy and that there is no justifiable reasons for
Taiwan stock market investors "spooking themselves."</P>
      <P>Wu said the recent plummet in the domestic bourse should not be a
cause for Taiwan investors to panic and trigger a crisis of
confidence in the government and he stressed that Taiwan is still
economically strong.</P>

cockpit assemblies from U.S.-based Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.</P>
      <P>Cougar Helicopter, an offshore oil operator based in eastern
Canada, has ordered the helicopters and AIDC is scheduled to deliver
the first cockpit to Connecticut-based Sikorsky by June 2001 for
final assembly.</P>
      <P>AIDC, a member of the international team of companies that
developed the new Sikorsky medium-lift helicopter, is in charge of
producing the cockpit section, which includes electrical harnesses,
flight controls, hydraulic lines and environmental controls.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan-based company also participated in the
development of the S-92's twin CT7-8 turboshaft engines with
U.S.-based General Electric.</P>
      <P>Currently in development, the 20-passenger S-92 is based on U.S.

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK LOWERS ROC ECONOMIC GROWTH FORECAST TO 6.41%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research (CHIER) said Friday it has lowered its forecast of Taiwan's
economic growth rate for 2000 to 6.41 percent for a combination of
factors.</P>
      <P>This was the second time that the private economic think tank
has adjusted downward its forecast of Taiwan's 2000 economic growth
rate.</P>
      <P>The CHIER first predicted this year's Taiwan economic growth rate
at 6.66 percent in April, but lowered its forecast slightly to 6.6
percent in July.</P>
      <P>The institute said it now decides to further lower its forecast
because of several major factors -- a drastic stock market plunge,
slow progress in reconstruction in areas hard-hit by the devastating
earthquake that rattled the island on Sept. 21, 1999, uncertainty
about the fate of the controversial fourth nuclear power plant, an
exodus of local industries, and a decrease in trade surplus due to
increased imports.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) and the Directorate-General Budget, Accounting and Statistics
echoed the CHIER's view, saying they also plan to make downward
adjustments of their forecasts of this year's economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Chen Po-chih was quoted as having said that the
council may lower its growth rate forecast to 6.4 percent from
original 6.57 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the Chung-Hua institute, Taiwan's economic
performance in the second half of this year was not as brilliant as
that in the first half. The institute estimated the economic growth
rates for the third and fourth quarters at 6.44 percent and 5.94
percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>CHIER researchers said the recent stock market fall has affected
private consumption. They predicted that the annual growth rate for
private consumer spending will be lower than 6 percent for the
second half of the year.</P>
      <P>While private investment increased by more than 20 percent in
the first half of this year, investments by both the government and
state-owned companies registered double-digit declines. As a result,
the institute said, the annual growth rate of domestic investment
will be only about 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>On the foreign trade front, customs tallies show that exports
remained bullish in the third quarter of the year and that export
orders received by local manufacturers also continued growing.
Nevertheless, imports have also expanded substantially, which has
narrowed the growth in trade surplus. Slower growth in trade surplus
would cut the trade sector's contribution to economic growth, CHIER
researchers said.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that this year's domestic economy is
characterized by robust growth in substantive industrial production
but lackluster performance in the financial sector.</P>
      <P>As for next year's economic prospects, the CHIER said
uncertainty in the global economy may have an adverse impact on the
Taiwan economy. As Taiwan's foreign trade, investment and consumer
spending may not grow as fast as this year in 2001, the institute
said the island's 2001 economic growth rate is expected to stand at
6.1 percent or even lower.</P>
      <P>The institute further said although domestic gasoline prices have
risen steadily, the hike has only affected wholesale prices and has
not significantly pushed up consumer prices. As a result, the
institute said this year's inflation rate will remain low at about
1.41 percent. But the inflation rate may reach 2.14 percent next
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institute predicted that the New Taiwan dollar's
exchange rate will remain at an average of NT$31.65 against the U.S.
dollar this year, but may depreciate to NT$32.02 against the
greenback next year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local financial expert urged the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government Friday to stop
presenting any new policy initiatives in order to revive public
confidence and maintain domestic stability.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chu-wei, a National Chengchi University finance professor,
made the call at a seminar on current domestic financial and economic
problems sponsored by an opposition Kuomintang-financed think tank.</P>
      <P>Tseng said many local people originally expected the new DPP
government to come up with fresh policy proposals with innovative
thinking.</P>
      <P>"However, five months after the inauguration of the island's
first DPP-led government, many people are disappointed as the new
government still fails to articulate its policies on some sensitive
issues, such as relations across the Taiwan Strait and the fate of
the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project," Tseng noted.</P>
      <P>Incoherence and inconsistency of various government agencies'
stances on these thorny issues have sparked a crisis of economic and
political confidence and triggered a drastic plunge in the local
stock market, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>"The phenomenon indicates that the new government is not yet
ready to cope with those contentious issues," Tseng said, adding that
since the government has not had fresh ideas and sufficient
capabilities to deal with the issues, it should suspend its
presentation of premature policy proposals that are based on the
DPP's traditional ideology.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the proposed scrapping of the fourth nuclear power
plant in terms of the DPP's anti-nuclear stance and the refusal to
acknowledge the so-called "1992 consensus" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait based on the DPP's pro-independence platform have
deepened public misgivings about the Republic of China's future
prospects.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Tseng said, the minority DPP government
should freeze its presentation of new policy initiatives until it
has managed to craft out well-designed, coherent and feasible
proposals on major policy issues based on new thinking, not old
ideology.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tseng also urged the DPP government to adopt effective
measures to stabilize the foreign exchange market. Noting that a
dramatic fall in the stock market often would have an adverse impact
on the currency market, Tseng said the government should not let the
New Taiwan dollar's exchange rate fluctuate too drastically to
affect overall financial and economic stability.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan legislator exposed an organ
trading group Friday that advertises for customers and urged people
not to fall prey to the group, which masquerades as an official
organization.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Yi-wen said in a press conference that a local
group took out advertisements in the name of the Organ Donation
Association (ODA) of the Republic of China that said patients
requiring transplants need no longer wait and that a liver could be
had for between NT$500,000 (US$15,625) and NT$800,000, while a kidney
would cost between NT$1.5 million and NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>Joyce Hsu, secretary-general of the ODA, said the advertisement
plagiarized contents of ODA periodicals in an attempt to cheat people
in need. She lodged the strongest possible protest and sued the
group.</P>
      <P>Hsu indicated that while there are about 5,000 people in Taiwan
awaiting organ transplants each year, only around 200 actually
receive transplants because regulations require that organs can only
be harvested when the donors are recognized as brain dead, while
transplants from living people must be confined to relations such as
spouses, parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers,
sisters and their children.</P>
      <P>Tan Kai-yuan, director of the Bureau of Medical Affairs under the
Cabinet-level Department of Health, said trading in human organs is
prohibited in Taiwan, and that violators can be fined NT$450,000. He
added that the number of hospitals permitted to carry out transplants
is also limited, and that violators face a fine of NT$600,000, while
the doctor's license can be revoked for a year.</P>
      <P>Chiang said she is promoting a revision of the regulations in an
attempt to resolve the bureaucratic difficulties surrounding organ
transplants.</P>
      <P>However, she expressed concern about recent reports of a
debt-ridden individual using the Internet to find a buyer for one of
his kidneys and said it is even more alarming that there are already
illegal groups trading in human organs.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By J.J. Hwang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
said Thursday that no breakthrough is possible for Taipei and Beijing
unless the gap in their standpoints on the outcome of a 1992 meeting
is shortened.</P>
      <P>Lee told the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think
tank, that mainland China insists a "one China" consensus was reached
in 1992, while Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian believes
that both sides only found a "1992 spirit."</P>
      <P>"If there is no concession at all to 'one China,' I think there
is no way out for them," he said, adding that a "very wide gulf"
still exists between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The former Singaporean prime minister went on to say that
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin had told him during his June
visit to Beijing that mainland China does not want to use force
against Taiwan, but no mainland Chinese leader could remain safe and
sound if he were to "lose" Taiwan during his term in office.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if mainland China has no other choice, it will abandon
ongoing efforts at domestic economic modernization and use force
against Taiwan under the principle of "one China," Lee added.</P>
      <P>The next U.S. president will have to face the thorny cross-strait
issues, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that mainland China will play a critical role in
Asia, and its membership in the World Trade Organization will be
beneficial to the development of the entire Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee said that mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, who has
declared that he is confident of being able to solve mainland China's
financial problems, must eliminate all the obstacles to his nation's
WTO accession during the next two to three years -- otherwise, Zhu's
successor will not be as bold in implementing economic reform as he
is.</P>
      <P>Regarding North and South Korea, Lee predicted that they will not
be reunified in the immediate or even medium term because it would
not be in either country's national interest. He added that mainland
China would not welcome unification of the Korean peninsula, as it
would mean losing a buffer state.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TO MEET NEW PARTY LEADER SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will meet with
opposition New Party leaders Saturday for wide-ranging talks as
part of his efforts to promote inter-party reconciliation and
cooperation, the Presidential Office announced Friday.</P>
      <P>President Chen will meet with Hao Lung-pin, convener of the
pro-unification New Party's National Campaign and Development
Commission, at the Taipei Guest House, the Presidential Office said,
adding that the meeting will start at 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>New Party Secretary-General Lee Ping-nan and Lai Shih-pao, the
party's whip in the Legislative Yuan, will also take part in the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Hao, also a legislator, said he and his colleagues will exchange
views with President Chen, a stalwart of the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, on a broad range of issues, including
relations across the Taiwan Strait, current stock market woes,
a crisis of economic confidence and other topics related to national
development and people's well-being.</P>
      <P>It will be the second time that President Chen has met with
leaders of a major local political party to signify his sincerity to
promote domestic political harmony and inter-party cooperation. Chen
held closed-door talks with opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong Thursday night. Chen called his meeting with Soong "a
great leap" for Taiwan's democratic development.</P>
      <P>As the DPP controls only about one-third of the Legislative Yuan
seats, Chen has pitched for an end to inter-party
squabbles and an early start of inter-party cooperation since his
inauguration in May.</P>
      <P>Due to complex reasons, a Chen-proposed roundtable meeting of
top leaders of major parties has long remained on the drawing board.
As a result, Chen said last week he will pay separate visits to PFP
Chairman Soong, main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and New
Party leaders to show his determination to forge inter-party
rapprochement.
 KMT Chairman Lien, also a former vice president, has tentatively
agreed to meet Chen next week. The exact time, venue and agenda for
the much-anticipated Chen-Lien meeting have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu said the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55
years until May 20 and now still controls a majority in the
legislature, hopes that the Chen-Lien meeting will focus on
substantive issues and achieve concrete results, not just
publicity effects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung on Friday hailed
Thursday night's meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, and described it
as a success.</P>
      <P>Asked whose performance during the talk was better, Chang said
diplomatically that he was very much impressed by the performance of
both men.</P>
      <P>The premier made these remarks while answering questions raised
by Kuomintang Legislator Chin Hui-chu at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he was especially pleased that the long-expected
meeting had finally taken place, because he personally sent the
invitation to Soong in his former capacity as secretary general to
the president.</P>
      <P>On Soong's "I am Taiwanese and also a Chinese" statement, Chang
replied that his ancestors indeed came from Fujian province, and he
is a citizen of the Republic of China and is also a Taiwanese. He
described the Soong's declaration as "very good".</P>
      <P>The premier said that he agrees with Soong's assertion that
ideological matters should not be brought into economic and financial
policies.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the government should uphold the freedom of
the press.</P>
      <P>In answering questions raised by KMT Legislators Chen Ming-wen,
Chang Fu-hsing and Hou Hui-hsien about reform of the statutes
regulating the structure of local governments, Chang said that his
policies were being carried out to benefit all the people of the
nation, and were not aimed at helping any specific political party.</P>
      <P>In his administrative report presented to the Legislative Yuan,
Chang called on political parties to cooperate each other in place of
confrontation.</P>
      <P>But KMT legislators said that they suspect the reform of local
government statutes is really just a way to weaken the party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial production increased by
16.49 percent in September over the same month last year, but the
construction industry suffered a decrease of 38.9 percent, according
to statistics from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>MOEA officials indicated Friday that the large annual growth in
September's industrial production was partly due to unusually low
production caused by the devastating earthquake that hit Taiwan on
Sept. 21, 1999, which caused property damage and power blackouts that
affected industrial output.</P>
      <P>Of September's industrial production, the manufacturing sector
increased by 19.18 percent thanks to booming exports, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>However, the officials added, internal demand was down in
September, which can be seen by the declining construction industry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said at a legislative interpellation session Friday that a limited
number of mainland Chinese tourists may be allowed to visit Taiwan on
a trial basis after June of next year.</P>
      <P>During the same session, Lin Wen-lang, a legislator of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, asked Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen why the government still does not allow
mainland Chinese tourists to enter Taiwan and also prohibits mainland
Chinese from investing in the island when the Taiwan public has been
visiting and investing in mainland China for years.</P>
      <P>Following next January's scheduled opening of the three
"mini-direct links" -- trade, postal, and transport links -- between
Taiwan's outlying islands and mainland China, which will allow for a
maximum of 1,700 mainland visitors per day, Chang said that the next
step will be to allow mainland tourists to visit Taiwan-proper,
abiding by the same limitations.</P>
      <P>Tsai responded to Lin's claims that Taiwan tourists have been
visiting mainland China for nearly 10 years by saying that they
actually travel there in the name of visiting relatives or inspecting
business operations. The government has not actually allowed the
Taiwan public to go to mainland China as tourists, she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that because Taiwan will soon enter the World Trade
Organization along with mainland China, the government will give
priority to allowing mainland Chinese investment in Taiwan's service
industry. Meanwhile, she added that a special task force will look
into the feasibility of allowing mainland Chinese to invest in the
stock market and manufacturing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>3 TAIWAN TRAWLERS STILL BEING DETAINED BY ARGENTINE AUTHORITIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taiwan trawlers detained by Argentine
authorities are still awaiting a judicial decision, an official of
the Fisheries Department under the Council of Agriculture said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The three detained trawlers are the Houtsun 101, Huaching 707 and
Chinchuanhsing. Crew members of one such vessel, the Houtsun 101,
have already been deported to Taiwan, while its captain, Yen
Wen-chien, is expected to be released soon. Crew members of the other
two detained trawlers were still detained in Argentina, the official
said.</P>
      <P>More than 100 Taiwan vessels have fished for squid in waters near
the Falkland Islands and the Argentine waters this year, but the
three trawlers were detained by Argentine coastal guard cutters for
allegedly poaching within 200-nautical miles of the nation's coast,
which it claims as its economic territory.</P>
      <P>When the Houtsun 101 sank while being escorted to a port in
southern Argentina, its crewmembers were rescued and sent back to
Taiwan, while skipper Yen Wen-chien was detained and is now awaiting
the judicial process.</P>
      <P>The other detained trawlers and their crewmembers are also still
awaiting a judicial decision on the matter by the Argentine
authorities, the official said.</P>
      <P>With the squid season in the southern Atlantic fast approaching,
the official called on local trawler owners to equip their ships with
satellite navigation systems so as to avoid entering into the
exclusive economic territory of Argentina and the Falkland Islands. A
trawler should report its position every day it is operating in that
area, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOLOMON APOLOGIZES TO TAIWAN FOR THURSDAY STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The day after blaming Taiwan for a rift in
bilateral ties, the Solomon Islands apologized to Taipei Friday, and
its prime minister announced a plan to visit Taiwan late this month.</P>
      <P>In a press release issued Friday by the Solomon government in
Honiara, Edward Hunuehu, a special adviser to Prime Minister Manasseh
Sogavare said that Thursday's press release criticizing Taipei for
not extending sufficient aid to the war-ravaged Pacific island was
released without the prime minister's approval.</P>
      <P>He apologized for the disturbance it caused in Taipei, and
reconfirmed that the relationship between the two countries remains
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Hunuehu also said that Sogavare has accepted an invitation
delivered by Republic of China Ambassador P. Y. Teng to visit Taipei
to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>ROC Foreign Ministry officials, who expressed outrage at
Thursday's statement from the Solomons and threatened to take
"determined action," said they are looking forward to Sogavare's
visit.</P>
      <P>In the emotionally-charged statement of the previous day, the
Solomon government blamed the diplomatic "inexperience" of Taipei's
Foreign Minister Tien Hung-mao for the scuffle between the two
countries. It also expressed outrage at mass media reports that the
tiny island state with a population of 360,000 was asking for US$200
million in aid from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead, the statement said, the Solomon has asked for no more
than US$60 million.</P>
      <P>Thursday's vaguely-worded statement also disclosed that the
Solomons were exploring "the one China policy option", an apparent
reference to investigating the possibility of opening diplomatic ties
with Taiwan's rival Beijing, because of what it called Taiwan's
breach of diplomatic protocol in its dealings with the Solomons.</P>
      <P>In a bid to vindicate its claim to be a sovereign state rather
than a province of People's Republic of China, Taiwan has engaged in
a long-running battle with Beijing to court as much overseas support
as possible. It often descends into a bidding war, with both Taipei
and Beijing competing to offer generous aid to states -- mainly small
ones -- in exchange for their support.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
said Friday that he hopes the "three links" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait can be opened soon, under the precondition that the
ROC's national security is not threatened.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the direct trade, mail and transportation links
-- the so-called "three links" between Taiwan and mainland China --
involves many problems that cannot be controlled unilaterally by
Taiwan, so he cannot set the timetable for opening the links.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remark in response to questions from legislators,
including Lee Ching-hua and Wu Ching-chih.</P>
      <P>Lee said the Cabinet has decided that the country will open the
direct three links between Taiwan's frontline islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and selected mainland Chinese coastal cities early next year,
commonly known as "mini three links," Lee has described the opening
as a "small scale" measure that cannot meet the needs of both sides
of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee emphasized that establishing the "three links" is no longer a
political chip for Taiwan, but is now a "necessity." He asked the
premier to set a timetable for the opening of the "three links," as
the people's welfare cannot wait.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu reiterated that the "three links" are the best hope
for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Chang, who just assumed the premiership, reiterated that the
Cabinet has announced many measures that can help promote bilateral
economic and trade exchanges with mainland China, and will review the
"No haste, be patient" policy with respect to Taiwan investment in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>The premier said he also hopes for an early opening of the direct
"three links" with mainland China, but this issue involves many
problems such as the signing of trade and transportation agreements.
He said he hopes the two sides can sit down to discuss this issue --
the sooner the better.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PRESIDENT ADVISES CURRENT PRESIDENT TO `HAVE PATIENCE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Prague,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui reluctantly gave his embattled successor Chen Shui-bian a
word of advice Friday -- "patience."</P>
      <P>During breakfast at his hotel in Prague, Lee at first was
reluctant to respond to reporters who asked him to give some advice
to Chen, who was exactly five months into his presidency. He said
that it was not proper for him to give advice in his capacity as a
former president.</P>
      <P>Lee eventually responded after the reporters praised him as
having made major accomplishments early in his tenure despite what
the reporter said was less power than Chen enjoys now. Lee slowly
mouthed the word "patience" and urged Chen to look farther ahead.
"Nursing the head when the head hurts and nursing the leg when the
leg hurts" is not a good policy, the former president said.</P>
      <P>Lee was in the Czech Republic to attend the fourth Forum 2000
conference on the roles of science, education, and religion in
globalization. The forum ended Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he has not criticized the new administration after
it took over the country's helm on May 20 because it is not right for
a former president to criticize the incumbent. He went on to say that
the current instability in Taiwan is a sign that the public is not
yet used to the new government, and has nothing to do with the
system.</P>
      <P>Members of the new ruling Democratic Progressive Party have no
experience at being government officials, he said, adding despite
this, things should get better.</P>
      <P>Lee and his Kuomintang ruled Taiwan for over five decades, and
Chen's rise to power marked the first transition of power from the
KMT to another party.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to point out that Beijing has kept up a steady
barrage of criticism at him when he actually did much to improve
cross-strait relations. Present-day cross-strait exchanges and the
US$90 billion Taiwan investors have poured into mainland China were
made possible because of his policies, he added.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he noted that one must look far ahead and not take
criticism with an attitude of disgust.</P>
      <P>He admitted that it has been hard work promoting political reform
in Taiwan, but that thankfully its society was mature enough that
there was no bloodshed or rioting during the changeover.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the policies carried out during his term
in office were all developed together by various ministries, which
took credit for the successes. This was a way to give them the morale
to continue promoting their own policies, he said.</P>
      <P>Handling technical issues when they come up also requires some
attention, he said. For example, if the stock market is not
performing well due to external factors, and the Cabinet and the
National Security Council have fully discussed the situation, they do
not need to make public their full intention because the effect of
their measures will be evident later, he said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the current impasse between Taipei and Beijing, Lee
said that there is always a way out, and that Beijing's biggest
problem right now is not the Taiwan issue but its own
democratization. He urged Taiwan to look at the problems from
Beijing's perspective and not always from its own.</P>
      <P>After mainland China enters the World Trade Organization and a
system for wireless communications is established, there won't be any
more secrets, he said. He also noted that mainland Chinese leaders
are worried about how the Communist Party will be able to control the
populace of mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China are just like water and oil --
"unmixable," he added. However, after WTO ascension brings about
privatization and greater respect for private rights in mainland
China, "opportunities will slowly increase," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee expressed his thanks for an invitation to the 12th
annual conference of the Asian Outlook Forum scheduled to be held in
Japan from Oct. 29 to Nov. 3. However, he could not just go as he
pleases, he said, because of Beijing's political pressure on Japan.</P>
      <P>Lee left Taipei last Saturday for Prague at the invitation of
Czech President Vaclav Havel, who founded the Forum 2000 think tank
together with a private Japanese foundation in 1997. Lee is scheduled
to return to Taipei on Oct. 22.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESDIENT CHEN CRITICIZES CONSTITUTION AS DEFICIENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian blamed Friday what
he called the "deficiencies of the Constitution" for the difficulties
facing his five-month old administration.</P>
      <P>In a courtesy meeting with a group of Taiwanese-Americans at his
office, Chen complained that under the Constitution, the Republic of
China president can not veto bills as his U.S. counterpart might do
-- nor can he dissolve the parliament as the president of France is
empowered to do.</P>
      <P>As the head of state, the U.S. president can steer national
policy by vetoing bills passed by a Congress under the control of an
opposition party.</P>
      <P>And the French Constitution allows the president to call snap
parliamentary elections as a last resort to rid themselves of a
legislature dominated by another party, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He lamented that none of these powers are granted to the
president of the ROC by the nation's Constitution. The president can
opt to dissolve a hostile Legislative Yuan only at the request of the
premier and after a no-confidence motion against him has been passed
by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>This constitutional "deficiency" has placed his administration in
limbo, because his Democratic Progressive Party is a minority in the
Legislative Yuan, said Chen.</P>
      <P>As a result, the agenda of the Chen Administration has often been
blocked by the legislature since he took power in May.</P>
      <P>The president said he is still confident that the constitutional
obstacles can be overcome, but he didn't elaborate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PREPARED TO NEGOTIATE WITH MAINLAND CHINA: ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said Friday that he is willing to carry out dialogue with
mainland China "on the existing foundations," but that Taipei and
Beijing did not reach a consensus on the "one China" issue in 1992.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a Chinese-language Singapore newspaper
published Saturday, Chen added that Taiwan has completed all
preparations and is ready to begin negotiations with mainland China
at any time.</P>
      <P>He went on to express his belief that the leaders on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait have sufficient wisdom and creativity to find a
mutually acceptable consensus and common ground between them so that
they can handle the issue of "a future one China" under the existing
foundations.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that the scope of the so-called "existing
foundations" is very broad and has different interpretations and
definitions under different circumstances. Taking the 1992 meeting
between the two sides as an example, he said that while the two sides
did indeed discuss the issue of "one China," they did not reach
consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan does not accept Beijing's claim that the "one China
principle" is a consensus between both sides and Beijing does not
agree with Taipei's take of "one China, respective interpretations,"
he added.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, despite each side sticking to its own
version of the story, they must nevertheless have arrived at some
kind of "spirit" that led to the historic 1993 meeting in Singapore
between cross-strait negotiators. According to Chen, this so-called
"1992 spirit" refers to dialogue, exchanges, and setting aside
contentions.</P>
      <P>Chen said: "My so-called `existing foundations' means that
agreements we've had, I will acknowledge; consensus we've reached, I
accept; tacit understandings we've agreed to, I'm not against. These
existing foundations already exist, and this is something I cannot
deny."</P>
      <P>He reiterated that there is no official record showing that
Taiwan and the mainland did reach a consensus in the 1992 meeting
about the "one China" principle. However, he added, both sides
definitely have more similiarities than differences and should be
able to put aside and preserve minor differences while seeking common
ground.</P>
      <P>When questioned as to whether his previous comment that
"unification is not the only option" means "Taiwan independence is
another option," Chen said that unification, independence, or
maintaining the status quo are all choices for the Taiwan people to
make. He added that he cannot decide the people's future for them.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the principles highlighted in his May 20
inauguration speech, where he promised that as long as mainland China
has no intention of invading Taiwan, he will not announce Taiwan
independence during his term in office, change the official name of
the nation, call a referendum on unification versus independence to
change the status quo, promote writing the controversial "special
state-to-state theory" into the constitution, or abolish the National
Unification Council and the Guidelines on National Unification.</P>
      <P>In response to reports of Beijing's claim that Chen's
unwillingness to admit being "Chinese" is the key reason the two
sides cannot resume dialogue, Chen said that this kind of "word game"
is meaningless because what most concerns the people of Taiwan --
regardless of whether they call themselves Taiwanese, Chinese, ethnic
Chinese, or a citizen of the world -- is how Taipei and Beijing can
interact with each other.</P>
      <P>As for remarks made a day earlier in New York by Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew that no breakthrough is possible as far as
cross-strait relations are concerned, Chen noted that unless there is
concession over the "one China" issue, under the circumstances, it
would not be easy to resume negotiations with Beijing before the U.S.
presidential elections in November.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENATE PASSES HOUSE RESOLUTION ON U.N. MEMBERSHIP FOR ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With only a few days left before the
end of the current session of the U.S. Congress, the Senate passed
Thursday by a unanimous vote a House concurrent resolution in support
of Taiwan's participation in the United Nations.</P>
      <P>"This is a victory for the people of Taiwan," said Rep. Bob
Schaffer (R-Colo.), original sponsor of the resolution, upon learning
of the Senate vote. He added that passing the widely supported
resolution "once again restates our support and our commitment to the
progress of Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>Schaffer, who along with 40 of his colleagues introduced House
Concurrent Resolution 390 on July 22, wrote a letter to Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) Wednesday, requesting the
resolution be placed on the Senate calendar to ensure its timely
passage. On Oct. 3, the House passed the resolution by an
overwhelming vote.</P>
      <P>"Congressional support for Taiwan is solid. Taiwan has made
enormous strides toward becoming a full democracy and it is
unreasonable for the people of Taiwan to be excluded from full
participation in international institutions due to threats from
mainland China," said Schaffer.</P>
      <P>The previous week, Schaffer and 10 other members of the House of
Representatives also sent joint letters to Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.),
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Craig
Thomas (R-Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, urging the Senate to support Taiwan's
participation in the United Nations and other international bodies
such as the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Formosan Association for Public Affairs President Chen Wen-yen
noted that under the constant mainland Chinese threat of military
force against Taiwan, the support by both houses of the U.S. Congress
will enable Taiwan to seek assistance and support from the U.N.
Security Council if necessary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING INTERVENTION IN TAIWAN'S APEC REP ISSUE `REGRETTABLE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office of the Republic of
China described as "regrettable" Saturday the fact that Beijing has
once again interfered politically to stymie Taiwan's participation in
international activities.</P>
      <P>The statement was made in response to a report that Beijing is
said to have voiced opposition to Taipei's plans to appoint Vice
Premier Lai In-jaw as chief Chinese Taipei delegate at the informal
leadership summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum scheduled for next month in Brunei.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office Public Affairs Department said in a press
release it is "deeply regrettable" that Beijing interference with the
naming of the delegation members has now placed Brunei, the host
country of the APEC summit meeting, in a difficult position.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian appointed Lai to
attend the summit on his behalf after a meeting with an emissary from
Brunei on Oct. 13, on the grounds that Lai is the government's top
decision-maker on business and financial affairs and is considered
the best choice for the mission by all industrial, business and
academic sectors in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Brunei authorities immediately accepted and acknowledged
Taipei's decision, according to the news release.</P>
      <P>However, because of Beijing's intervention, Brunei contacted
Taipei two days later to say that Beijing's opposition and Lai's
selection put Brunei in an awkward position.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Presidential Office Public Affairs Department
said the ROC government understands Brunei's awkwardness, but will
continue to negotiate with the Brunei authorities in the hope that a
solution satisfactory to the host country and Taiwan can be worked
out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FALLING  CURRENCY  CAUSING  TROUBLE FOR AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian currency hit a new record
low of 52 U.S. cents Friday, and economists and political experts
anticipate that the expected continuing plunge could have an enormous
political impact on the Australian government.</P>
      <P>Political analysts have predicted that a fall below the
psychologically potent 50 U.S. cents level will be highly dangerous
for Prime Minister John Howard.</P>
      <P>The experts say Australian voters will be less confident in the
Howard government's handling of its economic and financial management
and political fallout can be expected in the next election, either in
2001 or 2002.</P>
      <P>"The biggest negative for the dollar this year has been the
steady price falls that have led to a complete loss of confidence by
investors," according to Rory Robertson of the Sydney-based Macquire
Bank. "Fundamentals become increasingly less important as hopes for a
rebound are crushed," he added.</P>
      <P>Australia's economy remains sound, with its gross domestic
product growth expected to exceed 4 percent between July 1, 2000 and
June 30, 2001.</P>
      <P>But the continuous fall of the local currency, though good for
exports, is making imports more expensive and many Australian
consumers are now feeling the pinch, said Robertson.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET SUBMITS READJUSTED BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR FISCAL 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet submitted a readjusted national
budget proposal for fiscal 2001 to the legislature Saturday for
deliberation.</P>
      <P>Total revenues and expenditures remain unchanged at NT$1,458.5
billion (US$45.45 billion) and NT$1,608.2 billion (US$50.12 billion),
respectively, but the budget for programs that can be retrenched or
deferred has been cut by NT$1.389 billion (US$43.28 million), a sum
that will be spent on other programs.</P>
      <P>Total expenditures increased by NT$95 billion (US$2.96 billion)
over the current fiscal budget, but the Cabinet stressed that funding
to carry out government policies are facing obvious limitations,
making response measures urgently needed.</P>
      <P>Following the resignation of Tang Fei as premier early this
month, the Executive Yuan withdrew its original budget proposal for
readjustment, to reflect the intentions of new Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung to give priority to economic development and improving
care for off-shore island residents, aborigines, farmers and
fishermen.</P>
      <P>Trimmed expenditures also include NT$8.82 million (US$274,852) in
pay cuts for the president and the vice president, and NT$4 billion
(US$124.65 million) in government subsidies to the national health
insurance program.</P>
      <P>Most of the budget increases go to transportation construction

    <HEADLINE>HSINCHU MAYOR MAY RETURN FROM MAINLAND CHINA TRIP AHEAD OF SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Shanghai, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Peng Sze-chou and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mayor Tsai Jen-chien of northern Taiwan's
Hsinchu City might cut short an ongoing visit to mainland China
because he resents being described at a conference as the mayor of a
Chinese city, according to a member of his delegation.</P>
      <P>Liu Yu-tung, assistant dean of Hsinchu's National Chiao Tung
University School of Humanities, said Saturday that Tsai might return
to Taiwan early because a spokesman at the conference he attended
said the mayor, a member of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, identified with the "one China principle."</P>
      <P>Tsai is originally scheduled to end his trip Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, Tsai attended the second World Technology
Cities Conference in Nanjing purely to discuss issues related to
science-technology cities and share the 20 years of development
experience of the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, and did not
touch on any political issues.</P>
      <P>Liu went on to say that Tsai was in mainland China in his
capacity as "Hsinchu Mayor" and not "mayor of Hsinchu City, China."</P>
      <P>Tsai is the first local government chief to be allowed to visit
mainland China since the inauguration of the Republic of China
government in May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsinchu Deputy Mayor Lin Cheng-chieh said that he had
not been in contact with Tsai since the previous evening and did not
know if he was indeed returning ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has recently turned down on political grounds
separate applications by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh, who concurrently serves as DPP chairman, to visit

    <HEADLINE>CHEN INSISTS ON `OPENNESS' IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
he holds no preset stance on the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and that as a head of state, he will keep himself "hollow
and empty" so he can accept all outside opinions.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that consensus and decisions reached by the
Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations in the future
will be the pivotal basis on which the administration formulates its
policies on the thorny cross-strait relations issue.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks during a meeting with opposition New Party
head Hao Lung-ping and two other party heavyweights at the Taipei
Guest House -- Chen's second meeting since his inauguration for
fence-mending efforts with the oppositions.</P>
      <P>He noted that the 21st century begins only 72 days from now and
said he earnestly hopes that people from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will play greater roles in the new era. He added his fervent
hope that there will be no war, no conflict, but only peace and glory
ahead.</P>
      <P>He lauded the New Party as "an efficient and responsible
opposition group." He said the party's "small size" is no problem, as
long as the party has its own "height and depth."</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, a mini-party or a minority government is
a majority as long as it meets the people's expectations and its
policies are aimed at the greatest interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Quoting the old Chinese proverb: "When brothers are of one heart,
they will create a force strong enough to cut steel," Chen welcomed
his meeting with the New Party leaders, saying that as long as all
parties stand together, all difficulties, no matter how invincible
they seem, will be conquered.</P>
      <P>He added that similar meetings will take place in the future so
that his administration can hear more opposition voices.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen exchanged views with Hao, convenor of
the New Party's National Election and Development Committee, Lai
Shyh-bao, the New Party whip at the Legislative Yuan and New Party
Secretary-General Lee Ping-nan on matters regarding cross-strait
relations, constitutional reforms, policies to reinvigorate the
domestic economy and bourse, and ways to enhance ethnic harmony.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the meeting, Hao also confirmed the significance of
the talks, saying that "a good start is half-way to success."</P>
      <P>He said that despite its small size, the New Party is also part
of the crew of the "Ship of Taiwan" under the helm of President Chen.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that Chen's ideological insistence will
eventually be detrimental to the development of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that since Chen's administration took office five
months ago, the government has from the very beginning been shadowed
by a veil of ideological insistence.</P>
      <P>This, he went on, is evident in ex-Premier Tang Fei's
resignation, ostensibly on grounds of ill health, Chen and Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung's jointly held view that there was no consensus
reached across the Taiwan Strait in 1992, the Ministry of Education's
reluctance to adopt the Hanyu Pinyin romanization plan, and Chen's
insistence that he is "ethnic Chinese" rather than "Chinese."</P>
      <P>Hao said Chen and the ruling Democractic Progressive Party's
insistence on certain ideological issues will eventually cause a
stalemate between the ruling and opposition parties, impair
cross-strait relations and sacrifice ethnic harmony.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The mechanism for a hotline between
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian and the heads of the
country's various political parties will probably be established next
week, according to a top presidential aide.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, deputy secretary-general to the president, said in
a radio interview Saturday that the establishment of such a hotline
and the contact it would provide among the staff members of the
different camps will allow the president to exchange opinions with
party leaders and effectively resolve problems when faced with major
issues.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came after a Thursday meeting between the
president and opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong and
a meeting earlier Saturday with opposition New Party head Hao
Lung-ping, Chen's first meetings with opposition party leaders since
his May 20 inauguration.</P>
      <P>If a third meeting -- with opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan -- takes place next week, Chen said that the hotline and
dialogue mechanism will soon be inaugurated.</P>
      <P>However, KMT legislator Chen Hung-chi, who was also present in
the radio studio, said that while the establishment of such a hotline
might have a symbolic effect on the unstable political situation, the
actual effect would remain to be seen.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that where there is a lack of consensus, trying to
resolve difficulties and issues through the hotline would be more for
appearance's sake than any substantial significance such a move might

    <TEXT>
      <P>Salvadoran Vice President Carlos
Quintanilla encouraged Taiwan businessmen Friday to invest in El
Salvador.</P>
      <P>Quintanilla made the call at a seminar titled "Central American
Trade Opportunities and the Salvadoran Investment Climate," held in
Los Angeles where he was making a transit stopover en route to a
five-day visit to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Quintanilla encouraged Taiwan businessmen residing in the United
States to take advantage of the benefits afforded by the Central
American preferential act promulgated by the U.S. government, by
investing, manufacturing and procuring in Central America.</P>
      <P>The act, signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton on May 24 and
formally put into effect on Oct. 1, is aimed at paving the way for
the establishment of an American Common Market, by first offering
Central American and Caribbean nations the same treatment as the
members of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- no quota
restrictions on exports and no import tariffs.</P>
      <P>Quintanilla expressed the belief that the act will have a

transfer to be manufactured in the Central American region.</P>
      <P>Hsia Kuo-wei, a Taiwan businessman who has invested in El

    <HEADLINE>SISTER-TO-BROTHER KIDNEY TRANSPLANT SUCCEEDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH)
surgeons have successfully transplanted a kidney from a woman into
her elder brother, using laparoscopy instead of conventional surgical
methods, sources from NTUH's Department of Urology said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Although it is not the first live-donor kidney transplant in
Taiwan, the sister-to-brother transplant marks the first case in
Taiwan in which the laparoscopy technique has been used to remove and
acquire a kidney from a live donor.</P>
      <P>At a press conference announcing the successful transplant, which
was performed nearly one month ago, brother Lee Juei-cheng, 36, said
he was so touched by the love and unselfishness shown by his younger
sister, Lee Chia-ling, 30, that he could find no words to describe
his gratitude to her.</P>
      <P>Lee said that after five years of dialysis, NTUH doctors told him
earlier this year that a kidney transplant would be the only option
to keep him alive, whereupon his whole family, including his
62-year-old father, offered to give him a kidney.</P>
      <P>After a series of assessments and comparisons, doctors found that
a kidney from Chia-ling would be most suitable for the transplant.</P>
      <P>Chia-ling, who is married and has two children, accepted the
challenge without a second thought, enabling the transplant to be
performed in September at the NTUH Department of Urology under the
supervision of doctors Chuei Shih-chieh and Lai Ming-kun.</P>
      <P>Chia-ling said she has pretty much recovered from the surgery
over the past one month, apart from occasional feelings of fatigue.</P>
      <P>Chuei and Lai cut a relatively much small opening of 6.5 cm in
Chia-ling's lower abdomen and removed her left kidney by hand after a
hand-assisted laparoscope removed all connecting blood vessels on the
organ.</P>
      <P>Chuei described the operation as successful, saying that although
it took one hour longer using the laparoscopic technique, the
operation saved the donor from losing an excessive amount of blood --
only 50 cc, about one-third of the amount lost during conventional
surgery to remove a kidney -- while the size of the incision was also
much smaller. The donor also recovered much more quickly, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lai also highly recommended the laparoscopic technique for use in
Taiwan, saying it offers greater incentives for potential donors to
be willing to give up their own kidneys to needy relatives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President Lee
Teng-hui left the Czech Republic capital of Prague Saturday en route
to Taipei via Paris after winding up a week-long visit.</P>
      <P>Lee visited Prague to attend the fourth Forum 2000 conference on
the roles of science, education, and religion in globalization. The
forum ended Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He delivered a speech on Taiwan's democratization process and the
mainstream values of today's world at one of the sessions of the
forum, which gathered some 50 retired heads of state, religious
leaders, influential politicians, writers and artists from around the
world.</P>
      <P>Lee met exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama during the
conference and invited him to visit Taiwan again. the Dalai Lama, who
last visited Taiwan in 1997, said at a later press conference that he
will fly to Taiwan at a date yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The former president also visited Czech President Vaclav Havel on
Oct. 17 and they had a 20-minute exchange of views on Taiwan's
political and economic achievements.</P>
      <P>Lee's Prague visit was made at the invitation of Havel, who
founded the Forum 2000 think tank together with a private Japanese
foundation in 1997. The Czech Republic does not recognize Taiwan
diplomatically, although the two countries maintain close substantive
relations.</P>
      <P>This was Lee's second overseas trip since he stepped down as
president on May 20. He visited Britain in June.</P>
      <P>He would not elaborate on which countries he wants to visit next,
saying only that he is considering the matter, although many
countries have offered him invitations.</P>
      <P>Unconfirmed news reports have speculated that Lee is expected to
visit Japan to take part in this year's Asian Outlook forum later
this month, but the reports have been denied by Lee and he has not
applied for a Japanese visa.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which protested bitterly to London for allowing Lee to
visit, lodged a protest with the Prague authorities over his Czech

    <HEADLINE>16% OF CHEN'S SUPPORTERS WOULD SWITCH: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 16 percent of those who voted for
Chen Shui-bian in the March 18 presidential election would change
their minds if the clock could be turned back, according to the
results of a public opinion poll released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The same poll, conducted by an association affiliated to the main
opposition Kuomintang, also found that the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) has received the largest share of the blame
for the recent domestic stock market slump.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,095 adult residents conducted by the
Chinese National Development Association from Oct. 19-20, found that
if the presidential election were to be held again, 15.9 percent of
those who voted for Chen in March said they would cast their ballots
for other candidates; 66.9 percent said they would not switch their
allegiance; 11.6 percent either said "it depends" or "it's hard to
answer;" and 5.9 percent said they would not go to the polls or would
spoil their ballots.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 32.3 percent of those interviewed said
they voted for Chen in the March presidential election, 24.7 percent
said they opted for independent candidate James Soong (now chairman
of the People First Party (PFP)), 12.7 percent voted for KMT
candidate Lien Chan, and 29.7 percent either said they did not vote,
spoiled their ballot, or refused to answer the question.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 27 percent of the respondents said
they think that the DPP is to blame for the drastic stock market fall
over the past five months. In contrast, 17.3 percent said the KMT,
which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20, should be blamed for
the stock market woes. Only 0.2 percent said they feel the PFP, which
was founded after the March 18 presidential election, should take the
blame for the stock market plunge.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 11.1 percent said they think all major domestic
political parties should be held responsible for the bearish stock
market, while 14.5 percent said the question needs further
observation and 20.8 percent either declined to answer the question
or said they have no opinions about the issue.</P>
      <P>As for the main reasons behind the poor stock market performance,
23.1 percent cited uncertainty surrounding the government's financial
and economic policies; 16.3 percent blamed opposition parties for
countering the government simply for the sake of opposing; 10.4
percent put the blame on the DPP for its refusal to uphold the fourth
nuclear power plant construction project; 6.8 percent cited strained
relations across the Taiwan Strait; 5.8 percent blamed the DPP's
insistence on its traditional ideology (pro-Taiwan independence and
anti-nuclear energy); 20.5 percent said it depends; and 16.6 percent
said they do not know or have no opinion.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the recent financial and economic meeting chaired
by President Chen Shui-bian could help upgrade public confidence in
the government, 40.2 percent gave a negative answer; 26.1 percent
said it could help; 17.4 percent either said "it depends" or "it's
still hard to evaluate"; and 16.3 percent said they have no opinion.</P>
      <P>If the DPP fails to sustain Taiwan's economic growth, 38.2
percent said that not voting for the DPP in the next election is the
best way to hold the party responsible for its failure; 9.6 percent
said a recall of the president would be the best way; 8.1 percent
preferred to see legislators hold a no-confidence vote against the
premier; 4.4 percent said economic performance has nothing to do with
the ruling party; 2 percent said they see no need to weigh the DPP's
responsibility for the poor economic performance; 20.3 percent either
said "it depends" or "it's hard to answer"; and 17.4 percent said
they have no opinion.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 26.8 percent of those interviewed said
they feel that Chen gives the top priority to the DPP's opinions in
his policy-making, while 24.4 percent said they think that Chen
places more emphasis on the opinions of the general public, and 37.9
percent either said "they don't know," "it depends" or have no
opinion about the issue."</P>

    <HEADLINE>BILLS INTRODUCED TO BALANCE PRESS FREEDOM AGAINST NATIONAL SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Draft bills designed to draw a fine line
between the protection of state secrets and the freedom of the press
have been presented to the Legislative Yuan, a Government Information
Office (GIO) official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su Cheng-ping, general director of the GIO, said in an interview
with a local TV station that a bill aimed at protecting classified
information from the press and another designed to open other
government information to public scrutiny have been brought to the
legislature for approval.</P>
      <P>The bills are the brainchildren of the GIO and an attempt to
balance press freedom against the government's need to keep secret
information vital to national security.</P>
      <P>The editor-turned-government spokesman acknowledged that there
are often conflicts between press freedom, judiciary independence and
national security.</P>
      <P>"Drawing a clear line between them is the only way to reconcile
the competing demands," Su said.</P>
      <P>He made the comment in response to questions about a flurry of
recent government crackdowns on the publication of alleged government
secrets by local newspapers after they scrambled to publish the
transcripts of the depositions of witnesses involved in several
high-profile military scandals and other documents related to these
cases.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors, irritated by the disclosure of the information,
ordered a search of the offices of a local newspaper and indicted a
former police officer who was a member of the police task force
charged with looking into the scandal surrounding the navy's purchase
of warships six years ago.</P>
      <P>Angered by the Oct.3 search, the China Times Express is now
vigorously pushing for legislation to strip prosecutors of the power
to order searches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Lin Keng-chiang, now secretary-general of the Coast
Guard Administration was indicted Saturday for revealing secret
information about the navy scandal to a local electronic newspaper,
the "tTimes,"</P>
      <P>The prosecutors based their indictment on the grounds that Lin
was one of two investigators who had access to the top-secret
information and the only one who refused to undertake a lie detector
test to support his claims of innocence.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the reasoning behind the indictment as "absurd," Lin
said he refused to take the test because he felt it was an "affront"
to him, while its results are inadmissible in court.</P>
      <P>In its Sunday edition, the tTimes criticized the evidence listed
in Lin's indictment as "fragile."</P>
      <P>Newspaper officials said that as responsible journalists, they
did not reveal their sources to the investigating prosecutors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The dissolution of communism in Moscow's Red
Square in 1991 will be repeated some day on Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, exiled Chinese dissent Harry Wu said in a recent interview.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the French weekly L'Express which hit
newsstands Sunday, the dissent who spent many years in labor reform
camps in mainland China appealed to European leaders to help mainland
China rid itself of dictatorship.</P>
      <P>In the interview, released to coincide with a meeting in
Yangzhou, southern China, between French President Jacques Chirac and
his mainland Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin, Wu said Beijing's
crimes against human rights in wiping out political rivals are "no
less than those of Adolf Hitler."</P>
      <P>He estimated the victims of communist Chinese suppression since
1949 to number about 50 million and said that persecution of
political dissent is even more vigorous at present.</P>
      <P>The Beijing regime even sells the organs of executed criminals,
Wu claimed.</P>
      <P>He called Beijing's threat of using force to reunite with Taiwan
a bluff aimed at rallying the mainland people behind a banner of
nationalism. He further noted that a separate and prosperous Taiwan
funneling investment into mainland China would best serve Beijing's
interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAS NOT CHANGED 'GO SOUTH' POLICY: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian said recently that Taiwan's "go south" policy has remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in a recent interview with Singapore's
Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao, which published the full text
of the interview in its Sunday issue.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first president from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party, said Taiwan is one of major countries
in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>It is regretful that the ROC has been barred from taking part in
activities of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
simply because of political reasons, Chen said, adding that it's a
great loss to ASEAN member states and their people.</P>
      <P>Chen further said his administration has not changed the
previous Kuomintang government-initiated "go south" policy under
which Taiwan has encouraged its businesses to invest in Southeast
Asian countries with a view to cooling their craze for investing in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under the "go south" policy, Taiwanese entrepreneurs have poured
more than US$40 billion into major Southeast Asian countries for
various investment projects, making Taiwan a major source of foreign
capital in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia
and other nations in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC is more than willing to fulfill its obligation
as a member of the Global Village and share its developmental
experience with other developing countries. Due to mainland China's
opposition, Chen said, the ROC has been shut out of nearly all major
international organizations, including the United Nations, the World
Health Organization and ASEAN.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear power plant
project, Chen said the issue should not be politicized. According to
Chen, whether Taiwan should build a fourth nuclear power plant is
publicly discussed only after the DPP came to power in May. Under
the previous KMT government, Chen claimed, construction of a fourth
nuclear power plant is a must. The KMT government had never
presented alternatives to the project.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration has presented the issue for
public discussion and debate. He stressed that it's up to the
Executive Yuan (Cabinet) and the Legislative Yuan to pool wisdom to
decide the project's fate. Chen said a final decision on the issue
will be made in bear future.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's recent stock market slump, Chen said it's not an
issue unique to Taiwan. In fact, Chen said, major stock markets
around the world have suffered setbacks in recent weeks. "As 85
percent of Taiwan's stock investment concentrates in
science-technology stocks, our bourse would certainly be affected
when the U.S. technology-heavy NASDAQ drops," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Another special feature of the Taiwan Stock Exchange
(TAIEX) -- individual or retail stock investors account for 87
percent of the island's stock investors -- has added up to market
volatility, Chen noted, adding that Against this backdrop, short-term
speculative stock trading has become a social problem in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chen stressed that Taiwan's economic fundamentals
remain sound and healthy, with the economic growth rate expected to
reach 6.32 percent in the fourth quarter this year. Exports, imports
and foreign orders have all grown substantially and the inflation
rate remain low, Chen said, adding that he remains confident in
Taiwan's economic prospects.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's trade policy toward mainland China, Chen said so
long as Taiwan's national security can be ensured, his
administration will largely ease restrictions on commercial
exchanges with the mainland based on reciprocity, proportion and
general market principles.</P>

      <P>Nearly 90 percent of local farmers
responding to a recent public opinion poll support Proposed revisions
to the farmers association election law to ensure clean election of
major executives and board members, according to survey results
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,001 farmers randomly selected from
around the island, conducted by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) from Oct. 18-21, found that 88.2 percent of the
respondents support revisions to regulations governing election of
delegates of grassroots farmers associations, directors, supervisors
and secretaries-general.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, the respondents support the DPP-proposed
stricter restrictions on the qualifications for those who intend to
take part in the elections for managerial posts in grassroots
farmers associations.</P>
      <P>DPP officials said the restrictions are necessary to prevent
those with criminal records from joining future elections to
continue control of local farmers associations.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture said one-third incumbent farmers
associations executives, delegates and board members have previous
criminal records or close links to criminal rings.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in personal and notebook
computers have increased by more than 40 percent over last year, with
local notebooks accounting for 60 percent of the global market,
industry sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>With this excellent performance and solid base, the information
industry is also working hard to develop related spheres such as
telecommunications products, information appliances and servers, in
an effort to also gain a niche in the global market, according to the
sources.</P>
      <P>Global computer demand is expected to increase by less than 15
percent this year amid the global economic recession. However,
Taiwan's exports in desktop computers is expected to reach 2.9
million units, up 49 percent over the year-earlier level, said the
sources.</P>
      <P>The total production value of domestic desktop computers is
expected to reach US$80 million this year, representing an annual
increase of more than 10 percent and accounting for 24 percent of the
global market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's notebook exports are expected to reach 14 million this
year, an annual growth rate of 44.32 percent. Total production value
will increase from last year's US$11 billion to US$15 billion, while
its world occupancy rate will climb from 49 percent to 60 percent.</P>
      <P>As the world's third-largest information technology hardware
manufacturer, Taiwan's information industry is also conducting
research and development in software products and increasing added
value in its products, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>For example, the sources went on, four major notebook
manufacturers are shifting part of their efforts to the development
of Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) mobile phones, with total
production expected to reach 20 million units next year. Along with
its original production, Taiwan's WAP mobile phones are also expected
to gain an important position in the world market, they added.</P>
      <P>Many other domestic computer giants have formed R&amp;D teams to
develop software related to information appliances, in efforts to
gain an edge in the field within five years.</P>

      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
will play a decisive role among three joint ventures of local and
foreign oil companies who will bid for a NT$400 billion natural gas
power plant project at Tatan, a senior CPC official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>CPC Chairman Chen Tsao-wei said the company will choose a

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several participants in a seminar urged the
government Sunday to make its policies clear and respect market
mechanisms by reducing intervention to ensure the nation's solid
financial development.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao and several scholars were speaking at a
seminar aimed at hammering out constructive suggestions for the
government. They made the suggestions because the local bourse has
been in a serious slump since President Chen Shui-bian assumed his
post on May 20.</P>
      <P>Lai, of the opposition New Party, said the government has
intervened too much in the stock market while failing to make
decisions on crucial policies such as whether or not construction of
the fourth nuclear power plant will continue, which analysts have
blamed for the lack of confidence among investors.</P>
      <P>He said that although short-term government intervention in the
stock market may reduce the speed of the slump, it is harmful to the
market's long-term development.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government quickly make decisions on the
country's crucial construction projects and present basic economic
policies to ensure a more solid financial market.</P>
      <P>Tseng Chu-wei, professor of finance at National Chengchi
University, said one of the reasons behind the mounting problems is
the government itself.</P>
      <P>He claimed that fact that the country's industrial development is
inclined too much toward the high-tech sector is because of excessive
intervention by the government, which he said always uses
intervention as a knee-jerk reaction when short-term problems occur.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government should find a complete solution
to the many financial problems instead of presenting short-term

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAD SPEAKS ON LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS, `3 DIRECT LINKS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) predicted Sunday that none of Taiwan's three
major political parties will nominate members for more than half of
the contended seats in next year's crucial legislative elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh made the remarks when he was interviewed
by the media in southern and northern Taiwan in a teleconference.</P>
      <P>He was asked how the DPP expects to change the current situation
of a government with a legislative minority in view of the party's
suggestion that nominations for less than half of the contested seats
in the legislative election should be submitted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh responded that the number of DPP nominations will be close
to half of the contested seats in the legislature -- or 88, if the
proportional seats of each political party are discounted.</P>
      <P>He said that through cooperation with other political parties and
independents, as well as proportional seats in the future, any party
that can gather close to half of the seats will be the dominant force
in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Currently, the DPP accounts for slightly less than one-third of
the seats in the Legislative Yuan. The opposition Kuomintang, despite
suffering a defeat in the March presidential election, is still the
dominant force in the legislature.</P>
      <P>On reports that the DPP is likely to cooperate with the
opposition People First Party (PFP) headed by former KMT stalwart
James Soong in the hope of playing off the PFP and KMT for the
benefit of the DPP, Hsieh said that the public should not see this as
DPP connivance.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the DPP actually hopes to promote the
reconciliation of the country's political parties and help ease the
party rivalry.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also addressed the "three direct links" with mainland
China, saying that the mainland should shoulder the blame for the
delay of direct trade, postal and transport links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's remarks followed President Chen Shui-bian's statement
Saturday that as long as Beijing shows sincerity, cross-strait links
might be put in place sooner than generally expected.</P>
      <P>Both Soong and Hau Lung-bin, convenor of the New Party's
National Committee of Campaign &amp; Development, expressed concern
during recent meetings with Chen about the ideology of the
pro-independence DPP, which they said might affect cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said, however, that Beijing is also insisting on its own
ideology, and he expressed the hope that both sides can put aside
their ideological differences in order to resume dialogue.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the format of his press conference, he said that if
high-level officials from both sides cannot meet in person at
present, it might be a good idea to organize a teleconference for
them.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that he said long ago that the term "Chinese"
could refer to blood, history or politics. With the exception of the
island's aboriginal population, he went on, most of the ancestors of
local residents originally came from the mainland and so could be
referred to as Chinese. However, he continued, if "China" in
political terms were to refer to the People's Republic of China, 85
percent of local people would not consider themselves Chinese.</P>
      <P>On Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's recent statements to
the effect that the prolonged stalemate in cross-strait relations is
not in Taiwan's favor, Hsieh noted that the mainland also has a lot
of problems and that time is not necessarily on Beijing's side.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that while as a democratic society, Taiwan
has already extended numerous olive branches to the other side of the
Taiwan Strait, Beijing's policy is not so clear.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has shown some flexibility and goodwill toward
Taiwan, he said, the mainland offers different interpretations of its
"one China" principle to Taiwan and to the rest of the world, and
Taiwan must remain on guard.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou called
Sunday for the government to "follow its goodwill with action" and
act on the results of an upcoming meeting between President Chen
Shui-bian and opposition Kuomintang chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks followed recent meetings between Chen and other
opposition leaders, including People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong and New Party head Hau Lung-bin. A meeting between Chen and
Lien is expected soon.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is a KMT Central Standing Committee member, said that he
is glad to see Chen finally change his attitude and accept
consultations with other political parties, but he also said that if
there is only the form of consultation and no real substance, it will
not help solve the problems faced by the government.</P>
      <P>Chen's government is seen to be going nowhere after five months
in the office because of its minority status, according to Ma. Chen's
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) holds less than one-third of seats
in the Legislative Yuan, while the vanquished KMT is still the
dominant force in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma said that it is easy to show goodwill, but it is difficult to
follow it through, adding that for the real benefits of political
consultation, the government must show more sincerity and substantial
action and address the major issues of public concern, such as the
controversial fourth nuclear plant and cross-strait relations, so as
not to give the impression that the administration is dragging its
feet in the process of policy-making.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the new government should return to the
mainstream public will, and not work against the consensus of the
majority of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Ma said that Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung stressed the speeding up of direct trade, postal and
transport links -- the so-called "three direct links" -- with the
mainland, but he noted that the two sides have locked horns on the
issue of "one China."</P>
      <P>He said that the stance of the KMT is that both sides should
return to the agreement reached in 1992 -- "one China, separate
interpretations" -- which Ma said is also the consensus of the
majority of people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that if the government insists on acting against the will
of the majority, "the results will be clear."</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the government does not waver and acts quickly on
its decision-making, it will put the government in tune with the
needs of the people. In this way, he said, a minority government
could also succeed.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Tien
Hung-mao said in an interview with CNA Sunday that the ROC government
is paying great attention to the U.S. presidential election as it is
very important to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the election will play a crucial role in the
development of the triangular relationship between Washington,
Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>As a foreign minister, Tien said that he cannot openly indicate
his favored candidate, but he added that it can be assumed that
Taipei's access to the Republican camp is broader than its access to
the Democratic camp.</P>
      <P>He admitted that U.S. policy is very important to the ROC's
national security and national survival.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, if the new U.S. government is more
friendly toward Taiwan, Taiwan will be able to buy more advanced
weapons, while U.S. support for Taiwan will become more stable.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tien went on, such a friendly government will take
more positive steps to prevent a military invasion by mainland China
and will support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>The scholar-turned-foreign minister said his ministry attaches
importance to the work of promoting better relations with Washington,
because European countries, Japan and Australia usually watch the
moves made by the United States before deciding their own moves.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Tien also stressed that the ROC government will
continue its efforts to enhance relations with the European Union, as
the E.U. has become a very important regional group in the
international community.</P>
      <P>He said that priority will be given to the proposed establishment
of offices between Taipei and the E.U. and added that efforts will be
also be made to promote relations with other European organizations,
including the Council of Europe.</P>
      <P>Regarding the recent twists in the development of Taipei's
diplomatic relations with the Solomon Islands, Tien said that his
ministry's basic stance is that "we have to do our utmost to maintain
formal relations."</P>
      <P>Although the Solomons government demanded more financial aid from
Taipei and began negotiating with Beijing, Tien said that Taiwan will
not return to the old-school method of severing ties with any country
which engages in negotiation with mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that Taipei has been monitoring the incident with great
prudence and added that so far, the relationship between the ROC and
the Solomon Island remains positive.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Tien denied speculation that he is not in
harmony with President Chen Shui-bian after being excluded from some
of Chen's interactions with foreign countries.</P>
      <P>But he admitted that he has not fully adjusted to the political
circumstance since he took over the post last May.</P>
      <P>Tien also voiced regret that he has no time to make frequent
foreign trips to make new friends.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIR CALLS FOR CONTINUATION OF 4TH NUKE PLANT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman Vincent
Siew on Monday urged the government to resume the fourth nuclear
power plant project, saying that "to build" is better than "not to
build."</P>
      <P>Siew, who was a hard-core supporter of the project during his
term as the Republic of China premier when the KMT was in power, said
completion of the project is essential to meeting the needs of
Taiwan's economic development, which will result in growing demands
for electricity.</P>
      <P>The replacement plans that have been put forth by the Chen
Shui-bian administration are full of uncertainties, making it
necessary to continue and complete construction on the nuclear power
plant, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>President Chen, who campaigned for the presidency on an
anti-nuclear platform, has made moves to scrap the project, which is
already 33 percent completed.</P>
      <P>Siew said scrapping the project is also impractical as it would
not only involve heavy compensation payments, but would also scare
foreign investors away from the island, risking undermining the
country's reputation in the international community.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew suggested that the government enact relevant laws
stipulating that no new nuclear power plants be constructed in Taiwan
in the future, not even when the operational terms of the existing
three nuclear power plants expire, in order to support its policy of
keeping Taiwan "green and nuclear-free."</P>
      <P>Siew said that although it seems the government is already
determined to scrap the project and that it is only "a matter of
time" before it officially confirms the discontinuation, anything is
possible, particularly as things can change quickly in politics. He
said it is still hard to say at the present time that the project is
dead for certain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Siew blamed Taiwan's slumping stock market, which has
lost one-third of its value since the inauguration of the Chen
administration on May 20, on to two major factors -- investors'
crisis of confidence in the government and the impasse across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Siew suggested that the government stop playing the "word game"
in its overall policies, adding that the government must secure
continuity and stability in its policies in order to restore the
general public's confidence.</P>
      <P>As for the development of cross-strait relations, which also has
a decisive influence on the performance of Taiwan's bourse, Siew
suggested that a common market be established across the Taiwan
Strait to accelerate cross-strait exchanges, narrow the ideological
gap between the two sides, and eventually end the political deadlock.</P>

their highest level in more than three years as a prolonged recovery
in the market continues, according to a statement by the Australian

      <P>The AWIS, which represents wool exporters and processors,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TEENAGE GIRL AMONG FINALISTS IN INT'L WEB PAGE DESIGN CONTEST</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A junior high school girl from southern
Taiwan is hopeful of winning the top prize in the international
Thinkquest Web page design contest, sources from Kaohsiung said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Fourteen-year-old Lin Pei-ying, the first Taiwanese student ever
to be chosen as a finalist in the TQ contest, is going to travel next
month to Egypt where she will meet with her two Web "pals" for an
interview and final test for the ultimate prize. If Lin and her two
co-authors win the top prize, they will receive US$25,000 each for
their work.</P>
      <P>Although Lin has never met in person with her two Web pals, the
three of them have cooperated closely over the past half year to
jointly design their Web page titled "The Learning Curve," which was
chosen as one of the 24 finalists in the TQ contest of the best works
designed by young brains from around the world.</P>
      <P>The TQ contest, sponsored by the renowned non-profit Advanced
Network and Service, received 1,150 Web page design entries from
teenage students from around the world this year. Eight of those
entries came from Taiwan, according to Sin Yu-chien, an ANS
spokesperson in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>All the creators of the 24 chosen works will go to Egypt to take
part in individual interviews and assessments by international
judges. All the contestants and their coaches will be entitled to
cash prizes of between US$15,000 and US$75,000, Sin noted.</P>
      <P>"The Learning Curve," the Web page that Lin and her co-authors
created, is in English, although Lin and another of the creators,
Jaen Saul, an Estonian, do not have a good command of English. The
third member of the team is a Canadian teenager, Sin said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Taipei Chinese-language daily China
Times, Lin said she thinks Saul, is "simply a genius" because he can
use more than a dozen kinds of programming languages despite the fact
that he has never even bought a book about the Web or Internet and
can hardly speak English.</P>
      <P>Co-writing the Web page was also a challenge and at times tiring
because the three authors all live in different time zones, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin, who became "obsessed" with Web page designing at the age of
12, said she feels thrilled about meeting her Web pals next month in
Egypt. The "virtual" friendship will soon become "reality," she said.</P>
      <P>A veteran HTML user, Lin said she is continuing to learn COBOLs,
including Linux and PHP, to further enhance her skills.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PALACE MUSEUMS ON BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT TO BOOST EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior leaders of the national palace
museums on both sides of the Taiwan Strait met in Taipei Monday to
forge rapprochement and cooperative ties.</P>
      <P>Tu Cheng-sheng, director of the National Palace Museum in
Taipei, said he is very pleased to discuss with Tan Bin, deputy
director of the National Palace Museum in Beijing, concrete
measures for promoting bilateral exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>For his part, Tan told Tu that the striking similarity between
appearances of the Taipei and Beijing palace museums makes him feel
at home. "I hope the two museums can work out a feasible formula for
exchanges and cooperation," he added.</P>
      <P>Nestled along wooded slopes outside downtown Taipei, the palace
museum is home to more than 600,000 pieces of Chinese artwork. Along
with the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the
Louvre, the Taipei palace museum is regarded as among the world's
greatest.</P>
      <P>As mainland Chinese officials see the Taipei palace museum
collection as a giant cache of treasures "stolen" by the Kuomintang
government during the Chinese civil war in the 1940s, they had
threatened to take the collection back to the mainland.
Taiwan has taken the threat seriously. When the museum
sent exhibits in 1996 and 1997 to the United States for
display at several noted U.S. museums, it did so only
after the United States guaranteed the artifacts immunity
from judicial seizure.</P>
      <P>Tu said the Taipei palace museum has staged a series of
exhibitions of cultural relics and artifacts from mainland China in
the past few years, including the "Mysteries of San-hsing-tui," which
features bronze, gold and jade relics from a 3,000-year-old Chinese
kingdom, and an exhibit showcasing silk, lacquerware and
paintings from the Han Dynasty (202B.C. - A.D. 220).</P>
      <P>"We have accumulated plenty of experiences in organizing
exhibitions of mainland cultural relics and art treasures through
all those events," Tu said, adding that the museum is now preparing
for an exhibition of Tang Dynasty cultural relics scheduled for
2002.</P>
      <P>Tu said the Taipei palace museum is also no stranger to lending
its collection for overseas exhibitions. In the past, the palace
museum sent selected pieces of Chinese art for display at major
museums in the United States and France. It is now planning to lend
its exhibits for display in Germany next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that the U.S., French and German authorities had all
guaranteed safe return of the artworks, Tu said the museum would
consider sending its exhibits to the mainland only after Beijing
authorities offer similar guarantees.</P>
      <P>In response, Tan said although he personally cannot decide
mainland China's national policy, the Beijing palace museum is
willing to ensure the safe return of art treasures loaned by the
Taipei museum.</P>
      <P>If political obstacles to shipping Taipei's art treasures to the
mainland for exhibition cannot be removed soon, Tu said, the two
sides can consider cooperation in holding joint exhibitions in third
countries or areas.</P>
      <P>Tan immediately voiced his support for Tu's proposal, saying
that the Beijing palace museum is willing to join forces with its
Taipei counterpart in staging exhibitions in third countries at
proper times and under proper terms.</P>
      <P>Tan and five of his colleagues are currently on a weeklong visit
in Taipei. During his stay, Tan said he will hold further talks
with Tu on a possible framework for future exchanges between the two
museums.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROCKETING INT'L SUGAR PRICES CAUSE PURCHASE RUSH IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to the continuing climb in the
international price of sugar, domestic sugar traders predicted
that Taiwan Sugar Corporation will raise its prices in January,
which has resulted in a sugar purchase rush.</P>
      <P>The international sugar prices have nearly doubled since April of
this year.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the Fair Trade Commission, Chao Yang-ching, said
during the interpellation session in the Legislative Yuan Monday that
the Taisugar is currently keeping domestic sugar prices unchanged in
order to stabilize the market's supply and demand.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture and the Taisugar on Monday both
appealed to domestic sugar traders to maintain import orders.</P>
      <P>They added that the unrefined sugar imported for emergent
need will soon arrive and that the country's brown sugar stores
are still sufficient to meet market demand.

      <P>U.S. computer giant Compaq is seeking a
partnership in Taiwan to boost its new investment arm stretching into
the field of biotechnology, sources from Compaq Taiwan said Monday.</P>
      <P>Compaq's headquarters in the United States announced recently
that it will invest US$100 million to help the research and
development of the world's burgeoning life sciences, which include
genomics and bioinformatics, said Lai Chao-hui, vice president of
Compaq Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be one of the locations where part of the US$100
million Compaq investment will be used for the new program, Lai
noted.</P>
      <P>At a seminar titled "Decoding Human Genomic Sets -- Exploring
Biotechnology High-Performance Computing," Compaq introduced the
cutting-edge Compaq Alpha Server and its envisaged applications in
decoding human genomic sets.</P>
      <P>According to Bruce Foster, marketing manager of Compaq's bio-tech

    <HEADLINE>JOBLESS RATE FOR MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WORKERS ESCALATING: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) called a
meeting Monday to address the high rate of unemployment among
middle-aged and older workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics show that the number of jobless middle-aged and
older workers surged to 42,000 by March this year, compared with only
17,000 in 1986.</P>
      <P>CLA Vice Chairman Kuo Jen-chi presided over Monday's meeting, in
which the participants discussed the reasons for the high rate of
unemployment for this specific age group and reviewed the current
measures to address the problem.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the current retirement payment system is
the major hurdle for middle-aged and older workers seeking jobs. The
Basic Labor Law stipulates that laborers who have worked for 25
consecutive years, or who have worked for 15 years and have reached
the age of 55, must be given retirement payments by their employers.
Employers therefore tend to be reluctant to hire older workers.</P>
      <P>In addition, current labor insurance regulations stipulate that
it is compulsory for part-time workers, no matter how long or short
their working hours, to take part in the insurance system, putting an
added burden on their employers.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the language of current employment regulations does not
explicitly guard against discrimination based on a job-seeker's age.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that plant closures and business
downsizing are mainly to blame for the high unemployment rate among
middle-aged and older workers. The fact that these workers are often
the main source of a family's income and that they are often unable
to enter new lines of work has a major negative effect on Taiwan
society, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>Participants at the meeting seemed helpless in thinking of ways
to deal with the problem. Labor officials from local governments
expressed the hope that the CLA and other government agencies can
work together to review the structure of the nation's industry and
revive industrial development so as to provide more employment
opportunities for middle-aged and older workers.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that of all the government social welfare programs
available, the subsidies given to employers to encourage them to hire
jobless middle-aged or older workers, the subsidies given to the
jobless while receiving vocational training, and sponsoring job fairs
have shown good results and are worth further promotion.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL, KMT TOP AIDES TO DISCUSS HIGH-PROFILE MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Top aides of Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian and majority opposition Kuomintang party leader Lien
Chan are scheduled to meet Tuesday to thrash out details regarding an
impending meeting between Chen and Lien.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng was expected to call on
Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun at the Presidential Office
to settle the time and venue of the high-profile meeting, as well as
the issues to be discussed and the format the meeting is to take.</P>
      <P>According to KMT legislator Huang Hsiang-chou, Lien told him and
other KMT legislators during a meeting earlier in the day that he had
already left his schedule open for Thursday and Friday, and that he
wishes the meeting with Chen to be entirely open-door and to take
place in the Presidential Office during office hours.</P>
      <P>Yu told reporters later in the day that the Presidential Office
will be as open as possible and will try to accept all of Lien's
terms and conditions. He added that the office will respect Lien's
interest in showing sincerity, but that the KMT had not yet told him
explicitly about the three conditions regarding the venue, the time
and the open-door policy.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the reason for the requests is because the
public has the right to know and because it will prevent either side
from coming up with a conflicting version of the meeting afterward,
thereby raising cause for suspicion or causing an outbreak of "hidden
contentions" in the future.</P>
      <P>Huang went on to say that Lien wants the meeting to take place
during office hours at the Presidential Office because it is a formal
meeting that should not take place after office hours or in the
Taipei Guest House, as did the president's two previous meetings with
opposition party leaders.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he and the other legislators have suggested to
Lien that he should bring along officials who once served under the
KMT administration -- such as former Council for Economic Planning
and Development Chairman P.K. Chiang and former Mainland Affairs
Council Chairman Su Chi -- in order to present concrete
administrative advice at the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the topics to be discussed at the meeting
will include cross-strait issues, financial and economic issues, the
operation of constitutional government, the aims of post-quake
reconstruction and local government system reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA  URGED  TO  TREAD CAREFULLY WITH SOLOMON ISLANDS' DEMANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a visit to Taiwan by the Solomon
Islands prime minister scheduled for the end of this month,
legislators urged the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Monday to
tread carefully with regard to the issue of the country's repeated
demands for aid from the Republic of China government.</P>
      <P>Answering lawmakers' questions at a Legislative Yuan
interpellation session, Vice Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee said
MOFA takes great care of every penny of taxpayers' money that it
spends, but he added that the ROC has an obligation to help its
allies settle their internal disturbances. He added that MOFA has not
yet decided what kind of assistance will be offered.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yen Chin-fu (DPP-at large) said that the foreign aid
should be granted with wisdom. If the government approves the Solomon
Islands' repeated financial demands, he claimed, the government may
suffer a "double loss."</P>
      <P>Lee replied that although the Solomon Islands government has
demanded huge economic assistance from the ROC, Taipei has not
consent to their demands. He promised that future government
decisions will not disappoint the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hsien-jen (KMT-Taipei County) said that although
the Solomon Islands government has apologized to the ROC government
for an aggressively worded press statement in which it threatened to
seek ties with Beijing, it has already hurt the ROC's image. He
expressed the hope that other ROC allies will not follow Solomon
Islands' suit.</P>
      <P>David Lee replied that "lack of forbearance in small matters can
upset great plans. We will carefully observe it at first and then
take action," he added.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang (DPP) the government to take "drastic
measures" to halt Solomon Islands' repeated financial demands.</P>
      <P>Lee answered that as a diplomat, he should do whatever he can to
sustain the nation's interests. To this end, he said, he will suffer
all disgrace and insults in order to accomplish his task.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, asked who will replace Vice Premier Lai In-jaw at the
upcoming summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum in Brunei, Secretary-General to the President Yu
Shyi-kun said that President Chen Shui-bian will make a decision
within a couple of days.</P>
      <P>Yu did not rule out that Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
is one of the candidates who might be chosen by Chen to represent him
at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in answer to a question raised by Legislator
Chao Yung-ching (KMT-Taipei County) at the same interpellation
session.</P>
      <P>Chen had originally appointed Vice Premier Lai In-jaw to
represent him at the APEC summit meeting, but, yielding to pressure
from Beijing, Brunei demanded that the ROC send a lower-ranking
official or a leading entrepreneur in his place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERALL REVIEW NEEDED OF KOREAN PENINSULA TIES: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China needs panoramic,
comprehensive thinking to cope with relations with North and South
Korea, Vice Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Lee
said the Northeast Asian situation is changing rapidly following a
recent historic summit meeting between the leaders of long-feuding
North and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Lee said, Taiwan must make an overall
review of its relations with the two Koreas in order to craft new
strategies for dealing with the changing regional political climate.</P>
      <P>The ROC currently does not maintain diplomatic ties with either
North or South Korea, although Lee said the ROC has maintained
contact with North Korea through private channels.</P>
      <P>"Many legislators have also devoted much energy to helping
improve relations with Pyongyang over the past years," Lee said,
adding that the East Asian and Pacific Affairs Department of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has consistently paid close
attention to developments in Taipei-Pyongyang relations and has sent
officials to accompany delegations of legislators and business
executives on market-inspection tours of the reclusive Stalinist
state.</P>
      <P>As for relations with South Korea, Lee said direct airlinks have
not been resumed since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in
August 1992. The two countries have not yet established an
institutionalized consultative mechanism for trade and economic
consultations, he added.</P>
      <P>"We really need innovative and comprehensive thinking to seek
major breakthroughs in our relations with North and South Korea," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Asked about relations with Tibet, Lee said communication channels
between Taiwan and the Tibetan government-in-exile in northern India
have long existed and operate smoothly. Nevertheless, he went on, the
government has no immediate plans to set up a representative office
in Dharamsala, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is located.</P>
      <P>Touching on a planned visit to Taiwan by the Dalai Lama, the
exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, Lee said the government will grant
him an entry permit. In view of Beijing's sensitivity to engagements
between Taiwan and the Dalai Lama, Lee said, MOFA will handle the
Dalai Lama's visa application in a manner acceptable to the Tibetan
spiritual leader and in accordance with ROC law and relevant
regulations.</P>
      <P>Turning to the ROC's foreign aid policy, Lee said the ROC has
offered assistance to other countries in several different ways,
including technological cooperation, soft loans, encouraging Taiwan
businessmen to invest in countries that recognize the ROC, donations
of cash or merchandise, emergency relief and humanitarian aid.</P>
      <P>In fact, he continued, the government's budget for foreign aid is
limited, with the amount accounting for a mere 0.11 percent and 0.15
percent of Taiwan's gross national product (GNP) in 1998 and 1999,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Lee said MOFA will continue courting public support for a gradual
increase in the ROC's foreign aid ratio to 0.7 percent of its GNP,
the minimum level set by the United Nations for advanced countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPC EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE OIL PRICE HIKE TUESDAY</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) is likely to announce an increase in domestic gasoline and
diesel oil prices Tuesday amid soaring international oil prices,
sources close to the CPC said Monday.</P>
      <P>The international crude oil was US$33.21 per barrel Monday, with
the CPC's import costs between US$30 to US$31 per barrel.</P>
      <P>However, since the CPC's current oil prices correspond with its
last oil import cost -- between US$28 and US$29 per barrel -- CPC
officials said current domestic oil prices no longer reflect CPC
costs.</P>
      <P>The sources said the price hike will likely be NT$0.3 per liter
at most.</P>
      <P>After the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently scrapped the
implementation of unified oil prices in Taiwan, the CPC has
authorized its gas stations to implement more liberal oil prices
within a limit of NT$0.3 per liter to further elevate their
competitiveness among other private producers of petroleum products.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-based aviation companies are facing
cutthroat competition on domestic flight routes, as serious
oversupply has led to persistent business losses, according to local
industry sources.</P>
      <P>The recent suspension of fight services by the Far East Air
Transport Corp. (FAT) on the Taipei-Chiayi route is only the tip of
the iceberg, the sources said, adding that FAT's decision to
temporarily stop serving the route is an illustration that local
carriers are unable to continue taking care of public transport needs
as a result of a huge business crisis.</P>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautic Administration (CAA) in May ordered four
local airlines -- FAT, TransAsia Airways, Mandarin Airlines and UNI
Airlines -- to slash a total of more than 100 flights per week on the
Taipei-Kaohsiung route, in a bid to help secure public air traffic
safety to reduce operation costs for aviation companies amid the
vicious competition.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increasingly difficult domestic routes,
flights between Taiwan proper and offshore island destinations
constitute another major headache for the local aviation industry.
Carriers which operate flights to the Penghu islands, Green Island
and Orchid Island have claimed that they might not continue to
follow with the CAA's policy of serving those remote areas.</P>
      <P>Local aviation companies said government subsidies are not enough
to cover the overall losses they have sustained by operating the
offshore routes. Although they have cooperated with government policy
in serving these routes, they have complained that the CAA has failed
in turn to earmark international routes to them as a reward.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that demand for new domestic airports is still
running high, industry sources said subsequent developments remain
to be seen as all local aviation companies are busy trimming their
fleets as part of efforts to reduce costs.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait youth summit jointly
organized by Taiwan's Tamkang University and mainland China's Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences is tentatively scheduled to be held in
Beijing and Taipei in December and March, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Ming-yuan, director of the youth department of
the Republic of China's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
the students attending the summit will mainly discuss public issues
of concern to contemporary youth and will not exclude political
issues from their talks.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, political reality dictates that the DPP cannot
officially organize the summit because mainland China cannot accept
his party's pro-independence platform. Therefore, he went on, the
summit's Taiwan organizers will be private foundations and Tamkang
University's Institute of Mainland Studies, while the DPP will only
play a catalytic role.</P>
      <P>Wang, who visited Beijing last week to work out the details of
the summit with Yu Keli, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan
Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the
academy will select its mainland delegates from various celebrated
mainland Chinese centers of learning such as Peking University,
Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, and Shanghai's Fudan

rights commission, studying human rights policy proposals, taking
part in international human rights activities, promoting human
rights education and reviewing Taiwan's human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lu announced the 21-member roster of the new

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility that domestic electricity
prices will be increased due to the suspension of construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant is very slim, a high-ranking economic
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), made the comment to reporters at the
Ministry of Economic Affairs while attending a preparatory meeting
for an upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit
in Brunei.</P>
      <P>Chen said that plans for substitutes for the fourth nuclear power
plant, such as natural gas- or coal-fired power plants, greatly
reduce the possibility that domestic electricity prices will be
raised.</P>
      <P>He elaborated that in the past, the thermal efficiency of natural
gas-fired plants was only 30 percent, but the figure today can be
expected to be raised to 60 percent. The cost of coal for power
generation is also lower than the cost of fuel for nuclear power
plants, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that at present, Taiwan is not subject to regulation by
the international convention on the control of carbon dioxide
emissions.</P>
      <P>Chen also cited a European Union (EU) resolution passed last year
that says EU member nations cannot ease carbon dioxide emissions by
building nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan should not confuse the fourth nuclear power
plant issue with the decrease of carbon dioxide emissions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>5 HOGS CONFIRMED TO HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH FMD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The specter of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
returned to Taiwan when five hogs in northern Taiwan were confirmed
to have been affected with the disease, the Council of Agriculture
(COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health, Inspection and Quarantine, said that a veterinarian stationed
at a slaughter house in Taoyuan County a day earlier found five hogs
awaiting slaughter that he suspected might have been infected with
FMD.</P>
      <P>The suspect animals were immediately killed and specimens taken
for further examination revealed that they had been infected with
o-type FMD, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials were reported to be embarking on a large-scale
tracking operation of the source of the infected hogs and to have
begun quarantining livestock in areas neighboring the abattoir.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials killed tens of thousands of hogs in the wake of
a large outbreak of FMD three years ago, dealing a huge blow to its
pork export industry and almost decimating the hog raising industry.</P>
      <P>Further cases have since been reported, but nothing as serious as
the 1997 outbreak, thanks largely to the government's rigorous
enforcement of a vaccination campaign in hog farms islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOPE FOR PRO-TAIWAN BILL DIMS IN US CONGRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With just one week left before the
adjournment of the U.S. Congress and two weeks to go before the Nov.
7 election of lawmakers, hopes for a bill aimed at strengthening
military ties with Taiwan seem dim, Congress sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Although backers of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA)
are expected to push for its approval again in the next Congress
session, its passage will hinge on whether its leading sponsor -- the
Republican Party -- can control Capitol Hill and win the White House
in the presidential election which will be held along with the
congressional election on Nov. 7.</P>
      <P>Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush has declared his
support for the TSEA, while the Democrats Al Gore is following the
line of the Clinton administration and speaking out against it.</P>
      <P>The act, which passed the House of the Representatives
overwhelmingly by 341 to 70 on Feb. 1, has been shelved ever since
its arrival in the Senate.</P>
      <P>In light of the fact that several appropriation bills are pending
in the Senate over the next few days, and because the Democratic
senators are not enthusiastic about the act, it is absolutely
impossible that it will be put on the agenda before the adjournment,
according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The sources, who are aides to senators backing the bill, also
ruled out the possibility of dismantling the act and tacking its
provisions separately on to the end of related appropriation bills.</P>
      <P>Technically, Congress, which officially ended its term in
January, may reconvene to proceed with unfinished bills, but the
chances of a lame-duck Congress debating such a controversial bill is
almost non-existent unless there are dramatic changes in the
stability prevailing across the Taiwan Strait, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Government officials argue that closer military ties with Taipei
called for in the TSEA would tilt the delicate balance Washington
takes pains to maintain between Taipei and Beijing and thereby
jeopardize Taiwan's security by triggering an angry response from
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan's security is well ensured under the
existing legal framework, the officials threatened to recommend that
the president veto the TSEA if it should be passed by the Senate.</P>
      <P>The act was introduced to the Senate in March by Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, a Republican from North Carolina, and
to the House in May by Representative Robert Torricelli, a Democrat
from New Jersey.</P>
      <P>In addition to closer military exchanges with Taiwan, the
original bill also provided for the sale of Aegis missile destroyers
to Taiwan. But this part was eliminated from the final version before
it passed through the House of Representatives in February.</P>
      <P>The Senate replaced its own version with the House's act after it
cleared the House of Representatives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PRESIDENT'S CHANCE TO VISIT JAPAN SAID SLIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chances of former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui visiting Japan this year are "almost hopeless"
after the Japanese sponsor of a seminar revealed that Lee intended to
apply for a Japanese visa, a major Japanese newspaper said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Sankei Shinbum said that Japanese Senator Masakuni Murakami
told the former ROC president during a visit to Taiwan in
mid-September that the timing for Lee's visit to Japan was not right
at that time, adding that he hoped Lee would not attend an Asian
Outlook Forum conference scheduled at the end of the month in
Matsumoto. Lee responded by saying that he hoped to visit Japan at
another date in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>Murakami, who is now the vice president of the Japan-ROC
Dietmen's Council, a supra-party group in the Japanese parliament,
then began maneuvering quietly and cautiously to try to create an
environment favorable a visit to Japan by Lee later in the year.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reported that sources related to the council had
originally planned to travel to Taipei last Saturday to exchange
views with the former president on his visit, but as Japanese
sponsors of Asian Outlook announced last Wednesday that Lee was to
apply for a visa, the issue had aroused attention and drew an
immediate strong reaction from Beijing.</P>
      <P>As Japanese Foreign Ministry became more cautious over the issue,
the Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council had to suspend and review the
planning of Lee's visit. The chances of Lee's visiting Japan at the
end of the year are now "almost zero," according to the newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Asian Outlook Forum was founded by a group of Taiwanese and
Japanese scholars and senior business executives 12 years ago to
promote substantive ROC-Japanese relations.</P>
      <P>Over the subsequent years, the forum has held its annual
conference alternately in Japan and Taiwan. As Lee ended his 12-year
stint as the ROC head of the state in May, the forum has decided to
disband after its 2000 annual conference and it had been hoped that
he would attend.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of Beijing's diplomatic squeezing of
Taiwan, returned to Taiwan Sunday after attending the fourth Forum
2000 conference in Prague on the roles of science, education and
religion in globalization. Forum 2000 is a think tank jointly founded
by Czech President Vaclav Havel and a private Japanese foundation in
1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FAMILY REFUSES COMPENSATION FROM MAINLAND CHINESE MURDERERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The family of a Taiwanese councilor killed
in a botched kidnap attempt during a trip to mainland China in 1998
rejected compensation Monday from her mainland Chinese murderers.</P>
      <P>Lin Ping-hui, father of murdered Kaohsiung City councilwoman Lin
Ti-chuan, told a press conference that he decided to forsake his
right to demand cash compensation from his daughter's mainland
murderers for "humanitarian reasons."</P>
      <P>According to rulings by mainland China's Anshan Intermediate
People's Court and the Liaoning People's High Court, the four
convicted mainland murderers must jointly compensate the Lin family
452,000 renminbi (about US$54,603) in addition to receiving criminal
sentences.</P>
      <P>The mainland courts meted out harsh sentences for the four
convicts -- Yang Rongsung was given the death sentence; Huang
Shihdong was sentenced to life imprisonment; Zao Chuang was given a
15-year jail term; and Zhang Shihfeng was sentenced to 14 years.</P>
      <P>Chang Ken-ming, the Lin family's lawyer, said the mainland court
verdicts allow the Lin family to seek compensation by applying for
the confiscation of the houses of the four convicts or other property
belonging to them.</P>
      <P>"As such a move would increase the plights of the families of the
four murderers, the Lin family has decided to forsake its civil
lawsuit claim for compensation," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Lin Ti-chuan, a member of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), was kidnapped during a trip to the
northeastern mainland province of Liaoning in July 1998. Her captors
repeatedly injected her with sedatives, resulting in an overdose that
killed her at an age of 32.</P>
      <P>The DPP, now the Republic of China's ruling party, issued a
statement Monday praising the Lin family's leniency. It also
recognized the mainland law enforcement officers' efforts to bring
the murderers to justice.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the DPP expressed its regret that the mastermind
behind Lin's abduction, identified as Li Guangzhi, remains at large.
"We hope mainland law enforcement authorities will make continued
efforts to arrest the suspected mastermind," it added.</P>
      <P>The DPP also called on mainland Chinese authorities to strengthen
law and order and take effective measures to protect the safety and
legitimate rights of Taiwan people traveling or doing business on the
mainland. "We hope similar tragic cases will never happen again," it
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC URGED TO ONLY BUY PORK THAT HAS MET GOV'T SAFETY STANDARDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official at the Council of Agriculture
Tuesday urged the public to only buy pork that has passed government
safety standards after new foot-and-mouth disease cases were reported
in northern Taiwan for the first time in 18 months.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, director of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health, Inspection, and Quarantine, noted that the bureau began on
Oct. 4 to implement the scheme of stamping the surface of pork from
legal slaughterhouses that had passed meat sanitation requirements.
He said the system was put in place to protect the consumer's safety.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the bureau has also assigned an additional 150-plus
veterinarians to slaughterhouses and meat freezing plants around the
island since July to further ensure the safety of meat for the
consumer market.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks after five hogs waiting to be slaughtered at
a meat freezing plant in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan were found Sunday
to have been infected with FMD. The hogs were then immediately put
down.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that the latent period of FMD in pigs after
they have been infected is usually two to three days, adding that
during that period, the infected hogs will not exhibit any symptoms
of the disease. They also said that the hogs detected to have FMD
this time had passed examinations at the meat market and were only
found to have the disease during tests at the meat freezing plant.</P>
      <P>COA officials began quarantining livestock in areas neighboring
the meat freezing plant immediately after detection. They
initially traced the origin of the infected hogs back to Yunlin,
central Taiwan. The hog owner, surnamed Wu, trucked a load of 50
hogs, including the 5 infected ones, to the meat market in Taoyuan on
Friday, the officials said.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the reappearance of new FMD cases was due to
hog growers' lax attitude toward vaccination or to the illegal trade
in sick or dead pigs in disregard of the rights of consumers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan slaughtered tens of thousands of hogs in the wake of a
large outbreak of FMD three years ago, dealing a serious blow to its
pork export industry and almost totally decimating the local hog
raising industry.</P>
      <P>Further cases have since been reported, but nothing as serious as
the 1997 outbreak has occurred, thanks in large part to the
government's rigorous enforcement of vaccination requirements at hog
farms islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRATIZATION IMPORTANT TO CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The democratization of Taiwan holds out
a model for mainland China's possible political transition toward a
more pluralistic society, which in the end is the most fundamental
requirement for peacefully resolving cross-strait differences, noted
two American experts Monday.</P>
      <P>Bates Gill, director of the Brookings Center for Northeast Asian
Studies, and Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow in the Brookings Foreign
Policy Studies program, stated in an article they co-authored in the
latest issue of the Brookings Review that now, as for much of the
past 50 years, Taiwan is the hottest potential flash point in
U.S.-PRC security relations.</P>
      <P>"A more confident Taiwan, increasingly aware of its
`separateness' from the mainland, has prompted Chinese reactions that
are at best inflexible and dismissive of the changed circumstances
and at worst provocative and potentially dangerous in the face of new
realities," they said.</P>
      <P>A top priority for the new U.S. administration, the experts
emphasized, should be to revisit American policies toward the
U.S.-PRC-Taiwan triangle.</P>
      <P>"The fundamental U.S. interest remains unchanged -- to avoid war
in the Taiwan Straits. Washington should oppose any unilateral and
unprovoked declaration of independence on the part of Taiwan, as well
as any use of force by China against Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Beyond this fundamental baseline for U.S. policy, the two authors
added, several other steps are necessary. First, the next
administration will need to help build on and strengthen what
hopeful, though cautious, momentum has been generated in the wake of
Chen Shui-bian's election. It should urge both sides to devise new
ways to enable direct bilateral negotiations, economic interactions,
cultural exchanges, and confidence-building measures to proceed more
freely.</P>
      <P>Second, the new administration will very early in its tenure face
some key decisions on Taiwan arms sales, especially regarding missile
defense for the island. The United States should maintain its
intention of equipping Taiwan to defend itself against potential
Communist Chinese coercion and military threats as long as Beijing
holds out the use of force as a possible means of resolving its
differences with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Armed with this understanding, they said, "providing lower-tier,
land-based missile defenses to Taiwan is consistent with U.S.
commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act and is entirely
appropriate given China's continuing buildup of short- and
medium-range missiles opposite Taiwan. Other follow-on sales of more
capable missile defenses should await far more study of their
diplomatic and military-technical implications."</P>
      <P>The experts continued that the United States should also urge
Taiwan to be more serious in developing its "passive defenses" --
such as hardening its command posts, shelters, and other key
facilities -- to better withstand a possible Communist Chinese
ballistic missile attack.</P>
      <P>U.S. policy needs to operate on the understanding that the
continued maturation of democracy in Taiwan "presents a small,
sensitive, but nonetheless hopeful opportunity for the cross-strait
relationship," they said.</P>
      <P>"Caution and careful diplomacy here are critical: `support for
democratization' cannot be equated with `support for independence.'
But the next administration must earnestly and actively acknowledge
the growing centrality of democratization to the Taiwan question,"
they concluded.</P>

      <P>In the wake of Washington's unveiling of
plans for a new international forum aimed at improving security in
Northeast Asia, Mainland China stated it does not want any
confrontation with the United States regarding the issue of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech at the National Press Club in Canberra on Monday, Dr.
Morton Halperin, director of policy planning in the U.S. State
Department, said mainland China complained about U.S. interference in
the Taiwan problem because Beijing regards it as an internal affair.
But at the same time, he noted that Beijing needs U.S. support for
the "one-China" policy in resolving the issue.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the new forum, Halperin said it will be comprised of
the United States, Mainland China, Russia, Japan, and both North and
South Korea, saying the purpose of the forum is to improve security
across the potentially explosive northern Asian region. The issue of
Taiwan is expected to be excluded from the forum.</P>
      <P>He said Washington believes that solving Northeast Asia's
problems requires a separate multilateral forum as other forums,
including the ASEAN Regional Forum, have proven inadequate in this
regard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIBERAL INTERNATIONAL TO DISCUSS DRAFT RESOLUTION ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By S.C CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liberals from around the world will
discuss, among other things, a draft resolution on Taiwan when they
meet in Ottawa, Canada Oct. 26-28.</P>
      <P>The draft resolution, proposed by the Dutch Group of Liberal
International, welcomes the election of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu
as president and vice president of the Republic of China respectively
as a decisive step on the path toward full democracy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taking notice of the inaugural speech of President Chen in which
he stated that he will not take the initiative in changing the
present status of Taiwan, and acknowledging the significant
political, legal, and economic progress made in mainland China over
the last several years, the document calls for a resumption of
cross-strait dialogue that will lead to enhanced co-operation between
the two sides based on respect for human rights and democratic
principles.</P>
      <P>The proposal rejects any suggestion that the political status quo
in Taiwan can be changed in any way other than by the consent of its
inhabitants, and it calls upon the international community to
strengthen its ties with both mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It finally calls upon political parties within the Liberal
International to work together closely with Taiwan's Democratic
Progressive Party in defending democracy on the island.</P>
      <P>Delegates from over 60 countries, including two from Taiwan's
DPP, will attend the three-day congress. The two delegates from
Taiwan will be Chia-wen Yao and I-Chung Lai. Yao, also a presidential
advisor, will meet with Taiwan expats in Montreal before coming to
Ottawa for the Liberal International congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN, KMT CHAIR TO MEET FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The much-anticipated meeting between
President Chen Shui-bian and majority opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan will be held Friday at the Presidential Office,
Secretary-General to the President Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the announcement after meeting with KMT
Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng.</P>
      <P>Yu said President Chen originally planned to pay a visit to Lien
at the KMT headquarters near the Presidential Office. However, Lien
expressed his wish to meet Chen at the Presidential Office to show
his respect for the country's head of state.</P>
      <P>"President Chen then accepts Lien's suggestions concerning the
venue and format for their meeting to signify his sincerity to seek
advice from opposition party leaders," Yu said, adding that the
meeting will start at 10 a.m. and be entirely open-door.</P>
      <P>As for the agenda, Yu said President Chen will impose no limits
on topics to be raised and discussed during his meeting with Lien,
also a former vice president.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Chen expects to exchange views with Lien on
relations across the Taiwan Strait, financial and economic issues,
post-earthquake reconstruction, inter-party cooperation and
eradication of "black gold" politics or shady connections between
politics and organized crime.</P>
      <P>Yu and Deputy Secretary-General to the President Chen Tseh-nan
as well as KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng and spokesman Jason
Hu will also be present at the high-profile Chen-Lien meeting.</P>
      <P>This will be the first meeting between Chen and Lien after the
March 18 presidential election, in which Lien ended third by
garnering 23 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Lien himself said Tuesday that he hopes to discuss issues
related to the country's constitutional system during his meeting
with Chen, the Republic of China's first president from the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"This is a fundamental issue related to the operation of our
overall political system and governing mechanism," Lien explained,
adding that he has no plans to raise proposals concerning the
formation of a coalition government.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20, still
controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan, while the ruling
DPP controls slightly less than one-third of the legislative seats.
Against this background, some legislators and political observers
have pitched for the formation of a coalition government to ensure
smooth government operations and maintain domestic stability.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the proposal, Lien said what the KMT is concerned
is the nation's well-being and constitutional system, not
acquisition of government posts. "Therefore, we have no interest in
talking about the coalition government issues during Friday's talks
with the president," he added.</P>
      <P>As for financial and economic topics, Lien said he will focus on
major policy issues and will present feasible strategies to help
resolve current financial market woes.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to end squabbles and promote rapprochement
and cooperation among major domestic political parties, President
Chen held closed-door meetings with the top leaders of two other
opposition parties -- People First Party Chairman James Soong and New
Party leader Hao Lung-pin -- last week.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSTRUCTION ON TAIWAN'S 4TH NUKE PLANT BEHIND SCHEDULE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ongoing construction on Taiwan's fourth
nuclear power plant has lagged behind schedule due to the belief that
the new government is in favor of scrapping the project, according to
Ouyang Min-sheng, vice chairman of the Atomic Energy Council.</P>
      <P>Despite the adverse effects of the government's anti-nuclear
stance on the morale of the project crew, Ouyang said Tuesday during
the 10th inspection tour of the construction site by an environmental
protection supervisory committee that state-run Taiwan Power Company
will continue to strive to stay on schedule and will not purposely
slow down its progress.</P>
      <P>A senior Taipower official noted that the project should be 38
percent complete at this stage but is presently only 33 percent
complete, adding that if the government were to decide to finish the
project, the date of completion would be delayed by six to 10 months.</P>
      <P>Ouyang, who is a member of the traditionally anti-nuclear ruling
party, said that his council cannot take on either a pro-nuclear or
anti-nuclear stance and has consistently supervised the project from
a professional point of view.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Taipower has been under a lot of pressure
to make sure it upholds a high standard of quality in its
construction project under the supervision of anti-nuclear
organizations, environmental protection groups, and his council. He
added that the public can therefore be assured of its safety.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Democratic Progressive Party, Ouyang said that
he is naturally highly rebellious and resolutely against autocratic
decision-making, adding that a fair evaluation should be made on the
issue of the plant's fate. As a government official, however, he
added that he will have to carry out orders according to the
Cabinet's policy.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has yet to announce a decision on the future of the
nuclear plant, but Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi has already made a
recommendation to halt the project following an evaluation by his
ministry that many believe led to the resignation early this month of
the then premier Tang Fei -- a stalwart of the pro-nuclear Kuomintang
-- for his unwillingness to endorse the recommendation. The official
stated reason for Tang's resignation was his ailing health.</P>
      <P>Lin, ironically also a member of the KMT, has been stripped of
his party membership for turning against the party's pro-nuclear
platform.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the opposition parties, including the
KMT, the People First Party, and the New Party, arrived at a
consensus Tuesday to urge Premier Chang Chun-hsiung to make a
declaration on the Cabinet's stance toward the project before the
government budget for fiscal year 2001 enters final evaluations at
the end of the month.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP legislative caucus disagreed with using the
budget proposal as a "hostage" to "threaten" the Cabinet into making
an announcement on the ultimate fate of the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>The KMT pointed out that if the Cabinet is not planning to go
ahead with the legislature-approved budget for the nuclear power
plant, then "what use is there for evaluating the next budget?"</P>
      <P>The DPP has argued that approved budgets for the plant can be
simply withheld in times of "national emergency," but the KMT
maintains that the case can only be overturned in the legislature by
another vote to halt the plant's construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATORS CALL FOR DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT SHIPPING LINKS SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ten legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party on Tuesday urged the government tration to promote
the implementation of direct shipping links between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait immediately.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislators Su Huan-chih, Wong Chin-chu, Wang Tuoh, Perng
Shaw-jin, Ho Chia-jong, Wang hsueh-fung, Yang chiu-hsing, Tang
Jinn-chuan, Chung Chin-chiang, and Chiu Tai-san appealed for the
immediate planning of direct transport links during a press
conference. They called on the government not to wait until both
Taipei and Beijing have joined the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Legislator Su said he has "mixed feeling" about proposing direct
cross-strait shipping links as a member of the pro-independence DPP,
but as this is the only viable solution to Taiwan's economic
difficulties and is the key to Taiwan's globalization, as well as the
most important step toward cross-strait reconciliation, he added that
he has to make the proposal based on his conscience.</P>
      <P>The substantive measures they asked the Executive Yuan to
implement in the near future include the opening of cross-strait
passenger shipping services, direct cross-strait telecommunications
services, and the speedy construction of international airports in
southern and central Taiwan. They also requested that mainland China
open ports in Shanghai, Guangzhou and elsewhere for direct shipping
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-tung, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council,
said at the press conference that direct trade, postal, and transport
links across the Taiwan Strait and the "mini three direct links"
between Taiwan's offshore islands and mainland China are the goals of
the new government.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as there is a risk management mechanism in
place, then increased trade and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait will be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Chen said the new government has also felt the growing pressure
with the passage of time for the establishment of such links, but he
added that simply rushing things is not the way to proceed and that
these goals should be accomplished according to legal procedures.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a
land warning Tuesday for tropical storm Yagi, the 19th tropical
cyclone to affect the Pacific region this year, as it gathered
strength and was poised to strike Taiwan the following day.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB, Yagi's position as of 2 p.m. Tuesday was
approximately 570 kilometers east of Taiwan, headed west at 19
kilometers per hour, with maximum sustained winds near its center of
28 meters per second and gusts of up to 35 meter per second.</P>
      <P>Forecasters predicted that if Yagi stays on its current course,
its center will pass through Taiwan. Yagi's current storm radius is
150 kilometers, but the CWB predicts that its area of influence will
grow.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged the public to beware of torrential rain expected
to reach a peak from Wednesday afternoon to Thursday and warned
people living in mountain areas to beware of mudslides and flash
floods.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, typhoons and tropical storms hitting Taiwan later
than September have had devastating effects on the island when
combined with winter's northeast monsoon, which brings steady rain to
the windward (northeastern) side of the island.</P>
      <P>Although Yagi is smaller than most "autumn typhoons" -- the most
recent and damaging of which struck Taiwan in 1998 -- the CWB warned
that the public should still take care.</P>
      <P>Typhoons Zeb and Babs hit the island back-to-back in mid- and
late-October of 1998. Zeb caused 28 deaths and agricultural losses
totaling NT$5.16 billion (US$161 million), while Babs caused three
deaths and agricultural losses of NT$400 million.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 46.6 percent of residents in central
Taiwan's Nantou county are dissatisfied with the Nantou county
government's reconstruction efforts, a poll showed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Nantou's public opinion center conducted the survey to learn the
attitude of the county's residents over one year after the magnitude
7.3 earthquake hit Taiwan Sept. 21 last year. Nantou bore the brunt
of the devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>Although only 33.5 percent of the poll respondents said they are
content with the progress of reconstruction, most gave high marks to
the private groups participating in the effort.</P>
      <P>The areas that residents are most dissatisfied with are efforts
toward the reconstruction of roads and bridges, the prevention of
mudslides, and the reconstruction of homes and schools.</P>
      <P>Forty-five percent of those surveyed said they believe that it
may take between three and 20 years for Nantou to return to the state
it was in before the killer temblor struck.</P>
      <P>In addition, although city and county chief elections are still
more than a year away, the poll found that only 16.8 percent of the
residents would support the reelection of incumbent Nantou Magistrate
Pang Pai-hsien, compared with the support rating of 31.8 percent he
received in the last election.</P>
      <P>Some 36.5 percent of the respondents said they won't support
Pang's reelection, and 45 percent said that they are still undecided.</P>
      <P>The center called 1,154 people and received 735 valid samples.
The poll's margin of error is 3.6 percent, according to its authors.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN VOWS TO WIPE OUT NON-ECONOMIC BARRIERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hualien,  Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday his
administration will do its utmost to wipe out non-economic barriers
to Taiwan's sustainable economic development by promoting
inter-party and cross-Taiwan Strait reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Chen made the pledge while addressing students and faculty
members at National Dong Hwa University in the eastern Taiwan county
of Hualien.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is convinced that reconciliation among major
domestic political parties and between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait can gradually remove non-economic barriers to Taiwan's
economic development.</P>
      <P>Noting that his recent meetings with the top leaders of major
opposition parties were first steps to forge inter-party
rapprochement and reconciliation, Chen said he will make continued
efforts to improve inter-party relations to ensure smooth government
operations and upgrade administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said his administration will continue sparing
no efforts to seek a breakthrough to the long-stalled relations
across the Taiwan Strait. "We believe a thaw in cross-strait
relations will help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific region and
clear away non-economic obstacles to our economic development," he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen, the Republic of China's first president from the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said his
administration has given the top priority to sustaining the
island's economic development.</P>
      <P>"We have unveiled many measures to revive domestic economic
vitality and will continue working out strategies to help local
enterprises expand their business empire while keeping business
roots in Taiwan," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>After an inspection tour of the Dong Hwa University's
biotechnology development center, Chen said he hopes the center can
help boost the development of biotechnology industry and overall
economy in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Quoting government tallies, Chen said Taiwan's annual
biotechnology industry production amounted to NT$16.2 billion
(US$514.29 million) in 1998 and is expected to reach NT$90 billion by
2006. "We believe that the Dong Hwa University biotech center will
play a leading role in bolstering Taiwan's biotechnology
development and upgrading eastern Taiwan's overall economic
development," he explained.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Chen inspected an eastern Taiwan railway
improvement project aimed at modernizing the 337 km-railway
comprising the Ilan line, North Link line and the Hualien-Taitung
line.</P>
      <P>Chen demanded that the renovation project, launched in July
1991, be completed in June 2003 as scheduled. Chen said the
NT$48.64 billion project is expected to help facilitate exploration
of resources in eastern Taiwan and balance development in eastern
and western parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The improvements will include electrification, double tracks,
heavy rails, a centralized traffic control system, new locomotives,
repair facilities and the relocation of the Hualien depot.</P>
      <P>President Chen also paid a visit to Mennonite Hospital in
Hualien before ending his eastern Taiwan inspection tour. Chen was
briefed on the hospital's elderly people long-term medical services
and community daycare programs.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his admiration for the Christian hospital's
contribution to the upgrading of medical services in eastern Taiwan,
particularly in remote aboriginal communities, over past decades.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPLIED MATERIAL EXECUTIVE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Global demand for semiconductors will
remain strong, and the outlook for the industry is bright, a United
States-based industry leader said recently.</P>
      <P>Ashok K. Sinha, president of the Interconnect Systems and Modules
Business Group under the U.S.-based Applied Material, told CNA that
he wholeheartedly agrees with remarks made by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company (TSMC) Chairman Morris Chang that there will
be no cloud to cast a shadow over the semiconductor industry's future
in the coming 20 years.</P>
      <P>Sinha, however, pointed out that an increasing lack of
semiconductor devices such as resistors and capacitors will be the
prime obstacle facing the industry in the future.</P>
      <P>He also warned that mainland China may pose a major threat to
Taiwan within three years if Taiwan fails to integrate its expertise
and management experience with mainland companies and the island
fails to obtain a leadership role in the sector.</P>
      <P>Following is the full text of the interview with Sinha:</P>
      <P>Q: As more and more companies have joined the rush to build
plants to produce 12-inch silicon wafers, do you think that will lead
to a problem of oversupply?</P>
      <P>A: I am not worried about this problem at all. The marketing of
12-inch wafers is aimed at reducing production costs and increasing
the output of chips to meet market demand. I think that demand for
semiconductors will continue to grow quickly due to new types of
applications of the Internet, cellular phones, digital televisions,
and consumer electronic products. Demand will still surpass supply in
the market.</P>
      <P>There are three major noteworthy trends in the coming century.
First, the approach of the 0.1 micron process; second, the
development of copper interconnectors; and third, the replacement of
8-inch silicon wafers with 12-inch types.</P>
      <P>According to Moore's Law, each three-year period represents a
generation in the semiconductor process, while the development of
semiconductors' size usually takes 10 years from one size to another.
The development of new processing materials, such as the use of
copper to make interconnectors, may take 30 years.</P>
      <P>The occurrence of all three events in this century will have a
significant impact on the development of the semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>The plants which are being built at the moment -- most of which
are 12-inch wafer production facilities -- will start mass production
next year, and I predict that the output of 12-inch wafers will
account for more than 50 percent of the world's total silicon wafer
production within five years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the technology of copper interconnectors is also
expected to become a leading trend in five years. The technology will
be extensively applied in highly efficient and low power-consumption
chips. With regard to the 0.1 micron process, the technology will be
still some way off in five years, as lithography remains a very
difficult technology.

    <HEADLINE>APPLIED MATERIAL EXECUTIVE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Q: Is there any concrete proof to support your theory that demand
for semiconductors will continue to remain strong?</P>
      <P>A: Production value of the global electronics industry will
exceed the level of US$1 trillion for the first time to reach US$1.35
trillion this year, up a record 7 percent from the level posted in
1999.</P>
      <P>Demand for personal computers is expected to hit 1.4 billion
units across the world this year, while global output of mobile
phones is estimated at 4 billion units. The output of the world
semiconductor sector will be worth US$195.8 billion in 2000,
accounting for 18.9 percent of the entire electronics industry.</P>
      <P>A booming electronics industry will also drive the semiconductor
sector to continued growth, as capitalization spending in the
semiconductor industry is forecast to increase by 68.8 percent this
year, also a historic high.</P>
      <P>Q: Do you agree with the remarks made by TSMC Chairman Morris
Chang that "there will be no cloud overshadowing the future of the
semiconductor industry in the 20 years ahead?" Do you think that such
worries really do not exist in light of an analysis made by Salomon
Smith Barney in July this year that offers a negative view of the
industry's future?</P>
      <P>A: I do agree with Chang's remarks, and I am optimistic about the
prospects for the semiconductor industry. Stock analysts only set
their eyes on short-term profits. Judging from a long-term basis, I
believe that there will not be an oversupply of semiconductors,
demand for which will jump noticeably as a result of many new
Internet-related applications.</P>
      <P>As to the looming lack of devices such as capacitors and
resistors, I think this situation will deteriorate next year, because
increased production of these elements takes time. As the
semiconductor sector is a closely integrated industry, up-stream and
down-stream companies rely heavily on one another. That means a lack
of certain devices will affect the entire production process, even
though many orders are already in the works.</P>
      <P>Q: As global capital expenditure in the semiconductor industry is
estimated to hit a record high of US$55.1 billion this year -- a 27.1
percent rise over 1999 -- do you think that will have an impact on
Taiwan's status in this sector? What do you think of the world's
capital movements next year?</P>
      <P>A: Taiwan capital spending will account for 20 percent of the
world's total expenditure in this sector this year, making the island
probably the world's second-largest investor after the United States.
I have predicted that the world's capital allocation will slow down
in 2001 and increase by a moderate 28 percent.</P>
      <P>However, global spending in DRAM is likely to expand markedly
next year as world demand for DRAM will continue to grow due to a
recovering world economy and the development of electronics products.
After a two-year halt in investment in this field, Japan and South
Korea are expected to largely expand their DRAM output in 2001, a
move which may worsen business conditions in 2002.</P>
      <P>Q: What is your opinion about an ongoing mainland China
investment fever among Taiwan businesses, as many local semiconductor
makers have relocated to the mainland. Do you think that mainland
China's semiconductor industry will threaten the local sector?</P>
      <P>A: Taiwan is strong in manufacturing and business management. If
Taiwan can share its expertise and experience with mainland China,
coupled with the mainland's production capabilities, then Taiwan will
be able to achieve a leadership role in the world's semiconductor
industry.</P>
      <P>In my judgment, the mainland's semiconductor industry is likely
to pose a threat to the Taiwan industry within three years should
Taiwan fail to seize the present opportunity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUILD ROC INTO `PERFECT DEMOCRACY,' URGES PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the people
of Taiwan Tuesday to work together to develop the Republic of China
into a country characterized by perfect democracy, rule of law and
human rights.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in a keynote speech delivered at the
inaugural ceremony for the President's Advisory Group on Human
Rights.</P>
      <P>Noting that human rights, rule of law and democracy are the three
pillars of a modern country, Chen said protection of human rights is
a measurement of the legitimacy of a constitutional democracy.</P>
      <P>"I'm hopeful that the ROC can become a country blessed with
perfect democracy, rule of law and human rights through concerted
efforts of all residents on the island," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He expressed his admiration and respect for people of Taiwan who
have been jailed or endured other suffering in the name of promoting
Taiwan's democratization and human rights development.</P>
      <P>Quoting Bo Yang, a noted writer who spent some 10 years in jail
for his commitment to democracy on the island during the era of
martial law, Chen said past mistakes can be tolerated and forgiven,
but should not be forgotten.</P>
      <P>"Those who forget previous mistakes are likely to repeat their
past wrongdoings. We must explore, record and reflect on past events,
learn lessons from previous mistakes and continue moving forward,"
Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>As human rights form the core and basis of a constitutional
country, Chen went on, Taiwan must address human rights issues on
three dimensions.</P>
      <P>First of all, he said, Taiwan should promote human rights
consciousness and education at various levels, from schools to
on-the-job training for public functionaries and professionals.</P>
      <P>Second, Chen said, Taiwan must introduce international human
rights standards to upgrade its human rights concepts and guideposts.</P>
      <P>Third, he continued, Taiwan must enshrine a comprehensive human
rights protection and promotional mechanism.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first president from the Democratic Progressive
Party, further said that his professional experience as a lawyer has
made him fully aware that human rights protection cannot solely rely
on law, because no matter how perfect legal regulations are, they
leave room more or less for law enforcement officers to act on their
discretion.</P>
      <P>"How this discretion is exercised hinges on law enforcement
officers' human rights concepts and standards," Chen said, adding
that he hopes Taiwan can set up a human rights research center to
upgrade its overall human rights standards.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC completed its first-ever peaceful transition
of power between different political parties in May, Chen said he is
hopeful that the formation of the new human rights advisory group
will facilitate the promotion of human rights education, legislation
and policy formulation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice President Annette Lu, who
concurrently serves as chief convener of the human rights advisory
group, said the group will dedicate itself to defending the dignity
and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was once jailed for her pro-democracy activities during
the martial law era, said the period from Dec. 4-10 will be
designated as Taiwan's "human rights week," when a series of seminars
and exhibitions will be held in major cities around the island to
promote human rights education.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing the formation of the advisory
panel unveiled by Chen in September, the main missions of the group
will include promoting legislation of a national human rights bill
and the establishment of a national human rights commission, studying
human rights policy proposals, taking part in international human
rights activities, promoting human rights education and reviewing
Taiwan's human rights conditions.</P>
      <P>The group is composed of 21 members noted for their expertise in
human rights and contributions to Taiwan's human rights development.
The members include Bo Yang; lawyer Yu Mei-nu; Chai Sung-lin,
president of the Chinese Human Rights Association; Ho Teh-fen, a
National Taiwan University law professor; Catholic Cardinal Paul
Shan; Providence University professor Hsu Shih-kai; and Taiwan News
President Yang Hsien-hung.</P>
      <P>The group will hold a plenary session every four months, and if
necessary, the chief convener can call extraordinary meetings. The
members will be divided into six panels, each of which can hold
working meetings at any time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DEPUTY REPRESENTATIVE TO U.S. TO ASSUME POST NOV. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   24   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's newly appointed deputy
representative to the United States, Lee Ying-yuan, is scheduled to
leave Friday for Washington, D.C. to assume his post.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Lee, a Democratic Progressive
Party legislator before being appointed to the deputy representative
post, said his top priority in his new job in the U.S. capital is to
accelerate exchanges of visits by ministerial-level officials from
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>If the two countries cannot exchange visits by ministerial-level
officials in the near future because of the political situation, Lee
said, he will see to it that at least exchanges between vice
ministerial-level officials become more frequent.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that Taiwan's government-run or private
academic and research institutes should increase their exchanges with
U.S.-based think tanks so as to help open up communication channels
between the two countries. This could help the government expand
contacts with the United States from "points" to "lines" and even
"spheres," he added.</P>
      <P>Describing his new job as "highly challenging," Lee said he will
do his utmost to collaborate with Chen Chien-jen, Taipei's chief
representative in the United States, in an effort to further effect
Taiwan's diplomatic front in the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee visited the Legislative Yuan Tuesday to seek support in his
new position from legislators from the ruling and opposition parties.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly appointed Republic of China
Representative to Chile Francisco Huang was scheduled to leave
Wednesday for Santiago, Chile, to assume his duties.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Huang said that he will do
what he can to strengthen relations between the ROC and Chile. He
will also make efforts to promote economic and cultural, as well as
tourism interchanges, between the two countries, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang, a career diplomat and an expert on Latin American affairs,
will replace Steven F. Wang, who will be reassigned.</P>
      <P>He noted that the people of Taiwan know little about Chile, which
is located on the western coast of South America, separated from
neighboring Argentina by the Andes mountain range.</P>
      <P>The ex-chief of the Protocol Bureau of the Presidential Office
described Chile as a potential market for ROC tourists and investors.
He said he will try his best to explore the market by inviting ROC
tourists and investors to travel to the country and invest there.</P>
      <P>He said he will also promote academic interchanges between the
two countries and revealed that National University of Chile will
shortly enter into sisterhood ties with Tamkang University. The two
universities will arrange interchanges of professors and students
with the aim of promoting better bilateral understanding.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he will also promote cultural interchanges by
inviting Chilean and Chinese painters to hold alternate exhibitions
in Taiwan and Santiago. He also pointed out that several local
artists have already taught Chinese painting in Santiago.</P>
      <P>Chile, with a population of 14 million, is 21 times the size of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade totaled US$860 million in 1998, with copper,
seafood, timber and fruit listed as Chile's main exports to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SYMPOSIUM ON TAIWAN DEMOCRACY HELD IN WASHINGTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 23 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former White House official said at a
symposium in Washington Monday that the Taipei government should
eliminate uncertainty in its policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Douglas Paal, who worked for the Reagan and Bush administrations,
also suggested that the new U.S. government that will be inaugurated
next January strengthen high-level interaction with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the symposium on "the new era of Taiwan democracy,"
Paal noted that such unexpected incidents as former President Lee
Teng-hui's 1995 visit to the United States and his 1999 statement
redefining Taiwan's ties with the mainland as a "special
state-to-state relationship" toughened Beijing's stance against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he suggested, the government under President Chen
Shui-bian should take steps to eliminate the element of surprise and
uncertainty over cross-Taiwan Strait relations in exchange for time
for negotiations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Ambassador to Beijing James Lilley told the symposium
that Taiwan should not ignore the threat from mainland China and
added that it is important for Taiwan to pay attention to trends and
follow the trends of history.</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing talks about democracy and human right and
added that Taipei should follow this trend to encourage the mainland
to develop in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Another American participant said that Washington should continue
to honor the Taiwan Relations Act and should enhance military
exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Three participants from Taipei -- Lin Chia-lung, Cheng Yu-ping
and Sheng Chih-jen -- also reported on Taiwan's political development
since the inauguration of the Democratic Progressive Party

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER CONFIRMS FORMOSA PLASTICS' M'LAND INVESTMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
Wednesday that he will meet with executives of the Formosa Plastics
Group in a week to gain a better understanding of the business
conglomerate's latest plans on investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Lin said he has
learned that the FPG is planning to develop a PVC manufacturing
complex on Meishan Island of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province at an
estimated cost of US$100 million, contrary to rumors circulated
previously that the group was planning to develop a naphtha cracking
plant on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although FPG President Wang Yung-tsai has openly
claimed that the group has no other choice but to invest in mainland
China for long-term and sustainable development, the FPG has not yet
filed any applications with the Investment Commission under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs for its new mainland-bound investment
projects.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FPG plans to invest US$100 million in a PVC plant
project on Meishan Island, Wang said recently that the FPG is
"leaving" Taiwan mainly because of its labor shortages, problems with
foreign laborers, public utilities instability, and the government's
decision to shorten the workweek.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has just returned from a fact-finding trip to the
mainland, said mainland China's overall investment environment has
improved remarkably fast over the past four years and is thriving.
And in addition to mainland China's cheap real estate and labor
costs, the mainland authorities are also offering investment
incentives to Taiwanese business groups who are interested in
developing the petrochemical industry, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang urged Taiwan business
groups to consider carefully any plans to invest in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yen said that despite the mainland's low-cost real estate and
cheap labor, raw materials, and public utilities, the concealed risks
to foreign businesses operating in mainland China are present and
real.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwanese businesses must take to heart the hidden risks,
including the fact that listed companies on the mainland are not
allowed to sell their own stocks freely, before they decide to
proceed to invest there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIR NOT OPPOSED TO MEETING MAINLAND PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan said Wednesday he does not rule out the possibility of meeting
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin to help break the
long-stalled relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien was responding to a suggestion by Legislator Pan Wei-kang,
also a KMT Central Standing Committee (CSC) member, that the KMT
take the initiative to promote party-to-party exchanges with the
Chinese Communist Party to boost mutual understanding and prevent
miscalculation of the cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly CSC meeting, Pan said she is worried that
some senior ROC government officials' recent remarks concerning the
sensitive cross-strait issues may cause miscalculation on
the part of mainland authorities and thus affect
stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"As the Republic of China's largest opposition party, the KMT
should not sit idly and should instead take steps to help forge
cross-strait rapprochement," Pan said, adding that the KMT should
send its top official in charge of mainland research, chang
Jung-kung, to visit mainland China to promote party-to-party
exchanges with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</P>
      <P>Pan said more than half of the 117 KMT legislators have thrown
support behind her calls for KMT-CCP exchanges and a meeting
between Lien and Jian, who concurrently serves as the CCP general
secretary.</P>
      <P>Responding to Pan's proposals, Lien said he has on many
occasions expressed the KMT's determination to play a more active
role in the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts in this regard, Lien said, KMT think tanks
will sponsor a series of seminars in Taiwan, mainland China or third
places to discuss issues related to the signing of a cross-strait
peace agreement and the formation of a cross-strait peace zone.</P>
      <P>Lien, also a former ROC vice president, further said since the
KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20, is no longer a
ruling party, it now has greater room to work for cross-strait
rapprochement. The KMT still controls a comfortable majority in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien said he does not oppose talks with the top Chinese
Communist Party leader. "Nevertheless, a Lien-Jiang meeting
will certainly involve many complex issues, we need further studies
before a decision can be made," Lien explained, adding that he will
ask the KMT's policy research department to study the proposal.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's meeting, KMT CSC members also passed five
recommendations for the agenda of Lien's scheduled meeting with
President Chen Shui-bian on Friday -- continued construction of the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant; upholding the Meinung
reservoir project; upholding the 1992 consensus on "one China,
separation interpretation"; supporting eradication of "black gold"
politics; and respecting human rights, press freedom and proper
procedures in anti-"black gold" operations.</P>
      <P>The high-profile Chen-Lien meeting will be held at the
Presidential Office at 10 a.m. Friday in an open-door format.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER MAY REPRESENT ROC AT APEC LEADERSHIP MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will send former 
Premier Vincent Siew to attend the informal leadership summit of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum scheduled for next month in
Brunei, government sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The sources said that the ROC government has informed Brunei of
its choice of representative and is now awaiting a reply from Brunei.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian had originally wanted to send Vice
Premier Lai In-jaw to attend the summit meeting on his behalf, and
the Brunei authorities accepted Taipei's decision.</P>
      <P>However, due to intervention by mainland China, Brunei later
informed the ROC government that Beijing's opposition to the
selection of Lai had put Brunei in an awkward position.</P>
      <P>Sources said the Presidential Office had considered such
alternatives as chairman Jeffrey Koo of the Chinese National
Association of Industry &amp; Commerce; Lee Yuan-tseh, president of
Academia Sinica; and Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank of
China, but had decided on Siew after taking into consideration many
different factors.</P>
      <P>Siew, currently serving as the vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, had attended similar APEC meetings in 1993 and 1994 on
behalf of the ROC president at the time, Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Siew said that President Chen did ask him last week about
attending the APEC meeting on his behalf and that he has informed KMT
Chairman Lien Chan about the matter.</P>
      <P>Lien said that with the nation's interests as its top priority,
the party is willing to comply with the request, although he said
that the matter must be discussed between the two parties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan said Siew is a
suitable candidate to represent the ROC at the APEC meeting.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Chi-wen said that Siew has a lot of experience
in financial and economic matters and that she hopes Siew will accept
the invitation without hesitation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SECURITY SYSTEM READY FOR `MINI THREE LINKS' SAYS NSB HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's national security system is ready
for the government's plan to allow Taiwan's frontline islands of
Kinmen and Matsu to launch the "three mini links" with mainland
China, said National Security Bureau Chief Ting Yu-chou on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The NSB has completed planning on measures to safeguard national
security, including personnel training, the establishment of relevant
facilities at appointed ports, the establishment of inspection and
surveillance points, and the completion of other related
arrangements, Ting noted.</P>
      <P>After long discussions and debates, the government decided
recently to open direct trade, mail, and transportation links between
Kinmen and Matsu and selected mainland Chinese coastal cities as part
of its efforts to forge cross-strait rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Ting noted that although the related security planning has been
mapped out, the question of funding the implementation of the plans
is still up in the air as the costs were not included in the
government's budget plan for this year.</P>
      <P>Ting, however, said a concrete plan on the much discussed "direct
three links" -- direct trade, mail, and transportation links between
Taiwan proper and mainland China -- still requires the input of a lot
of time, wisdom, and careful assessment as it involves serious
national security concerns and other vital issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in Kinmen, where the mood recently has been upbeat in
preparation for the implementation of the "mini three links," a
two-day seminar on tourism promotion kicked off Wednesday as part of
efforts to usher in a "new era" of business prosperity.</P>
      <P>Some 200 people are attending the seminar, which is focusing
discussions on five areas of business -- tourism, hotels and
restaurants, tour buses, dining, and sales of folk products and
souvenirs.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the seminar, Kinmen Deputy Magistrate
Yen Tah-jen said that if the "mini three links" are planned and
implemented well, they will create a second spring of prosperity for
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Under the government's "mini three links" plan, up to 700
mainland Chinese citizens will be allowed to arrive in Kinmen per day
for business or pleasure, while a maximum of 150 mainland citizens
per day will be able to visit the smaller Matsu.</P>
      <P>In related news, quarantine sources from Kaohsiung in southern
Taiwan suggested Wednesday that the government reinforce quarantine
efforts in Kinmen and Matsu as waves of people, products, and even
animals from mainland China are due to land there in a couple of
months.</P>
      <P>Chang Shien-ching, director of the Kaohsiung County Animal
Quarantine Department, urged the government to pay extra attention to
the possible threat of animal diseases or epidemics from mainland
China after the implementation of the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Chang noted that while related quarantine agencies in Taiwan
proper are capable of controlling the O-type foot-and-mouth disease,
which is endemic to Taiwan, many other types of FMD virus originating
from mainland China will easily be able to be brought into Taiwan via
Kinmen and Matsu once the two outpost bases open there gates to
mainland Chinese imports, thus posing a serious challenge to Taiwan's
quarantine system.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The total value of exports for October is
expected to hit US$13.7 billion, setting a new record high for a
single month, the Ministry of Finance predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the first part of October, exports
totaled US$9.3 billion, while imports amounted to US$8.59 billion,
with Taiwan enjoying a trade surplus of US$710 million. The figures
show that Taiwan's exports have continued to be brisk during the
first half of October.</P>
      <P>As the price of agricultural and industrial raw materials rose
rapidly in October, growth in the total value of imports began to
slow down in the first half of October.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the officials said that if the price of world
crude oil stabilizes and the global economy continues its stable
growth, then exports are expected to continue to grow.</P>
      <P>They estimated that exports and imports in October will grow by
20.6 percent and 15.5 percent from the same month last
year respectively.</P>
      <P>They also predicted that growth in the total value of exports
this year will hit 23.3 percent, while growth in the total value of
imports will likely hit between 27 percent and 28 percent, or
slightly lower than the estimated figures released earlier by the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MJIB FORMALLY CEASES CONTROVERSIAL `POLITICAL SURVEILLANCE' WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau
(MJIB) Director Wang Kuang-yu said Wednesday that the bureau has been
formally freed from the responsibility of carrying out controversial
"political surveillance" work.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Wang
said Premier Chang Chun-hsiung had already approved a revision to the
MJIB's duties, freeing the bureau of the work of monitoring the
activities of major domestic political parties and local factions, as
well as suspected wrongdoing by various government agencies.</P>
      <P>Wang told lawmakers that the so-called "political surveillance"
was originally included in the MJIB's "national conditions survey."
After the revision of the bureau's work content, Wang said, the
"national conditions survey" has been redesignated as the "domestic
security survey."</P>
      <P>According to the revised MJIB work rules, Wang said, the
"domestic security survey" will comprise 21 items in six categories,
including mainland China's Taiwan-targeted activities; unfriendly
activities of foreign nationals; unconstitutional and unlawful
activities; financial and economic activities; science and technology
development; information security; social stability; early warning of
threats to domestic public order; and other activities that may
affect national security.</P>
      <P>Wang said the scrapping of surveillance of political parties,
factions and individual political figures and of suspected wrongdoing
by government agencies from the "domestic security survey" complies
with general public opinion and democratic trends.</P>
      <P>Noting that national security is critical to Taiwan's survival,
Wang said the MJIB is an integral part of the Republic of China's
national security intelligence mechanism. "And I believe that the
latest revision of the scope of the bureau's security survey will not
affect overall national security protection operations," he added.</P>
      <P>In fact, the MJIB stopped monitoring major opposition parties and
their leaders as well as government wrongdoings -- commonly known as
"political surveillance" in local society -- in September, under
pressure from reform-minded grassroots MJIB agents and opposition
parties. But the cancellation was not formalized until Tuesday, when
Premier Chang endorsed the proposed revision to the MJIB's work
content.</P>
      <P>The revision marks a formal end to the decades-old "white terror"
political persecution tactics used by the previous Kuomintang
government against opposition politicians and parties.</P>
      <P>A group of reform-minded MJIB agents formed an association in
August to push the new Democratic Progressive Party government to end
the "white terror" surveillance against opposition political figures
to signify Taiwan's success in democratization.</P>
      <P>In the past, the MJIB conducted "political surveillance" under
the guidance and supervision of the National Security Bureau (NSB)
under the Presidential Office. Therefore, cancellation of this work
from the MJIB's duty list required the approval of both the NSB and
the president before the premier could endorse it.</P>
      <P>NSB Director Ting Yu-chou said President Chen Shui-bian had
ordered a quick completion of all legal formalities to formally free
the MJIB from the controversial operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S PLAN TO EXPLOIT TIBETAN OIL RESOURCES FACES INT'L OPPOSITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is facing international
opposition to its plans to exploit the oil resources of the Tibetan
Plateau, reported the Australian on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign oil firms are also expected to encounter protests from
environmentalists and the Tibetan government in exile established by
Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily reported that Communist
China is trying to exploit the massive oil reserves of Tibet in order
to develop the vast and impoverished western part of the mainland,
and giant oil companies such as BP Amoco, Shell, Agip, and Exxon
Mobil are all lining up for a slice of the exploration action.</P>
      <P>But the potential for destruction to the delicate ecology of the
Tibetan plateau and the likely displacement of the already
underprivileged Tibetan population has led to a backlash among
China's neighbors and has reinvigorated international environmental
and pro-Tibet campaigners, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>It reported that supporters of the Dalai Lama's government in
exile are focusing on plans to build a 935-km long natural gas
pipeline from Sebei in Qinghai to Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu
province.</P>
      <P>Opponents argue that the exploration efforts will speed up the
settlement of Han Chinese on lands traditionally occupied by Tibetan
and Mongolian nomads, adding that similar past patterns have shown
that the indigenous people generally are marginalized from economic
development.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a spokesman for the International Campaign for
Tibet as saying that "when you try to develop areas based on resource
extraction, it just turns them into colonies."</P>
      <P>The Tibetan government in exile has also called for the immediate
cessation of the oil exploration and exploitation plans.</P>
      <P>"These projects, as they are now conceived, will cause harm to
the Tibetan people," the government in exile said.</P>
      <P>Foreign oil companies have poured a total of US$3 billion into
Chinese oil companies in a bid to secure a foothold in the
development of the industry, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists recently succeeded in reversing a World Bank
decision to fund a project to move Chinese farmers on to Tibetan
lands in Qinghai, and this has encouraged them to lobby against the
involvement of global companies in such projects, the daily reported.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
expressed hope Wednesday that he can attend next year's summit in
Central America between Central American countries and the ROC.</P>
      <P>Chen revealed his wish while receiving visiting El Salvador Vice
President Carlos Quintanilla.</P>
      <P>He also expressed welcome for a visit to Taipei in December by El
Salvador President Francisco Flores and added that he is happy with
the high-level exchanges between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The president said it gave him great pleasure to see Quintanilla
again so soon. The two met in August in Dominican Republic when Chen
made his first official overseas trip to six states in the Caribbean,
Central America and Africa after his inauguration on May 20.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's meeting coincided with the 55th anniversary of the
retrocession of Taiwan from Japanese occupation and Chen said that if
Taiwan had not escaped Japanese rule 55 years ago, the country would
not have the progress in democratization and economic prosperity
which it now enjoys.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC wishes to share with El Salvador, one of its
closest allies, the fruits of its progress in various aspects.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed gratitude to El Salvador for its
long-term support of the ROC's bid to join the United Nations and
other international organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen added that he hopes Quintanilla's visit will lead to more
local enterprises investing in El Salvador, bringing more trade
opportunities to the Central American country.</P>
      <P>Quintanilla and his delegation was scheduled to leave Taiwan
Thursday.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Efforts to bring assets management
companies into Taiwan has borne fruit, with well-known international
investment bank Goldman Sachs group expressing interest in setting up
in Taiwan, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The venture being contemplated by Goldman Sachs will have
capitalization of NT$30 billion (US$937 million), which will be
financed either by the bank alone or by Goldman Sachs in conjunction
with its local partners, said Yen, the driving force behind the
system.</P>
      <P>He noted that the potential investor was not ruling out the
possibility that local finance institutions could join the venture by
turning over their bad loans to the new company as an investment.</P>
      <P>However, Yen continued, a bill exempting assets management firms
from the legal obligation of auctioning off bad loans taken from
finance institutions is pending in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The auction, conducted under court supervision, is time-consuming
and would tie the hands of assets management firms in handling the
bad loans purchased from banks.</P>
      <P>With the exemption in place, assets management firms will be able

      <P>Prompted by the rising stock market, which has rebounded more

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian
said Wednesday that the "Taiwan spirit," jointly created by various
ethnic groups on the island, is a common asset that can be used by
all local residents to face the challenges of the new century.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a cocktail reception to mark the 55th
anniversary of the restoration of Taiwan to Chinese rule in 1945
after half a century of Japanese occupation.</P>
      <P>Chen, the Republic of China's first president from the Democratic
Progressive Party, said Taiwan has come a long way in charting its
own destiny since the end of Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Over the past 55 years, Chen said, the people of Taiwan have
worked diligently to achieve economic prosperity and political
democratization. "This marvelous Taiwan developmental experience,
created by all our people, has attracted world attention and should
give our people confidence in our country's future," he explained.</P>
      <P>He further said the brilliant Taiwan experience lies in the
"Taiwan spirit" characterized by confidence, hope, dreams, sweat and
wisdom.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "Taiwan spirit" integrates the essences of the
Han (Chinese) culture and the Nantao (southern island) culture, Chen
said the people of Taiwan should continue "glorifying" this common
asset.</P>
      <P>With the 21st century just around the corner, Chen went on, all
Taiwan residents, regardless of their ethnic origins and party
affiliations, should stand united to consolidate the island's
democratic achievements and create yet another economic boom and
accelerate reconstruction in the areas hard-hit by a devastating
earthquake that rattled Taiwan Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>The reception, chaired by Interior Minister Chang Po-ya, was
attended by senior government officials, representatives from
Taiwan's sister states and provinces around the world, as well as
representatives of the 921 earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>2000 marks the first year since 1945 that Taiwan's Retrocession

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will open its door
wider to mainland Chinese science-technology professionals in
a gradual manner, National Science Council (NSC) Chairman Weng
Cheng-i said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting, Weng
said the NSC has drafted a revision bill to the current regulations
governing the entry of mainland scientists, engineers and other
technological experts.</P>
      <P>According to the NSC-proposed revision, the maximum period of
stay for mainland science-technology professionals will be extended
from current two years to three years.</P>
      <P>Weng said the draft revision bill has been referred to the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, for screening.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Weng said, the NSC has asked the Ministry of the
Interior to revise relevant entry regulations to allow mainland
scientists and technological experts eligible for staying in Taiwan
for more than six months for research purposes to take with them
their spouses and children.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, some legislators suggested that the
government draft a bill granting permanent residency to
qualified mainland scientists and technological experts and their
families to attract more mainland professionals to work and settle
in Taiwan to help resolve manpower shortage problems faced by local
companies.</P>
      <P>In response, Weng said the NSC is willing to gradually adjust its
policy and regulations based on the domestic demand and the
development of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, MAC Vice Chairman John C.C. Teng,
said the government will give the priority to attracting overseas
mainland-born scientists and technological experts to work in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As an influx of mainland professionals may have an impact on the
local job market and cause many complex problems, including
marriage, education and health insurance, Teng said,
regulations governing employment of mainland scientists and engineers
should be eased gradually, not hastily.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRATIC PARTY ADVISORS EXPLAIN GORE POSITION ON CHINA-TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A future Gore administration would
continue U.S. policy on "one China" while emphasizing its support for
the people of Taiwan, according to senior advisors to the Democratic
presidential candidate.</P>
      <P>Marc Ginsberg, senior coordinating foreign policy advisor to the
Gore campaign, said that he expects "the policy of `one China' based
on the (1972) Shanghai communique would continue but on the basis of
peaceful efforts and resolution, not armed conflict."</P>
      <P>"The Taiwanese people deserve to know that the United States will
stand by their side and that we will be there for them ... because
they have proved they are strong friends of ours," Ginsberg told
Taiwan reporters.</P>
      <P>Beijing must engage Taiwan to resolve cross-strait differences,
he said, adding that a Gore administration would try to play "a
constructive and important role on behalf of both parties consistent
with our long-stated bi-partisan policy."</P>
      <P>Answering questions after a briefing on foreign policy positions
of the Gore campaign, Ginsberg also said that a Gore administration
would not abandon Taiwan and would provide weapons necessary for the
island's defense.</P>
      <P>During the briefing, another advisor to the campaign suggested
that, as president, Gore would likely try to avoid the controversies
and partisan attacks that have dogged the Clinton administration's
conduct of U.S. China policy.</P>
      <P>"Al Gore is going to approach all foreign policy issues, trying
to build a bipartisan coalition, this one in particular," said Bruce
Jentelson.</P>
      <P>"Given our history in the region and given the contentiousness of
this issue, it's even more important that we improve on the
bipartisan nature of this policy," he said.</P>
      <P>During the briefing, Jentelson laid out the principle of a Gore
administration's China policy as trying to "maximize the areas of
cooperation with the People's Republic of China, and at the same time
be very clear about where our differences are."</P>
      <P>He said a President Gore would ensure that, where there are
differences with Beijing, the United States would stand up for
American interests and for its allies in the region.</P>
      <P>Rejecting criticism by the Bush campaign, both Jentelson and
Ginsberg stressed the importance with which Gore views U.S. ties with
Japan and other allies in Asia.</P>
      <P>"There's no doubt that one of the most important objectives of a
Gore administration will be to strengthen our security commitments
with Japan," said Ginsberg.</P>
      <P>He also described ties with Australia, Thailand, the Philippines,
South Korea and Taiwan as "cornerstones" of U.S. relations with the

    <HEADLINE>CRUDE OIL PRICE WILL AFFECT TAIWAN'S GROWTH RATE: CEPD OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking official with the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday
that Taiwan's economic growth rate will be affected by the
international price of crude oil.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said that if the price of crude remains high next year,
it will become hard to attain the 6 percent real growth rate set for
next year unless tariffs for crude imports and the commodity tax for
petroleum products are slashed.</P>
      <P>But he added that Taiwan will have no problem attain the 6.1
percent growth rate set for this year, even if the price soars to
US$40 per barrel by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The CEPD official made the remarks at a seminar organized by the
China External Trade Development Council to analyze the fluctuation
of international crude prices and its effect on Taiwan's economy and
trade.</P>
      <P>Participants invited to the seminar included specialists from the
Chinese Petroleum Corp., the Energy Commission under the Economics
Ministry, the Lee Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp. and the Taiwan
Economic Research Institute.</P>
      <P>According to Hu's analysis, Taiwan's growth rate this year will
reach 6.57 percent if the price of crude averages US$27 per barrel in
the fourth quarter of this year. However, it will go down to 6.47
percent and to 6.13 percent if the price averages US$30 or US$40,
respectively.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the crude price will have little effect on
Taiwan's foreign trade, as foreign trade's dependence on energy has
dropped significantly.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew said Wednesday
he would be willing to attend the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum summit of leaders on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is also an opposition Kuomintang vice chairman, called
the appointment "a task, a responsibility, but not a post." He said
he will accept it if it serves the national interest without
compromising the stance of his party.</P>
      <P>In response to questions from the media after the weekly meeting
of the KMT Central Standing Committee, Siew confirmed that he had
been consulted by Chen on the possibility of representing the
president at the Nov. 15-16 summit in Brunei.</P>
      <P>But Siew said he was told at the time that he was only one of a
number of choices being weighed by Chen and added that he has yet to
hear any more about the issue.</P>
      <P>Siew, who represented former President Lee Teng-hui at the annual
summits in 1993 and 1994 when he served as chairman of the Council
for Economic Planning and Development, said it is his understanding
that his private status is not an obstacle to his being an envoy at
the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said Chen, who is a Democratic
Progressive Party member, should consult the KMT before appointing
Siew, although he stressed that his party would give the national
interest top priority when weighing its decision.</P>
      <P>Describing the KMT, which lost ignominiously in the March
presidential election, as "rich in talented people," Lien said his
party did not grudge its members being tapped by the DPP for
government service, but added that the "formality" of consultation
between the two parties should be followed.</P>
      <P>Although the Republic of China is a member of APEC, its president
has never rubbed shoulders with his APEC counterparts at the summit
since the conference was launched in 1993 in Seattle, due to
opposition from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, threatened
to boycott the summit should the ROC president attend in person,
forcing Taiwan to settle for having a ministerial-level official at
the occasion.</P>

Taipei Foreign Exchange is the "most transparent of its kind in the

      <P>Chou A-ting, director-general of the CBC's Foreign Exchange

advanced trading instruments, he said that the CBC provides the
results of trading every month and permits trading in 18 foreign
currencies.</P>
      <P>Regarding the charges in trading and procedures, Chou said that
they are "comparatively lower" than many other foreign exchanges
around the world.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the scale of trading on the Taipei Foreign
Exchange -- about US$5 billion - US$6 billion daily -- is far smaller
than the scale of its Singapore counterpart, which amounts to over
US$100 billion per day, but he noted that most of the volume in
Singapore trading is from trading in foreign currencies other than
the Singapore dollar.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the scale of trade in Taipei will increase after
Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization, Chou replied obliquely
that the CBC will ask banks to step up their risk management.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Legislator Trong Tsai visited a faction of the opposition Kuomintang
on Wednesday to seek support for holding a referendum to solve the
issue of the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Tsai sought support from the KMT faction, which calls itself "The
E-generation," after eight members of DPP's "Mainstream Alliance"
faction expressed conditional support for continuation of the
construction of the plant, and a survey conducted last week among
alliance members revealed that 26 supported the holding of a
referendum to decide whether to continue with the project.</P>
      <P>The plant has become a political hot potato for the DPP, with
opinion sharply divided over whether or not it should be scrapped,
challenging the party's anti-nuclear platform.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that although Taiwan's democratic system is
well-developed, there is no system in place to allow for referenda to
be used as a means of determining major national policy. He described
a referendum as "the highest performance of public opinion."</P>
      <P>However, the head of the KMT's "E-generation," Chen Hung-chi,

    <HEADLINE>EDUCATION MINISTRY WORKING TO LEGALIZE TAIWAN SCHOOLS ON M'LAND</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education is seeking the
legalization of mainland China-based schools established for children
of Taiwanese businesspeople, sources from the MOE said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Education Minister
Ovid Tzeng said the MOE is currently discussing with the Mainland
Affairs Council, the top agency formulating Taiwan's mainland China
policies, matters concerning legalizing Taiwan educational
institutions established in mainland China for children of Taiwan
citizens maintaining business operations there.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said the MOE and MAC are working on adding an article to
the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan
Area and the Mainland Area to formally legalize the Taiwan schools in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>After years of preparation, the first Taiwan school, situated in
Dongguan in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, began
operating on Sept. 2. The school was established after it obtained
official approval from authorities of Taiwan, Beijing, and the local
government.</P>
      <P>The school in Dongguan only accepts children of Taiwan citizens,
and the faculty is also entirely comprised of Taiwan citizens. Also,
the management of the school and the curriculum are based on the
educational system in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Tzeng, there are about 200,000 Taiwanese
businesspeople working or operating companies in mainland China, with
most of them living in the coastal provinces. Family affairs,
particularly children's education, are of major concern to this
group, he noted.</P>
      <P>Most of these Taiwan businesspeople prefer to have their children
educated within a Taiwan educational institution, said Tzeng, adding
that most have not chosen foreign schools because of the
prohibitively high costs nor mainland Chinese schools because of
their concerns about the possible ideological influence on their
children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-PRESIDENT'S AIDE DENIES U.S. TRAVEL PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A close aide to former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui Thursday denied a newspaper report that Lee
will visit his alma mater, Cornell University, in Ithaca,
New York State in December.</P>
      <P>Su Chih-cheng, head of Lee's office during his 12-year
presidency, said Lee, who just returned from a visit to the Czech
Republic to attend an international seminar, has no new overseas
travel plans before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Su, now deputy director of the Taiwan Research Institute, a
private think tank, admitted that Lee indeed received an invitation
from a U.S. foundation to visit Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the U.S. foundation had sent the invitation
through the ROC's representative office in the United States and
planned to cite Lee for his achievement in promoting Taiwan's
democratization.</P>
      <P>As Lee just retired in May this year and the foundation is
located in the politically sensitive U.S. capital city, Su said, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had suggested that Lee turn down
the invitation to avoid affecting the delicate
Taipei-Washington-Beijing triangular relations.</P>
      <P>"After a prudent study, the MOFA said a U.S. visit by Lee at
this moment, no matter conducted in any format, is not expected to
have positive, constructive effects on relations across the Taiwan
Strait. Therefore, Lee has politely rejected the invitation," Su
explained.</P>
      <P>The China Times, a Taipei daily, reported Thursday that Lee has
been invited to attend a fund raiser to be held at Cornell University
in December to raise donations from alumni for a science-technology
research project. In addition, the paper, Lee will also visit New
York and several other major U.S. cities except Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>However, Su categorically denied the report, saying it is
unfounded and completely wrong.</P>
      <P>"If Lee were to visit the United States in December, he
certainly would have made every possible effort to prevent any
premature exposure of his travel plan," Su stressed, adding that as
the weather is getting cold, the 78-year-old ex-ROC president will
not travel abroad in the rest of this year.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against
Taiwan and an active promoter of Taiwan's distinctive identity,
managed to make a high-profile visit to the United States
in June 1995, making him the first ROC president to set
foots on the U.S. soil. During that visit, Lee delivered a
speech, titled "Always in My Heart," on Taiwan's progress
in economic development and political democratization.</P>
      <P>The visit, however, infuriated Beijing and strained
Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations. Beijing even test-fired
missiles and conducted live-fire military exercises at Taiwan's
doorstep between 1995 and 1996 to intimidate Taiwan.
Beijing's saber-rattling, also known as the 1996 Taiwan Strait
crisis, also prompted U.S. President Bill Clinton to spell out a
new "three noes" policy toward Taiwan -- no support for "one
China, one Taiwan"; "no support for Taiwan independence"; and "no
support for Taiwan's membership in international organizations which
require statehood."</P>
      <P>Although Lee has no longer held any government posts since
he stepped down from the presidency in May, Beijing still opposes
Lee's any overseas visits. Beijing lodged protests with London when
Lee visited Britain in June. It also tried to pressure the Czech
Republic to block Lee's visit earlier this month, but to no avail.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. MUST WARN CHINA IT WON'T LET TAIWAN BE COERCED: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By  Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While recognizing that the Taiwan issue
could bring America and Communist China into a military conflict, the
next U.S. administration must warn Beijing that it will not stand
idly by if China coerces or uses military force against Taiwan, noted
a renowned American expert in Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Richard Haass, vice president of the Brookings Institution and
director of the Brookings Foreign Policy Studies program, wrote in
the latest issue of the Brookings Review that the United States'
bilateral relationship with China is fast becoming the most difficult
issue for Washington to manage.</P>
      <P>Areas of cooperation, including working toward the expansion of
trade and toward promoting stability on the Korean peninsula, risk
being overwhelmed by differences over Taiwan, human rights, Beijing's
assistance to Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs, U.S. plans for
theater and national missile defense systems, and humanitarian
intervention, he said.</P>
      <P>"Complicating matters is the political reality that in both
countries, there are those who see the other as the principal
obstacle to a successful foreign policy and who see a competitive if
not adversarial relationship as all but inevitable," said the former
special assistant to President George Bush.</P>
      <P>Haass pointed out that negotiations cannot eliminate these
differences and what is required instead are regular consultations,
attempts at cooperation in selected areas, and special care at making
sure areas of disagreement do not spill over and affect the entire
relationship.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should be singled out, however, as the one issue that
could bring the United States and China into direct military
confrontation. China must understand that the United States will not
stand idly by if China coerces or uses military force against
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>This posture needs to be balanced, however, by U.S. diplomacy
that both encourages a mainland China-Taiwan cross-strait dialogue
and discourages any unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan,
emphasized the Asia expert.</P>
      <P>Regarding the controversial missile defense programs, Haass said
even a modest national missile defense system could pose a threat to
Communist China's arsenal, which is far smaller than Russia's.
Moreover, theater missile defense inevitably becomes entangled with
the Taiwan issue, "as China is sure to view U.S. missile defense
plans for Northeast Asia as enabling Taiwan to declare independence
with impunity," he added.</P>
      <P>"There is no way to eliminate these Chinese concerns and probably
no way to avoid a decision by China to increase the size and
capability of its nuclear arsenal, something likely to happen to some
degree regardless of U.S. missile defense plans," he stressed.</P>
      <P>"But the United States can alleviate the adverse consequences,
both by making clear that any national missile defense is limited and
by working to discourage a declaration of independence by Taiwan,"
concluded Haass.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TOURISM SECTOR RESPONDS FAVORABLY TO ALLOWING M'LAND VISITORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   26   (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Premier Chang-Chun's recent
announcement that the government will allow a limited number of
tourists from mainland China to visit Taiwan each year has been
favorably received by the local tourism sector.</P>
      <P>Following a series of "goodwill" policies announced by the new
government to address the cross-strait impasse, the premier announced
Oct. 20 that visitors from mainland China will be able to take
leisure trips to Taiwan beginning next June. The announcement has
still not been formally acknowledged by mainland Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the announcement, leaders of the tourism sector
have expressed the hope that the government will quickly work out
relevant regulations on the market opening so as to allow them to
move accordingly.</P>
      <P>Shih Tsun-hsiung, chairman of the Taiwan Folklore Village, a
recreation center in central Taiwan, said he feels the government's
opening of the island to mainland Chinese tourists will definitely
have a positive effect on Taiwan's tourism industry, which has been
heavily battered by the devastating earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999.</P>
      <P>Shih said that based on mainland China's huge population, about 3
million to 5 million tourists could be expected to be able to visit
Taiwan from the mainland per year, making this group an irresistible
attraction to Taiwan's tourism operators.</P>
      <P>Chuang Hsiu-shih, owner of the renowned Leofoo Zoo and Theme Park
and the five-star Hotel Westin Taipei, said the number of mainland
Chinese tourists that the government plans to allow in should not be
too few, saying 200,000 a year would not be enough.</P>
      <P>He said the number should be more like 500,000 or more tourists
per year to make it "cost efficient" for Taiwan tourism operators.</P>
      <P>Although official regulations are not yet available, members of
the domestic tourism industry have envisaged that the average
itinerary for a mainland Chinese tourist would likely be a tour of
7-10 days at a cost of between NT$35,000 and NT$40,000, with Sun Moon
Lake, Mt. Ali, and Taroko Gorge being major travel destinations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSES RELOCATING TO M'LAND NOT AN EXODUS: LIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Lin Hsin-yi said
Thursday that the relocating to mainland China by parts of Taiwan's
business and industrial sectors does not constitute an "industrial
exodus."</P>
      <P>Lin, speaking in the Legislative Yuan, noted that it is a natural
development for Taiwan companies to choose to relocate their
manufacturing operations to mainland China one after another.</P>
      <P>He attributed the trend to an assortment of factors, including
Taiwan's labor shortages, unstable public utilities supplies,
saturation in certain domestic markets, Taiwan and mainland China's
impending entry into the World Trade Organization, which mandates
free trade among all trade entities, and particularly cheap real
estate and labor on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yi-shih ridiculed Lin in the
Legislative Yuan by saying that Yulon Motor Co., one of the leading
automobile manufacturers in Taiwan, demonstrated a lack of confidence
in the government by deciding to invest on the mainland after Lin
assumed the post of economics minister. Lin was president of
China Motor Corp., an affiliate of Yulon Motor, before being
appointed to his present post in Chen Shui-bian's administration.</P>
      <P>Discounting the legislator's ridicule, Lin said Yulon's plans to
invest on the mainland have nothing to do with him, nor with the
possibility of water, electricity, and other public utilities
shortages in Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Lin said he knows that Yulon began discussing possible
investments on the mainland seven or eight years ago on the grounds
that Taiwan's motor market was expected to become saturated in a few
years. And the truth is that that expectation came true, Lin said,
pointing out that the combined annual output of cars shrank to
430,000 units last year from an average of 570,000 units per year a
few years ago.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's auto industry has no choice but to "move out" in
order to survive, but he added that the relocating of operations out
of the country does not constitute an exodus.</P>
      <P>Taiwan newspapers reported Thursday that Yulon plans to invest
some US$16 million to acquire a 25 percent stake in Fengshen Motor,
one of the leading automobile manufacturers in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The Yulon investment plan has already received approval from
mainland Chinese authorities. The company plans to file a formal
application with the Investment Commission for government approval.</P>
      <P>Yulon's mainland investment plan comes on the heels of Formosa
Plastics Group's announcement that it is planning to invest US$100
million in developing a PVC manufacturing complex on Meishan Island
in Ningbo, located in mainland China's Zhejiang Province.</P>

      <P>Australian universities have been
attracting more and more foreign students in recent years, said
Education Minister David Kemp on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, Kemp said that "education is

students over the last two years."</P>
      <P>He said there has been an 80 percent increase in the number of

higher education courses for the year 2000, compared with 53,188 in
1996.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Education Department told the CNA that Taiwan
was one of the top ten educational markets for Australia, but he
added that a specific breakdown in the country of origin of foreign
students studying at Australian universities would not be released
until early 2001.</P>
      <P>"However, we regard Taiwan as a major educational market for us
and will continue our promotional campaigns to attract more Taiwanese

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR TAIWAN STRAIT CONFLICT PREVENTION MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Wednesday pitched
for the establishment of a Taiwan Strait conflict management and
prevention mechanism to maintain regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal during a meeting with C. Daniel Mote,
president of the University of Maryland, who is currently on a
weeklong visit to Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, there are now three possible flashpoints in
the Asia-Pacific area -- the Korean peninsula, the South China Sea
and the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen said long-feuding North and South Korea are engaging in
detente and that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
has provided a forum for prevention and management of South China Sea
disputes or conflicts.</P>
      <P>In contrast, he went on, the Taiwan Strait is the only area where
no effective dialogue mechanism exists. With a view to preventing
cross-strait conflicts, he said, both Taiwan and mainland China
should endeavor to thrash out conflict management or preventive
diplomacy measures.</P>
      <P>Chen told his guest that the Republic of China government has
consistently given priority to improving and normalizing cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"Although there are still some `blind points' or obstacles to the
development of cross-strait relations, I'm convinced that we'll be
able to find a way out with goodwill, wisdom and creativity," Chen
said, adding that his administration will do its utmost to avoid any
possible cross-strait conflicts for the well-being of the people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>For his part, Mote said the University of Maryland has set up a
global ethnic Chinese affairs study center and a conflict management
and research center which has studied all major conflicts around the
world over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>"We hope to contribute to the study of cross-strait issues,
disputes and conflicts through the cooperation of these two
organizations," Mote said.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Mote will sign a memorandum of understanding on
cooperation between the University of Maryland (UOM) and the ROC's
National Yang Ming University.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will be pleased to see the prestigious U.S.
university strengthen exchanges and cooperation with Taiwan's
educational and research institutes.</P>
      <P>Mote told Chen that for the University of Maryland, the ROC is an
important country because it has the world's largest UOM alumni club
outside the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
the government supports the choice of Clement C.P. Chang to head both
the Asian Pacific League for Freedom and Democracy (APLFD) and the
World League for Freedom and Democracy (WLFD).</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment as he received delegates to a joint
executive committee of the WLFD and the APLFD, which opened in Taipei
earlier in the day and was chaired by Chang.</P>
      <P>Chang is contesting with Yao Eng-chi, president of the APLFD's
ROC chapter, to head the WLFD, a non-government organization.</P>
      <P>He spoke highly of the WLFD's contributions to promoting freedom
and the universal values of democracy over the years in every corner
of the world.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to describe the ROC as a free and democratic country
whose people uphold freedom and "love" democracy. The people enjoy
100 percent freedom of speech that allows them to voice criticism of
the government and even the president, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the ROC is "a member of the global village" and
that ROC citizens are also global citizens. "We (the ROC) will not
raise fences for ourselves and hope that we can rejoin the United
Nations so that we can fulfill our international obligations," he
continued.</P>
      <P>He added his hope that the WLFD can help the ROC rejoin the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another WLFD executive committee meeting convened by
Yao, will be held Friday in New York.</P>
      <P>Yao claimed that he has obtained support from 16 WLFD executive

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BECOMING A COUNTRY OF `MODERATE' ECONOMIC GROWTH: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is becoming a country of "moderate
or even low" economic growth and its unemployment rate reached a
20-year high last year, a national policy advisor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsin-huang, who is also a research fellow of social science
at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's most prestigious academic institution,
based his remarks on statistics from the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>He said that this is not a bad condition and is a tendency when
economic development matures. However, he went on, the climbing
unemployment rate is worth observing.</P>
      <P>He also noted that although Taiwan people are getting richer, the
distribution of wealth is getting worse. He suggested that the
government should figure out on how to maintain a society of "equal
wealth."</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS statistics, Taiwan's economic growth reached
5.4 percent in 1999 after emerging from the shadow of the Asian
financial crisis, with its gross national product (GNP) totaling
US$290.5 billion, the 16th-highest in the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's per capita GNP registered US$13,235, or 25th place in
the world, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>However, Hsiao said Taiwan's unemployment rate reached a record
high of 2.92 percent last year, due mainly to the devastating Sept.
21 earthquake, and had climbed to 3.16 percent by August this year.</P>
      <P>Last year, labor disputes continued to surge, totaling 5,860
cases, an increase of 40 percent over the previous year, Hsiao added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a public sanitation expert said that according to a
human development index compiled by the United Nations, the per
capita Gross Domestic Product in Taiwan has registered US$19,197, the
21st-highest in the world, while its life expectancy registered 31st
place.</P>
      <P>Chien Chien-jen, director of the School of Public Sanitation of
National Taiwan University, said this shows that Taiwan's high GDP
has not brought health and longevity for its people.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
declined Thursday to confirm a press report that the Republic of
China is to forge full diplomatic relations with the South Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu.</P>
      <P>However, several local newspapers said a breakthrough is due soon
on the establishment of full-fledged diplomatic ties with Vanuatu and
that Vice Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee had left for Vanuatu to
discuss relevant issues.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen would not comment on the report and
said only that the ROC has consistently worked hard to strengthen
relations with its diplomatic allies and non-allies.</P>
      <P>While maintaining formal diplomatic ties with mainland China,
Vanuatu "exchanged recognition" with the ROC in 1992, one step short
of full diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>Chen said ROC-Vanuatu relations, including trade and agricultural
exchanges, are cordial. He went on to stress that grasping every
possible chance to forge rapprochement and cooperative ties is MOFA's
basic working principle and attitude.</P>
      <P>In view of the ROC's difficult diplomatic situation, Chen said,
MOFA will not give up any chance of upgrading relations with other
countries.</P>
      <P>As for Lee's ongoing overseas trip, Chen said he had indeed
traveled to a country that does not recognize the ROC. "But he is not
in Vanuatu to discuss issues related to upgrading bilateral ties," he
added.</P>
      <P>Because of Beijing's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, the ROC
currently maintains formal diplomatic ties with only 29 countries,
most of which are located in Latin America, Africa and the Pacific
Ocean.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's leading research institute
announced Thursday that it had adjusted the economic growth rate this
year for the island after days of stock market slump and decreased
investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Economics of Academia Sinica adjusted the
economic growth rate for this year to 6.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The non-profit Chang-Hwa Institute for Economic Research had
earlier adjusted economic growth this year to 6.41 percent, down by
almost 0.2 percent. The Directorate Generate of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics is also expected to lower its forecast of the economic
growth rate to around 6.4 percent next month.</P>
      <P>The Institute of Economics had predicted in July that economic
growth this year would be 6.44 percent, but as economic recovery has
not been as good as predicted, it had to adjust the figure downwards.</P>
      <P>Institute Director Hu Teh-cheng said that in anticipation of the
entry of both sides of the Taiwan Strait into the World Trade
Organization, many traditional industries in Taiwan have moved to the
mainland, while some technology industries have also tried to move to
the mainland, which he described as an inevitable trend.</P>
      <P>He said that the domestic economic situation is still good, but
added that as the fourth quarter will not be as optimistic as
originally predicted, the institute had to adjust its predication
downwards.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that economic growth next year will hinge on the

DEBATE OVER TAIWAN'S CONTROVERSIAL NUCLEAR PLANT HEATS UP</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA) The debate over the ongoing construction of
Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant continued to gather heat Thursday
as various factions within the ruling and opposition parties offered
diverse solutions to settle the controversial issue.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who serves concurrently
as a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang, confirmed that the
KMT has prepared a draft bill to guarantee that the fourth plant will
be Taiwan's last nuclear plant and set up a timetable to scrap the
existing three nuclear plants.</P>
      <P>The KMT apparently plans to introduce the bill if and when the
Cabinet officially announces its decision to stop administering the
budget for the plant's construction, which would effectively touch
off an open war between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
government and the KMT-majority legislature.</P>
      <P>Thursday's development came on the heels of a call at a DPP
Central Standing Committee meeting the previous day from newly
appointed Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen to his fellow DPP
members to "be prepared for a fight over the nuclear plant issue."</P>
      <P>Chiou's fighting words elicited a strong backlash from the KMT's
legislative caucus, which announced that it will also be ready to go
into battle and added that no one country in the world can simply
stop executing a budget that has been passed by the legislature,
because to do so is illegal.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party legislative caucus spokeswoman Lee
Ching-an also responded by saying that Chiou's words are a sign that
the DPP cannot seem to recognize the fact that it is a minority
government. She added that any budget that has been approved by the
legislature should continue to be carried out -- including the one
for the fourth nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>However, Hsu Tien-tsai, convener of the DPP's legislative caucus,
attempted to clarify his party's position by saying that the DPP has
"always maintained a humble attitude." He further expressed his hope
that the different party caucuses can arrive at a mutually acceptable
timetable for the Cabinet to make a final decision on the issue
before the opposition parties make good on their threat to freeze the
national budget bill for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>A consensus was reached at a meeting of the various caucuses
later in the day for the legislature to go ahead with evaluations and
general interpellations for the national budget because a DPP
legislator relayed a "tacit understanding" that the Cabinet will
decide on the issue by Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said that a national referendum may be the best
solution to the controversial issue. He added that the Cabinet should
first announce its policy decision of abolishing the fourth nuclear
plant, which could then be seconded by a vote by the entire
electorate.</P>
      <P>Hsu's offered solution was supported by a faction of the KMT.
Legislators of the so-called "E-generation" pointed out that a
referendum may be a feasible solution and added that the possibility
of the Cabinet being able to actually implement the KMT's prepared
draft bill to scrap the existing nuclear plants while upholding the
continued construction of the fourth plant is slim.</P>
      <P>The E-generation claimed that if the DPP actually respected the
law, it would not have proposed scrapping the fourth nuclear plant in
the first place. The KMT faction also announced its own draft bill
for a national referendum to decide the plant's fate.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
sincerely wants to hear the views of opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan when they meet Friday, a Presidential Office official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate his sincere wish to reconcile with Taiwan's
opposition parties, the official said that Chen has accepted the
KMT's demand to open the Chen-Lien meeting to the media.</P>
      <P>Last week, Chen held separate talks with People First Party
Chairman James Soong and New Party chief Hau Lun-pin to exchange
views on a broad range of issues.</P>
      <P>On those occasions, press conferences were held after the
closed-door meetings.</P>
      <P>Because Friday's meeting will be open to the media from beginning
to end, there will be no press conference afterward.</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lien meeting has drawn much public attention because of
the width of the policy gap between the KMT and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) over issues such as cross-strait ties,
economic and financial development, and whether to stop the fourth
nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>The KMT maintains a majority of the seats in the Legislative Yuan
and without the party's cooperation, it is hard for bills submitted
by Chen's government to get approved by the parliament.</P>
      <P>Chen's aide said that during his meeting with Lien, Chen may also
ask the KMT to let former Premier Vincent Siew, a KMT vice chairman,
represent the president at the informal leadership conference of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in Brunei next
month.</P>
      <P>The meeting, to be held at the Presidential Office, will be
attended by Presidential Secretary-General You Shi-kun and Deputy
Presidential Secretary-General Chen Che-nan on the DPP side, and by
KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng and the party's spokesman Jason
Hu on the KMT side.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER ROC PREMIER TO REPRESENT PRESIDENT AT APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has appointed
former Premier Vincent Siew to represent him at an informal
leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum, the Presidential Office announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, told a press
conference that Brunei, the host country of this year's APEC summit,
has agreed to Siew's presence at the annual leadership meeting on
behalf of Chen.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Chen has informed opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and Siew, a KMT vice chairman, of Brunei's consent to his
choice of proxy at the APEC summit scheduled for Nov. 15-16.</P>
      <P>"Siew has accepted President Chen's assignment," Yu said.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment, is one of the few international organizations which
simultaneously accept the Republic of China and mainland China as
full members.</P>
      <P>However, because of Beijing's opposition, the ROC president has
been unable to attend the annual APEC summit in person and has
instead had to name a delegate to represent him.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first president from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), originally appointed Vice Premier
Lai In-jaw to attend the 2000 APEC summit on his behalf. The
proposal, however, met strong opposition from Beijing and at Brunei's
request, Chen was forced to pick another proxy.</P>
      <P>This will be the third time that Siew has represented the ROC at
the annual APEC informal leadership meeting. During the KMT
government era, Siew represented former President Lee Teng-hui at the
1993 and 1994 APEC summits in his capacity as chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Siew is well-versed in trade, economic and financial affairs and
also once headed the Mainland Affairs Council, which charts Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>As the DPP and the KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May
20, are not fully consistent in their stances on the development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait, it remains to be seen how Chen
and Siew will work out terms regarding Siew's speeches at the APEC
summit, particularly those related to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu, also a former ROC foreign minister, said
Lien has agreed to Siew's attendance at the upcoming APEC summit on
Chen's behalf.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, asked whether Lien would discuss APEC-related issues
with Chen during a meeting scheduled for Friday, Hu said he could not
make such a prediction.</P>
      <P>As part of his efforts to promote inter-party rapprochement and
cooperation, Chen was scheduled to meet Lien at the Presidential
Office Friday in an open-door meeting to exchange views on a range of
issues.</P>
      <P>Chen held separate talks last week for the same purpose with the
top leaders of two other opposition parties -- People First Party
Chairman James Soong and New Party convener Hao Lung-pin.</P>
      <P>As the KMT still controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan, the
Chen-Lien meeting is expected to be the focus of much attention.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a Taiwan semiconductor giant
urged the government Thursday to open up to the mainland Chinese
market or face the stifling of Taiwan's industry.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC), made the remarks in
a speech on Taiwan's electronics industry.</P>
      <P>Chang said that there are two things crucial to the successful
development of Taiwan's industry in the future. One is to open up to
the mainland market or risk having the lifeline of its industry
stymied, adding that this is where Taiwan lags behind other nations
in terms of competitive edge.</P>
      <P>He described the second factor as the need to establish a
long-term steady policy and stable investment environment, adding
that the Taiwan stock market, although it boasts the fifth-largest
turnover of the world's bourses, is still not sound enough. He also
pointed out that it is very difficult for people in other countries
to find information about the Taiwan stock market.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the Taiwan stock market is like a casino,
which he said affects major shareholders' plans to have long-term
sustainable business management.</P>
      <P>He stressed that cross-strait tensions have to be eased, saying
that if the political situation is unstable, businesses will not be
able to obtain the best possible results even if they perform well,
which he said will certainly affect long term investment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official in the information industry said that it
would not be detrimental for the domestic information industry to
move to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ke Chi-sheng, deputy CEO of the Institute for Information
Industry, said that as long as high value-added information industry
stays in Taiwan, and conducts R&amp;D on forward-looking products, Taiwan
will still maintain its leading position.</P>
      <P>Ke made the remarks after reports said several leading domestic
information product manufacturers are planning to invest in the
mainland in anticipation of its imminent entry into the World Trade
Organization, which they see as a boon to the domestic information
industry.</P>
      <P>Ke said that Taiwan is presently the third-largest information
hardware producer in the world and it is expected to maintain growth
of over 10 percent.</P>
      <P>But, affected by a drop in demand for personal computers and the
ever-dropping price of computer products, Ke said Taiwan has to move
some of its low value-added information products, such as monitors
and peripherals, to the mainland so as to take advantage of the cheap
labor, land and technology talent there.</P>
      <P>He noted that the mainland's information industry grew by 30
percent last year and said its annual production could surpass that
of Taiwan this year, which could be attributed to Taiwan
manufacturers' setting up plants in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ke said that Taiwan's information industry should focus on
information appliances and imbedded software, as well as technology
related to e-commerce and mobile phones.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIRMAN TO ATTEND APEC MEETING WITH KMT HEAD'S BLESSING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China Premier Vincent
Siew said Thursday that he will do his best to accomplish the "very
important mission" of attending the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) summit on behalf of ROC President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Brunei, the host nation, formally notified the ROC Foreign
Ministry earlier in the day that it had accepted Siew as Chen's
envoy.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is currently a vice chairman of the opposition
Kuomintang, said through a member of his staff that he received the
blessing of KMT Chairman Lien Chan after Presidential
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun announced at an evening press
conference that Chen had appointed Siew to represent him during the
Nov. 15-16 informal leadership summit.</P>
      <P>According to Siew, Lien urged him to do his best "for the nation
and for the party."</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Siew told reporters that because he has no
consensus with Chen on issues such as "one China" and "the 1992
consensus," if he is to attend the APEC meeting on Chen's behalf,
authorization issues must be clarified before he participates in the
summit.</P>
      <P>However, he went on to say that APEC members have an overt
agreement not to discuss politics or bilateral relations, with talks
to focus on regional and multilateral economic cooperation instead.</P>
      <P>Siew attended the summit on behalf of former ROC President Lee
Teng-hui in 1993 and 1994 as chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development.</P>
      <P>Chen had originally named Vice Premier Lai In-jaw to attend the
conference, but Brunei later informed the ROC government that
Beijing's opposition to Lai's selection had put Brunei in an awkward
position.</P>
      <P>Although the Republic of China is a member of APEC, its president
has never rubbed shoulders with his APEC counterparts at the summit
due to opposition from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, threatened
to boycott the summit should the ROC president attend in person,
forcing Taiwan to settle for having a ministerial-level official at
the occasion.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment, is one of the few international organizations which
simultaneously accept the Republic of China and mainland China as
full members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALLIANCE  FORMED  TO  SUPPORT  `COMFORT  WOMEN' IN MOCK TRIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several private groups in Taiwan formed an
alliance Thursday afternoon to lend support to a number of local
"comfort women" during a mock "world court" scheduled to be held in
Tokyo in December.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Action Alliance to Support Comfort Women is made up of
members of various local groups, including the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation and the Taiwan Alliance of Medical Professionals.</P>
      <P>Wang Nien-tsu, a spokeswoman of the newly formed alliance, said
that to help the 100 members participate in the mock trial, it has
set a goal of raising NT$5 million (US$154,800).</P>
      <P>Wang said the alliance will launch a signature campaign between
1:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. at Taipei Railway Station Sunday to support
their cause and solicit donations.</P>
      <P>The trial session, to be held Dec. 8-12 in Tokyo, is to be
sponsored by a voluntary Japanese civic organization called The
Violence Against Women Brought by War.</P>
      <P>Two former "comfort women" from Taiwan, mainland China, Korea,
the Philippines, Indonesia and the Netherlands will make
representations in the court accusing Japan of war crimes and its
government of irresponsibility.</P>
      <P>During the mock court session, prosecutors from the six countries
will submit bills of indictment and the comfort women will give their
accounts of the accusations.</P>
      <P>A verdict to be handed down by the court on Dec. 12, though
non-binding in nature, will be jointly reached by law experts from
the six nations and Japan and will become a historical record.</P>
      <P>In addition to the 12 former comfort women, now in their 70's or
80's, more than 300 people from six nations, together with 700 from
Japan, mostly human rights activists, will attend the session.</P>
      <P>More than 200,000 young women from Taiwan, mainland China, South
Korea, North Korea, the Philippines and Indonesia were abducted by
the Japanese and forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese
Imperial Army some 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>According to an investigative report released early last year by
National Taiwan University lecturers Lee Kai-min and Chiang Mei-fen,
between 1932 and 1945 in Taiwan alone, nearly 2,000 women were sent
by the Japanese to military brothels in Southeast Asia and Okinawa.</P>
      <P>The report noted that although half a century has passed, the
comfort women are still suffering, with half of them divorced or
never having married, while 60 percent of them were rendered
infertile as a result of their brutal treatment.</P>
      <P>Until 1992, the Japanese government denied that its military was
involved in running frontline brothels during the war, and even
though it later admitted the existence of the brothels, it has
refused to apologize or provide compensation to the surviving comfort
women, saying that all questions of compensation have already been
settled with the nations concerned.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government instead set up a private Asian Women's
Fund in June 1995 which offers to give each surviving comfort woman 2
million yen (about US$17,000) in compensation.</P>
      <P>However, most of the surviving women, including those from
Taiwan, have turned down the offer because the money comes from
private donations rather than from the Japanese government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPEACHED FORMER NAVY TOP BRASS DISPUTES CHARGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Commander-in-Chief of the Navy
Admiral Yeh Chang-tung claimed Thursday that he has been falsely
accused in an impeachment brought against him Tuesday by the Control
Yuan.</P>
      <P>In a defense of his role in choosing the French-made
Lafayette-class missile frigate in preference to the South
Korea-manufactured Ulsan frigate in 1989 as the navy's backbone, Yeh
said the Lafayette frigate is superior to Ulsan in its anti-submarine
and anti-blockade capabilities.</P>
      <P>Although the navy initially intended to buy 16 2,000-ton Ulsans
to replace its aging fleet, its evaluation revealed that the
Lafayettes would also meet the needs of the force, Yeh said at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the comment to dispute the impeachment's charges that
the Lafayettes, a blue-sea warship with a displacement of 3,000 tons,
did not suit the navy's needs, considering the geography of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As to allegations that he deliberately concealed the navy's
switch from Ulsans to Lafayettes and kept then-President Lee Teng-hui
in dark, Yeh said Lee was fully aware of the decision change and was
kept informed of the entire purchase process.</P>
      <P>Yeh said he personally reported to Lee at a military conference
on Dec. 18, 1990, about the initiation of a letter of intent with
French authorities on the purchase of six Lafayettes, and was
directed by Lee "to negotiate with France aggressively and wrap up
the contract as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>Lee's directions were recorded in the conference minutes stored
at the General Staff Headquarters, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>He also argued that the navy did not inflate the price tag of the
Lafayettes as accused by the impeachment papers, but that it rather
listed a higher price in the budget to account for possible
fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate.</P>
      <P>Even the higher price listed in the budget had to be revised
upward seven times from NT$4 billion apiece to NT$15.1 billion
(US$125 million to US$471.87 million), because the navy, as well as
the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology, which designed the
weapons system for the warship, constantly revised the specifications
of the ship to counter the rapid increasing military force of
Beijing, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He said he was sure that no kickbacks were involved in the
purchase of the hulls of the six Lafayettes while he was at the helm
of naval headquarters.</P>
      <P>The retired admiral said that the members of the Control Yuan
presiding over the hearing of the case seemed prejudiced against him,
summoning him while he did not feel well and refusing his request
afterward for a chance to explain the details of the case.</P>
      <P>Branding the impeachment the "most bitter insult" he has ever
suffered in his military career, Yeh compared himself as Yue Fei, an
ancient Chinese general who was framed by a treacherous minister and
killed by the emperor.</P>
      <P>Yeh and two retired vice-admirals were impeached Tuesday for
their alleged inappropriate implementation of the navy's acquirement
of Lafayettes.</P>
      <P>The impeached will answer the charges before the Committee on the
Discipline of Public Functionaries. Given the fact that all of them
are retired, a guilty verdict from the committee will do no harm to
them other then compromising their honor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ordered six Lafayettes from France in 1991 at about US$2.8
billion. A scandal surrounding the deal erupted in Paris in
1998, when big kickbacks involved in the sales came to light.</P>
      <P>Former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who approved the
sales in 1991, was investigated under the suspicion of having
received bribes for the contract.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to look into the sale after the French authorities
opened their judicial investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL NOT INCUR FINANCIAL TURMOIL: FINANCE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not incur financial turmoil in
light of various economic indicators, but the rise of overdue loans
and the bubble in the domestic construction sector are alarming
signs, Finance Minister Yen Ching-chang said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks while calling on the Taiwan Alliance, a
political faction in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Ho Chih-hui, a Legislative Yuan party whip of the opposition
Kuomintang, said that despite government measures such as deferring
payment of enterprise loans that transfers the risk to financial
institutions, there will probably be financial turmoil within six
months.</P>
      <P>In reply, Yen cited various economic statistics to back his claim
that no financial turmoil will occur in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said domestically oriented financial turmoil mainly occurs in
nations with long-term unfavorable balance of trade, such as
Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>Typical phenomena of these nations are that their debt-raising
accounts for a very high percentage of gross domestic product (GDP)
and their economies' fundamentals are not good, he said.</P>
      <P>Yen further pointed out that Japan, despite having high foreign
exchange reserves, has had zero economic growth for many years. This,
plus a great deal of loans to Southeast Asian nations that are hard
to collect on, resulted in financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, he
said, adding that basically, Japan is a victim of the Southeast Asian
turmoil that broke out in 1997.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has enjoyed trade surpluses in two-way trade
with many nations, owns a lot of foreign exchange reserves, maintains
economic growth rate between five to six percent, and has very low
debt-raising. These factors, he went on, make the likelihood of
Taiwan suffering financial turmoil very slim.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, FRANCE TO STEP UP PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>France and Taiwan will step up their
cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights, said
Republic of China official Chen Ming-pang on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen, the director general of the Intellectual Property Office
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, made the remarks after
concluding consultations with his French counterpart Philippine
Hangard in western France.</P>
      <P>Chen said that both sides discussed the two countries' laws and
regulations concerning intellectual property rights protection and
their implementation during the consultations.</P>
      <P>Chen said that France and Taiwan will step up their cooperation
in the protection of trade marks and patents, respect intellectual
property rights of all forms of industrial technology, and further
protect the rights of consumers.</P>
      <P>The consultations were held in western France's rich brandy
producing region. Chen, accompanied by Hangard, visited French brandy
cellars to learn how France establishes its spirit brands and also
how the spirits are assessed and classified.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that French wine has always been popular with Taiwan
consumers, but he added that some rogue businessmen have tried to
sell wine falsely labeled as French for profits at the expense of
consumers.</P>
      <P>Consultations on this problem have led to an agreement between
both sides to set up a comprehensive certification system under which
the original information of all trade mark and brand wines will be
provided in order to protect the image of French spirit manufacturers
and the rights of Taiwan consumers.</P>
      <P>Although trade marks for wines and liquors were the focus of this
year's consultations, both sides also exchanged views on patent
protection of biotechnology and aerospace technology.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the strengthened patent and copyright
protection will increase the advanced countries' trust in the Taiwan
market, promote bilateral understanding, facilitate technology
cooperation and transfers, and promote the upgrading of Taiwan's
industries.</P>
      <P>To step up the crackdown on imitation products and to increase
cooperation in the protection of intellectual property rights,
Hangard will visit Taipei on December 8 to preside over a seminar,
during which he will explain the French approach to the protection of
intellectual property rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP THREATENS TO TOPPLE CABINET IF NUKE PLANT PROJECT SCRAPPED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party on Friday
threatened to dissolve the Cabinet by calling for a motion of
no-confidence if and when the Cabinet announces the scrapping of the
fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>The PFP party caucus at the Legislative Yuan made the vow to
topple the Cabinet only a couple of hours before Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung made a surprise announcement at noon that the
administration has decided to call a permanent halt to the project
based on six major reasons, taking the legislature as well as the
public by surprise.</P>
      <P>After heated debates on the controversial project Thursday at the
Legislative Yuan, lawmakers from the ruling and opposition parties
reached a "tacit understanding" that the Cabinet would decide on the
issue by Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>At a national affairs forum at the Legislative Yuan Friday
morning, PFP Legislator Chen Chen-sheng said that scrapping the
fourth nuclear power plant project would be "seriously illegal"
because the project was passed by the legislature years ago and that
such a move would necessitate the opposition parties to take urgent
steps to hold a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus spokeswoman, Lee Ching-an, also said
Friday morning that halting construction on the US$5.6 billion
nuclear power plant would violate the Republic of China Constitution
and would be in blatant disregard of the people's will and the
opinions of the opposition parties as well as many academics and
experts.</P>
      <P>Arguing that any budget that has been approved by the legislature
should continue to be carried out, including the one for the fourth
nuclear power plant, Lee said a motion of no-confidence would be
exercised as soon as the Cabinet were to announce the scrapping of
the project.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Wang Tien-ching reminded the Democratic
Progressive Party-led administration not to forget that it is only a
minority government and that the DPP is only a minority party in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang urged the opposition Kuomingtang, which has a majority in
the legislature, to "stand up" bravely against the DPP-controlled
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"The Kuomintang cannot say it is qualified to be the ruling party
if it does not dare to voice its opposition to such a critical
decision," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, the Kuomintang legislative party
whip, declined to voice support for the PFP no-confidence proposal,
despite the fact that some KMT legislators publicly seconded the PFP
proposal at the Legislative Yuan national affairs forum.</P>
      <P>Tseng said a no-confidence vote would be improper now that
Taiwan's political situation has already become chaotic since the
DPP-led administration of Chen Shui-bian was inaugurated on May 20.</P>
      <P>Tseng stressed that the KMT would not cast a no-confidence vote
against Premier Chang Chun-hsiung and his administration even if the
move would benefit the KMT.</P>
      <P>Instead, he noted, the KMT will take a lawful approach towards
finding a solution to the disputes over the fourth nuclear power
plant project.</P>
      <P>The KMT will propose a draft bill on nuclear power utility in the
Taiwan area, suggesting that construction on the fourth nuclear power
plant be completed, the three existing nuclear power plants be
scrapped when their operating life spans come to an end, and that no
new nuclear power plants be built in Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at least three KMT lawmakers voiced support for the
PFP's call for a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Ching-chih said he supports the no-confidence
move, adding that President Chen Shui-bian should first be recalled
before the Cabinet is toppled by a no-confidence vote in the name of
justice for the legislature and the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Shyh-bao, convenor of the opposition New Party
legislative caucus, said the New Party does not oppose the
no-confidence motion in principle, but would think about it carefully
before making such a move.</P>
      <P>Toppling the Cabinet, which may possibly lead to President Chen
dissolving the Legislative Yuan, would be too great a cost to society
and would likely sink the whole country into unrest, Lai pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET ANNOUNCES HALT TO 4TH NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced a
decision Friday to halt construction of the island's fourth nuclear
power plant, saying the move is the only choice for building
a nuclear-free homeland.</P>
      <P>"We must make a rational, responsible and conscientious choice
for the well-being of our descendants and the only planet of the
mankind, and the choice is that we must cease construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant," Chang told a press conference.</P>
      <P>Chang said the decision may not be able to satisfy all local
people at the moment. "But I'm convinced that some day we can
tell our offspring that we once bravely made the right choice for
Taiwan," the premier said confidently.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lai In-jaw, Cabinet Secretary-General Chiou I-jen,
Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi, Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, Chen
Po-chih, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, Lin Chuan, director-general of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics, and Atomic Energy Council Chairman Hsia Der-yu were
present at the news conference to throw their weight behind the
decision.</P>
      <P>Chang cited six reasons to back the decision -- the scrapping of
the fourth nuclear power plant will not cause domestic power
shortages; concrete, feasible alternatives to the nuclear power
plant are available; there is still no proper ways to resolve
the thorny nuclear waste disposal problem; management of any nuclear
disaster is no easy task; the loss to be caused by a halt to the
fourth nuclear power plant project is lower than the cost needed for
continued construction of the plant; and the government is
determined to develop Taiwan into a nuclear-free "green
silicon island."</P>
      <P>In his statement, Chang stressed that the security issue
surrounding the nuclear power plant is not just an economic problem,
but rather a problem related to the lives of the 23 million residents
on this island.</P>
      <P>Chang further reminded local people that disposal of radioactive
waste from nuclear power plants is not easily soluble. There is
still no proper way for permanent disposal of nuclear waste, he
added.</P>
      <P>As for domestic power supply, Chang said even no alternative
measures are taken following the termination of the fourth nuclear
power plant, Taiwan will not face a power shortage in seven years.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government has drawn up a comprehensive package
of measures as alternative to the nuclear power plant, including
encouraging private investment in construction of more fossil fuel
power plants and promoting liberalization of the power generation
industry.</P>
      <P>Quoting an estimate by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Chang
said the government would have to invest an additional NT$120
billion (US$3.8 billion) if construction of the fourth nuclear power
plant were to be continued. "Moreover, we would have to spend a
still-incalculable-amount of money for nuclear waste disposal," he
added.</P>
      <P>Chang said the decision to halt the fourth nuclear power
plant was made after a prudent review of all possible issues. "We
hope that all major domestic political parties and the general
public will throw their support behind the decision and work
together with the government to sustain Taiwan's economic
development and build a nuclear-free environment," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDUSTRY EXPRESSES SHOCK OVER ANNOUNCEMENT TO SCRAP NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of Taiwan's industrial
sector expressed their shock over Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's
surprise announcement Friday at noon that the fourth nuclear power
plant project will be halted for good.</P>
      <P>Members of the Chinese National Federation of Industries
complained vehemently about the Cabinet not demonstrating any sense
of justice nor integrity concerning the controversial and
much-debated project.</P>
      <P>Noting that the six major reasons Premier Chang stated for
scrapping the project were unjustifiable, particularly the expressed
reason that "the alternative plan is highly viable," they lambasted
the administration by saying that "in trying to deceive others, it
has only ended up deceiving itself."</P>
      <P>The CNFI has long been noted for its determination to prevent
energy cost increases and to prevent power shortages from occurring
in Taiwan's industrial sector.</P>
      <P>Wu Si-chung, chairman of the Taiwan Electrical and Electronics
Manufacturers Association, said Chang's announcement about scrapping
the fourth nuclear power plant project is absolutely unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Terming it a sheer "reckless decision," Wu said the Cabinet
should make sure that alternative plans are totally feasible and that
the costs incurred from scrapping the project are not transferred to
the industrial sector and the general public before it makes such a
shocking and far-reaching decision.</P>
      <P>Voices from the semiconductor industry, Taiwan's flagship and
cash cow industry, expressed helplessness over Chang's announcement.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Taiwan Semiconductor Industrial Association
said scrapping the fourth nuclear power plant would double the
uncertainty factors regarding investor's willingness to invest.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the probability of semiconductor manufacturers,
both domestic and foreign, locating their production lines in Taiwan
will increasingly diminish in the wake of the government's decision.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu Cheng-tah, vice president of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co., one of the world's leading silicon wafer
foundries, said the fourth nuclear power plant is required to meet
the energy needs of the semiconductor industry, which requires a
steady supply of high-quality power that only nuclear power plants
can provide.</P>
      <P>The costs to the nation of scrapping the project will be much
higher than completing the plant if one factors in the social costs
and the costs to the industrial sector, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Noting that none of the government's alternative plans are
viable, Hu said it would be a natural development if members of
Taiwan's high-technology industry relocate their operations abroad
one after another.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DEMANDS IMPEACHMENT FOR PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang Legislative caucus called
Friday for the Control Yuan to impeach Premier Chang Chun-hsiung for
his announcement of the scrapping of the fourth nuclear power plant
project, a move the KMT termed "illegal and impairing the public
interest."</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators demanded the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest
watchdog body, to impeach Chang as his announcement "violated the ROC
Constitution and was illegal and invalid" because continuation of the
construction of the nuclear plant was an issue passed by the
legislature years ago, said Hung Yu-ching, executive director of the
KMT's Policy Coordination Committee.</P>
      <P>"No country in the world can simply stop executing a budget that
has been passed by the legislature, because to do so is illegal,"
Hung noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, he maintained, a motion proposed by the
then-opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to overturn the
KMT-initiated decision to build the plant was rejected by the
Legislative Yuan two years ago, making Chang's announcement of the
scrapping doubly illegal.</P>
      <P>Hung stressed, however, that even if a no-confidence motion would
benefit the KMT, the former ruling party will never call a
no-confidence vote to topple the Cabinet, saying that as the DPP has
already led the country into chaos since it became the ruling party
in May this year, toppling the shaky Cabinet would be rubbing salt
into the wound.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan members Lee You-chi and Lin Shih-chi received the
appeal made by Hung and around 10 other KMT members and promised that
they will look into the case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, the KMT legislative party whip,
lambasted the ruling DPP as "ridiculously insolent and mad" for
making the announcement at "a bad time" -- immediately after KMT
Chairman Lien Chan's talks with President Chen Shui-bian about the
fourth nuclear power plant project in an ostensible fence-mending
meeting that same morning.</P>
      <P>Noting that the announcement will certainly whip up a political
and economic storm in Taiwan, Tseng said the DPP had better brace
itself to face "growing economic inertia, social unrest and people's
anxiety" in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman and former Premier Vincent Siew described
Chang's Friday surprise announcement of the scrapping of the fourth
nuclear power plant as an "unwise and reckless" decision.</P>
      <P>He said the government will have to bear all the repercussions of
the long-debated case because it made the decision unilaterally
without reaching consensus with opposition parties and without coming
up with any viable alternative plans.</P>
      <P>The KMT secretary-general also blasted the Cabinet for playing
what he described as "a double-handed scheme" and for demonstrating
"not the slight sense of sincerity."</P>
      <P>"How could President Chen, as smart as he is, allow a stupid
thing like this to happen?" he asked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>STOPPING CONSTRUCTION OF NUKE PLANT `UNWISE:' FORMER PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China Premier Vincent
Siew described the government's decision Friday to stop the
construction of the fourth nuclear power plant as "incomplete and
reckless."</P>
      <P>Siew, who has been appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as his
special envoy at the informal summit of the 2000 Asian Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum scheduled to be held in Brunei on
Nov. 15-16, said the Chen administration will have to bear the
consequences of its decision.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the government's decision was "incomplete and
reckless" as the government did not prepare sufficient alternative
measures to the controversial power plant.</P>
      <P>However, he disagreed with a proposal to topple the Cabinet
because it would bring political turmoil to Taiwan and affect
national economic development.</P>
      <P>Unless private power plants can begin operations within the next
several years, he went on, the Chen administration's promise that
Taiwan will not lack electricity in the next seven years will not be
enough to convince local businesses.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an interview with a local radio station, Siew
said that the decision to stop construction of the plant will also
affect the local stock market.</P>
      <P>He called on the government to use effective actions, not words,
to speed up economic development. If the people lack confidence,
economic development will decline, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>He also cited the Bayer investment case in Taichung, claiming
that there has been "no major foreign investment in Taiwan" since the
Bayer investment case failed in 1998.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that halting construction of the fourth nuclear
power plant will also prompt more local enterprises move from Taiwan
to mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER TO FORM TASK FORCE TO HANDLE NUCLEAR PLANT ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) said Friday it
will immediately halt construction of the island's fourth nuclear
power plant in line with the government's decision to scrap the
controversial project.</P>
      <P>The state-run company made the statement after Premier Chang
Chun-hsiung announced at noon that his Cabinet had decided to cancel
the fourth nuclear power plant project to protect future generations
from possible radiation contamination.</P>
      <P>"Taipower will abide by the government's decision to stop
construction of the plant," Taipower Chairman Hsi Shih-chi said at a
press conference, adding that the company will form a special task
force to handle the halting of the project and its consequences.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a budget of NT$125.5 billion (US$3.98
billion) for the project in July 1994. Of this amount, some NT$50
billion has already been spent on the plant, which is about one-third
complete. According to the current budgetary regulations, Taipower
will have to return the remaining budget to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said they are worried about the budget needed
for compensating foreign suppliers of nuclear power generation
equipment following the halting of the project. According to their
estimates, Taipower will need NT$30 billion to NT$90.3 billion for
compensating relevant equipment suppliers.</P>
      <P>Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Boston-based Stone and
Webster Engineering Corp. and General Electric Co. are supplying the
two 1,350-megawatt boiling water reactors for the plant.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said they will try to re-sell the equipment to
reduce their losses. However, they admitted that it will not be easy
to find suitable buyers.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taipower will raise electricity rates to offset its
financial losses incurred from the halting of the project, Taipower
Chairman Hsi did not make a direct response, saying only that it will
depend on whether the government demands that Taipower absorb the
compensation cost.</P>
      <P>In fact, Hsi said, an across-the-board power rate hike is long
overdue because fuel costs have increased significantly in recent
years due to rises in oil and natural gas prices.</P>
      <P>As an alternative to the fourth nuclear power plant, Hsi said
Taipower will take active measures in support of the government's
policy of encouraging private investment in construction of more
fossil fuel power plants to ensure sufficient domestic electricity
supplies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
announced Friday it will file a no-confidence motion against the
Cabinet and another motion to suggest that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung
be impeached.</P>
      <P>The PFP party caucus at the Legislative Yuan made the
announcement at a press conference to blast the decision earlier in
the day to scrap construction of the fourth nuclear power plant and
also urged "conscientious and intelligent" legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the other opposition parties
to support the PFP move.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chen Chen-sheng said at the press conference that
it is illegal to halt construction of the plant and it is
unjustifiable for the Cabinet not to carry out the plant's
already-passed budget simply on the grounds that the ruling party has
changed.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, PFP spokesperson at the Legislative Yuan, said the
suspension of the construction of the plant will have an adverse
effect on political stability. Faced with "a government which abuses
its power," the PFP must exercise its right to bring no-confidence
and impeachment motions "on behalf of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Discontent with the opposition Kuomintang's attitude toward the
Cabinet's scrapping of the plant, several PFP legislators urged the
KMT to support the motions to topple the Cabinet and impeach Chang.</P>
      <P>According to the KMT, however, toppling the Cabinet would waste a
great deal of time and would have an adverse effect on social and
political stability and the party will not do anything that will
result in social and political instability.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei wondered why the KMT did not insist
on its policy to build the plant and urged the KMT to safeguard its
stance on the nuclear project.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Wang Tein-ging said that now that the KMT is a
majority party in the Legislative Yuan, it should stand bravely to
maintain the welfare of the people of Taiwan and the dignity of law.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chin Huei-chu said it is shameful that the Cabinet
has failed to respect the Legislative Yuan's decision to construct
the plant made when the KMT was in power.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT RESPECTS CABINET DECISION TO HALT NUKE PLANT PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian respects the
Cabinet's decision to halt construction of the controversial fourth
nuclear power plant, Presidential Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun said
Friday.</P>
      <P>According to a Presidential Office press release, Yu said that
Chen understands the decision, announced earlier in the day, was made
with the country and the people's long-term best interests in mind
and that the reasons behind the decision are "fairly adequate."</P>
      <P>Yu said that Premier Chang Chun-hsiung had fully explained the
decision-making process behind the announcement to Chen days ago and
pledged that the country will not be at risk of a shortage of
electric power once the plant is scrapped. Yu also quoted Chang as
saying that the opinions from all sides were heard and that
professional assessments were heeded.</P>
      <P>The top presidential aide went on to say that Chang also promised
all alternative plans to the nuclear plant will be "absolutely
feasible" and will not adversely effect the country's economic
development.</P>
      <P>From the information provided by the Cabinet, Yu said that a
nuclear power plant can generate electricity for 30 or 40 years but
leaves behind a large amount of nuclear waste material. He added that
even if a nuclear disaster does not occur in Taiwan, nuclear power is
not a cheap source of energy. Furthermore, he went on, just a single
disaster would be destructive to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that advocating a halt to the plant's construction
in the current political reality is not beneficial to Chang's Cabinet
because he will face immense pressure from the legislature, where the
opposition has a majority.</P>
      <P>However, Chang's final decision to scrap the plant shows his
courage and wisdom, Yu said, adding that it also shows that the
anti-nuclear policy is "definitely not an insistence on a political
party's private wishes or ideologies, but for the benefit of future
generations and to shoulder the historic responsibility of living on
this piece of land."</P>
      <P>Because Chang's announcement came hot on the heels of a historic
meeting between the president and Lien Chan, chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang, that took place only hours earlier, the KMT
accused Chen of "double-dealing" and called into question whether
Chen had known beforehand that the Cabinet was going to announce the
decision.</P>
      <P>A presidential aide denied the allegations and said that a tacit
understanding had existed between Chen and Chang for a decision to be
announced in the near term, but that Chen did not tell Chang when to
make the announcement.</P>
      <P>The aide asked people "not to politicize" the circumstances. He
went on to say that the Cabinet is under a lot of pressure and that
whether the announcement was made Friday, Saturday, or next week, it
would still come under fire.</P>
      <P>He added that certain effects can be foreseen -- including a
stock market plunge -- but asked the opposition parties not to use
extreme measures such as toppling the Cabinet before evaluating the
consequences of such actions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTEL CEO PROMOTES TECHNOLOGY TRAINING FOR TAIWAN TEACHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Intel Chief Executive Officer Craig Barrett
announced on Friday his company's plans to include Taiwan in its
"Intel Teach to the Future" project, which will give 10,000 local
teachers technology training to improve the quality of education.</P>
      <P>Barrett, who met in Taipei with Republic of China Education
Minister Ovid Tseng, pointed out that students in the era of
"knowledge-based economy" must learn to innovate and express
themselves, the key to which rests in education and begins with
teachers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he continued, teachers must incorporate the effective
use of technology in the classroom and learn critical thinking in
order to combine knowledge and life experience, which can then be
taught to the next generation so that the students can learn
independent thinking and analysis.</P>
      <P>Tseng agreed with Barrett's assessment and noted that Taiwan
students still lag behind in such abilities, which Tseng said are
necessary in today's industries.</P>
      <P>Barrett said that Intel will provide the equipment, the
curriculum planning, and the millions of U.S. dollars in funding so
that 10,000 elementary and middle school teachers can learn essential
computer skills through 40 hours of lessons and 20 hours of
self-study. The project is scheduled to begin in the latter half of
next year and will take approximately three years to complete.</P>
      <P>According to Barrett, Intel is promoting the project around the
world, with as much as US$100 million invested in the training of
400,000 teachers in countries including the United States, mainland
China and India.</P>
      <P>Regarding the mass exodus of Taiwan high-tech manufacturing
companies to mainland China, Barrett said it is not a crisis because
companies move out to areas of lower production cost as a global
trend. He added that as long as Taiwan can upgrade its industries
from manufacturing-based to design-based, it should be able to cope
with the situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOLDS MEETING WITH KMT CHAIRMAN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
and opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan held their first meeting
Friday since Chen's election in March, in which Lien urged Chen to
convene a National Unification Council (NUC) meeting.</P>
      <P>Lien said that if Chen can restore the NUC's original
responsibility and mission, he would be willing to take part in the
meeting on behalf of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Lien is the last of three major opposition leaders to meet with
Chen. The president met last week with James Soong, chairman of the
People First Party (PFP) and Hao Lung-bin, convenor of the National
Committee of Campaign and Development of the New Party.</P>
      <P>As requested by the KMT, the meeting was broadcast live on TV.
Also on hand were Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president;
Chen Che-nan, deputy secretary-general to the president; Lin
Feng-cheng, secretary-general of the Central Committee of the KMT;
and KMT spokesman Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait relations dominated the much-hyped meeting,
which went on for two hours rather than the originally planned one
hour, although both men also touched on the domestic financial and
economic situation, shortened working hours, the domestic energy
problem and the controversial fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Lien said cross-strait relations should be based on peace,
stability and development, should not jeopardize the status quo,
should not be provocative, and should seek positive exchanges on a
rational basis.</P>
      <P>Lien said that although Chen promised during his inauguration
speech that there would be no question of abolishing NUC and National
Unification Guidelines, the NUC exists now only in name and not in
substance.</P>
      <P>He said the NUC clearly defines cross-strait relations in the
belief that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait may have disputes over
their systems, but never on the issues of national unification or
independence.</P>
      <P>Lien said that if the president will restore the original
responsibilities and mission of the NUC, he would like to represent
the KMT at NUC meetings.</P>
      <P>Chen for his part stressed that a National Development Conference
meeting four years ago decided to set up an advisory group on
cross-strait relations, and added that a book published by Lien
during the presidential campaign also appealed for the convening of a
supra-party team, which became the basis of forming the President's
Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations headed by Lee Yuan-tseh,
respected Nobel laureate and president of Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed hope that Lien would take part in this advisory
group.</P>
      <P>The president said that he set the tone for the policy toward the
mainland in his inaugural speech, which is that leaders on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait should use wisdom and creatively to deal with
the question of a future "one China."</P>
      <P>Lien said that the NUC is in itself a supra-party organization,
and that because the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) would not
attend the council meeting, the KMT government suggested setting up
other consultation organizations. But as the DPP is now in power, he
continued, there is no need for an overlap, and he urged the
president "to show leadership" by convening a NUC meeting.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait did reach an
agreement in 1992, adding that Taipei told Beijing in October that
although both sides agreed on "one China," they had different views
about its interpretation. In November, Beijing responded that it
would accept "separate interpretations" of "one China."</P>
      <P>He added that if it is not agreeable to the president to use "one
China, separate interpretations," the term could be replaced by "the
1992 agreement." He said that this could be a basis for cross-strait
dialogue.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The controversial fourth nuclear power plant was another subject
on which the two sides failed to find common ground.</P>
      <P>Lien suggested decommissioning the island's older first, second
and third nuclear power plants while continuing construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant, with the understanding that this would be
the island's last.</P>
      <P>He claimed that northern Taiwan will lack 2,100 megawatts of
electricity by 2005, and that southern Taiwan will need 3.7 million
tons of water in 2006, but can only obtain 2 million tons of water.
As alternative energy sources are not clear, he went on, it will
affect investors' decisions to invest in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as the power capacity of the first and second
nuclear power plants will surpass that of the fourth, there is no
reason to continue with its construction.</P>
      <P>Chen said that a report by the Ministry of Economic Affairs has
clearly stated that northern Taiwan will not be short of electricity
in seven years, and that suggesting construction of new nuclear
plants to replace old ones is a blinkered attitude.</P>
      <P>On Lien's criticism that the misery index on the island has risen
since Chen's administration took office, Chen said that this is
because a majority of the people still cannot adjust to the political
changeover, saying that the top priority is to stabilize cross-strait
and foreign relations and then continue to develop the economy.</P>
      <P>He said that many of the problems did not arise in one day, but
have accumulated over a long period of years and that it is
unreasonable to expect a new government to solve them in a short
time.</P>
      <P>Lien also suggested that the president convene a national
industrial conference to learn and help solve the difficulties faced
by industry.</P>
      <P>He said the industrial conference could discuss which industries
should be upgraded, which have no chance of being upgraded and must
undergo transformation, and which are too costly and should move
overseas to survive.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he would ask related government agencies to
prepare for such a meeting.</P>
      <P>In light of the domestic investment environment, Lien also
suggested that the president consider putting off for two years the
implementation of an 84-hour two-week work period bill scheduled for
next year, to which Chen replied that as the bill was first proposed
by the KMT, the KMT should consult within the Legislative Yuan for
any changes.</P>
      <P>He said he had no ideas on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed the hope that Lien would use his clout to
support the government's crackdown on "black gold," or government
links with organized crime, as well as the anti-corruption campaign,
in the legislative election next year.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed that the crackdown on "black gold" was the
established stance of the KMT and a national consensus, but he also
urged Chen's government to respect procedural justice, human rights
and journalistic freedom in the process of the crackdown.</P>

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Foreign Ministry
announced Friday that the first batch of draftees to be posted to
Taiwan's overseas technical missions as an alternative to military
service will be ready by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>Huang Nan-huei, director-general of the ministry's Department of
Economic and Trade Affairs, said at a routine press conference that
the Cabinet officially approved adding "diplomatic service" as a new
category of alternative military service on Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang said that applications will be accepted for an estimated 35
vacancies beginning May 2001. Approved draftees will begin five weeks
of basic military training in August, followed by three months of
foreign language and specialization training, he added.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that they will be ready to be shipped abroad in
December to serve as assistants in anywhere from five to seven of
Taiwan's 40 overseas technical missions, which are located in 34
countries.</P>
      <P>Huang said that most of the first batch will be sent to Taiwan's
allies in Central America and Africa.</P>
      <P>Because the difficulty of supervising the draftees will increase
due to their overseas work locations, Huang said that his ministry is
working on drawing up measures, with initial designs leaning toward
giving the ROC embassies -- particularly military attaches --
complete authority over the draftees.</P>
      <P>Huang added that a total of NT$16 million (US$496,000) has
already been allocated to cover the cost of air tickets and overseas

    <HEADLINE>EX-ROC PREMIER'S PRESENCE AT APEC SUMMIT UNCERTAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Vincent Siew's attendance at
an upcoming summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum on behalf of President Chen Shui-bian has become uncertain as
Siew's party had not endorsed the arrangement as of Friday.</P>
      <P>Siew is a vice chairman of the Kuomintang, which ruled Taiwan for
55 years until May 20 and now still controls a majority in the
Legislative Yuan. The KMT decided to re-evaluate whether to allow
Siew to represent Chen at the APEC summit following the Chen
administration's announcement of a halt to the construction of the
island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announced the decision to scrap the
controversial plant just half an hour after Chen, a stalwart of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), held talks with KMT Chairman Lien
Chan on a range of issues facing the country, including whether to
continue construction of the fourth nuclear power plant in Kungliao,
a coastal township in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many KMT Central Standing Committee (CSC) members and legislators
were angered by the DPP-led government's anti-nuclear decision and
the timing of its announcement of the decision. They said the timing
of the announcement signified Chen's insincerity in wishing to
promote inter-party rapprochement and cooperation and suggested that
the party have second thoughts on whether to approve Siew's
attendance at the APEC summit.</P>
      <P>Siew said he agreed to Chen's appointment mainly based on the
consideration of national interests. "I would be pleased to accept
the assignment, but only with my party's consent," Siew said, adding
that he would leave the decision to Lien's discretion.</P>
      <P>Lien told Chen Thursday that he agreed in principle to Siew's
attendance at the APEC summit but that he would have to further
discuss the issue with the party's CSC members.</P>
      <P>After listening to suggestions from Siew and the CSC, Lien said
he would make a final decision after further observation of the DPP
government's actions following its announcement of the halt to the
plant's construction.</P>
      <P>APEC, a regional forum dedicated to promoting free trade and
investment, is one of the few international organizations which
simultaneously accept the Republic of China and mainland China as
full members.</P>
      <P>However, because of Beijing's opposition, the ROC president has
been unable to attend the annual APEC summit in person and has
instead had to name a delegate to represent him.</P>
      <P>Chen, the ROC's first president from the pro-independence DPP,
originally appointed Vice Premier Lai In-jaw to attend the 2000 APEC
summit on his behalf. The proposal, however, met strong opposition
from Beijing and at Brunei's request, Chen was forced to pick another
proxy.</P>
      <P>The 2000 APEC leadership meeting is scheduled for Nov. 15-16 in
Brunei.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the KMT's decision to reconsider its consent to
Siew's presence at the APEC summit, Secretary-General to the
President Yu Shyi-kun said he hopes the KMT will honor its original
decision.</P>
      <P>Yu said a change of the ROC's representative to the APEC meeting
would affect Taiwan's national image and cause unnecessary trouble
and inconvenience to host Brunei.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's handling of the
controversial fourth nuclear power plant issue received flak Friday
from opposition Kuomintang leader Lien Chan, who said his actions
were "rude, impolite, and immature."</P>
      <P>Lien said at a meeting of the KMT's Central Standing Committee
that he was very sincere and full of goodwill when he called on Chen
earlier in the day at the Presidential Office to discuss issues that
included the nuclear plant project.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Chen agreed the meeting should not be
simply a formality, but rather should have concrete results.
Furthermore, Lien said that Chen agreed to give careful thought to
the nuclear plant issue, but Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's announcement
of the scrapping of the project came almost immediately after the
meeting between Chen and Lien ended.</P>
      <P>Lien asked what the country is coming to when a nation's leader
says one thing and does another half an hour later. This is a sign of
"disrespect and lack of sincerity" to him, to the legislature, where
the KMT holds the majority, and to most of the public, he said. Lien
expressed regret and condemned Chen's "trickery" for what he
described as the "private interest of a political party."</P>
      <P>The KMT had already studied various ways to respond, Lien said,
adding that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's "major
historical error" is only the beginning and not the end of the
problems.</P>
      <P>Lien stressed that he did not feel humiliated or cheated because
he "knew what kind of man he was facing" and already had "thorough
considerations" before heading to his meeting with Chen. He added
that the person and the government he faced turned out to be "as he
had expected," and he felt it was "a pity."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HEAVYWEIGHTS SUPPORT CABINET DECISION TO HALT 4TH NUKE PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several heavyweights from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lent their support Friday to the
Cabinet's decision to halt construction of the fourth nuclear plant</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, residents in the vicinity of the construction site in
northern Taiwan were elated by the decision.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Frank Hsieh said that his party fully supports the
Cabinet's policy and will publish pamphlets to explain the reason for
opposing nuclear power.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that although there are differences in the party over
how to solve the controversial project, into which the previous
Kuomingtang-led administration had already pumped millions of dollars
and which is now 30 percent complete, there has never been any
support within the DPP for its continued construction.</P>
      <P>He said that his party's opposition to the plant did not start
only after it took power, but is a long-standing stance based on the
long-term sustainable management of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the construction of the plant involves not only economic
and employment problems, but that concern should also be given to the
storage of nuclear waste and the possibility of nuclear disasters.</P>
      <P>He said the government might have to pay huge sums in
compensation for breaching contracts with suppliers of the plant's
equipment, but added that if the private sector can construct power
plants, the government will save billions in expenditure, which would
go some way toward balancing the compensation payouts.</P>
      <P>Residents in Kungliao, Taipei County, set off firecrackers upon
hearing the news. Wu Wen-tung, an anti-nuclear activist, said the
road to fight against nuclear power is long and winding and the cost
paid is too high.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that future administrations will be
cautious in public works so as to avoid paying huge costs like the
Kungliao plant.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP veteran Shen Fu-hsiung said the political
situation will be turbulent after the halt of the plant's
construction, but he predicated that the KMT, which dominates the
Legislative Yuan, and the opposition People First Party (PFP), which
only holds 19 seats, will not topple the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Shen said that DPP legislators will now take up "battle stations"
to brace for the chaotic situation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tain-Tsair, party whip of the DPP in the legislature, said
that the DPP caucus will form a team to deal with the impact caused
by the halt of the plant's construction.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP will watch closely possible proposal by the
PFP to topple the Cabinet and if it makes such a proposal, then the
caucus will "protect the Chang Cabinet by all means."</P>
      <P>Former DPP Chairman Shih Ming-teh said that he fully supports the
Cabinet's decision, saying that "delaying the decision is absolutely
not a good thing."</P>
      <P>He also said that some may feel that they have been "tricked" by
the premier's abrupt announcement despite an agreement Thursday that
the decision would only be made Nov. 15, but added that "they should
not take the matter too seriously."</P>
      <P>Chen Poh-chih, chairman of the Council of Economic Planning and
Development, revealed that when the debate for the plant's budget
heated up in July 1994, he advised then President Lee Teng-hui as a
scholar not to endorse the plant.</P>
      <P>He also said that a "heavyweight business in the United States"
supported the decision to halt construction, although he did not
reveal its identity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A prosecutor reportedly on a mission to
France to probe the scandal surrounding Taiwan's acquisition in the
1990s of six warships, returned to Taipei Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport upon his return, Hung Wei-hua denied that he had gone to
Paris to seek information about Taiwan's purchase of six Lafayette
frigates from France and disputed local reports that his activities
in Paris were closely monitored by the French authorities.</P>
      <P>Instead, the prosecutor charged with probing the case said his
visit was a vacation.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper had claimed that Hung headed for Paris on Oct.
18 to seek clues about huge kickbacks involved in the Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>Hung's departure from Taiwan was kept low-profile out of concern
that his mission might be thwarted by the French authorities. Taiwan
could not ask France for legal assistance due to the absence of
diplomatic ties between the two countries, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>The frigate scandal erupted in Paris in 1996 when an ex-mistress
of former French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas accused him of
accepting bribes to approve the sale of the warships in 1991.</P>
      <P>The Taipei authorities began looking into the case after Dumas
was forced to resign from his post as president of the Constitutional
Court earlier this year and was eager to find out what clues the
French authorities had in their possession.</P>
      <P>The investigation has already seen the arrest of two retired
Republic of China naval officers for inflating the prices of the
warships, but has otherwise made very little progress.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou urged the
Legislative Yuan Friday to halt the government's decision to scrap
the construction of the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Ma claimed that halting construction of the plant will shock
local economic development and Taiwan's international image.</P>
      <P>He expressed belief that a legal proposal by the opposition
Kuomintang was a way to stop the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-led government from scrapping the plant and stop Taiwan's
"continued decline."</P>
      <P>He criticized the timing of Premier Chang Chun-hsiung's
announcement of the decision to scrap the plant, saying that it was
inappropriate to make such an announcement so soon after a meeting
between President Chen Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>The move showed disrespect to Lien, who Chen had repeatedly
described prior to the meeting as one of the men whose suggestions
and advice he would seek, said Ma.</P>
      <P>The premier's announcement will certainly deal a heavy blow to
domestic economic development and Taiwan's international image, which
will be reflected in the local stock market, investment willingness
and the moving of enterprises from Taiwan to other nations.</P>
      <P>He urged Chen to "hear the voice of the populace" and correct the
"wrong decision." Otherwise, he went on, Taiwan might end up like the
Philippines and Argentina, both of which went from riches to rags.</P>

      <P>Former Chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) P.K. Chiang said Friday that the Chen
administration has lost a good chance to recover the people's
confidence by announcing the halt to construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The move action will exacerbate the mistrust of the people toward
the government, Chiang said, adding that this will certainly reflect
on economic development and the stock market.</P>
      <P>Chiang, now executive head of a Kuomintang think tank, strongly
criticized some members of Cabinet as having lost their
professionalism and conscience after assuming power.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a press conference held at the KMT Central
Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>He said that he felt deeply affected by the announcement of the
halt to construction of the plant so soon after the end of what was
supposed to have been a rapprochement meeting between President Chen
Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien Chan. The KMT had originally worked
out measures to help the Chen administration cope with local economic
development, he said, adding: "My heart has been disappointed after
hearing the government's decision."</P>
      <P>The Chen-Lien meeting should have created a cordial atmosphere
that would have reassured the public, he said, but added that the
DPP-led government had destroyed this mood.</P>
      <P>Chiang quoted People First Party Chairman James Soong, saying he
"does not underestimate the economic situation and overestimate the
government capability to deal with the event." He said that many
major investments have encountered difficulties in counties or cities
governed by the DPP. This, he claimed, reflects whether the
government's alternative measures for the plant will succeed or not.</P>
      <P>He criticized Economics Minister Lin hsin-yi and CEPD Chairman
Chen Po-chih's declaration that Taiwan will not lack electricity
supplies in the coming seven years, saying that Taiwan will naturally
not lack electricity, as all the domestic enterprises will leave

    <HEADLINE>MOEA CLARIFIES REPORT OF DECLINE IN ROC'S APPEAL TO INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Friday
that Taiwan has attracted more inbound investment than its own
outbound investment so far this year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after local business monthly CommonWealth
published the results of a recent survey which show Taiwan's ranking
as a popular Asian investment destination has declined from third
place in 1999 to second last among the 11 countries included in the
study.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), Lin
said foreign and overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan amounted to
US$5.59 billion in the first nine months of this year, up 111 percent
from the same period of 1999.</P>
      <P>In comparison, outbound investment by Taiwan enterprises totaled
US$3.07 billion during the January-September period.</P>
      <P>Lin said the figures indicate that Taiwan remains attractive to
foreign and overseas Chinese investors.</P>
      <P>He admitted that Taiwan cannot compare with mainland China in
terms of land and labor costs. Nevertheless, the minister said, the
MOEA will continue working hard to improve Taiwan's investment
climate by integrating all its resources and upgrading its
administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>According to the CommonWealth survey, Taiwan was ahead of only
the Philippines in its appeal to foreign investors among the 11 Asian
countries compared.</P>
      <P>The magazine sent out 617 questionnaires to foreign businessmen
from Oct. 9-20 to explore their views on Taiwan's general investment
climate and its new government's performance. A total of 148 valid
replies were collected.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that about 60 percent of the respondents
were dissatisfied with President Chen Shui-bian's performance. Chen
is the Republic of China's first president from the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 49 percent said they have no confidence
in Premier Chang Chun-hsiung-led Cabinet's crisis
management capability, compared to 41.78 percent who said they
are confident of the Chang Cabinet's ability to manage economic
and financial crises.</P>
      <P>Asked about the reasons for the DPP government's
worse-than-expected performance, 36.7 percent cited "inexperience";
23.81 percent said the new government lacks vision and direction;
17.69 percent blamed the new government's lack of coordination;
and 13.61 percent cited the new government's "policy inconsistence
and incoherence."</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the percentage of foreign investors
who think Taiwan's investment climate has worsened has increased from
25 percent to 76 percent over the past six years, while the ratio of
those who intend to expand investment in Taiwan has declined from
36.7 percent in 1994 to 15.1 percent this year.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, foreign investors in Taiwan hope that
the new DPP government can improve Taiwan's investment climate by
improving relations with mainland China, maintaining political
stability and wiping out corruption and shaddy connections between
politics and organized crime.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPEACHMENT OF RETIRED ADMIRALS CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Control Yuan's impeachment of three
retired admirals for their roles in Taiwan's purchase of six
French-made frigates drew fire from legal experts and scholars at a
symposium Friday.</P>
      <P>They accused the Control Yuan of stepping beyond its jurisdiction
and degenerating into an instrument of political suppression by
impeaching Tuesday a former naval head and two of his vice admirals.</P>
      <P>Che Chung-chuan, a former member of the Control Yuan, said the
five-member panel which passed the impeachment exceeded their
authority by disapproving of the navy's choice of weapons systems
when they are mandated only to expose irregularities and dereliction
of duty by government employees.</P>
      <P>He said the navy is free to choose the arms they deemed best
suited to their demands and that the Control Yuan panel was trying to
pull strings in the navy's decision to acquire warships by claiming
in their impeachment that the Lafayette-class frigates bought from
France did not meet the navy's needs.</P>
      <P>Policy making is something to be supervised by the popularly
elected Legislative Yuan, rather than the Control Yuan, which
consists of members nominated by the president and approved by the
National Assembly, said Che.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the process of impeachment is supposed to be brought
against government officials and active military officers, and it is
a waste of time to impeach three retired admirals, to whom no
punishment can be applied.</P>
      <P>Che banded the impeachment as illegal, arguing that the
negotiations on the purchase of the Lafayettes began from 1989, which
is too long ago to be pursued by impeachment under the law.</P>
      <P>He blamed the Control Yuan panel for deliberately "spilling the
beans" about the outcome of their investigation before the
impeachment was formally put forward.</P>
      <P>Che said the panel deviated from its original purpose of
unearthing alleged huge kickbacks in the deal and the possible links
between the kickbacks and the death of a navy captain who was
involved in the deal.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Ching-an of the People First Party blamed the
Control Yuan for ruining its own credibility and debasing itself into
a tool used by politicians to strike at their political rivals.</P>
      <P>The controversial impeachment was passed Tuesday on the grounds
that the Lafayettes did not meet Taiwan's defense needs and the
purchase decision was made without following the due policy-making
process.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior Taiwanese presidential adviser Yao
Chia- wen visited Montreal Thursday to ask in person what his bosses
can't: that the international community recognize Taiwan as a nation
independent of communist China, a major daily in Quebec reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Montreal Gazette, the only English newspaper in Canada's
second largest city, quoted Yao as saying the internatonal community
knows Taiwan is an independent state, but won't acknowledge the fact
because it is afraid the communist Chinese government would attack
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We believe that Taiwan is qualified to be member of the
international society. We have improved our human rights situation.
We have reform- ed our political situation to be a free, liberal and
democratic government. Under the standards of civil society, we are a
good country," Yao was quoted.</P>
      <P>The Gazette quoted Robert Henderson, a political and economic
consultant who studies Taiwan, as noting, "A lot of Chinese would
love to have what the Taiwanese have." But the threat of a Chinese
military strike still worries Taiwan, added Henderson.</P>
      <P>Ellen Huang, a Taiwanese TV talkshow celebrity, was quoted as
saying the Taiwanese would not know how to stop China if war broke
out.</P>
      <P>But Yao argued attacking Taiwan now would only confirm to the
world that China is a repressive regime, the daily said. "He said he
doubts China really wants to invade Taiwan," it added.</P>
      <P>Yao reasoned China can't use the military force in the near
future because of international relations: "They want to host the
Olympic Games. They want to become a member of the WTO. They want to
persude American people to invest in their country."</P>
      <P>Still, Yao was quoted as adding, "China's military generals may
feel differently."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR SUGGESTS `TAIWAN SQUARES' TO PROMOTE TRADE WITH EUROPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An idea to establish "Taiwan Squares" with
trade and cultural activity functions in major European cities was
introduced Friday at a public hearing held at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang Wei-pang, a professor at Tamkang University, introduced the
concept at a public hearing on how the government can assist Taiwan
enterprises wishing to make inroads into European markets.</P>
      <P>Hearing organizer Legislator Chuo Jung-tai said that according to
statistics compiled by the Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, Taiwan's exports to Europe in the first eight
months of this year accounted only for 15.7 percent of the island's
total exports during the period, while the growth rate of its exports
to Europe in the period was much lower than those to other areas.</P>
      <P>This, coupled with the small- and medium-sized enterprise-led
economy in Taiwan makes it all the more necessary for the government
to help Taiwan enterprises to promote trade with Europe, he said.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the most effective and feasible method to achieve
the goal would be to rent or buy office buildings in major European
cities to set up "Taiwan Squares" with various advertisement
hoardings to attract European businessmen to do business with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-chun, deputy director of the European Affairs
Department under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said MOFA
has long known about the "Taiwan Squares" concept, but added that
such an idea would be too expensive for the government to
contemplate.</P>
      <P>He suggested that large-scale domestic business groups or
syndicates should consider establishing such facilities and request
that MOFA personnel based abroad could be stationed there to help
Taiwan businessmen promote trade with Europe.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. business leader described as
"regrettable but understandable" Taiwan's decision Friday to halt
construction of its fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond, President of the U.S.-ROC (Taiwan) Business
Council, told CNA that the United States should leave Taiwan's
government and people to decide whether to go ahead with the
construction of the plant and that Washington has absolutely no role
to play in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the Taiwan government should compensate the
foreign builders, notably U.S. firm General Electric -- which is
contracted to build the plant's reactor -- according to the terms of
their contracts, or it will damage the island's international image
as a reliable trade partner.</P>
      <P>In order to attract foreign investment, he continued, Taiwan
should convince potential foreign investors that the island will have
abundant electricity after 2005 even without the nuclear plant.</P>
      <P>He was responding to an announcement earlier in the day by ROC
Premier Chang Chung-hsiung that the government had scrapped
construction of the nuclear plant despite it being already 30 percent
finished and despite the fact that the move will incur huge
compensation claims from foreign companies contracted to supply the
plant's equipment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN'S FULFILLMENT OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States Friday reiterated its
concern about Taiwan's fulfillment of its contractual obligations
after the island decided to halt construction of a controversial
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>U.S. Statement Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the
decision on whether to proceed with the construction of the
island's fourth nuclear power plant is a choice for Taiwan
authorities to make.</P>
      <P>"And our major concern is that contract provisions all be
fulfilled," Boucher said, referring to a business contract previously
reached between Taiwan and General Electric Co. about the supply of
nuclear power generation equipment to be installed in the
fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>In a surprise move, the Republic of China government
announced its decision Friday to pull plug on the nuclear power
plant to protect the people of Taiwan and their offspring from
possible radiation contamination.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the State Department has anything to say on
Taiwan's decision, Boucher said: "We certainly think it's a decision
for them (Taiwan) to make, and at the same time, we will advocate on
their behalf to see that contract provisions are obeyed."</P>
      <P>Boucher further noted that the design of the nuclear reactor to
be sold to Taiwan has been certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.</P>
      <P>"It's safe for construction in the United States. So, you know,
we would hope that this would not reflect in any way on the quality
of this reactor, which is certified," Boucher stressed in an effort
to prevent any doubt about the quality and safety of the U.S.-made
nuclear reactors.</P>
      <P>As for whether the State Department has concern that the
incident might have an adverse impact on the U.S. business
confidence in Taiwan, Boucher said: "I think that's maybe better for
businesspeople to comment on than for me."</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the ROC's state-owned Taiwan Power Co. will have to
compensate foreign power generation equipment suppliers NT$30 billion
(US$952.38 million) to NT$90.3 billion (US$2.87 billion) for
scrapping the reactor deal.</P>
      <P>Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Boston-based Stone and
Webster Engineering Corp. and General Electric Co. are supplying the
two 1,350-megawatt boiling water reactors for the Taiwan plant.</P>

      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan on Saturday
urged Chu Wan-ching, a former Central Broadcasting System director

return as soon as possible to answer prosecutor inquiries.</P>
      <P>Chu was charged with embezzlement and released on NT$500,000
(US$15,500) bail Oct. 12, after which she immediately took a flight
to Los Angeles, claiming that she did not know she was barred from
leaving the country. She had stressed that she had only left for the
United States in order to accompany her son to a military boarding
school in Pennsylvania whose reported registration deadline was Oct.
14.</P>
      <P>She told reporters Friday that she had originally intended to
return to Taiwan as soon as she could, but concerns that she might be
arrested and taken into custody immediately upon her return made her
decide to ask Taipei prosecutors for a three month leave of absence
during which she will wait for an official green card to be issued.</P>
      <P>She added that if she were arrested, it would be even more
difficult for her to defend her innocence. Therefore, she said she
will return after her lawyer has found out everything about the case
for her.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the press at the inauguration ceremony of the Taiwan
Criminal Law Association, Chen assured Chu that the so-called "white
terror," "unfair justice," and "political persecution" may have been
a part of Taiwan's past, but that they no longer exist, particularly
since the new government took over in May.</P>
      <P>He advised Chu to return in order to clarify certain "points of
doubt," adding that some "unnecessary suspicions" would otherwise
have an unfavorable effect on Chu's defense.</P>
      <P>Chu announced that she received her temporary green card under a
priority immigration article for talented and outstanding individuals
on Friday after completing a process of deferred inspection at the
U.S. Immigration Office in Los Angeles. She said that she will apply
for her Social Security card in the next few days and wait for her
permanent resident status to be approved.</P>
      <P>She added that the pressing matter at hand is to ask the
prosecutors to look into the NT$16 million (US$496,000) she was

EX-FINANCE MINISTER ORDERED TO POST NT$600,000 BAIL</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 28 (CNA) Former Finance Minister Paul Chiu was
ordered to post NT$600,000 bail after he was formally questioned
Friday night by a Taipei district prosecutor about his alleged
wrongdoings during his tenure as finance minister.</P>
      <P>Chiu was accused of instructing four domestic financial
institutions organized into a banking group to bail out financially
troubled Hung Fu Securities Finance Corp. and of providing the banks
with false Hung Fu financial statements in 1998, resulting in large
losses for the banking group.</P>
      <P>The four members of the banking group are the International
Commercial Bank of China, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank,
the United World Chinese Commercial Bank, and the International
Securities and Finance Corp.</P>
      <P>It was reported that Chiu instructed the banking group to take
over Hung Fu Securities Finance Corp. by buying its stocks at a price
of NT$6 each, lower than par value.</P>
      <P>After checking Hung Fu's assets and liabilities, the banking
group found that the failing corporation's shares were actually only
worth NT$0.12 per share, resulting in a huge financial loss for the
banking group.</P>
      <P>After a six-month investigation, Prosecutor Meng Ling-shih of the
Taipei District Prosecutors Office summoned Chiu to be questioned
Friday night about his alleged misconduct in the Hung Fu case. Chiu
was ordered to post NT$600,000 bail shortly after the interrogation.</P>
      <P>Chiu defended his innocence Saturday by saying that his conduct
concerning the Hung Fu case was totally in line with the Banking Law,
according to which the Ministry of Finance had the right to settle
the Hung Fu case by seeking feasible bailout measures.</P>
      <P>Chiu went on to say that the banking group had reached an
agreement with Hung Fu boss and Taipei City Councilor Chen
Cheng-chung in 1998 when Hung Fu Securities Finance Corp. was faced
with a financial crisis.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Chen had to refund any excess money
obtained by selling Hung Fu's shares if the banking group found that
the net value of the corporation's shares were lower than what the
banking group paid for them when taking over the corporation, or else
the banking group could choose not to buy Hung Fu's shares.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's influential former Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said Friday he has never promised mainland
Chinese leaders a deadline for ending the Southeast Asian city
state's military training cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee, now a senior minister, made the remarks at a dinner in
response to an inquiry about his answer to a question by former
mainland Premier Li Peng some 10 years ago concerning Singapore's
dispatch of armed forces to Taiwan for training purposes.</P>
      <P>Lee said he didn't promised Li when Singapore will stop sending
its troops to the Republic of China to receive necessary military
training. "I had instead clearly told Li that Singapore intends to
continue sending its military servicemen to Taiwan for training and
military exercises," he explained.</P>
      <P>The respected Singapore elder statesman went on to say that he
had asked mainland authorities to inform Singapore in advance once
mainland China would take military action against Taiwan so that
Singapore can evacuate its troops from the island in time.</P>
      <P>Lee said Singaporean troops in Taiwan have consistently worn the
ROC's military uniforms to avoid causing any inconveniences for local
residents. As a result, Lee said, Singapore military servicemen would
face risks if mainland China attacks Taiwan. "Therefore, we are
hopeful that Beijing would notify us in advance so that we have
enough time to evacuate our troops from Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>Under a cooperation program, Singapore has regularly sent its
troops to Taiwan for basic combat training and exercises for past
decades. The cooperation program has proceeded smoothly.</P>
      <P>Singapore recognizes Beijing, while maintaining close substantive
ties with Taiwan. Lee himself also maintains friendly relationships
with top leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. He made a
low-profile visit to Taipei in September for wide-ranging talks with
ROC President Chen Shui-bian and other senior government officials in
charge of relations with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee has repeatedly encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to resume dialogue, but he has also made it clear that he has
no intention of mediating cross-strait negotiations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government hopes to
establish a trade-driven relationship with mainland China in which
bilateral trade can replace ROC investments in the mainland, said
Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chen Ming-tung Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen said at a MAC-sponsored seminar on cross-strait relations
and mainland issues that direct trade, postal, and transport links
between Taiwan and mainland China are "unavoidable" and part of an
"inevitable trend."</P>
      <P>He said that the new government's principle goal following the
establishment of the links will be to let bilateral trade and
economic relations move ahead of political contentions between the
two sides so that a structure of mutual economic development and
co-existence can be instituted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that "stability supercedes all" while the
government is carrying out this trade-based policy and that many
plans under consideration are meant to lay the groundwork for mutual
orientation.</P>
      <P>The plans under consideration include the initial implementation

    <HEADLINE>CREDIT CARD COUNTERFEITERS BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei  County, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County police arrested three
suspects Saturday and discovered in their possession 599 counterfeit
credit cards, various pieces of equipment used to fabricate them, and
over NT$1 million worth of goods purchased with the cards.</P>
      <P>In what is the largest credit card counterfeiting bust ever in
northern Taiwan, police also found nine counterfeit identification
cards, five phony fiscards (ATM cards), two fake driver's licenses,
one forged national health insurance card, and 1,500 grams of
amphetamines.</P>
      <P>Police said that the main suspect, surnamed Wang, is also alleged
to have been involved in the kidnapping of a businessman and an
overseas Chinese from Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Police believe that Wang may have colluded with certain
businesses and installed microchips inside their credit card machines
in order to record confidential information from each transaction.</P>
      <P>After the counterfeit cards were fabricated at his apartment, his
girlfriend, surnamed Chen, and another man, surnamed Chuang, would
then purchase goods from stores nationwide and sell them for half the
purchase price, police added.</P>
      <P>According to the police, Wang's credit cards have already caused
over NT$50 million (US$1.5 million) in losses to domestic financial
institutions. They also calculated that the 599 cards have a combined
credit limit as high as NT$60 million (US$1.9 million).</P>
      <P>Records from the National Credit Card Center show that a total of
NT$1.2 billion (US$37.2 million) in losses were incurred from January
to June from transactions with fake credit cards alone, a figure
equivalent to the total amount of such losses from the previous year,
indicating a marked increase in such crimes.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the center said that Taiwan has become the area
with the highest amount of credit card fraud in terms of both dollar
figures and number of cases in the Asia Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON TO HIRE MORE SPECIALISTS TO COUNTER ESPIONAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense is
hiring 450 new counterintelligence specialists over the next three
years to protect defense secrets against what is seen as a growing
threat posed by foreign spies, including those working for Communist
China, reported the Washington Post on Friday.</P>
      <P>Senior U.S. defense officials said the decision was made after
learning that Communist China has obtained classified U.S. missile
technology, including critical information about the heat shield that
keeps America's most advanced missiles from burning up as they
reenter the atmosphere, reported the daily.</P>
      <P>According to Pentagon officials, 150 new counterintelligence
specialists will be hired each year for the next three years. They
will be hired from both the civilian and military sectors and will be
assigned equally across defense laboratories and contractors working
for the U.S. armed forces.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon admitted the hiring surge is in recognition of what
is seen as an increased overall foreign espionage threat.</P>
      <P>A recent study by the Defense Security Service says that in 1999,
the service received reports of suspicious activities concerning
interests associated with 56 different countries -- an increase over
the previous two years, the Voice of American radio station reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>The report does not identify any nations by name, but it states
45 percent of the suspected foreign activities involved Asian
nations, adding the U.S. technologies generating the most foreign
interest last year included information systems, sensors and lasers,
aeronautics systems, and armaments, said the VOA.</P>
      <P>Pentagon officials, however, recently confirmed they are
cooperating with other intelligence agencies in a probe of Communist
Chinese espionage aimed at collecting classified U.S. missile
technology.</P>
      <P>That investigation stems from a review of newly-translated
military documents provided by a Communist Chinese defector, reported
the Washington Post earlier.</P>
      <P>The U.S. intelligence community had originally been focusing its
investigation on the possible theft of nuclear secrets by Chinese
spies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A working commission of the 50th Congress
of the Liberal International being held in Canada passed a resolution
Friday supporting Taiwan's democracy and calling for peace across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The resolution, proposed by the Dutch group of the Liberal
International and containing an amendment by Foklpartiet Liberalerna
of Sweden, welcomes the election of Chen Shui-bian and Annette Lu as
president and vice president of the Republic of China respectively,
saying the election "emphasized the democratic achievements of
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>It also reaffirms the Liberals International's firm conviction
that political leadership has to be democratically legitimized and be
based on free and fair elections, the rule of law, and the principle
that people have the inherent right to decide on their political
future through their political institutions.</P>
      <P>The resolution, expected to be adopted in the plenary session on
Saturday, takes note of Chen's inaugural speech in which he stated he
will not take the initiative to change the present status of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It also acknowledges the significant developments in different
parts and sectors of society in mainland China over the last years
and calls for a resumption of the cross-strait dialogue between
mainland China and Taiwan to enhance cooperation between the two
sides based on a respect for human rights and the democratic
principles stated above.</P>
      <P>The document rejects any suggestion that the present political
status quo on Taiwan can be changed by any means other than by the
consent of its inhabitants.</P>
      <P>It urges the international community to strengthen its ties with
both mainland China and Taiwan and calls upon political parties
within the Liberal International to work together closely with the
Democratic Progressive Party of Taiwan in defending democracy on the
island and the right of its people to decide their future.</P>
      <P>Dr. Matyas Eorsi, who chaired the commission meeting, told the
CNA that he's "99.9 percent sure, perhaps plus one" that the
commission's adoption of the Taiwan resolution will be accepted by
the plenary meeting tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Eorsi is the deputy leader of Hungary's Alliance of Free
Democrats and the secretary-general of the ELDR Group of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. He's also a good
friend of the ROC representative in Hungary, Jo-shui Leng.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Yao Chia-wen and Lai I-chung of the DPP are among the
hundreds of delegates from 65 countries attending the three-day
Liberal International meeting in Hull, Quebec. The meeting concludes

    <HEADLINE>51% SUPPORT 'NO CONFIDENCE' VOTE AGAINST CABINET: KMT POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of respondents to a public
opinion poll support an opposition call for a vote of no-confidence
against the Cabinet in the wake of its decision to halt construction
of the fourth nuclear power plant, the Kuomintang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a telephone poll of 1,066 randomly
selected adult residents, the main opposition party said 51.13
percent of those interviewed have thrown explicit support for a
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that 33.87 percent of the respondents
gave a thumbs-down to the no-confidence vote proposal, and 15.01
percent either said they have no opinion or don't know whether such
a move is needed.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20 and still
controls a majority in the 221-member Legislative Yuan, was angered
by the Cabinet's abrupt announcement of its "scrapping the fourth
nuclear power plant" decision shortly after a high-profile meeting
between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and President Chen Shui-bian Friday.
The party then conducted the survey in the evening to explore the
general public opinion about the Cabinet's anti-nuclear decision.</P>
      <P>Another opposition party -- the People First Party (PFP) -- has
been seeking the KMT's support for launching a no-confidence vote
against the Cabinet over the nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>Wang Tan-ping, an executive secretary of the KMT's Central
Policy Coordination Department, said Saturday that the KMT has not
called for a no-confidence vote mainly because of three major
reasons -- the Cabinet is fully dominated by President Chen who is
the "culprit" of the current domestic political disorder, not the
Cabinet itself; since Chen has shown no respect for the country's
constitutional system, a parliamentary re-election following the
no-confidence vote against the Cabinet is not expected to effectively
improve relations among the Presidential Office, the Cabinet and the
Legislature; the KMT does not want to see further political
instability.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wang said the results of the latest opinion poll
have prompted the KMT to have a second thought of its previous
reluctance to call a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet. "We now
do not rule out that possibility," he said.</P>
      <P>But Wang stressed that the KMT will make a further evaluation
before deciding on whether to support a PFP-initiated no-confidence
vote against the Cabinet as opinion polls conducted by two mass
circulation local newspapers have shown different trends concerning
the public opinions about the "toppling the Cabinet" issue.</P>
      <P>A China Times poll conducted Friday found that only 25
percent of the respondents said they support a no-confidence vote
against the Cabinet simply for the nuclear power plant scrapping,
while 44 percent said they oppose the proposal and 30 percent didn't
express their opinion.</P>
      <P>According to a similar United Daily News survey, the ratios of
proponents and opponents to the no-confidence vote proposal were 32
percent to 43 percent, and 24 percent said they have no opinion.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-chia, a KMT legislator from the Taipei County
constituency, the site for the fourth nuclear power plant, said most
of the 115 KMT legislators do not support a no-confidence vote
against the Cabinet for the moment because a re-election would
weaken the party's dominance in the legislature and add to the
country's political uncertainty.</P>
      <P>Many observers have said no party would be able to control
majority seats in the legislature if a parliamentary election is
held at the moment. President Chen's Democratic Progressive Party
now controls only 68 seats in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's Friday poll also found that 54.41 percent
of those interviewed agreed with the saying "the Cabinet's
announcement of a halt to the nuclear power plant immediately after
a long-awaited meeting between Lien and President Chen indicates
that the president has played jokes on the KMT's sincerity to
promote inter-party rapprochement"; 28.89 percent disagreed with the
accusation; and 16.7 percent said they don't know.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday
presided over a preparatory meeting of the Presidential Science and
Technology Consulting Committee in her capacity as the chairwoman.</P>
      <P>A ceremony will be held on Nov. 1 at the Taipei International
Conference Center to formally inaugurate the committee.</P>
      <P>Addressing the preparatory meeting, Lu said that faced with a
brand new century, Taiwan should attach great importance to science
and technology development.</P>
      <P>She said that President Chen Shui-bian in August approved the
establishment of the committee and assigned her to be the head of the
committee.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the functions of the consulting committee will
not conflict with those of the Cabinet's Science and Technology
Advisory Group.</P>
      <P>Lu indicated that the purpose of the Presidential Science and
Technology Consulting Committee is to increase the nation's
competitiveness, strengthen national security, promote the nation's
long-term development, as well as advise the president on related
issues.</P>
      <P>The committee's main missions will be planning the nation's
science and technology development policy; planning the application
and integration of national science and technology resources;
planning a national science and technology development framework;
cultivating science and technology talent; as well as other functions
yet to be assigned by the president.</P>
      <P>After much discussion, the preparatory meeting picked 59
committee members from 523 names in the field of science and
technology recommended by all walks of life, said Lu, adding that she
believes those chosen will surely make an important contribution to
aiding the president with their professional knowledge.</P>
      <P>The committee will be organized into 12 divisions, with a
convenor to chair each respective division.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu, speaking on the issue of the fourth nuclear power
plant, said that she had not attended the decision-making meeting
that led to the announcement by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung that the
project would be scrapped.</P>
      <P>She expressed her regret over the political turmoil caused by the
scrapping of the nuclear power plant project, adding however that the
issue has become over politicized.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the public to calm down and view the issue with a
rational attitude so that the political turmoil the controversy has
caused can be solved in a beneficial manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUESTION MARK HANGS OVER TAIPEI'S ENVOY TO APEC SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With two weeks to go before the summit of
the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, uncertainty
looms larger over who will represent Taiwan at the meeting of one of
the few international organizations to which the island is still a
member.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian took the Kuomintang to task on Saturday
after its leaders reneged on their promises to allow its vice
chairman Vincent Siew to attend the APEC summit on behalf of Chen.</P>
      <P>The president, who defeated Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and his
running mate Siew in March's presidential election, blamed the
opposition for not being able to come to terms with their failure. He
added that he himself has already shrugged off the bitter rivalry
between the two parties during the presidential campaign and has
offered Siew the chance to reenter the political limelight.</P>
      <P>Chen consulted Siew last week on the possibility of taking part
in the APEC gathering as his personal envoy after the summit host
Brunei expressed reservations about Taiwan's initial choice of
Republic of China Vice Premier Lai Ying-chao. Brunei's reservations
stemmed from pressure from Beijing to limit Taipei's envoy to the
APEC summit of heads of state to a government minister.</P>
      <P>Siew, who attended the APEC summits in 1993 and 1994 while
serving as the chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under President Lee Teng-hui, had agreed to accept Chen's
offer, subject to the approval of his party.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan had initially given the nod to the
arrangement, but this was before Friday's sudden announcement by
Premier Chang Chun-hsiung that construction on Taiwan's controversial
fourth nuclear power plant would be halted. The announcement came
almost immediately after the live broadcast meeting between Chen and
Lien to hear the latter's opinions on national issues, including his
strong support for completion of the nuclear plant project.</P>
      <P>Lien criticized Chen for damaging trust between the two parties
by pretending to listen to the opposition only to flagrantly spurn
their recommendations.</P>
      <P>He announced a delay in the party's approval of Siew's assignment
to the APEC summit, a move which invoked Chen's criticism of the KMT
for its flip-flop.</P>
      <P>Jason Hu, the Kuomintang spokesman, said Saturday that Chen's
criticism of the Kuomintang can only have a negative affect on the
possibility of the party approving Siew's assignment.</P>
      <P>Caught in the fire between the Kuomintang and Chen, Siew stuck to
his initial stance by saying Sunday that the Kuomintang has the final
say on whether he should serve as Chen's envoy.</P>
      <P>Attending a funeral in Kaohsiung, Siew told reporters that the
tensions between the Kuomintang and President Chen have complicated
the problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP POLL FINDS 33% SUPPORT DECISION TO HALT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 33.2 percent of the Taiwan public
supports the Cabinet's decision to halt construction on the island's
fourth nuclear power plant, while 47.5 percent are against the
decision, a poll unveiled Sunday by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party shows.</P>
      <P>The DPP conducted the survey on the controversial project and the
political storm unleashed after Premier Chang Chun-hsiung abruptly
announced the decision to halt its construction Friday shortly after
a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and Chairman Lien Chan of
the opposition Kuomintang during which the president said he would
give more thought to the project.</P>
      <P>The poll was conducted between Oct. 27 and 28, with 1,189
effective samples collected. The margin of error of the poll is 2.8
percent.</P>
      <P>Although the number of those who support the Cabinet's decision
is greater than the number of those who are against it, DPP official
Chen Chun-lin stressed that the gap has narrowed since a similar
survey was conducted Oct. 2-3. At that time, 54 percent said they
were opposed to the halting of construction on the nuclear power
plant, while 27. 9 percent said that they were in favor of scrapping
the project.</P>
      <P>One noteworthy phenomenon that the poll found was that only 62.2
percent of respondents who are leaning toward the DPP said they
support the Cabinet's decision, while 23.4 percent said they are
against it.</P>
      <P>Some 48.8 percent of those polled also said they had no
confidence in state-owned Taiwan Power Co.'s ability to handle a
nuclear emergency, and 50 percent said they had no confidence in
Taipower's ability to safely dispose of nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>On the question of the nuclear power plant's location, 55.1
percent of those surveyed said they would be opposed to the site
being located in their city or county. Also, 77.1 percent of the
respondents agreed that the construction of a nuclear plant must have
the consent of the local people.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Wu Nai-jen said the poll figures reflected
the Taiwan public's conflicting attitude, pointing specifically to
the fact that 47.5 percent of respondents said they are opposed to
scrapping the nuclear plant project, while nearly half said they have
no confidence in Taipower's ability to handle nuclear emergencies or
safely dispose of nuclear waste, and over 77 percent said that
construction of the nuclear power plant must have the consent of the
local people.</P>
      <P>Asked if they would be opposed to continued construction if
energy alternatives were indeed feasible and there were no fears of
future power shortages, some 58.4 percent said they would, while 29.9
said they would not.</P>
      <P>Some 56.1 percent of those surveyed also said that they are
opposed to the threats by opposition parties that they will boycott
the review of the general budget submitted by the Cabinet because of
the Cabinet's decision on the power plant.</P>
      <P>Some 51.1 percent of the respondents also said that since the
Cabinet has made its decision, the other political parties should
cast away their differences so as not to affect political and
economic stability, while 37.7 percent said they are opposed to the
idea.</P>
      <P>Wu said that this showed that over half of the people would not
like to see the political situation continue in a chaotic state.</P>
      <P>He suggested to the opposition parties that the time is not right
for a political struggle, saying that this will not be beneficial to
Taiwan's long-term development.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether the nuclear power plant controversy
will trigger moves to topple the Cabinet or recall the president, Wu
said that as the public poll shows that even the opposition's more
moderate option of boycotting the Cabinet's general budget doesn't
have the support of half the people, the more drastic mentioned
alternatives would not come about.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION DIVIDED ON HOW TO BLOCK GOVERNMENT'S ANTI-NUCLEAR POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's three opposition parties, the
Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP), and the New Party,
are united against the government's decision to scrap the fourth
nuclear power plant, but they are divided on how to go about trying
to block it.</P>
      <P>Shocked by the government's abrupt announcement Friday that it
will halt construction on the island's fourth nuclear plant, PFP
Chairman James Soong said Sunday that he is willing to call on the
KMT and the New Party to explore the possibility of working on a
joint front to stop the government from scrapping the project, which
is already one third complete.</P>
      <P>Soong said that although the administration of President Chen
should bear much of the responsibility for the current political
upheaval, those who revised the Republic of China Constitution to
make possible a divided government under which the executive branch
and the legislature are controlled by different parties should also
be blamed.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the root of the current crisis is the
administration of the minority party Democratic Progressive Party's
insistence on following its own path without respect for the opinions
of the majority opposition KMT, which he added is too afraid to oust
the Cabinet and thereby risk losing its majority status in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the administration has destroyed the minimum trust
needed to maintain its rules, Soong said the only way to sort out the
crisis is for the Legislative Yuan to topple the Cabinet with a vote
of no-confidence.</P>
      <P>However, he said he is keeping his mind open to the KMT's
suggested option of introducing a recall of President Chen at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>With 141 seats between them in the 220-seated Legislative Yuan,
the three parties could together push through a motion of recall, but
there is a technical problem -- they would first have to work out the
law regulating the implementation of the recall of the president, and
this could be a time-consuming process.</P>
      <P>The KMT leader, Lien Chan, made a similar call for unity among
the opposition parties in Kaohsiung Sunday.</P>
      <P>Without mentioning the PFP by name, Lien urged all opposition
parties to work out a consensus on how to protect the welfare of the
people.</P>
      <P>The New Party, which controls nine seats in the legislature, said
that it would join forces with the other two opposition parties to
boycott the government's decision, but the party has not mentioned
which option it prefers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT OPTING FOR RECALL OF PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang has decided to
move to recall President Chen Shui-bian rather than to call for a
no-confidence vote against Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, said a KMT
heavyweight Monday.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-chin, executive director of the KMT's Coordination
Committee, said the KMT, in cooperation with the KMT legislative
caucus and sub-groups, will push for President Chen Shui-bian's
recall in retaliation to Chen's apparent disrespect for the majority
in the Legislative Yuan as evidenced by last Friday's sudden
announcement by Premier Chang Chun-hsiung that construction of
Taiwan's controversial fourth nuclear power plant will be halted.</P>
      <P>After Premier Chang's announcement, the KMT, which holds a
majority in the Legislative Yuan, made calls for the Control Yuan to
impeach the premier while launching a vitriolic attack on President
Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party-led administration.</P>
      <P>Terming it "against the public interest," the KMT declared that
the DPP-led government's action of simply stopping the carrying out
of a budget that had been passed by the legislature illegal.</P>
      <P>The KMT said what was particularly infuriating about the decision
to scrap the nuclear power plant project was the "poor timing." The
premier's announcement came almost immediately after Chen's
ostensible fence-mending meeting with KMT Chairman Lien Chan that
same morning.</P>
      <P>Ting Shou-chung, deputy executive director of the KMT's
Coordination Committee, said the party has chosen to move to recall
the president rather than to push to have Premier Chang step down
because they feel Chang is only a puppet of the president and Chen
will only replace him with a similar figure if lawmakers force him
out with a vote a no-confidence.</P>
      <P>Ting noted that recalling the president is not as difficult as
one would imagine, saying that it is feasible as long as all the
opposition parties are united at heart in common purpose.</P>
      <P>He added that all that is required is a minimum of 57 legislators
to propose a motion to recall the president, 150 legislators to
endorse the motion, and half the ROC citizens participating in a
vote, or 3.51 million of 7 million people, to support his recall.</P>
      <P>Ting said Chen's personality and his method of doing things are
the root of the present political chaos in Taiwan. Dealing with the
problem at its root by recalling the president is the only way to end
the chaos, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus announced that beginning
Tuesday, the doors to the Legislative Yuan will be closed to Premier
Chang Chun-hsiung, all the negotiating channels between the
administration and the legislature will be shut down simultaneously,
and the screening of the general budget for next fiscal year will
also be halted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN WILL RESPECT LEGISLATURE'S DECISION: PRES'L OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan passes a resolution
to overturn the decision made by the Executive Yuan to halt
construction on the fourth nuclear power plant, the Executive Yuan
will respect and accept it, an official of the Presidential Office
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office, said in a press conference held at the Presidential Office
that the Executive Yuan will respect the resolution if passed by the
Legislative Yuan according to lawful procedures.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks came amidst a political storm unleashed by the
Cabinet's abrupt announcement last Friday to scrap the nuclear plant
project shortly after President Chen's meeting with Lien Chan,
chairman of the largest opposition party Kuomintang, during which
Chen promised to give more thought to the nuclear project.</P>
      <P>To try to defuse the political storm, President Chen will convene
an informal meeting with the presidents of the five Yuans, including
Chang Chun-hsiung of the Executive Yuan, Wang Jin-pyng of the
Legislative Yuan, Weng Yueh-sheng of the Judicial Yuan, Fredrick
Chien of the Control Yuan, and Hsu Shui-teh of the Examination Yuan.
Also attending the meeting will be Vice President Annette Lu and
Secretary-General to the President Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Chen said that faced with the large dispute between the executive
and legislative branches of government, President Chen hopes the
meeting Monday night will help in calming things down and returning
things to the rule of law.</P>
      <P>If the Legislative Yuan passes revisions to the budgetary law and
the energy law, then the Executive Yuan and the president will
respect and accept the decision, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The budget for the fourth nuclear power plant had cleared the
Legislative Yuan during the rule of the previous KMT-led
government.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Cabinet accepting the resolution made by
the Legislative Yuan that runs counter to the anti-nuclear platform
of the DPP, Chen said that this is out of the question, noting that
the president is the president of all the people and not just of the
party.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang called emergency
meetings between party chairman Lien Chan and the heads of the other
opposition parties Monday in an attempt to cement their unity in a
fight against President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Jason Hu said Chairman Lien Chen called on People
First Party Chairman James Soong, whom the KMT expelled early this
year for defying party rules and running in the presidential election
without party approval, at around 3 p.m. for an emergency meeting in
the wake of the surprise move by the Cabinet last Friday to pull the
plug on the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Later in the afternoon, at around 4:30, Lien will meet with Hao
Lung-ping, convenor of the New Party's National Election and
Development Council, for a similar meeting, according to Hu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said, Lien is still undecided on whether he will
leave for the United States Wednesday as previously scheduled. Lien,
the only overseas board member of the University of Chicago, had
promised to attend the prestigious university's board meeting later
this week. Lien was also scheduled to visit New York to meet his
overseas Chinese supporters there.</P>
      <P>Hu, who declined to speculate on whether Lien will cancel the
planned trip at this critical juncture in Taiwan's politics, said
only that the party chairman will make a "proper and responsible"
decision soon, placing the need to maintain political stability at
the top of the list in his decision-making.</P>
      <P>In related news, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is
a KMT cadre, said he will decide later Monday on whether to attend a
meeting called by President Chen Shui-bian for Monday evening.</P>
      <P>The president is calling an emergency meeting with the heads and
executives of the five branches of the central government -- the
Legislative Yuan, the Judicial Yuan, the Examination Yuan, the
Control Yuan, and the Executive Yuan -- to look for a solution to the
ongoing political chaos and constitutional crisis that was heightened
by last Friday's announcement to scrap the nuclear power plant

      <P>Wang said he will finalize his decision on whether to attend the
president's meeting soon after exchanging views with leaders of the

    <HEADLINE>ROC DECLARES POLIO-FREE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    Oct.    30   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has
completely eradicated the virus that causes polio, once one of the
most feared diseases, the Department of Health (DOH) announced
Monday.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Lee Ming-liang made the announcement in protest of
the World Health Organization's deliberate ignorance of the ROC's
public health achievement.</P>
      <P>WHO declared 37 countries and areas in the western Pacific
region polio-free Sunday, claiming a victory against the highly
infectious disease. Dr. Shigeru Omi, WHO western Pacific regional
director, said at a meeting held in Kyoto, western Japan that the
West Pacific has become the second region to be certified polio-free
after the Americas in 1994.</P>
      <P>The WHO list of polio-free West Pacific countries and areas
included mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, but deliberately
omitted Taiwan as WHO regarded Taiwan as part of mainland China.</P>
      <P>The ROC was a founding member of WHO, but lost its membership in
the organization after it was expelled from the United Nations in
1971. WHO is a U.N. affiliate.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is regrettable that WHO has ignored the ROC's
achievement in eradicating the polio virus simply because of
political reasons.</P>
      <P>Noting that no case of polio has been confirmed in Taiwan since
1989, Lee said the ROC has successfully eradicated the debilitating
childhood disease through a massive immunization campaign starting
in 1964. A polio outbreak, however, hit Taiwan in 1982, with
1,000-plus cases being confirmed. The ROC then revised its
immunization program by using a new five-dose vaccine, and no polio
case has since been reported.</P>
      <P>Lee said as the current polio vaccine is highly effective and
safe, the existing immunization policy will not change.
Nevertheless, Lee said the DOH will continue its close monitoring to
prevent inflow of foreign polio cases.</P>
      <P>Over the past few years, Lee said, the ROC has donated more
than US$2 million to help eradicate the polio virus in other parts of
the world. "We feel deep regrets over WHO's failure to recognize our
efforts simply because of Beijing's pressure," Lee said, adding that
the ROC will lodge protests with WHO over its failure to include
Taiwan in its latest list of polio-free countries and areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said the DOH's next work goal is to eradicate
measles and German measles so that Taiwan can join the ranks of
advanced public health countries.</P>
      <P>Polio is highly contagious virus transmitted by direct
person-to-person contact, contact with infected secretions from the
nose or mouth, or contact with infected fecal matter. Polio can
strike at any age. However, children under the age of three are the
majority of its victims. Once contracted, its effects are almost
always irreversible.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition parties on Monday
declared Premier Chang Chun-hsiung "persona non grata" for his
announcement of a major policy turnabout that was not only "illegal"
but also "sacrificed the public interest."</P>
      <P>The opposition camp, including Kuomintang, People First Party,
New Party and the Non-partisan Lawmakers Alliance, made the
declaration Monday afternoon after a meeting called in the wake of
Chang's surprise announcement last Friday to pull the plug on the
fourth nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislative Yuan party whip Lai Shyh-bao
said Chang is now not welcome or accepted by the New Party, stating
that the premier, "the puppet of President Chen Shui-bian," also does
not need to go to the Legislative Yuan for an interpellation session
by lawmakers Tuesday as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Lai called for Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, a
Kuomintang cadre, not to attend the meeting called by President Chen
for Monday evening that is apparently aimed at seeking a solution to
the political crisis that was heightened by the announcement to scrap
the nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>Lai also noted that the New Party legislative caucus is fully
supportive of a no-confidence vote against Premier Chang or a move to
recall President Chen.</P>
      <P>The New Party will also throw its support behind moves to
introduce other statute amendments, including an amendment to the
National Budget Law, and moves to suspend screening of the general
budget for next fiscal year in an effort to seek justice for the
legislature and the people, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, New Party legislators said they will collaborate with
KMT lawmakers to request a constitutional interpretation by the ROC
Council of Grand Justice of the legal basis for Premier Chang's
announcement of the scrapping of the controversial nuclear power
plant project.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers will request that the grand justices
determine whether the Executive Yuan had the right to unanimously
announce that it will not carry out a budget that had been passed by
the legislature, said New Party Legislator Feng Ting-kuo.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO UNVEIL REVISED MAINLAND INVESTMENT POLICY IN 2 MONTHS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Lin Hsin-yi said Monday
the Ministry of Economic Affairs will unveil a revised package of
regulations governing investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
will also finalize a blueprint before the end of this year
concerning the opening of direct "three links" (trade, mail and
transport) across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan committee
meeting.</P>
      <P>Opposition New Party Legislator Lai Shih-pao said the Cabinet's
abrupt decision to halt construction of the fourth nuclear power
plant has added up to domestic political and economic
uncertainty and triggered a further stock market slump. At
this time of crisis, Lai said the MOEA should immediately
ease restrictions on mainland China-bound investment and announce
a timetable for opening direct "three links" to help restore
local enterprises' confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said, the MOEA has formed a joint task force
with the Mainland Affairs Council, the Ministry of Finance and the
Central Bank of China to review the previous Kuomintang government's
"no haste, be patient" policy on mainland investment.</P>
      <P>"The task force is expected to come up with a revised policy
proposal in two months," Lin said, adding that the new package will
offer local companies greater freedom in deciding whether to invest
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Economics Minister Chen Ruey-long said the
inter-ministerial task force will meet Tuesday to review the "no
haste, be patient" mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOEA basically has completed a policy review. "We
want to listen to the evaluation results concluded by other
ministries at Tuesday's meeting," he noted, adding that the MOEA
will refer to their opinions in deciding which industries will be
allowed to invest on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The government currently still bans companies in some
industries, including upperstream petrochemical industry and
high-tech wafer industry, to invest on the mainland. However, some
companies in those fields have reportedly launched investment
projects on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen said the MOEA is considering allowing some high-tech
companies to invest on the mainland on a case-by-case basis if they
meet some conditions. "For instance, if those companies are
satellite plants of multinational firms, they may be allowed to
invest on the mainland on a case-by-case basis," he explained.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the MOEA is evaluating cross-strait capital
movement resulting from mainland China-bound investments by local
companies publicly listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange and
over-the-counter market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Intel, the world's largest maker of silicon
wafers, entered into a technical cooperation agreement with Taiwan's
Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) Monday to help the local
information industry upgrade its technology.</P>
      <P>The signing marked the first time Intel has signed a technical
cooperation memorandum with a government agency in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>IDB Director Shih Yen-hsiang and Huang Yi-sung, Intel's sales
supervisor for the Asia Pacific region, inked the memorandum,
effective immediately, on behalf of their respective parties.</P>
      <P>Under the memorandum, the IDB will conduct technology exchanges
with Intel to jointly promote integrated development of the
information technology industry and wireless telecommunications
industry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the technical cooperation, the two sides also
agreed to hold an Intel Wireless Client Forum every year, together
with a related exhibition circuit so as to upgrade local industry and
Internet competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Shih said that through technical cooperation pacts with major
world information technology makers and academic institutes, the
production capacity of the local information apparatus (IA) industry
will reach 50 million units by 2005 and be valued at US$6 billion,
representing 30 percent or 40 percent of the global IA market.</P>
      <P>Shih forecast that the IA industry will become a focus industry
in the next century and noted that four local makers entered into an
IA research and development project last year. In addition, more than
200 local makers have formed a Federation of IA, indicating that the
development of IA products will be a mainstream industry for years to
come.</P>
      <P>Shih went on to say that local IA makers produced a total of

    <DATELINE>Matsumoto,   Japan,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui Monday urged the world to use new thinking
and new attitude to cope with new challenges of the new century.</P>
      <P>Lee made the appeal in a 15-minute taped speech broadcast at the
opening of the 12th conference of the Asian Outlook Forum held in
the central Japanese city of Matsumoto.</P>
      <P>Noting that reckless use of force cannot resolve conflicts and
disputes, Lee said war would only bring hatred, regret and incurable
scars.</P>
      <P>"With the 21st century just around the corner, we should learn
lessons from history and use new thinking and new attitude to deal
with challenges the world faces," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although Lee didn't make any direct reference to problems faced
by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, his remarks were widely
believed to be aimed at reminding mainland Chinese leaders of using
new thinking to handle cross-strait disputes or related problems.</P>
      <P>Lee, an outspoken critic of mainland China' diplomatic embargo
against Taiwan and active advocate of Taiwan's distinctive identity,
was forced to give up its plan to attend the current Asian Outlook
Forum meeting in person because Beijing had strongly pressured Japan
to reject Lee's visit.</P>
      <P>The Asian Outlook Forum is a private think tank jointly founded
by Taiwan and Japanese academics and business executives 12 years
ago to promote substantive Taipei-Tokyo relations during Lee's
presidency. As Lee already retired in May this year, the forum has
decided to disband after its current meeting.</P>
      <P>In his taped opening remarks, Lee expressed his gratitude for
all those who have participated in the forum's activities over the
past 12 years. "The forum has contributed much to the improvement of
mutual understanding between our two countries and the expansion of
cultural, economic and academic interchanges," he noted.</P>
      <P>More than 250 delegates from Taiwan and Japan are attending the
two-day seminar. The ROC delegation is headed by Jeffrey Koo,
chairman of the Chinese National Association of Commerce and
Industry, while the Japanese mission is led by Masao Kamei. Several
scholars from the United States, France and Russia have also been
invited to present papers on issues related to Asia-Pacific security
and globalization.</P>
      <P>Masajuro Shiokawa, a member of the lower house of the Japanese
Diet (parliament), said Lee's absence from the meeting reflects the
complexity of international relations. Shiokawa highly praised Lee
for his achievement in promoting Taiwan's democratization and
economic development during his 12-year stint. Shiokawa said he
hopes new ROC President Chen Shui-bian will continue strengthening
ROC-Japanese ties and cooperation and contributing to peace and
stability in Asia. The meeting is scheduled to close Tuesday.</P>

discuss integrating their opposition strength to cope with the
political turmoil caused by the Cabinet's halting of construction of
the island's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Kuomintang Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng and
Spokesman Jason Hu, KMT Chairman Lien Chan called on People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, PFP Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung, PFP Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi and other high
ranking PFP officials.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Hu held a press conference to explain a
three-point consensus reached by the two parties. The points of the
consensus are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Both sides are anxious over the current political situation
and are willing to combine the opposition strength to map concrete
measures to cope with the political turmoil;</P>
      <P>-- Both sides agree to establish communication channels at
chairman, secretary-general and legislative party cadre levels; and</P>
      <P>-- Both sides urge those who love Taiwan to unite and make
vigorous efforts to turn the tide, with the ultimate goal of
preventing anyone from ruining "the Taiwan miracle."</P>
      <P>It was the first time Lien and Soong had met since campaigning
started for the March 18 presidential election. The two political
heavyweights verbally assailed one another during the bitter election
battle.</P>
      <P>Soong, originally a KMT stalwart and former Taiwan provincial
governor, formed the PFP after the election in which he came in a
close second to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to leave Taipei for Chicago Nov. 1 to attend a
meeting of the board of directors of the University of Chicago, visit
overseas Chinese communities in Chicago and New York, and inspect
party affairs of the KMT's overseas offices in the two cities.</P>
      <P>Many KMT legislators have suggested that Lien cancel the visit
and Hu told reporters that Lien was inclined to call off the U.S.
trip, but had not made a final decision.</P>

to our future generations and should instead make the right choice
for them. This is a sacred mission," the president said, adding that
he hopes local people can face the issue calmly and rationally.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with the Republic of China
delegations to the just-concluded Asian mathematics and physics
competitions and the 2000 international natural science and
information technology Olympics contests.</P>
      <P>Chen's call was seen part of his efforts to calm the
outrageous backlash from opposition parties over the Cabinet's
abrupt announcement of its decision to halt construction of
the partially completed fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>While major opposition parties have been discussing joint
strategies to fight against the Chen administration's decision to
scrap the nuclear power plant project, Academia Sinica President Lee
Yuan-tseh threw his support behind the decision to halt
construction of the plant.</P>
      <P>"I think it's a good decision," said Lee, a co-winner of the
1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry.</P>
      <P>The island's foremost scholar further said unless Taiwan has the
capability to treat radioactive waste from nuclear power plants, it
should not continue to build any new nuclear power plants. "Every
time I see the Orchid Island, where radioactive waste from Taiwan's
three nuclear power plants has been stored, I feel sorry," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said many Western countries have endeavored to seek effective
ways to save energy and cut the demand for electricity after the
energy crisis in the 1970s. Regrettably, Lee said, Taiwan didn't do
so.</P>
      <P>As many traditional energy-consuming industries have moved
abroad, Lee said, Taiwan's demand for electricity has declined.
Against this backdrop, he said, it is understandable and reasonable
for the new ROC government to halt construction of an additional
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Frank Hsieh, chairman of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said the party is willing to
modestly accept criticism from opposition parties concerning its
handling of the nuclear power plant issue.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we hope opposition parties will stop their moves
to promote a no-confidence vote against the Cabinet or a recall of
the president to add to domestic political instability," Hsieh
said, adding: "The nuclear power plant controversy is basically a
public policy issue, we have better leave it to be judged by the
general public."</P>

    <HEADLINE>N-POWER PLANT CANCELLATION SAID TO AFFECT U.S. INVESTMENT IN ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. political heavyweight has
said Taiwan's decision to halt construction of its fourth nuclear
power plant will affect U.S. interest in bidding for the island's
infrastructure projects, a visiting ROC lawmaker said here Monday.</P>
      <P>Hung Tu, an opposition Kuomintang legislator, said although the
U.S. government has repeatedly reaffirmed its non-interference
stance on Taiwan's nuclear power plant issue, some U.S. political
observers have expressed concern about the island's recent political
situation.</P>
      <P>Hung had visited Washington, D.C. and New York before arriving
in San Francisco on his way back to Taipei. During his stay in the
two U.S. major cities, Hung had met with Richard Bush, the top U.S.
liaison officer with the Republic of China in the absence of
official ties, and several noted American China hands.</P>
      <P>Hung quoted an unidentified influential American as having said
that Taiwan's decision to scrap the partially completed nuclear power
plant project would reduce its own appeal to attract U.S. businesses
to participate in the island's infrastructure construction projects
in the future.</P>
      <P>Hung said as his talks with the U.S. heavyweight were
confidential, he couldn't divulge the identity of the American
friend.</P>
      <P>Hung instead said he had held talks with researchers with
many noted U.S. think tanks, including the Peace Research
Institute, the Heritage Foundation and the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy, during his visits to Washington and New
York.</P>
      <P>"Many of the U.S. experts in affairs related cross-Taiwan Strait
ties have not hidden their concern and worry about Taiwan's recent
political and economic situation, particularly the Democratic
Progressive Party-led government's handling of the nuclear power
plant issue and its possible impact," Hung added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LEGISLATOR SOLICITS MORE SUPPORT FOR RECALL OF PRESIDENT PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the
opposition Kuomintang said Tuesday that he is continuing to solicit
more support for his proposal to recall President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Ting said at noon that 123 legislators had already signed their
names supporting the move to recall the president, adding that he is
hoping to be able to gather the necessary two thirds of legislators
to have the proposal stand.</P>
      <P>Ting said that the dismissal of a president is a matter that
requires extreme prudence and that he will take public opinion and
other measures proposed by the opposition parties into consideration
before submitting the proposal.</P>
      <P>The recall proposal will stand if it is co-signed by one fourth
of the legislators (55 seats) and agreed upon by two thirds of the
legislators (147 seats), meaning that if all the legislators of the
three major opposition parties, the KMT, PFP, and NP, support the
motion, they will still have to solicit the support of six or seven
more legislators to make the proposal stand.</P>
      <P>In the 220-seat Legislative Yuan, the opposition Kuomintang
dominates with 115 seats, compared with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's 67 seats. The opposition People First Party has
17 seats, the New Party nine seats, the National Non-Party League
seven seats, and independents five seats.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to try to preempt the possible recall proposal,
legislators of the ruling DPP called for unity within the party.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tain-tsair, DPP party whip, said that there is still some
time before the opposition parties possibly submit recall proposals
and that "the situation is still developing."</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the opposition parties to "think twice" before making
such a move, stressing that the party will do everything to meet its
top priority of maintaining "political stability."</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Chou Po-lun said that the fourth nuclear power
plant is no longer the focus and that the urgent task now is to form
a task force to deal with the crisis and to solicit the support of
"anti-power forces" in the opposition camp.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that while the opposition parties are in a state of
euphoria over their unprecedented unity, the DPP will now unite
behind the "ultimate goal" of political stability.</P>
      <P>The latest political storm was unleashed when the Cabinet
abruptly announced the halting of construction on the fourth nuclear
power plant last Friday shortly after a meeting between President
Chen Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien during which the president
promised to give more thought to the project.</P>

      <P>Anti-nuclear activists and the Green Party
announced Tuesday that they will take the initiative in moving to

possibility of recalling Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>In the latest twist to the controversy that began last Friday

their actions and rescind their proposal to recall the president.</P>

legislators for being "bent on having their own way" without regard
for public opinion.</P>
      <P>Residents of Kungliao Township in Taipei County, where the
nuclear plant stands 33 percent completed, said at the conference
that they are "saddened" by the legislators who are clinging
willfully to their course when the residents had finally received

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's majority
opposition party on Tuesday brushed aside a patch-up gesture by
Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian over a nuclear power plant
controversy.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said, "There is no need for
Chen to send a representative to see me or to visit in person to give
his regards."</P>
      <P>Leading a delegation to pay tribute to the resting place of late
President Chiang Kai-shek on the 114th anniversary of Chiang's birth,
Lien urged Chen not to "revolve around formalities."</P>
      <P>Lien added that he would not be upset by Chen's gesture, whether
it was an "arrangement with intentionally or unintentionally
humiliating overtones," because he is only concerned about what the
government is doing to ensure national stability and development.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to criticize the government by saying that many
people "screwed on new heads" after taking up new positions of power
and now refuse to even admit that they are both Taiwanese and Chinese
-- an apparent reference to Chen of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lien also pointed to Economics Minister Lin
Hsin-yi, a former KMT member who was expelled from the party for
embracing the administration's anti-nuclear stance, as another
example of the kind of people he said he scorns. He criticized Lin
for appearing in a anti-nuclear television commercial while claiming
to be a member of the KMT, which is traditionally pro-nuclear.</P>
      <P>Opposition parties have been locked in battle with the ruling DPP
government -- even going as far as rallying to recall the president
-- since the Cabinet sprung a surprise on the nation last Friday by
announcing that it was pulling the plug on the controversial fourth
nuclear power plant project.</P>
      <P>The announcement came hot on the heels of what was supposed to be
a fence-mending meeting between Chen and Lien in which Chen had just
promised to give careful thought to the nuclear plant issue.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Premier Chang Chun-hsiung explained at the
Legislative Yuan that the Cabinet had "absolutely no intention" of
being disrespectful to Lien and that if it came across that way, then
he was willing to say sorry.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary General Lin Feng-cheng also accused the government
of merely "putting on a show" when Presidential Secretary General Yu
Shyi-kun earlier in the day proposed visiting Lin in order to convey
the president's message and to work out the details for Chen to visit
Lien in person.</P>
      <P>KMT Spokesman Jason Hu also urged the president to keep his mind
on policy-making instead of on showmanship.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in order to keep up on events at this critical
juncture following the controversy kindled by last week's Cabinet
announcement, Lien has decided not to attend a meeting of the
University of Chicago board of trustees, of which he is the only
member without U.S. citizenship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA YOUTH CORPS CHANGES OFFICIAL DESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-government, non-profit China Youth
Corps (CYC) changed its Mandarin name Tuesday and dropped the words
"anti-communism" from its official designation as a result of a
change in world trends, according to CYC sources.</P>
      <P>The CYC's goals of endeavors, however, remain unchanged, said
President Jeanne Tchong-koei Li.</P>
      <P>The name-change coincided with the organization's 48th founding
anniversary. It was founded in 1952 by the late President Chiang
Ching-kuo when Chiang was a young official in charge of youth affairs
in the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the anniversary, Li said people had
begun to question the appropriateness of CYC's "anti-communism"
designation as early as 1987 when then-President Chiang allowed
Taiwan residents to visit relatives in mainland China for the first
time.</P>
      <P>However, the issue was not addressed until early this year, when
ex-CYC Vice President Hsieh You-hua motioned for the words
"anti-communism" to be scrapped once and for all as cross-strait
relations and the world situation had drastically changed, Li noted.</P>
      <P>Li said that it took 334 rounds of meetings for CYC management to
decide to formally change the official designation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, parts of CYC's anthem were also changed for some less
ideological lyrics, with terms such as "anti-aggression and
anti-ferocity" changed to "having ideals and goals," and "obeying the
leadership of the president" changed to "devoting our best," Li
added.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's ceremony, 4,133 CYC volunteers from all over the
world were cited for their unselfish devotion to voluntary work. A
total of 86 representatives attended in person to receive the
citations.</P>
      <P>Aimed at guiding youth in their growth and development through
various activities, CYC holds lectures and seminars to educate youth,
in addition to providing a counseling hotline. Its most popular
activities are outdoor recreational programs during summer and winter
vacations, designed for teenagers and young adults.</P>
      <P>The organization also sponsors youth goodwill missions to various
destinations around the world, seeking to broaden young people's
horizons. Since 1992, the CYC has organized youth cultural and
educational exchanges with mainland China. Between 1998 and 1999, 615
ROC youths traveled to the mainland in 20 CYC groups, and 507 young
mainlanders came to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Young Chinese who were born overseas and foreign youths are not
excluded from CYC programs. During summer vacations, youths of
Chinese descent can come to Taiwan to learn the Chinese language,
culture, and customs. In addition, groups of young foreigners are
invited to Taiwan each year for cultural and academic exchanges with
their Taiwan counterparts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP, NEW PARTY MEETING REACHES 3-POINT CONSENSUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leaders of two of Taiwan's opposition
parties reached a three-point consensus Tuesday on promoting
inter-party cooperation to help maintain domestic political
stability.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong and Hao Lung-pin,
convener of the New Party's National Campaign and Development
Committee issued a joint statement on their consensus after a
40-minute closed-door meeting.</P>
      <P>The statement said the two parties agree to establish a dialogue
mechanism for the country's opposition parties to reflect mainstream
public opinion.</P>
      <P>The tiny New Party will organize a roundtable meeting of the
leaders of the three opposition parties -- the New Party, the PFP and
the Kuomintang -- next week to discuss strategies to cope with the
domestic political situation in the wake of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP)-led government's decision to halt
construction of the partially completed fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The statement further said the New Party and the PFP agree to
forsake partisan biases and give top priority to national interests
and stability. "And we'll use this principle as a basis to establish
various levels of inter-party communication channels," the statement
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two parties agreed to cooperate closely with the
main opposition KMT, which ruled Taiwan for 55 years until May 20 and
still controls a majority in the Legislative Yuan or parliament.</P>
      <P>Hao said the three parties will promote the passage of bills
helpful to domestic political, economic and judicial reforms and
fulfill their duty of providing a system of checks and balances
against the ruling DPP.</P>
      <P>The Soong-Hao consensus on opposition party cooperation was
expected to receive KMT support, as KMT Chairman Lien Chan made
similar appeals during separate meetings with Soong and Hau a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The unprecedented reconciliation among the three opposition
parties was prompted by their wrath at the DPP government's abrupt
announcement of its decision to halt construction of the island's
fourth nuclear power plant last Friday. The plant, launched during
KMT rule, is about one-third complete.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the three opposition parties have joined forces to
push for the dismissal of President Chen Shui-bian over the scrapping
of the controversial project. Chen beat Soong and Lien in the March
18 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The dismissal motion may stand a chance of passing the
legislative floor, as the three opposition parties jointly control
141 seats in the 220-member legislature. The ruling DPP holds only 67
seats in the parliament.</P>
